00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.760
Just before I came into the studio, I heard some very good news for the people in the Tennessee

00:10.760 --> 00:14.560
Valley area, and I want to tell you about it now.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.840
The good news is that the Senate Public Works Committee has finally reported out a self-financing

00:19.840 --> 00:23.480
bill for the Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:23.480 --> 00:28.520
We all know that it's necessary for the TVA to build more steam plants and hydroelectric

00:28.520 --> 00:34.800
facilities to be able to furnish the increasing demand for power for electricity and the Tennessee

00:34.800 --> 00:35.800
Valley.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.760
While we haven't been able to get any appropriations for it for a long time, so this

00:39.760 --> 00:46.680
bill is to enable the TVA to issue a revenue bond with the users of power to pay back through

00:46.680 --> 00:49.880
the TVA over a course of years.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.600
The bill has been tied up for some time, but it's been finally reported.

00:54.160 --> 00:59.840
Of course, some compromises had to be made, and there was a giving and taking on both sides,

00:59.840 --> 01:04.200
but I think the bill that has finally been brought out is a good compromise.

01:04.200 --> 01:10.600
It's one that the TVA can live with, and I get along under, and I think it's about the

01:10.600 --> 01:12.520
best it could be done.

01:12.520 --> 01:19.240
The compromise is that the bill is for a five-year period, enabling the TVA to issue $750

01:19.240 --> 01:22.360
million worth of bonds over a period of five years.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.720
After that, we review the program and then see what needs to be done.

01:27.720 --> 01:34.960
Another compromise is that the 40-year amortization program whereby the TVA has to repay back its

01:34.960 --> 01:40.200
original investment within 40 years has been taken out of the bill, and in lieu of that,

01:40.200 --> 01:45.920
the TVA will pay interest at the average rate which the government pays on the amount

01:45.920 --> 01:48.960
that has been appropriated to it.

01:48.960 --> 01:55.360
The committee got into a great deal of difficulty over the so-called limit on the area to be served

01:55.360 --> 01:56.360
at the TVA.

01:56.360 --> 02:02.360
And the compromise is that if the TVA area is extended in any substantial way, it can

02:02.360 --> 02:05.000
only be done by an act of funds.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.200
But if it's a small, minute extension to serve some REA-electrical office adjacent to

02:11.200 --> 02:17.680
the TVA area, that may be done provided the TVA notifies the Congress in which 60 days

02:17.680 --> 02:20.320
to be served whether there's any objection.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.160
Under the compromise bill, the Secretary of the Treasury can delay the issuance of bonds

02:25.160 --> 02:31.360
for 45 days in order to fit in with the government's overall fiscal focus.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.680
I want to congratulate Senator Robert Kerr of Oklahoma, the chief sponsor of this bill and

02:35.680 --> 02:41.680
the chairman of the Subcommittee, Alan Colleg, Senator Gore, who is a member of the committee

02:41.680 --> 02:47.360
of Senator Hill of Alabama, Senator Cooper of Kentucky, and many others who have worked

02:47.360 --> 02:50.280
on the bill very, very hard.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.080
The bill came out with two Republican votes.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.880
Let's show the sure that it wouldn't be classified as a partisan matter when it reaches the

02:57.880 --> 03:04.880
floor so that I hope that we can pass the bill with a big majority that will also give

03:04.880 --> 03:08.800
it some impetus to get through the House of Representatives.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.240
We're working on a deadline in connection with this bill.

03:12.240 --> 03:17.760
We cannot be considered this week under the rules of the Senate, and we are going to

03:17.760 --> 03:24.520
try very hard to get it up early next week before July 8th, the date on which the so-called

03:24.520 --> 03:29.000
civil rights long debate of Philobuster will take place.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.960
We have spoken to the majority leader and to others in this effort, and I am very, very

03:35.960 --> 03:38.640
hopeful that this can be done.

03:38.640 --> 03:44.440
Well, that's the first bit of good news we've had insofar as TVA legislation for some time

03:44.440 --> 03:45.440
to be concerned.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.640
I didn't want to talk with you today about another important matter that happened in the

03:49.640 --> 03:51.760
Senate this week.

03:51.760 --> 04:00.280
We all remember the Hungarian revolt last fall, how the people rose up against the communist

04:00.280 --> 04:01.280
mess.

04:01.280 --> 04:05.360
We all wanted to do something about it that didn't know what to do.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.500
The United Nations had a committee that composed the five members of five nations which

04:09.500 --> 04:12.960
has randomly condemned what the communist did.

04:12.960 --> 04:18.380
And the United States Senate passed a resolution unanimously asking our delegate in the UN

04:18.380 --> 04:24.640
to urge the General Assembly to be called in order to take this matter up again.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.640
I hope that's going to be done.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.640
That's an idea.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.640
What's going on?

04:28.640 --> 04:34.840
Well, Dick Wallace, my administrative assistant, his head is the Keptish Derby, which is being

04:34.840 --> 04:37.160
held at Savannah Tennessee.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.920
This month I'm going down Saturday to be there at Derby.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.360
And I know I'm going to have a good time.

04:42.360 --> 04:47.680
We are mighty proud of our Tennessee blue cats, no fish are better.

04:47.680 --> 04:53.040
We are challenging Colorado deferring to shop to the senators and let them determine which

04:53.040 --> 04:54.040
will, which tastes better.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.040
And we know that Tennessee cats will win out.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
That's all for now.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.040
Thank you very much.

05:05.840 --> 05:13.760
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, as you know the anti-trust and monopoly subcommittee

05:13.760 --> 05:20.840
of which I am chairman has been conducting hearings and so-called administered prices,

05:20.840 --> 05:25.040
administered prices or those which do not react to what we ordinarily consider to be the

05:25.040 --> 05:28.400
competitive forces in our economy.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.200
Their prices set by decision of management.

05:31.200 --> 05:36.160
They may be raised when demand is falling, contrair to the ordinary views of inflation.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.600
Well, we've had a number of distinguished economists who have discussed this problem

05:40.600 --> 05:42.680
before our subcommittee.

05:42.680 --> 05:48.960
And right now we have Mr. Roger Blow, chairman of the board of the United States Steel Corporation,

05:48.960 --> 05:52.040
and a number of his fellow officers before it.

05:52.040 --> 05:56.720
Now all of these distinguished gentlemen have discussed in learned terms such things as

05:56.720 --> 06:00.280
administered prices as opposed to the free market.

06:00.280 --> 06:05.520
But sometimes you get the clearest explanation, the finest understanding of the differences

06:05.520 --> 06:09.560
between the two from unexpected sources.

06:09.560 --> 06:14.800
Ours came from a letter to the editor, but appeared in a little weekly paper down in

06:14.800 --> 06:17.680
weekly county at Dresden, Tennessee.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.960
It is signed simply J.A.

06:19.960 --> 06:24.320
I have no idea who J.A. is, although I'm curious.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.080
I read this letter across the committee table to Mr. Blow this week, and I'd like to read

06:29.080 --> 06:35.240
it to you because I think that in very simple and humorous terms, it explains the fight

06:35.240 --> 06:36.720
of our economy.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.720
This is the letter.

06:38.720 --> 06:43.920
Dear editor, the trouble with inflation is that not enough people understand its calling.

06:43.920 --> 06:50.080
Right at this point Mr. Blow interrupted and said, I agree with that 100% to 100%.

06:50.080 --> 06:54.840
But continuing the letter, I had noticed in a copy of a newspaper which a neighbor of

06:54.840 --> 07:01.560
mine brought a mere mess of fish in, or your information it wasn't a copy of your paper

07:01.560 --> 07:04.000
as this one had a fishy smell.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.720
That the price of steel had recently gone up $6 a ton, which clearly indicated that the

07:09.720 --> 07:13.920
steel industry has let its newspaper subscription expire.

07:13.920 --> 07:19.720
As President Eisenhower only the day before had asked business to hold prices down voluntarily.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.960
And as a result, a lot of other things were automatically going up.

07:23.960 --> 07:29.160
For example, naturally the watch manufacturers on hearing the price of steel had gone up

07:29.160 --> 07:32.680
will figure that they ought to go up on the price of their watches.

07:32.680 --> 07:37.360
As everybody knows the steel spring on the watches made of steel, even if it doesn't weigh

07:37.360 --> 07:39.200
over and out.

07:39.200 --> 07:45.440
Power points, tractors, cars, pickups, naturally will require an increase in prices to offset

07:45.440 --> 07:48.440
the rise in the price of steel.

07:48.440 --> 07:52.840
And so I decided that what was good for industry was good for me.

07:52.840 --> 07:58.960
Consequently, when I took a dozen eggs in the town yesterday to sell, I told the store

07:58.960 --> 08:02.280
I'd have to have five cents more for my eggs.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.000
How come the store owner asks?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.400
Don't you read your newspaper?

08:06.400 --> 08:10.280
It's on account of the increase in the price of steel, I explain.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.720
Now here's the rub.

08:12.720 --> 08:17.440
Instead of nodding his head in agreement and saying there didn't seem to be any way around

08:17.440 --> 08:19.440
if he does laugh.

08:19.440 --> 08:24.720
You could see he didn't have any full understanding of inflation and the upward price spiral.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.200
Don't believe I'd be interested, he said.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.560
But my cost are going up and I've got to have more money for these eggs.

08:31.560 --> 08:36.920
Don't believe I'd be interested, he said, and turned around and waited on another customer.

08:36.920 --> 08:42.000
Now I could have waited him out, but from long experience I knew the eggs couldn't.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.440
So I sold the eggs, sold the eggs at his price and came on home.

08:47.240 --> 08:52.040
It's the people who don't understand inflation that's causing this country so much trouble.

08:52.040 --> 08:55.760
I don't mind paying six dollars a ton more for steel.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.800
If somebody will recognize that I ought to get more from my eggs.

08:59.800 --> 09:04.800
There are more people than you realize who are out of tune with me and with my hymn.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.520
You're a spacefully J.A.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.920
And there you have it, my friends.

09:08.920 --> 09:15.040
A clear distinction between free and competitive market and the administered price market.

09:15.040 --> 09:19.560
And an explanation of why this inflation, which is our number one problem,

09:19.560 --> 09:25.960
is not a simple traditional kind that can easily be cured by any simple traditional remedy,

09:25.960 --> 09:28.160
such as the tight money policy.

09:28.160 --> 09:32.000
As a matter of fact, that policy doesn't do a thing to US steel,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.280
but it makes the egg business a whole lot rougher.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.040
But we'll have more to tell you about our fight against inflation

09:39.040 --> 09:43.480
for the judiciary subcommittee from time to time.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.120
In any event, we've got to do something about it.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.720
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.560
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.040
First on this program today, I would like to bring you up today as to the progress

10:07.040 --> 10:12.560
of being made in connection with the TBA self-financing bill, which is now pending in

10:12.560 --> 10:13.560
Congress.

10:13.560 --> 10:18.840
We will all recall that it's been almost five years since the TBA has had any appropriations

10:18.840 --> 10:23.960
for the building of a steam plant or for a hydroelectric facility.

10:23.960 --> 10:28.920
And that being denied appropriations is necessary for us to have a self-financing bill so that

10:28.920 --> 10:35.920
the TBA can issue its own bond, which it will repay from its own revenue, and which will

10:35.920 --> 10:40.720
only be revenue in that general government obligation bond.

10:40.720 --> 10:45.960
Along with Senator Gore and the Senators from the Tennessee Valley area, I'm a co-sponsored

10:45.960 --> 10:52.040
the so-called Kerr Bill, which would allow the Board of Directors and TBA to issue bonds

10:52.040 --> 10:59.200
and to be a responsible group and agency in connection with them and their repayment.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.720
Five bills are pending before the public works committee.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.840
We've been having quite a number of discussions about the matter.

11:04.840 --> 11:11.440
There's some parity that we got some bill out this year because it takes years to build

11:11.440 --> 11:17.240
steam plants, and we're not going to have power enough by the winter of 1959 unless we

11:17.240 --> 11:20.240
build some more.

11:20.240 --> 11:27.440
These conferences seem to be pulled out some hope that we can get a bill passed in the Senate

11:27.440 --> 11:32.880
and perhaps in the House and one that the President will not veto that the TBA can live

11:32.880 --> 11:33.880
by.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.560
But I think it's going to be necessary, and I personally believe that in order to get

11:37.560 --> 11:40.160
a bill passed, we'll have to make some concessions.

11:40.160 --> 11:47.320
The two concessions most frequently spoken of are to put a $750 million limit on the

11:47.320 --> 11:50.320
amount of bonds for a period of five years.

11:51.040 --> 12:01.560
And also to provide that the TBA might make a manner extension of its service to some

12:01.560 --> 12:02.720
close by REA.

12:02.720 --> 12:08.080
It never has made any more than a manner extension of its service anywhere.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.920
But in order to make a major one that it would have to secure a congressional approval.

12:11.920 --> 12:18.160
But I personally would rather these limitations and other limitations it might come up not

12:18.160 --> 12:24.240
be placed on this self-financing bill.

12:24.240 --> 12:29.240
We will have to have some amendments of this kind in order to get it passed.

12:29.240 --> 12:35.480
I think during the five years the TBA can prove itself and go on as a great agency that it

12:35.480 --> 12:38.480
is and live with these amendments.

12:38.480 --> 12:42.080
Anyway, we're doing everything possible to get the bill passed.

12:42.080 --> 12:47.720
I've been receiving a great deal of correspondence from people in Tennessee and there's tremendous

12:47.720 --> 12:49.960
national interest.

12:49.960 --> 12:57.720
In connection with the American soldier William S. Gerard who is charged with a killing

12:57.720 --> 13:03.720
of a Japanese woman, whether he should be fired by American court martial law in the

13:03.720 --> 13:04.720
Japanese court.

13:04.720 --> 13:11.160
And you know what's the strange thing that this goes to show that how individual actions

13:11.160 --> 13:16.800
and issues of this kind determine the attitude and the relationship between nations as much

13:16.800 --> 13:24.040
as the tremendous amount of money that we have spent since the war of visions and visions

13:24.040 --> 13:29.960
of dollars to how to help to 10 and not spend the nation get on her feet.

13:29.960 --> 13:36.440
But some incident like this and it happened very impeccably because our soldiers are well

13:36.440 --> 13:40.320
behaved generally and things like this do not occur.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.560
And this roughed the relationship between nations.

13:44.200 --> 13:51.560
Well Gerard it will be remembered that was accused of killing a Japanese woman and I do

13:51.560 --> 13:57.800
not want to minimize the extent of the seriousness of what he's been charged with and in the extent

13:57.800 --> 13:58.800
whatsoever.

13:58.800 --> 14:06.080
But we have a treaty with Japan whereas when our soldiers are committed to a sense

14:06.080 --> 14:10.720
while on duty and on the reservation there to be fired by court martial.

14:10.720 --> 14:14.400
And they're out on their own and off duty while they'd be fired by the civilian courts

14:14.400 --> 14:17.240
of the country in which they are located.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.600
And that applies reciprocally when some of their soldiers are over here.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.240
The big mistake that's been made is that we have vacillated in the matter.

14:25.240 --> 14:30.000
I personally have information I have he was on duty and on the reservation and he should

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
have been fired on court martial.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.800
And now a court has come into the case and we all have to wait I think until the Supreme

14:36.800 --> 14:37.800
Court acts.

14:38.440 --> 14:43.480
In any event I hope that by diplomacy the rights of this young man can be preserved.

14:43.480 --> 14:47.960
He's entitled to be fired by court martial and that our relationships will not be

14:47.960 --> 14:50.960
a rapidly damaged between Japan and our country.

14:50.960 --> 14:51.960
That's all for now.

14:51.960 --> 14:52.960
Thank you very much.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.560
Ladies and gentlemen friends with Tennessee.

15:03.560 --> 15:08.240
One of the most important discussions taking place in Washington these days is the matter

15:08.240 --> 15:12.720
that has not come to the floor of the Senate and the former than its village yet.

15:12.720 --> 15:16.760
This discussion that I have in mind is taking place largely before the Senate's finance

15:16.760 --> 15:20.800
committee and it involves the tight money policy.

15:20.800 --> 15:25.800
This policy is being descended by the second care of the Treasury, Comfort, who is widely

15:25.800 --> 15:29.760
recognized as a man who knows money and money policies.

15:29.760 --> 15:34.640
It is being attacked by Senator Bob Kerr of Oklahoma and others who are just as well recognized

15:34.640 --> 15:36.880
for the same quality.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.920
You have all heard of the laws that fly in demand.

15:39.920 --> 15:45.420
The tight money policy is a device employed by the administration which is designed to

15:45.420 --> 15:51.000
bring down the man down to the level of the class by restricting the ability of business

15:51.000 --> 15:54.800
and individuals to borrow money or to obtain credit.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.800
It is opposed to eliminate inflation.

15:57.440 --> 16:02.080
Well I'm no financial expert but my mother used to tell me that the proof of the pudding

16:02.080 --> 16:03.080
is in the eating.

16:03.080 --> 16:09.000
It seems to me that the proof of the failure of the tight money policy to control inflation

16:09.000 --> 16:13.120
is in the inflation that we are experiencing at the present time.

16:13.120 --> 16:18.400
Since this new policy was adopted over a year and a half ago, living costs have continued

16:18.400 --> 16:23.800
to hit new highs each month or 14 months out of the last 15.

16:23.800 --> 16:28.360
We don't have to look at fancy charts to note that we are having inflation.

16:28.360 --> 16:34.160
Most of us can simply tell by looking into our wallet and into our firsts.

16:34.160 --> 16:38.680
I have my wallet here and I know that I can tell that we are having inflation every

16:38.680 --> 16:43.400
time Nancy returns from a trip to the grocery store.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.800
Why has this policy failed to check inflation?

16:46.800 --> 16:50.920
Very simply because I think we are having a different kind of inflation.

16:50.920 --> 16:56.680
The kind of inflation that tight money policy might cure would be the kind we had during

16:56.680 --> 17:02.000
the war when we had the limited things that people could buy and we had the OTA and the OCS

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
for that purpose.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.200
And it is the wrong remedy for the other kind of inflation.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.080
You don't have to be an expert to know that something is wrong and prices continue to

17:11.080 --> 17:17.720
go up in industries where production is falling and where goods are and over supply.

17:17.720 --> 17:22.320
As an example, the steel industry last week announced that it was raising the price of

17:22.320 --> 17:28.600
steel $6 a ton and yet we know the figures released by the industry itself that it is

17:28.600 --> 17:32.480
operating nearly 20% below its full capacity.

17:32.480 --> 17:36.920
So we can see that it isn't the law to plan the man that is responsible for increasing

17:36.920 --> 17:39.000
prices of steel.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.880
But what is happening is just the opposite of what you would expect.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.680
What then is responsible?

17:44.680 --> 17:49.480
I think that the answer is simply that some concentrated industries have the power to

17:49.480 --> 17:55.840
raise prices even when demand is falling and do not hesitate to exercise that power.

17:55.840 --> 17:59.480
Steel is just one such concentrated industry.

17:59.480 --> 18:05.000
The overall effectiveness phenomena is an increasing in the cost of living in the face of a falling

18:05.000 --> 18:07.440
demand for their products.

18:07.440 --> 18:13.200
This is a type of inflation which can be only minutely affected by a tight money policy.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.280
It is somewhat like taking an aspirin to cure a penicillin.

18:17.280 --> 18:22.000
If the tight money policy was of any substantial benefit in holding the type of inflation we

18:22.000 --> 18:26.240
have today, you can be sure that I would be all-farring.

18:26.240 --> 18:32.000
But not only is it the wrong remedy, it also has many and jury side effects of its own.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
It hurts small business badly, but they are the first to be cut off from the supply of

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
credit.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.880
Even if they can obtain enough credit, the interest rates will take so high that the cost of loans

18:42.880 --> 18:45.600
become an unbearable burden.

18:45.600 --> 18:51.600
In addition, a tight money prevents much needed construction such as homes, highways, schools

18:51.600 --> 18:53.520
and things of that sort.

18:53.520 --> 18:57.800
It creates high interest rates that are often passed on to the consumers.

18:57.800 --> 19:02.480
It even forces the government to pay much higher rates for the money it times necessary

19:02.480 --> 19:05.640
as a bar and thus increases tax.

19:05.640 --> 19:09.480
So the poor consumer gets stuck with the bill no matter which way he turns.

19:09.480 --> 19:13.800
The Senate Finance Committee and its present hearings is trying to come up with a new

19:13.800 --> 19:14.800
description.

19:14.800 --> 19:19.800
And this week the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly in which I am chairman is going

19:19.800 --> 19:25.640
to begin a separate inquiry into those industries which maintain administered prices, posted

19:25.640 --> 19:30.320
prices at which they will sell regardless of the fluctuation of the man.

19:30.320 --> 19:34.680
We must know more about the effects of such industries before we can describe the remedy.

19:34.680 --> 19:39.640
There is no doubt that the patient shows signs of illness, the tight money policy described

19:39.640 --> 19:43.000
as sedative, which has yet to prove its value.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.920
But we need is complete and thorough diagnosis to determine the cause of the disease.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.080
Then we will be able to keep the patient recording.

19:50.080 --> 20:03.400
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.720
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, it is a great pleasure to be back again with

20:07.720 --> 20:10.880
you at this opening of a new session of Congress.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.960
And this promises to be a very interesting session.

20:13.960 --> 20:18.680
It is particularly a time when we Democrats in Congress have a big responsibility, the

20:18.680 --> 20:23.200
cost of the very large majority which we have in both the Senate and the House as a

20:23.200 --> 20:25.920
result of last November's elections.

20:25.920 --> 20:30.800
I pray and hope that as a result of our actions we will succeed in bettering the lot of the

20:30.800 --> 20:36.800
American people while strengthening our nation and the free world against communist aggression.

20:36.800 --> 20:42.100
It is already a historic Congress because it is the first one in which 49 states are

20:42.100 --> 20:43.100
represented.

20:43.100 --> 20:48.040
Alaska, as you know, was granted statehood as a result of action in the last session of

20:48.040 --> 20:49.360
Congress.

20:49.360 --> 20:54.080
And it has elected its two senators and its member of the House and they were sworn in

20:54.080 --> 20:55.080
last Wednesday.

20:55.080 --> 21:00.760
There are a lot of jokes going around Washington because Alaska has succeeded Texas as the

21:00.760 --> 21:05.040
biggest state from the standpoint of territory in the Union.

21:05.040 --> 21:10.000
One of the latest that I heard is that the way to feel him then is far in the last to move

21:10.000 --> 21:11.920
to the state of Texas.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.680
I know that you are interested in some of the things which I believe a new Congress may

21:15.680 --> 21:17.880
or may not do.

21:17.880 --> 21:22.360
First of all, I think that the TVA's self-financing bill, and I have talked with my colleague Senator

21:22.360 --> 21:28.640
Gore about this and he agrees, will have a much better chance of passage in this Congress.

21:28.640 --> 21:32.080
The goodness knows we need it badly and we need it now.

21:32.080 --> 21:37.320
An analysis of the senators and House members who were defeated in November or who retired

21:37.320 --> 21:43.120
shows that by and large a good-sized majority of them were critics of the TVA and the rural

21:43.120 --> 21:45.760
electrification administration.

21:45.760 --> 21:50.080
On the other hand, the new faces among both the House and the Senate members include

21:50.080 --> 21:54.000
many outspoken champions of public power and of TVA.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.800
Therefore, I believe that this year we will have the majorities we need to give the TVA

21:58.800 --> 22:04.120
the self-financing authority it needs and let it plan and let it make its plans and run

22:04.120 --> 22:07.280
its business on a business like basis.

22:07.280 --> 22:12.760
Personally, I shall work for this TVA legislation and for the new dams and installations on the

22:12.760 --> 22:17.360
Cumberland River as well as for West Tennessee flood control.

22:17.360 --> 22:22.520
I shall work again as a heaven to pass on legislation which I think will improve the juvenile

22:22.520 --> 22:24.520
delinquency situation.

22:24.520 --> 22:30.520
Specifically, I shall have a new bill on forestry camps and I hope that this year it will

22:30.520 --> 22:31.520
be adopted.

22:31.520 --> 22:36.760
My idea on this is to use land or military installations which have been abandoned,

22:36.760 --> 22:42.160
my property which the government already owns but which is surplus to establish camps

22:42.160 --> 22:46.560
for the rehabilitation of boys who have become juvenile delinquents.

22:46.560 --> 22:52.040
It will serve a double purpose, aiding conservation of lands and forests as well as conserving

22:52.040 --> 22:54.640
our greatest resource, our children.

22:54.640 --> 22:59.600
I hope that an aid program will be established to help the states in their training of personnel

22:59.600 --> 23:05.160
to serve in the juvenile institutions and in probationary positions.

23:05.160 --> 23:09.960
And we all know that high prices and inflation continue to be our major headache.

23:09.960 --> 23:15.960
As chairman of the Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee, we will continue to work on this problem.

23:15.960 --> 23:19.560
The staff during this recess has been making various inquiries.

23:20.080 --> 23:24.760
I intend now to get the committee together to hear the results of their work and to

23:24.760 --> 23:27.880
decide what we shall pursue in the future.

23:27.880 --> 23:31.240
As for taxes, I hope that we won't have any new ones.

23:31.240 --> 23:35.760
There are many inequities in the nation's present tax laws and I think some of you should

23:35.760 --> 23:39.040
be eliminated before we have new taxes.

23:39.040 --> 23:43.840
And certainly the farmers must have a better deal as a result of this session and I believe

23:43.840 --> 23:45.640
that they will get it.

23:45.640 --> 23:50.120
The closing, let me say, that during this recess I have had an opportunity to visit with

23:50.120 --> 23:52.120
many of you personally.

23:52.120 --> 23:57.360
I have enjoyed this very much and have found it very helpful to exchange views and opinions

23:57.360 --> 23:58.680
with you.

23:58.680 --> 24:03.760
I have visited all parts of the state and again I was impressed with the greatest potential

24:03.760 --> 24:07.200
for growth and development at his Tennessee age.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.960
If we will all work together, there is no limit on our future.

24:10.960 --> 24:16.600
As your senator, I certainly try to do my part during this new session of Congress.

24:16.600 --> 24:21.200
And I want to thank this station for carrying this program as a public service, a service.

24:21.200 --> 24:27.080
I hope that those of you who see and hear these programs will write me your suggestions

24:27.080 --> 24:28.080
from time to time.

24:28.080 --> 24:35.040
I will be very glad indeed to have your criticisms, your thoughts and your ideas about legislation

24:35.040 --> 24:37.480
and what I can do in Washington to help.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.120
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

24:40.960 --> 24:56.280
The people of Tennessee may well be proud of the victory they have helped win over

24:56.280 --> 24:58.280
infantile paralysis.

24:58.280 --> 25:02.400
Thanks to your contributions, the Salk vaccine was developed.

25:02.400 --> 25:10.800
Your contributions also gave a help to 350,000 polio victims to improve treatment and rehabilitation.

25:10.800 --> 25:16.000
Your National Foundation, formerly known as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis,

25:16.000 --> 25:20.560
will definitely continue its important work in the polio field.

25:20.560 --> 25:25.440
At the same time, the National Foundation is undertaking a vast new program to fight

25:25.440 --> 25:29.040
arthritis, birth defects and virus diseases.

25:29.040 --> 25:34.760
Through a greatly expanded research program, the National Foundation will seek to cause

25:34.760 --> 25:40.200
and prevention of these major health problems, which affect millions and millions of children

25:40.200 --> 25:42.200
and adults each year.

25:42.200 --> 25:46.800
It will help launch this new program by supporting the March of Dimes this month.

25:46.800 --> 25:51.600
Join with the National Foundation in helping millions of our disabled fellow citizens have

25:51.600 --> 26:02.400
a better life.

26:02.400 --> 26:07.040
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the past week in Congress has been a very busy

26:07.040 --> 26:11.040
one, with many matters of importance under consideration.

26:11.040 --> 26:15.880
First, I'd like to tell you about a new committee assignment, which I consider of great importance

26:15.880 --> 26:18.600
to me and to our state of Tennessee.

26:18.600 --> 26:23.880
I have an assigned to be a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and I have requested

26:23.880 --> 26:29.760
its chairman, Senator Hayden of Arizona, to give me a place on the subcommittee on interior

26:29.760 --> 26:30.760
and public works.

26:30.760 --> 26:36.080
Now, we will ask for no special favors in these subcommittees, but I intend to try to

26:36.080 --> 26:41.600
see to it that matters of vital importance to Tennessee, receive thorough attention,

26:41.600 --> 26:44.760
and that we get our fair share of money.

26:44.760 --> 26:48.760
Such matters as the Smoky Mountain National Park and the Forest Service fall within the

26:48.760 --> 26:52.160
school for the subcommittee on the interior.

26:52.160 --> 26:57.960
Under this subcommittee on public works will come a wide variety of important projects,

26:57.960 --> 27:03.200
necessary to the continued and future development of all parts of our state.

27:03.200 --> 27:08.720
Tennessee Valley Authority, the Cumberland River Damns, and flood control in West Tennessee

27:08.720 --> 27:12.360
and drainage projects to mention just a few.

27:12.360 --> 27:16.760
The Appropriations Committee is the committee where the real yes or no to the business of

27:16.760 --> 27:18.840
government is heard.

27:18.840 --> 27:23.800
Other committees may authorize and propose projects and programs, but such matters will

27:23.800 --> 27:28.680
never be realized until the money to pay for them is appropriated.

27:28.680 --> 27:34.600
The Appropriations Committee holds the final key to this final, all-important step, getting

27:34.600 --> 27:36.720
the money to pay the bill.

27:36.720 --> 27:41.760
This is one main reason I feel my new position on this committee will enable me to render

27:41.760 --> 27:47.960
even greater service to every part of Tennessee, and I shall do my very best to do so.

27:47.960 --> 27:52.760
Another matter of wide interest to all parts of Tennessee is the TVA Self-Financing Bill

27:52.760 --> 27:54.680
that we've talked about so much.

27:55.200 --> 28:00.320
I am pleased to report the Senator Robert Kerr of Oklahoma has again agreed to introduce

28:00.320 --> 28:04.520
this bill in the Public Works Committee on to guide it there.

28:04.520 --> 28:09.560
It has been discussed with the new senators on the committee and with others, and I think

28:09.560 --> 28:15.120
in the Senate the outlook is favorable, and I think it's better in the House also.

28:15.120 --> 28:20.560
President Eisenhower's budget presented to Congress last week suggested that when such

28:20.560 --> 28:27.120
a bill was passed that he would ask that the TVA have authority to borrow $200 million

28:27.120 --> 28:32.280
to bill necessary projects at the present time.

28:32.280 --> 28:37.480
We have not been able at this time to determine the period the money is supposed to cover.

28:37.480 --> 28:42.240
This is an important point that needs clarification, and we are working on it.

28:42.240 --> 28:47.160
Senator Goura and I, as your senators from Tennessee and all the others from our TVA

28:47.160 --> 28:53.600
area, have worked hard and steadily toward this goal of securing a self-financing program

28:53.600 --> 28:59.400
for TVA and FAR, all of the matters pertaining to this important power, navigation, flood

28:59.400 --> 29:01.560
control facility.

29:01.560 --> 29:06.600
Now that we have brought the program near realization, we all propose to renew our efforts

29:06.600 --> 29:12.200
all along the line to see that the TVA remains strong and grows according to the needs of

29:12.200 --> 29:17.680
the state, and our colleagues in the House of Representatives are doing the same thing.

29:17.680 --> 29:23.480
Now I'd like to extend my thanks to all those in Upper East Tennessee and in Nashville,

29:23.480 --> 29:28.560
whose warm welcome last night, last week made our visit so wonderful.

29:28.560 --> 29:32.220
The first Baptist Church of the Elizabethan, where I spoke to the brotherhood, ladies'

29:32.220 --> 29:36.920
night, and attended Sunday services was most cordial.

29:36.920 --> 29:41.440
At Nashville last Monday, I saw many old friends and enjoyed attending the inauguration of

29:41.440 --> 29:46.720
Governor Buford Ellington, where he and the outgoing Governor Frank Clement both made

29:46.720 --> 29:47.720
fine speeches.

29:47.720 --> 29:53.360
I hope to be able to return to Tennessee very soon with my new administrative assistant,

29:53.360 --> 29:58.440
Charlie Calwell, and we plan to have make many trips back and to talk with you about your

29:58.440 --> 30:01.360
needs and your problems.

30:01.360 --> 30:05.240
In closing, I'd like to mention that the Senate Animal Noply Subcommittee of which I'm

30:05.240 --> 30:11.520
chairman, last week resumed its hearings concerning the growing high cost of living,

30:11.520 --> 30:15.720
and the runaway inflation that some people are experiencing in this country.

30:15.720 --> 30:20.080
We plan to pursue this problem vigorously in an effort to arrive at the causes for these

30:20.080 --> 30:27.320
spiraling costs of living, and to make recommendations that may help to pull the price line, and to

30:27.320 --> 30:30.880
prevent inflation that is damaging all of our people.

30:31.280 --> 30:37.880
That's all I have time for for this occasion, so goodbye until next week.

30:45.760 --> 30:50.560
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the past week in Congress has again been a very

30:50.560 --> 30:51.960
busy one.

30:51.960 --> 30:56.640
The Judiciary Committee of which I'm a member, met, discussed its budget, and made assignments

30:56.640 --> 30:58.400
to subcommittees.

30:58.400 --> 31:02.720
I am again privileged to head the antitrust and monopoly subcommittee.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.840
For several days now, this committee has heard expert testimony from a number of leading

31:06.840 --> 31:12.920
economists such as Dr. Norris and Lewis and others, on the effect of administered prices

31:12.920 --> 31:16.280
and the inflation of prices to the consumer.

31:16.280 --> 31:20.120
This is a very important question, and we will have many more hearings in our effort to

31:20.120 --> 31:26.000
determine the causes of this rapidly increasing cost of living and what can be done about

31:26.000 --> 31:27.160
it.

31:27.160 --> 31:32.400
This will include a look at food and bread and some parts of drugs and other commodities

31:32.400 --> 31:36.120
that affect every citizen's pocketbook every day.

31:36.120 --> 31:40.280
In this connection, I have introduced a bill designed to take automobile manufacturers

31:40.280 --> 31:44.080
out of the banking and insurance business.

31:44.080 --> 31:48.560
Our committee has found that Ford Motor Company contemplates setting up a banking and insurance

31:48.560 --> 31:53.960
structure as General Motors has been employing for many years, and there are rumors that

31:53.960 --> 31:57.800
Chrysler Motor is also thinking along these same lines.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.920
I don't feel it is fair that one manufacturer should have the benefits to rise from such

32:01.920 --> 32:06.560
operations, while others do not, and if one is going to have it, the other ought to be

32:06.560 --> 32:09.320
others ought to be entitled to have it too.

32:09.320 --> 32:14.120
But even more important, our committee has determined that any automobile manufacturer

32:14.120 --> 32:19.440
to engage in banking and insurance activities restrains trade and automobiles and promotes

32:19.440 --> 32:27.360
mop monopolization of the production, distribution, sale, financing, and insurance of automobiles.

32:27.360 --> 32:32.680
I believe that financing and insurance should be the business largely of local establishments,

32:32.680 --> 32:35.560
whose primary concern is such business.

32:35.560 --> 32:39.840
In sponsoring this legislation, I certainly do not want to penalize any manufacturer who

32:39.840 --> 32:46.200
spins off his insurance or banking business, and I would support laws to give the manufacturers

32:46.200 --> 32:48.320
relief in this respect.

32:48.320 --> 32:52.720
I believe that this legislation will be helpful to all, including the dealers and put them

32:52.720 --> 32:54.960
on an even basis.

32:54.960 --> 32:59.240
Putting financing and insurance back in the hands of agencies at home will keep them more

32:59.240 --> 33:05.000
of the money at home, where it belongs, and materially aid small business.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.920
Hearings will be held on this bill so that all interested parties may present their views.

33:09.920 --> 33:15.080
Now to other assignments on the Judiciary Committee, I have again been named ahead the Constitutional

33:15.080 --> 33:19.920
Amendment Subcommittee, which will consider such important questions as equal rights for

33:19.920 --> 33:25.680
men or women and the possible inability of the President to perform the functions of his

33:25.680 --> 33:26.680
office.

33:26.680 --> 33:30.900
I have again prepared a resolution in this connection, outlining the methods for the Vice

33:30.900 --> 33:36.280
President to assume the President's duties in such an event, and for determining such

33:36.280 --> 33:37.880
inability and its extent.

33:37.880 --> 33:43.840
Now, third assignment in the Judiciary Committee is to the Judiciary Committee, a juvenile delinquency

33:43.840 --> 33:47.440
subcommittee, which I have in the past service chairman.

33:47.440 --> 33:51.840
I consider the work of this committee among the most important congresses coming to grips

33:51.840 --> 33:53.080
with.

33:53.080 --> 33:57.360
Much evidence has been developed to show that the responsibility or the blame for juvenile

33:57.360 --> 34:02.000
delinquency rests not upon a single cause but upon many.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.080
We do know that it is the delinquence family, the delinquence community, and the delinquence

34:06.080 --> 34:09.800
society which breeds the delinquent child.

34:09.800 --> 34:15.360
I feel so strongly about this that I devoted an entire speech to the subject before I create

34:15.360 --> 34:19.440
a group of leading Methodist ministers and laymen this week.

34:19.440 --> 34:23.400
That's all that we say how much I have enjoyed visits from many friends in Tennessee this

34:23.400 --> 34:24.800
past week.

34:24.800 --> 34:29.880
The rural towns have found service organization of leaders from rural areas where host to

34:29.880 --> 34:33.720
Congressman Baker and me at breakfast one day last week.

34:33.720 --> 34:38.360
And Kato Ellis of Munford, George Flowers and Tom Bradley of Covington and J.T. Haines

34:39.240 --> 34:42.400
of Brownsville stopped in the semen.

34:42.400 --> 34:48.000
We were able to be of service to some of these people in connection with a cotton virus program.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.240
Senator Gore in Representative Everett and I accompanied them to see assistant secretary

34:52.240 --> 34:55.080
McLean of the Agriculture Department.

34:55.080 --> 34:58.200
And I think that our meeting was satisfactory.

34:58.200 --> 35:02.960
The cotton program is being written and everybody is expressing their views about what it ought

35:02.960 --> 35:03.960
to be for next year.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.680
I look forward to next week's visit with you over television when I will try to bring

35:08.680 --> 35:12.840
you up to date on the many activities in your nation's capital.

35:12.840 --> 35:13.840
Thank you very much.

35:23.920 --> 35:28.640
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the Senate last week burst into activity on

35:28.640 --> 35:31.480
a number of important issues.

35:31.480 --> 35:35.800
Among these was considerable debate on the housing bill of this year, which was reported

35:35.800 --> 35:39.280
by the Banking Committee of the Senate last Wednesday.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.360
The bill sponsored by the Democrats would provide federal grants totaling two and one

35:43.360 --> 35:47.200
tensed billion dollars for urban renewal programs.

35:47.200 --> 35:51.280
Over the next six years, we have a lot of these programs in Tennessee, as all of you

35:51.280 --> 35:52.280
know.

35:52.280 --> 35:58.400
The administration bill by contrast would appropriate one and three tensed billion dollars for

35:58.400 --> 36:01.840
urban renewal over the same period.

36:01.840 --> 36:06.720
The Democratic bill calls for 35,000 new starts in public housing.

36:06.720 --> 36:12.200
The administration proposal makes no provision for new starts this year.

36:12.200 --> 36:17.160
The Democratic measure would raise interest rates on GI loans from four and three fours percent

36:17.160 --> 36:19.480
to five and one fourth percent.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.440
And this is in line with the administration's thinking.

36:22.440 --> 36:27.640
Although I personally doubt whether this increased interest rate is a solution to the problem

36:27.640 --> 36:32.440
of GI's getting adequate loans.

36:32.440 --> 36:37.640
The bill would provide for federal loans to a four hundred million dollars for college

36:37.640 --> 36:43.440
housing, which is just about double the figure that Mr. Eisenhower represented.

36:43.440 --> 36:48.360
The original Democratic proposal for direct loans for veterans was three hundred million

36:48.360 --> 36:53.360
dollars, but this was compromised down to one hundred and fifty million dollars.

36:53.360 --> 36:57.560
For the Cape Heart of Indiana, attempted to amend the bill in many respects.

36:57.560 --> 37:03.560
We had two long night sessions about it, but most of his amendments have been voted down,

37:03.560 --> 37:09.120
and it looks like the bill as originally presented or about in that form will pass, as to what

37:09.120 --> 37:13.920
the president will do with the bill, whether he will veto it or not, is another matter.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.280
We'll have to wait and see.

37:16.280 --> 37:22.200
Another bill which is headed for debate and for final action is federal aid for airports.

37:22.200 --> 37:26.280
We passed a bill in the Congress last year along this line, which as many of you know

37:26.280 --> 37:29.080
was vetoed by the president.

37:29.080 --> 37:35.280
I feel that some bill ought to be passed, giving more aid for airport construction.

37:35.280 --> 37:40.400
The airport congestion problem, the rapid increase in demand for new facilities brought about

37:40.400 --> 37:44.440
by jet planes is already a very serious problem.

37:44.440 --> 37:50.480
It has already reached the point of real difficulty and danger as we know it.

37:50.480 --> 37:56.520
Many planes have been falling recently, some on a kind of inadequate airport facilities.

37:56.520 --> 38:01.600
And I don't think we can afford to squeeze dollars in case where lives are directly concerned

38:01.600 --> 38:03.600
as they are here.

38:03.600 --> 38:08.840
By this last week, it was a pleasure to welcome quite a number of visitors to Tennessee,

38:08.840 --> 38:14.680
a delegation of the Tennessee Veterans of Foreign Wars came to Washington to attend their

38:14.680 --> 38:19.880
annual congressional meeting where they presented the needs of veterans to the various congressional

38:19.880 --> 38:20.880
committees.

38:20.880 --> 38:26.520
And I had the privilege of having a number of this group as my guest in the Senate Restroom.

38:26.520 --> 38:34.840
The group included Herbert Davis, the state commander of Mowlin, Dave Doughton of Memphis,

38:34.840 --> 38:41.120
Charlie Casey and Floyd Matthews of Nashville, RL England, the former commander of Gallatin,

38:41.120 --> 38:43.800
and Balsam Perry of Elizabeth.

38:43.800 --> 38:48.760
On another occasion last week, Mayor Steger Well of Mowlin and Dr. Clember, the head of

38:48.760 --> 38:52.600
the Chamber of Commerce, came to see Senator Gore and me.

38:52.600 --> 38:57.720
And we took them over to see Dr. Holiday, the Missile Tsar in connection with trying to

38:57.720 --> 39:03.120
get the Mowlin ordinance used in connection with the making of missiles or some parts there

39:03.120 --> 39:04.120
are.

39:04.120 --> 39:08.200
There is a company that's operating down at Huntsville in the solid propellant part of the

39:08.200 --> 39:09.200
missile program.

39:09.200 --> 39:15.560
And if they do get new business, they feel that they could use a great deal of the Mowlin

39:15.560 --> 39:18.760
arsenal and give a great many people employment.

39:18.760 --> 39:22.560
We didn't get any promises, but they agreed to give us consideration when the program has

39:22.560 --> 39:27.480
been decided upon and we'll keep in touch with the matter and do the best we can to get

39:27.480 --> 39:32.840
some much needed activity at the Mowlin arsenal.

39:32.840 --> 39:39.200
Another bill which I have a special interest in because I filed it as a sports bill which

39:39.200 --> 39:45.880
would equalize the baseball, basketball, football teams and would give the players a better

39:45.880 --> 39:49.880
right to protect themselves and would be of great interest to the Mowlin elite.

39:49.880 --> 39:54.320
I'll have an opportunity of telling you more about that next week or some other occasion.

39:54.320 --> 39:57.120
Now time's up and I must say goodbye for now.

39:57.120 --> 40:07.520
Thank you very much.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.160
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

40:11.160 --> 40:16.160
In our day-to-day concentration on the very real domestic problems of our nation, there

40:16.160 --> 40:21.680
is often the danger that we may lose sight of another very real problem that is worldwide

40:21.680 --> 40:22.680
in its school.

40:22.680 --> 40:27.680
I speak to you now on the touch and go battle which we wage every hour for the minds

40:27.680 --> 40:32.280
and muscle of men and women throughout the uncommitted nations of the world.

40:32.760 --> 40:38.200
I would, in no way, suggest that I domestic efforts to secure better schools, homes, a

40:38.200 --> 40:43.560
fair and workable program for the farmers and a positive answer to the complex and vexing

40:43.560 --> 40:49.920
problem of a higher and higher cost of living should be relaxed for a moment or any of these

40:49.920 --> 40:53.440
other vital programs that we talk about every day.

40:53.440 --> 40:58.080
These are issues to which I have devoted a considerable amount of study on effort.

40:58.080 --> 41:03.520
They are the framework upon which our way of life and our very freedoms are built.

41:03.520 --> 41:09.120
But this framework of our freedoms also depends to a very large degree upon whether or not

41:09.120 --> 41:13.680
we win the relentless coal war for the peoples of the world.

41:13.680 --> 41:19.080
Not only in Sephari's freedom lives, not only in Sephari's our own nation, but in these

41:19.080 --> 41:23.120
many nations where our freedoms stay strong.

41:23.120 --> 41:27.600
It is with these thoughts before me that I call you attention to a resolution that I

41:27.600 --> 41:31.360
have just introduced in the United States Senate.

41:31.360 --> 41:35.720
Fifteen of my colleagues in the Senate have co-sponsored this resolution.

41:35.720 --> 41:41.400
They are Senator Byrd of West Virginia, Senator Young of O'Hah, Senator Douglas, Maulis,

41:41.400 --> 41:49.120
McGee, Javits, Murray, Mansfield, Bartlett, Humphries, Engel, McCarthy of Minnesota, Clark, New

41:49.120 --> 41:51.480
Berger, and Randolph.

41:51.480 --> 41:56.520
Most countries of the free world are now giving economic help of one kind or another to the

41:56.520 --> 41:59.120
underdeveloped countries of our world.

41:59.120 --> 42:04.680
It is my belief that such help could be much more effective if all of these free nations,

42:04.680 --> 42:10.800
such as France, England, Italy, West Germany, the United States, and many others, would

42:10.800 --> 42:15.600
immediately coordinate their national programs of economic assistance.

42:15.600 --> 42:20.360
My resolution calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to seek to work out

42:20.360 --> 42:25.800
agreements with other free nations, looking toward consolidation of these various national

42:25.800 --> 42:29.040
programs of economic assistance.

42:29.040 --> 42:33.840
Such a consolidated program would achieve, I believe, three very important things.

42:33.840 --> 42:39.840
First, it would avoid costly duplication of effort, and thus work a less of a tax burden

42:39.840 --> 42:43.040
on the people of any one nation.

42:43.040 --> 42:48.120
In Second, it would join the uncommitted nations to the free world, rather than to just one

42:48.120 --> 42:49.800
member of this world.

42:49.800 --> 42:54.240
One nation might have better acceptance here and another nation there.

42:54.240 --> 42:59.240
And third, it would encourage greater effort on the part of free nations to work as a harmonious

42:59.240 --> 43:01.400
economic force.

43:01.400 --> 43:06.480
You may ask, what has all this to do with fighting the Russians and the Cold War?

43:06.480 --> 43:09.440
Here I believe is the answer to that question.

43:09.440 --> 43:15.080
The Soviet Union is courting the underdeveloped and uncommitted nations with economic aid,

43:15.080 --> 43:23.000
a one kind or another, in a big way, just as we in the free nations community are doing.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.320
But the Soviet rate of production is gaining on us at a fast cliff.

43:27.320 --> 43:32.200
And as they are able to offer more and more aid, they have the dangers advantage of one

43:32.200 --> 43:39.320
single channel, the totalitarian Russian funnel, through which they can pour their offerings,

43:39.320 --> 43:42.680
in devastating concentration.

43:42.680 --> 43:46.320
Concerted action in this field is vital to the free nations.

43:46.320 --> 43:50.720
If this economic battle is lost, the Cold War could be lost.

43:50.720 --> 43:55.120
This year's bidding too for the hearts and minds of many people in the world.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.880
We cannot afford to underbid and lose these people.

43:58.880 --> 44:05.400
I hope the executive department of our government will heed this resolution amid the daily domestic

44:05.400 --> 44:07.200
and political struggle.

44:07.200 --> 44:11.360
I believe it is a very important resolution.

44:11.360 --> 44:14.400
I believe it is an important battle.

44:14.400 --> 44:19.080
I believe our very freedoms here in abroad depend to a large degree upon the common effort

44:19.080 --> 44:23.880
among the free nations to beat Russia to the economic punch.

44:23.880 --> 44:27.400
That is why I have devoted this weekly report to this question.

44:27.400 --> 44:31.520
I have enjoyed talking with you again, and I will look forward to visiting with you again

44:31.520 --> 44:33.720
on television next week.

44:33.720 --> 44:36.160
That's all for now, and goodbye until next week.
