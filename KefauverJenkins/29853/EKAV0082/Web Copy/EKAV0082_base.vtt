00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
This is Senator Estes' key fall for Tennessee speaking.

00:08.400 --> 00:14.920
I am delighted to be invited to take part in honoring station WICU on the occasion of

00:14.920 --> 00:16.920
its 10th anniversary.

00:16.920 --> 00:22.800
I have known Ted Lam for many, many years, and I know the outstanding work he and the

00:22.800 --> 00:28.960
staff of WICU have done in bringing the best of news, entertainment and public service

00:28.960 --> 00:34.520
programs to the viewers and listeners of the area and the surrounding area.

00:34.520 --> 00:39.760
I know that not only from reputation, but I have had the opportunity of visiting station

00:39.760 --> 00:43.600
WICU on two occasions in the past few years.

00:43.600 --> 00:48.360
I wish very much I could be with you personally on this occasion.

00:48.360 --> 00:57.040
I extend to Ted Lam and to the staff and to the people of WICU and to the audience of

00:57.040 --> 01:01.560
this film, my warmest greetings and congratulations.

01:01.560 --> 01:08.520
I wish all of you continuing success and your undertakings and many more good years to come.

01:08.520 --> 01:18.360
Thank you very much.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.120
Ladies and gentlemen, my friends are Tennessee.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.480
Today we are very honored in having a distinguished member of the United States Senate with us,

01:26.480 --> 01:29.400
who is one of my very best friends.

01:29.400 --> 01:34.080
We came here at the same time back in the first part of 1949.

01:34.080 --> 01:40.480
I'm sure that all of you know our distinguished guests, but in case you do not recognize him,

01:40.480 --> 01:43.680
he has sent a Russell Long of Louisiana.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.480
Russell before you're saying anything, I want to say that I think Senator Long is one

01:47.480 --> 01:53.800
of our ablest, finest, most progressive members of the United States Senate.

01:53.800 --> 01:58.760
He had the distinction when he came here first of being about the third youngest senator

01:58.760 --> 02:01.000
to ever come to Washington.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.640
Of course, he's older than that now.

02:03.640 --> 02:09.640
And also the only member of the Senate who's father and mother were also members of the

02:09.640 --> 02:10.840
United States Senate.

02:10.840 --> 02:16.960
He's doing a great work here and we in Tennessee certainly appreciate your cooperation with

02:16.960 --> 02:18.920
many things that we are interested in Russell.

02:18.920 --> 02:23.080
Well, that's, if that needs to be, I don't agree with everything you said, but I appreciate

02:23.080 --> 02:24.080
you saying it just the same.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
I'd be glad if you hadn't.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.040
I told the truth Russell.

02:28.040 --> 02:33.680
Senator Long today has introduced a bill of which I have the pleasure of being a co-sponsor

02:33.680 --> 02:38.080
called the Veterans Reinsurance Bill.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.280
It's of importance to servicemen of all wars.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.040
I know you'll hear a great deal about it.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.080
And Senator Long, will you tell us about the bill and what it provides?

02:46.080 --> 02:50.560
Is this particular bill that I've introduced and Senator Keith Bolvers joined in the years

02:50.560 --> 02:52.760
of sponsor on this bill?

02:52.760 --> 02:57.260
Just to give veterans of World War II and the Korean War and any other veteran who was

02:57.260 --> 03:03.880
ever eligible to take out his national service life insurance, a second chance to take

03:03.880 --> 03:04.880
it out.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.080
And that would include those veterans who once had an additional service life insurance

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
and they'd expire.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.280
Now, of course, the big reason we want to do that is because this veteran's insurance is

03:13.280 --> 03:16.080
much cheaper than it is to take it out with a private company.

03:16.080 --> 03:21.280
For example, for term insurance, I noticed it would cost less than one third as much

03:21.280 --> 03:25.400
to have this insurance with the government under your national service life insurance.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.280
Then it would have it with a private company.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.120
This can be done in such a way that the new policies will carry the cost of administration

03:34.120 --> 03:36.080
and the cost of taking them out.

03:36.080 --> 03:40.560
And even then, it will be a tremendous savings to the veteran and at no cost, whatever,

03:40.560 --> 03:42.240
to the federal government.

03:42.240 --> 03:47.440
Now, we feel that this is needed, that there are about 14 million veterans and their families

03:47.440 --> 03:49.480
who are interested in this measure.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.920
This past has said on two other occasions when we offered it, it has failed in the house

03:53.920 --> 03:57.120
of representative, but one of these days we're going to succeed in getting it through

03:57.120 --> 03:58.680
bull houd as in making it law.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.680
I've seen it long.

03:59.680 --> 04:05.760
As I understand, veterans who have let their insurance, their national life insurance,

04:05.760 --> 04:09.560
lapse or who just never took it out, this would give them one year in which they could

04:09.560 --> 04:10.560
get into the program too.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.240
And they should have that.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.280
Same opportunity was given veterans of World War I.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.160
For many, many years, I believe even up to this day, they had that opportunity.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.160
That's right.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.520
To take out their national service life insurance at their tamed age.

04:22.520 --> 04:26.200
And actually, if you took it out when you were younger, you would get a cheaper rate.

04:26.200 --> 04:31.160
But even so, it's a substantial savings in veterans of World War II and the Korean War.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.960
It should have that opportunity.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.840
As a matter of fact, most of them, when they were discharged, were not married men.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.400
They didn't have family responsibilities.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.240
And if they took out insurance policy, it was just, they were the matter of ensuring

04:42.240 --> 04:43.480
that mother or their father.

04:43.480 --> 04:48.840
But now that they have wives and children and very heavy and substantial family responsibilities,

04:48.840 --> 04:50.840
they want this protection, this coverage.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.640
I believe we'll get from one of these days after.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.560
I think we will do Russell now.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.240
How much will this cost the government?

04:56.240 --> 04:57.240
Not of it.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.240
Not one red copper cent.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.160
The way we drew it up, it wouldn't be quite as favorable as if they had taken the policy

05:02.160 --> 05:06.760
out in the first place because every service the government furnished will be covered in

05:06.760 --> 05:08.360
the cost of the policy.

05:08.360 --> 05:13.080
But even then, as I say, we figure, let's say a man thirty-five with a term insurance

05:13.080 --> 05:17.320
policy of ten thousand dollars could get that for about eighteen dollars a year.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.440
And it would cost about sixty-six only average with the private company.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.360
Now how about the American Legion and the VFW and the VFW?

05:23.360 --> 05:24.760
Every single one of them would borrow it.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.680
I don't know of any nature of veterans organization against it.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.720
As a matter of fact, some of the nature of veterans organizations like American Legion

05:31.720 --> 05:35.960
have promised me that they're going to fight actively for that bill during this Congress.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.960
Well I think this is the most important bill.

05:37.960 --> 05:42.800
I know where all of us members of the Senate received letters from servicemen who want

05:42.800 --> 05:46.560
to sit in on the program and say that they let it lapse and this will give them an opportunity

05:46.560 --> 05:47.560
of getting in.

05:47.560 --> 05:52.600
I congratulate your Senator Long upon filing this bill and thank you very much for your

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
bill.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
Thank you for your help, FF.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.600
Just will need you up to get it through.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.600
That's all until next week at this time.

05:57.600 --> 06:07.200
Thank you very much.

06:07.200 --> 06:12.160
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I wish to first report to you that my

06:12.160 --> 06:17.400
knee is feeling a great deal better now than it was this time when I talked to you last

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400
week.

06:18.400 --> 06:24.360
But even though I have had considerable improvement, nobody has persuaded me yet to again try to

06:24.360 --> 06:28.080
ride in one of these soup box Derby automobile racers.

06:28.080 --> 06:34.560
For the time being, I'm just antique automobile will continue to be my hobby.

06:34.560 --> 06:40.600
I went out to see this little racer a few days ago and I marveled high ever was able

06:40.600 --> 06:41.600
to get in it.

06:42.160 --> 06:46.520
But ladies and gentlemen, today I have with me two very handsome men as you will see

06:46.520 --> 06:50.640
in just a few minutes that I want to introduce to you.

06:50.640 --> 06:56.440
First on my left is Richard Wallace and I thank you for seeing him on this program.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.560
Many of you know him.

06:58.560 --> 07:05.560
He has been my very able conscientious loyal, hardworking administrative assistant for almost

07:05.560 --> 07:09.120
eight years here in Congress.

07:10.120 --> 07:15.600
I hate very much to leave Mr. Wallace, but he's leaving us in a few days to perform a

07:15.600 --> 07:20.320
very important work in which I'm interested too.

07:20.320 --> 07:26.240
Dick, I know you want to tell us something about what you're going to do.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.240
Oh yes, I'm sure.

07:27.240 --> 07:32.600
But first let me say that it's been a real pleasure working with you during these past

07:32.600 --> 07:33.600
years.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.800
I never know anyone that I admired more and you certainly performed it.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.800
Well, you're a nice say.

07:38.800 --> 07:44.600
So we've had a lot of hard decisions and a lot of difficulties, but we've made them

07:44.600 --> 07:45.600
right or wrong.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.600
But he didn't made it right.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.160
I admit a lot of them wrong too.

07:50.160 --> 07:58.840
Well, Senator, the Atlantic Congress is really something that you started in 1957.

07:58.840 --> 08:04.000
You appointed the delegate to the NATO Parliamentarians' conference and while there you

08:04.000 --> 08:09.400
proposed a resolution that was unanimously adopted by delegates from all the NATO nations

08:09.400 --> 08:14.840
calling for a Congress of citizens, modeled after the Hague Congress that was held in

08:14.840 --> 08:20.560
Europe in 1948, to meet in June of next year, now all the NATO...

08:20.560 --> 08:21.560
You mean in Indonesia, right?

08:21.560 --> 08:22.560
In the year 1959.

08:22.560 --> 08:29.440
Now all the nations are in the process of organizing and arranging for their participation in

08:29.440 --> 08:31.440
the Congress.

08:31.440 --> 08:35.800
My part will be working with the United States Committee to do this.

08:35.800 --> 08:42.960
We hope that a lot will be produced in this year, which is the anniversary of NATO, not

08:42.960 --> 08:48.000
just be a time of looking back with what will be a time to look forward to what NATO ought

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
to be in the future.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Well, that's right.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.480
Well, I certainly agree that this is going to be one of the most important meetings in

08:53.480 --> 08:54.480
the century.

08:54.880 --> 09:01.480
As a matter of fact, the security and freedom and the peace of the world and the security

09:01.480 --> 09:08.480
of the United States, I think, depends upon us working with our allies of the North Atlantic

09:08.480 --> 09:13.280
community better with greater unity, and that's the purpose that we're of this meeting.

09:13.280 --> 09:20.120
So you're going to be performing a most outstanding service with which you're very well qualified.

09:20.120 --> 09:24.720
We want you to come back and be with us on this program as a guest from time.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.720
Thank you, Senator.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.800
I'll be over here begging for the privilege.

09:27.800 --> 09:35.240
Now on my right here is Charlie Colwell, who was assistant city editor of the Memphis

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
Presbyter.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.160
I know that many of you have known Charlie Colwell.

09:40.160 --> 09:45.320
He and Dick have been friends and Charlie and I have been friends for many, many years.

09:45.320 --> 09:49.480
I don't know if anyone can fill Dick Wallace's shoes, but Charlie, you look big enough for

09:49.480 --> 09:51.480
a lot of us, anybody's shoes.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.240
And we certainly are glad to have you as our new administrative assistant.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.240
Thank you, Senator.

09:56.240 --> 10:01.080
It's not very often that a man gets an opportunity to work as an administrative assistant for

10:01.080 --> 10:06.000
a senator, and it's really rare that he gets a chance to work as one for a senator and

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
a station.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.680
And I'll try to be the John Dick, that Charlie or you sure are starting off well.

10:12.680 --> 10:18.120
Well, every since we first met in the campaign in 48 and 10 a.m. at which time we traveled

10:18.120 --> 10:24.200
together, I've followed your career with great interest and I do want you to know that

10:24.200 --> 10:26.240
I consider quite an honor to work for you.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.240
Well, thank you, Charlie.

10:27.240 --> 10:32.560
And I know you're going to do a great job and we're going to be down to the governor's inauguration

10:32.560 --> 10:37.080
on Monday the 19th and together and you'll have a chance of seeing a whole lot of people

10:37.080 --> 10:38.080
then.

10:38.080 --> 10:42.320
Well, I wish we could talk about a lot of other things, but our time is up and so long

10:42.320 --> 10:46.320
until next week at this time.

10:46.320 --> 10:59.520
This week from the nation's capitals, Senator Estes Keek-Fover presents a very distinguished

10:59.520 --> 11:04.000
guest and a very interesting subject, submarines and the Polaris.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.240
Now here is Senator Keek-Fover.

11:06.240 --> 11:12.680
Ladies and gentlemen, this week we have on our program, we're Admiral John T. Hayward,

11:12.680 --> 11:17.600
who is the chief of naval operations for research and development.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.800
We'd like to have you, Admiral Hayward, and welcome to our program.

11:21.800 --> 11:27.400
Admiral Hayward, the defense department has placed a great deal of dependence upon the Polaris

11:27.400 --> 11:28.720
missile.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.800
What is it and how does it work and will you tell us something about it?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.920
This is in your jurisdiction, of course.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.720
Yes, that's a badly-centered.

11:35.720 --> 11:41.960
The Polaris missile is a solid propellant ballistic missile launched from the nucleus submarine

11:41.960 --> 11:45.200
and it is one of the best weapon systems we have.

11:45.200 --> 11:51.560
It permits us to use the submarine's advantages of security and invulnerability because of

11:51.560 --> 11:55.440
its mobility to the best effect.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.760
And it is one of our best deterrent forces.

11:57.760 --> 12:02.680
It has advantages, of course, over fixed bases and it is part of the approach to the

12:02.680 --> 12:05.760
deterrent problem by putting flexibility into it.

12:05.760 --> 12:10.200
Well, we're very proud of the great progress you and the Navy have made in this field.

12:10.200 --> 12:15.040
Admiral Hayward, is it just this mean that battleships and cruisers and destroyers and

12:15.040 --> 12:19.120
surface ships are not no longer going to be important in the Navy?

12:19.120 --> 12:24.040
No, Senator, because this is just one part of the challenge that faces the United States.

12:24.040 --> 12:29.880
This is in what we call the all-out of the mega-war part of the spectrum of war.

12:29.880 --> 12:36.080
Whereas when you have situations such as existed in Lebanon or Indonesia or Korea, you will

12:36.080 --> 12:41.200
have to use the other part of your conventional systems to fight and ease their countries.

12:41.200 --> 12:46.240
Well, Admiral Hayward, I understand that you are receiving some very valuable weather

12:46.240 --> 12:52.160
information from the latest Vanguard shot, which we are all proud of as a scientific

12:52.160 --> 12:55.120
advancement by our researchers.

12:55.120 --> 13:01.960
What is the Navy's Vanguard rocket like and how does the orbiting process work other

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
than?

13:02.960 --> 13:05.440
It's a 20-inch sphere that we have.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.240
It's a three-stage rocket.

13:07.240 --> 13:11.680
This is the fourth stage I'm holding, and the sphere is separated from the fourth

13:11.680 --> 13:16.960
stage because you want to get accurate scientific information.

13:16.960 --> 13:22.040
The Vanguard is now in the hands of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency.

13:22.040 --> 13:27.280
Of course, we in the Navy feel like it's our project and we're very happy to be getting

13:27.280 --> 13:29.600
this weather information.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.560
It is an excellent scientific accomplishment and the American should be proud of it.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.920
Well, we certainly are and we're proud of the Navy.

13:35.920 --> 13:41.680
I'm trying to see if somewhat of a naval state, although we don't bother on any ocean.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.000
We have rivers and lakes.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.880
Well, Admiral Hayward, what is the Navy's future role in the missile field?

13:50.880 --> 13:56.520
Are we going ahead with satellites as a military weapon or are you confining yourself, yourselves,

13:56.520 --> 13:58.160
to tactical missiles?

13:58.160 --> 14:05.440
Well, our philosophy is to use space to accomplish our objectives where we can accomplish it

14:05.440 --> 14:08.120
better in space than we can on the ground.

14:08.120 --> 14:13.080
We are certainly going to investigate a new space to the best of our ability to do the

14:13.080 --> 14:14.080
naval job.

14:14.080 --> 14:20.680
Well, Admiral, as you know, all of us in the Senate get a lot of letters about the budget

14:20.680 --> 14:24.360
and the defense department is spending $45 billion.

14:25.080 --> 14:29.040
Well, these weapons are going to get more and more costly and we'll have to spend more

14:29.040 --> 14:31.360
of what do you think about that situation.

14:31.360 --> 14:35.840
Well, they're going to be more complex and they probably will cost more and actual dollars.

14:35.840 --> 14:40.560
However, I feel that if we, by the means of research and development, we can do the

14:40.560 --> 14:45.640
job more efficiently with fewer people that the costs should relatively run about the

14:45.640 --> 14:48.600
same percentage of the budget as it runs today.

14:49.320 --> 14:56.360
Well, Admiral, we hear a whole lot about the Russians' huge submarine fleet and can you tell

14:56.360 --> 15:02.120
us where we stand in this course that we're engaged in?

15:02.120 --> 15:06.000
As the Polaris succeeds on our side, we're worried about the Russian submarine.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.840
We certainly don't have all the answers and I'm sorry I can't say that we do.

15:09.840 --> 15:15.080
Well, I'm certainly I'm grateful to you for coming and I know that the viewers of this

15:15.080 --> 15:17.880
program appreciate your appearance very, very much.

15:17.880 --> 15:18.880
Thank you.

15:18.880 --> 15:19.880
Thank you, sir.

15:19.880 --> 15:24.880
That's all until next week at this time.

15:24.880 --> 15:35.720
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, as you may have read in the newspapers recently,

15:35.720 --> 15:42.560
there seems to be a lot of conversation going on about another increase in the steel industry.

15:42.560 --> 15:47.320
Another time steel prices jump, your pocketbook jumps with pain.

15:47.320 --> 15:53.640
The prices of your automobile, your washing machine, your refrigerator, your iron, tin cans,

15:53.640 --> 15:59.240
hair pins and all of your appliances and hundreds of others, all the things that you must buy

15:59.240 --> 16:05.440
to pursue your life and business, respond directly and acutely and immediately to any change

16:05.440 --> 16:07.440
in the price of steel.

16:07.440 --> 16:11.720
As a matter of fact, it's steel that is the bellweather of our economy.

16:11.720 --> 16:16.920
For some months now, there has been talk of a strike in the steel industry.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.640
Manufacturers hedge by building up inventory.

16:19.640 --> 16:24.120
The steel industry hedges by stepping up production and stockpiling.

16:24.120 --> 16:29.200
The industry points to labor cost and says it must raise the price of steel.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.480
Labor points to the high cost of manufactured goods and profits the steel industry makes

16:34.480 --> 16:41.080
and says it must have more money to make things come out even and the consumer just winces.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.400
The real question is, which comes first?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.320
The chicken or the egg?

16:46.320 --> 16:52.160
Why is it that we can't stop this nut-so-mer-y, merry-go-round of wages and prices, which spins

16:52.160 --> 16:56.640
us further and further into the high altitudes of inflation?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.240
Which really does come first?

16:58.240 --> 17:00.400
The chicken or the egg?

17:00.400 --> 17:05.840
A few days ago, I outlined a new proposal in an effort to prevent a further price increase

17:05.840 --> 17:07.320
in the steel industry.

17:07.960 --> 17:14.200
I urge that Roger Blau, the board chairman of the United States Steel and David McDonald,

17:14.200 --> 17:19.160
the president of the United Steel Workers, consider this proposal in the seriousness with

17:19.160 --> 17:21.080
which I propose it.

17:21.080 --> 17:27.040
I propose that the union offer to limit its wage-increased demand to an amount equal to

17:27.040 --> 17:31.720
the increase in the productivity in the steel industry.

17:31.720 --> 17:36.080
An impartial board could determine the rate of productivity increase.

17:36.080 --> 17:41.900
I pointed out that if the union were to so restrict its demands, and there would be no

17:41.900 --> 17:47.720
necessity for an increase in the cost of steel per tonne, and thus no justification for

17:47.720 --> 17:49.600
a price increase.

17:49.600 --> 17:55.400
But if management, despite this limited demand by the union, raised prices, the union would

17:55.400 --> 17:59.640
be free to seek its proportionate share of the price increase.

17:59.640 --> 18:05.280
Well, Mr. McDonald, when he was asked by reporters for his reaction to this proposal, was quoted

18:05.280 --> 18:09.520
as stating he wished I would keep my nose out of his business.

18:09.520 --> 18:14.560
This position doesn't seem very indicative of a willingness to solve the problem, and

18:14.560 --> 18:20.560
it dramatizes my position exactly, and I understand Mr. Blau may not be very happy with the proposal

18:20.560 --> 18:21.560
either.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.960
The price of steel is not just Mr. McDonald's business.

18:24.960 --> 18:29.720
It's not just the business of Mr. Roger Blau of the United States Steel Company.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.640
It's the business of the people.

18:32.640 --> 18:38.080
The price increase in steel will start the inflation, merry go around spinning, and

18:38.080 --> 18:40.400
who among us can afford that.

18:40.400 --> 18:45.860
I hope Mr. McDonald, for whom I have the highest admiration, will give my proposal more

18:45.860 --> 18:51.680
serious consideration, as he must realize, and the equation is just as hard on the members

18:51.680 --> 18:56.080
of his union, as it is on the people everywhere.

18:56.080 --> 19:01.560
I believe that some serious talk and action along the lines I propose, but sound a lot better

19:01.560 --> 19:07.800
to the consumers' ear, and to talk about the inevitable ability of a price wage boost

19:07.800 --> 19:10.920
that seems to drown out all else.

19:10.920 --> 19:16.360
I would suggest that if you concur with me, that you like Mr. McDonald, and that you write

19:16.360 --> 19:22.000
Mr. Roger Blau at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and urge them to make a serious effort to head

19:22.000 --> 19:26.640
off another plan in the cost of living stratosphere.

19:26.640 --> 19:31.360
Perhaps if enough consumers write enough letters, we can plan the answer to the chicken and

19:31.360 --> 19:37.680
egg question, and slow down the merry go round enough to step off and find out what solid

19:37.680 --> 19:41.840
ground feels under our cost of living.

19:41.840 --> 19:48.120
My earnest effort to find a solution to the inflationary spiral still stands, and I stand

19:48.120 --> 19:49.440
behind it.

19:49.440 --> 19:54.600
We have been trying to do that this for a number of years, but it seems like every July the

19:54.600 --> 20:00.880
price of steel goes up, and then we have an increase demand for higher wages, and so it goes

20:00.880 --> 20:01.880
on and on.

20:01.880 --> 20:02.880
It's got to stop somewhere.

20:02.880 --> 20:03.880
That's all for now.

20:03.880 --> 20:07.880
Thank you very much.

20:07.880 --> 20:21.280
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, it has been a very busy week in Congress,

20:21.280 --> 20:25.400
and here are some of the things which we have accomplished in the Senate.

20:25.400 --> 20:31.120
The situation in Berlin, brought it by Mr. Kruchef into a state of real danger, called

20:31.120 --> 20:35.120
for a firm show of strength on the part of the United States.

20:35.120 --> 20:40.320
I'm glad to be able to report that the Senate acted in at least two ways to give Mr. Kruchef

20:40.320 --> 20:41.600
something to chew on.

20:41.600 --> 20:48.440
With only one dissenting vote, we approved by 90-1 vote a four-year term, four-year extension

20:48.440 --> 20:50.160
of the draft act.

20:50.160 --> 20:54.880
This was urgently requested by President Eisenhower, and I think that it was proper that

20:54.880 --> 20:59.200
the act be extended, and I voted for the extension.

20:59.200 --> 21:04.000
Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, called on

21:04.000 --> 21:09.880
the Senate before the vote on this bill was taken to show that the United States, quote,

21:09.880 --> 21:15.200
means what it says when it says we must maintain the military strength of the United States,

21:15.200 --> 21:16.440
unquote.

21:16.440 --> 21:22.840
In addition to continuing the present machinery for drafting young men aged 18 through 26,

21:22.840 --> 21:28.560
the Senate bill also provides among other things authority for continuation of extra pay

21:28.560 --> 21:35.560
at the rate of $100 to $250 a month to newly commissioned physicians and dentists and

21:35.560 --> 21:39.520
$100 a month additional pay for veterinarians.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.440
Another action taken by the Senate, which our field will help show our enemies in the Berlin

21:43.440 --> 21:51.360
crises that we mean business, was the 90-to-nothing vote to authorize an extra 48 million dollars

21:51.360 --> 21:56.400
to keep our civilian space program operating during the next four months.

21:56.400 --> 22:01.960
Senator John Stennis of Mississippi asked for and got this unanimous speedy approval of

22:01.960 --> 22:08.080
the supplemental measure to speed our capabilities to put man into space.

22:08.080 --> 22:13.080
The bill will bring to more than $384 million dollars the funds authorized for the National

22:13.080 --> 22:20.040
Arionatics and Space Administration during the current fiscal year, which ends July 1.

22:20.040 --> 22:27.200
The House Committee has also voted unanimously to authorize this $48 million extra.

22:27.200 --> 22:32.320
Sometimes we in Congress are here in Congress or asked why spend so much money on research

22:32.320 --> 22:35.000
and why worry about putting a man into space?

22:35.000 --> 22:40.640
Well, I think this research program is of vital importance to our country and to all the

22:40.640 --> 22:49.800
free nations in the conquest for at least a fair consideration in space as far as it concerns

22:49.800 --> 22:52.800
science and military supremacy.

22:52.800 --> 22:58.880
It is easy to say that this sort of research has a crazy, buck-rodious kind of intangibility.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.080
It is harder to look beyond the world.

23:01.080 --> 23:07.320
We all understand into the mysterious regions of outer space and see that here in the

23:07.320 --> 23:12.360
not too distant future will allow the key to the safety of our people.

23:12.360 --> 23:16.840
Well as we all know Russia claims that it has sent a satellite weighing a ton and a half

23:16.840 --> 23:18.680
into orbit around the sun.

23:18.920 --> 23:25.240
There is no doubt in any of our minds that Russia's advances in rockets and satellites

23:25.240 --> 23:27.240
has been phenomenal.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.400
We are struggling to catch up and to stay caught up.

23:30.400 --> 23:36.080
We must understand that mastery or at least even consideration in the matter of outer space

23:36.080 --> 23:41.080
can mean life or death to us and we must act accordingly.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.120
Talk about buck-rodious' ostrich thinking.

23:44.120 --> 23:50.760
We cannot afford to have our heads in the sand when unforeseen space machines and all

23:50.760 --> 23:53.720
that they mean in the military control of the world.

23:53.720 --> 23:59.440
Yes, even of the universe one day are being pressed vigorously pursued and pressed by

23:59.440 --> 24:03.400
our most sinister enemy, the Soviet Union.

24:03.400 --> 24:08.960
Extension of the draft, authorization for space research and all that pursuit of our

24:08.960 --> 24:15.200
military missile program, foreign military and economic aid, all these are weapons with

24:15.200 --> 24:20.200
which we must must fight for our freedom and the freedoms of our friends and the community

24:20.200 --> 24:21.200
of nations.

24:21.200 --> 24:27.760
It is dangerous to think only of balancing the budget as desirable as that might be and

24:27.760 --> 24:31.880
with a death and destruction of waiting right around the corner.

24:31.880 --> 24:36.840
Certainly we must find the way of saving money, of plugging loopholes if possible and

24:36.840 --> 24:42.320
tempering our domestic spending programs within the bounds and the needs of our people.

24:42.320 --> 24:47.200
But real danger lies alongside the path of budget just for budget sick alone.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.520
I'm trying in these decisions on these matters to keep constantly in mind that we must keep

24:52.520 --> 24:59.040
our nation strong and think about the budget after we think about the defense and the safety

24:59.040 --> 25:00.040
of our people.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.760
Thank you and that's all until next week.

25:07.840 --> 25:13.560
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we have some very important news with reference

25:13.560 --> 25:17.920
to the TVA to report to you on this program today.

25:17.920 --> 25:24.160
The House Public Works Committee by a vote of 19 to 14 reported out and sent to the floor

25:24.160 --> 25:30.600
of the House of Representatives, the so-called TVA Self-Financing Bill, to enable the TVA

25:30.600 --> 25:37.480
to finance its own steam-plants to issue bonds up to the extent of $750 million at any

25:37.480 --> 25:38.480
time.

25:38.480 --> 25:45.960
At any one time, the bonds to be paid out of the revenue from the sale of electricity.

25:45.960 --> 25:50.640
The members of the Tennessee delegation and Chairman Clifford Davis of the Public Works

25:50.640 --> 25:56.440
Committee, subcommittee, worked very hard to get a bill out over very stiff opposition

25:56.440 --> 26:02.960
from the private tower lobby and others who were here to testify against the bill.

26:02.960 --> 26:08.840
Unfortunately, bill that was reported by the House Committee did have a very bad crippling

26:08.840 --> 26:14.360
amendment insofar as a territory to be served by the TVA as concern.

26:14.360 --> 26:22.680
The House Committee bill members the TVA territory to 82,000 square miles, whereas the Senate

26:22.680 --> 26:29.960
bill, which we got through the last Congress in the Senate, had 105,000 square miles.

26:29.960 --> 26:35.240
The issue is kind of like this, that it's pretty difficult for former on one side of the

26:35.240 --> 26:41.080
line to be paying higher electricity and he feels that when he's definitely in a position

26:41.080 --> 26:46.560
where he can't ever get TVA service that his electric rates are going to go up, whereas

26:46.560 --> 26:49.720
if the threat is there, the rates will stay down.

26:49.720 --> 26:54.960
In any event we can work this, we can strive to get this crippling amendment eliminated

26:54.960 --> 26:59.880
in the House and in the Senate or to at least get it in better shape than it is at present

26:59.880 --> 27:00.880
time.

27:00.880 --> 27:08.160
It was a good thing and I'm glad that the TVA steam plant and the Memphis steam plant and

27:08.160 --> 27:10.680
interchained system was included.

27:10.680 --> 27:16.840
Coveington Diesburg would kept in the TVA area, South Fulton, Tennessee and Paducocan

27:16.840 --> 27:23.440
Tucky may get TVA power as is the case of Chickamaga, Georgia and Ringo, Georgia.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.800
But at least we're on the way to some worthwhile legislation.

27:25.800 --> 27:33.840
I'm very glad to have with us as a visitor today, Mr. Zeno Yates, a prominent citizen and

27:33.840 --> 27:37.200
leading architect of Memphis, Tennessee.

27:37.200 --> 27:42.320
We as you know last time I had a hearing in the Senate and got an appropriation through

27:42.320 --> 27:48.360
to start the purchase of property and planning for a new federal building in Memphis, which

27:48.360 --> 27:50.280
is very badly needed.

27:50.280 --> 27:55.040
And Mr. Yates, you've been up here in connection with this week and will you tell us what

27:55.040 --> 27:56.040
happened.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.040
Yes, sir.

27:57.040 --> 28:01.680
So let me tell you a little bit about the background that has transpired with the first

28:01.680 --> 28:06.720
Mr. Yates, you're the chairman of the Advisory, Civic Center Advisory Committee of Architects.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.720
Yes, sir.

28:07.720 --> 28:12.960
And we have entered into a contract through a League of Memphis Architects, Senator, that

28:12.960 --> 28:18.200
was established in Memphis about all the first of February.

28:18.200 --> 28:25.360
And we received an appropriation from the city that would allow us to spend about six

28:25.360 --> 28:31.720
months in developing and recommending a Civic Center design for the Civic Center of

28:31.720 --> 28:32.720
Memphis.

28:32.720 --> 28:38.800
We have been working through a Civic Center Advisory Committee that was appointed by the

28:38.800 --> 28:41.640
Mayor and the City Commissioners in Memphis.

28:41.640 --> 28:49.840
And on Monday of this week we presented them a recommended plan that was unanimous in

28:49.840 --> 28:58.520
the Architectural League of Memphis Architects to accept that to recommend to the city, the

28:58.520 --> 29:05.520
site for the proposed federal buildings which is immediately south of Ellis, auditorium.

29:05.520 --> 29:11.200
The Civic Center Advisory Committee next took that recommendation which was unanimous

29:11.200 --> 29:15.440
by the Memphis Architects to the City Commission on Tuesday.

29:15.440 --> 29:18.720
And they intend accepted our recommendation.

29:18.720 --> 29:24.080
And the Mayor came up to, and the Mayor and Tom Ferry's came up, Tom Ferry's is president

29:24.080 --> 29:27.640
of the Memphis chapter and I came up to Washington last night.

29:27.640 --> 29:34.120
And we appeared before the Mr. McConney and the administrative GSA today and received

29:34.120 --> 29:35.520
their approval this morning.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.760
Well, I congratulate you very, very hard to lay.

29:37.760 --> 29:38.760
Thank you, sir.

29:38.760 --> 29:43.360
That's going to be a wonderful Civic Center and that will be a beautiful 12 million dollar

29:43.360 --> 29:44.360
building.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.560
We want to get started on the construction right away because it's badly needed.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.560
Oh, well, thank you very much, Mr. Yates.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.560
That's all for now.

29:50.560 --> 29:51.560
Thank you very much.

29:57.640 --> 30:07.760
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I would like to speak to you today about a lonely

30:07.760 --> 30:11.640
man, the American consumer.

30:11.640 --> 30:18.880
It is a strange commentary on our life and times that this man should be lonely or he is

30:18.880 --> 30:21.960
the very fabric of our nation.

30:21.960 --> 30:28.680
His labor or management or professional abilities produce the goods and services of our economy

30:28.680 --> 30:30.640
on every hand.

30:30.640 --> 30:35.960
He is everywhere and still no one will listen to him.

30:35.960 --> 30:43.200
In Washington today, there is a course of many voices creating such a loud plumber that

30:43.200 --> 30:46.920
this forgotten man cannot be heard.

30:46.920 --> 30:53.200
But if he were only to look about him and join together with all those standing about him

30:53.200 --> 30:59.520
and at a given signal, shout out in unison with them, stop.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.360
We will be heard.

31:01.360 --> 31:07.160
We are the ones who must pay the prices charged for the goods and services.

31:07.160 --> 31:12.400
We are the ones whose pocketbooks grown when prices soar out of sight.

31:12.640 --> 31:20.360
Yes, we make the goods and provide the services, each in our own compartment of the economy.

31:20.360 --> 31:28.760
But when it is built or grown or done, we all are the ones who pay the prices too.

31:28.760 --> 31:35.120
This is the single loud, clear voice that must be heard if the inflation that is plaguing

31:35.120 --> 31:39.480
this country today is to be halted.

31:39.480 --> 31:45.800
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe I have opened a door through which this lonely man can direct

31:45.800 --> 31:52.340
his craft or help in the midst of the organized pressures which lean and powerfully on him

31:52.340 --> 31:54.560
from every hand.

31:54.560 --> 31:59.680
This past week I introduced a bill in the Senate which would set up a cabinet level

31:59.680 --> 32:02.480
department of consumers.

32:02.480 --> 32:08.160
This department would provide a central clearinghouse where a consumer could find the answers

32:08.160 --> 32:14.880
to his questions instead of trying to thread his way through a maze of agencies and regulatory

32:14.880 --> 32:16.600
boards.

32:16.600 --> 32:22.100
And most important of all, this bill would bring together the many unorganized voices of

32:22.100 --> 32:28.920
individual, puzzle consumers on the actions of those governmental agencies which might

32:28.920 --> 32:34.400
have an adverse effect on the value of the consumer's dollar.

32:34.400 --> 32:39.400
After the Secretary of Consumers, the voices of all of the lonely and forgotten men and

32:39.400 --> 32:46.200
women would become a course asking, what will this do to our pocketbooks?

32:46.200 --> 32:51.960
What will this do to the price of beans, of bobby pins, of cabbages, of train tickets,

32:51.960 --> 32:58.400
of gas bills, of all of the thousand and one other things a man and his wife and children

32:58.400 --> 33:01.000
must buy to live?

33:01.000 --> 33:07.200
At least 23 of my colleagues have joined me in sponsoring this bill in the Senate.

33:07.200 --> 33:11.560
I expect more to join as time goes on.

33:11.560 --> 33:17.560
They believe and I believe that this proposed department of consumer would be the beginning

33:17.560 --> 33:24.800
of a really new era in the lives of the lonely and forgotten men and women, the consumers

33:24.800 --> 33:26.880
of our nation.

33:26.880 --> 33:33.520
We know that their voices in Washington who speak for business, who speak for agriculture,

33:33.520 --> 33:39.800
who are special leaders for these groups and for labor, but there is no department and

33:39.800 --> 33:45.840
no voice that just speaks for the average person, the American consumer.

33:45.840 --> 33:51.720
Too often these other departments have become involved in fights between this railroad and

33:51.800 --> 33:58.120
that railroad like the ICC, fights between competing producer groups.

33:58.120 --> 34:04.480
What we need in this nation is someone who is going to fight and present facts and represent

34:04.480 --> 34:08.320
and take the side of the American consumer.

34:08.320 --> 34:16.320
Let us keep in mind that the government of the United States itself is the biggest consumer.

34:16.320 --> 34:20.360
That's one of the reasons why we have to pay taxes and we can't have a balanced budget

34:20.360 --> 34:25.160
very easily is that things are costing so much.

34:25.160 --> 34:30.920
And we know who these forgotten people are, the government, they are you and I, they

34:30.920 --> 34:32.160
are all of us.

34:32.160 --> 34:40.160
Thank you until this time next week.

34:40.160 --> 34:52.080
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, Congress is near the end of its Easter recess.

34:52.080 --> 34:56.240
And this would be a good time to review what the Senate has been able to do during the

34:56.240 --> 35:00.120
first three months of the 86th session.

35:00.120 --> 35:04.200
It is a have here the congressional record and it's rather remarkable that we have been

35:04.200 --> 35:10.600
able to pass the volume of legislation which has been handled within these three months.

35:10.600 --> 35:14.720
When we take into consideration the fact that on all legislation there must first be

35:14.720 --> 35:21.160
built past and then extensive committee hearings and reports filed and then debate on the

35:21.160 --> 35:26.320
floor of the Senate before a final vote is taken.

35:26.320 --> 35:30.580
Let me run down here in the congressional record some of the main things that have been

35:30.580 --> 35:36.180
accomplished here in the United States Senate during these first three months potatoes.

35:36.180 --> 35:41.420
First how how how how how why you a bill has been passed and of course I in the Senate

35:41.420 --> 35:46.800
and the House and signed by the President providing for the admission of how why you as

35:46.800 --> 35:54.200
a state in the field of housing the bill provides for a two and seven tenths mid a billion

35:54.200 --> 36:02.400
housing program over a six year period emphasizing low cost housing urban renewal and a more

36:02.400 --> 36:06.640
realistic building program for the elderly.

36:06.640 --> 36:13.440
The extension of the draft the draft has been extended for four years or until July 1st

36:13.440 --> 36:22.520
1963 the induction provisions of universal military training and authority to draft physicians

36:22.520 --> 36:30.480
and dentists in a essay a bill has been passed to authorize a supplemental appropriation of

36:30.480 --> 36:37.080
forty eight million dollars for the national aeronautics and space administration for salaries

36:37.080 --> 36:43.720
and expenses research and development particularly earmarked and almost entirely for project project

36:43.720 --> 36:55.640
mercury project mercury as you all know is the project to put a man in space in orbit in space

36:55.640 --> 37:01.080
this is very very important who is going to control space whether we're going to have our

37:01.080 --> 37:07.000
say about it and this is one of the most important projects have been considered airports

37:07.000 --> 37:14.120
authorized four hundred and sixty five million dollars over a four year period in the federal aid

37:14.120 --> 37:19.800
for airport construction and I think there are a few bills that there's been more interest in

37:19.800 --> 37:25.520
Tennessee than has in this large airport construction program.

37:25.520 --> 37:32.120
World Bank the bill increased the resources of the international monetary fund by fifty percent

37:32.120 --> 37:37.360
the capital of the international bank by one hundred and ten percent.

37:37.360 --> 37:44.720
Clayton act amended the Clayton act so as to fill a enforcement void which has existed for years by

37:44.720 --> 37:50.440
making final the decrees and the findings or rather the orders of the federal trade commission

37:50.440 --> 37:53.600
and other regulatory agencies.

37:53.600 --> 37:59.000
This is incidentally was a bill that came from our monopoly and antitrust subcommittee of which

37:59.000 --> 38:03.880
I have the privilege of being chairman and we got it we were very fortunate to get it passed

38:03.880 --> 38:08.200
in the Senate and I think it will be passed in the House of Representatives.

38:08.200 --> 38:14.960
It was a bill also recommended by the president in his economic report to the to the Congress.

38:14.960 --> 38:20.600
Distressed areas authorized a new federal program with an initial authorization of three

38:20.600 --> 38:26.960
hundred and eighty nine million dollars aimed at alleviating unemployment and under development

38:26.960 --> 38:28.840
and distressed areas.

38:28.840 --> 38:33.520
It was a great deal of interest from some areas in Tennessee and this legislation and many

38:33.520 --> 38:39.520
witnesses from Tennessee came to Washington to test to support it in hearings before the

38:39.520 --> 38:41.360
committee.

38:41.360 --> 38:46.740
Economic provides a two hundred thousand dollars for the joint committee to use in making an

38:46.740 --> 38:52.680
economic inventory of the United States and particularly a study about inflation.

38:52.680 --> 38:57.800
When we passed a bill in the Senate extending the unemployment compensation until the first

38:57.800 --> 39:02.760
of July then of course there are other bills that have just been reported by committees such

39:02.760 --> 39:05.360
as a labor bill.

39:05.360 --> 39:10.280
Everybody feels that some worthwhile and good legislation must be passed in racketeering

39:10.280 --> 39:11.720
and labor.

39:11.720 --> 39:17.320
So we'll have a very busy time on this and other legislation immediately after the Easter

39:17.320 --> 39:18.960
resets.

39:18.960 --> 39:23.360
Until next week thank you very much.

39:23.360 --> 39:36.280
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the Middle Eastern crises continue to be

39:36.280 --> 39:39.280
the top of the news here in Washington this week.

39:39.280 --> 39:43.880
They debate over the President's resolution move from committee to the floor of the Senate.

39:43.880 --> 39:48.000
Every while committee hearings continued on an offshoot of the same problem.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.640
The difficulty is created in the world oil supply by closure of the Suez Canal followed

39:53.640 --> 39:59.160
by the increase in prices for oil and gasoline in this country and all over the world.

39:59.160 --> 40:03.440
For taking precedence this week over both the President's resolution and the oil and gasoline

40:03.440 --> 40:09.040
prices was the continuing diplomatic backlash which took place over the question of Israeli

40:09.040 --> 40:13.080
troops in the Gaza Strip and in the Gulf of Aqaba.

40:13.080 --> 40:17.520
And here I think a word of background to the news is essential to an understanding of

40:17.520 --> 40:22.040
the headlines that have been flashed out of Washington, Cairo, New York and Tel Aviv

40:22.040 --> 40:24.320
on this issue during this week.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.680
Here is a map of the Middle East.

40:26.680 --> 40:33.320
Here is the Suez Canal which has been closed Israeli shipping and now closed all shipping

40:33.320 --> 40:34.320
controlled by massor.

40:34.320 --> 40:40.600
Here is the Gaza Strip which Israeli troops took which is in the controversy.

40:40.600 --> 40:45.400
Here is the Gulf of Aqaba which is controlled by Egyptian forces here on the streets of

40:45.400 --> 40:46.400
Iran.

40:46.400 --> 40:50.400
Israel has a little port down here on the Gulf of Aqaba.

40:50.400 --> 40:54.800
Israel as you know maintains that the Gaza Strip has been used by Egypt for border raids

40:54.800 --> 40:56.300
into Israel.

40:56.300 --> 41:00.720
It also points truthfully to the fact that Israeli shipping has been blocked.

41:00.720 --> 41:05.880
It wants assurances that its ships will not be blocked in the Suez or in the Gulf of Aqaba

41:05.880 --> 41:10.160
and that raids will not again be staged from the Gaza Strip before it withdraws its troops

41:10.880 --> 41:14.040
from Gaza and from the mouth of the Gulf.

41:14.040 --> 41:18.360
On the other hand the United Nations has passed a resolution that everything has to be

41:18.360 --> 41:23.200
returned to the status it was before the attack, before any assurances like that can be

41:23.200 --> 41:28.840
given and Egypt is dragging its feet on clearing the canal until the troops are removed.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.760
Now what happens in a situation like this?

41:31.760 --> 41:36.440
What usually happens is that all the parties interested are trying to bring as much pressure

41:36.520 --> 41:41.400
as they can for the best kind of arrangement they can work out for themselves, start conducting

41:41.400 --> 41:43.560
their diplomacy in public.

41:43.560 --> 41:48.080
They say what they do for propaganda effect in Washington, Tel Aviv, Cairo and the other

41:48.080 --> 41:50.120
capitals of the world.

41:50.120 --> 41:54.200
And the crises began sometimes to look worse than it actually is.

41:54.200 --> 41:58.400
Thus this week you began to hear talk of sanctions being applied to Israel.

41:58.400 --> 42:02.640
This talk originated in the United Nations and in the State Department here in Washington.

42:03.040 --> 42:09.120
Now personally don't think that we're going to apply sanctions that at this time are in

42:09.120 --> 42:10.960
the foreseeable future.

42:10.960 --> 42:15.720
As matters now stand I do not feel that Congress would go along with it, certainly I would.

42:15.720 --> 42:20.000
I don't see how a case can be made out of sanctions against Israel unless sanctions were

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
also applied to the others.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.200
We have to fight the United Nations such as Russia, Egypt and India.

42:26.200 --> 42:31.000
You can't have one set of rules for the strong and another set for the week.

42:31.000 --> 42:38.200
I suspect that the Israeli embassy may know that sanctions are not likely to be applied.

42:38.200 --> 42:42.320
But it's a way that the State Department took to publicly apply pressure to Israel to

42:42.320 --> 42:44.360
withdraw its troops.

42:44.360 --> 42:49.680
Conversely therefore it puts some moral responsibility it seems to me on the State Department.

42:49.680 --> 42:54.600
To use the influence of the United States to get United Nations guarantees of neutralization

42:54.600 --> 43:00.840
of the Gaza Strip and free passage through the Gulf and through the Suez Canal.

43:00.840 --> 43:05.920
This also serves to emphasize one of my principal criticisms of the Middle East resolution

43:05.920 --> 43:07.480
as is now written.

43:07.480 --> 43:10.600
It doesn't touch the basic problems of the whole Middle East.

43:10.600 --> 43:15.680
If Israel does withdraw its troops the basic problems will remain unsolved.

43:15.680 --> 43:20.000
These problems are the internationalization of the Suez Canal and the guarantee of free

43:20.000 --> 43:25.440
passage through the Canal and through the Gulf of Aqibah and the prevention of further fighting

43:25.440 --> 43:27.280
from the Gaza Strip.

43:27.280 --> 43:31.160
The relationship between Israel and her Arab neighbors which has been the subject of the

43:31.160 --> 43:36.480
headlines this week isn't a communist and non-communist problem at all.

43:36.480 --> 43:41.000
And therefore the so-called Middle East doctrine doesn't touch this basic threat to peace

43:41.000 --> 43:43.040
in the Middle East in any way.

43:43.040 --> 43:47.120
So that this is some of the background of the news that you will be hearing from Washington.

43:47.120 --> 43:52.520
The debate in the United States Senate will of course point out these issues and undoubtedly

43:52.520 --> 43:57.480
some amendments may be offered to the Middle East resolution which will be specifically

43:57.480 --> 43:59.800
where the problems had upset that region.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.360
I hope that some amendments to that effect are adopted.

44:02.360 --> 44:06.440
If they're not I don't think the Middle East resolution will be much good.

44:06.440 --> 44:07.440
That's all for now.

44:07.440 --> 44:07.960
Thank you very much.
