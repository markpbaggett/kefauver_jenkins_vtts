00:00.000 --> 00:23.240
Listen carefully. What you will hear now is the voice of a 14-year-old boy who already

00:23.240 --> 00:53.000
has tasted more violence than most people do in a lifetime.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.440
The boy is talking about his father. The man facing you can listen to this sort of thing

00:58.440 --> 01:04.040
without burning a hair. He's a counselor at a Los Angeles County Forestry Camp for

01:04.040 --> 01:10.440
boys who've gotten in trouble. Boys like this 14-year-old who talks almost casually of

01:10.440 --> 01:16.640
drunkenness and stabbing. You'll hear this kid's own story. You'll see how the forestry

01:16.640 --> 01:22.160
camp officials are trying to set him straight. And you'll visit San Quentin. For the story

01:22.160 --> 01:29.580
of this man, Carol Chessman, who began as a juvenile offender and ended up on Death

01:29.580 --> 01:45.200
Road. All this on program 2 of Focus on Delinquency. A special report from the KNXT Department

01:45.200 --> 01:56.240
of Public Affairs. The story begins at Juvenile Hall. Last week, you saw how the hall works.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.680
But to get the flavor of the place, you have to talk with the kids as I did on a bench

02:00.680 --> 02:27.920
beside the football field.

02:27.920 --> 02:36.440
Your folks know your drink? Yes, sir. Don't they mine? Well, I live with my stepdad and

02:36.440 --> 02:45.120
my mom. I don't like stepping and he doesn't like me. Well, what sort of trouble is it,

02:45.120 --> 02:52.240
is it? Oh, the whole trouble. Mostly home trouble. Yeah, your family. It's pretty messed up.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.560
How come? I was probably my fault and then the end of the end of the fall.

02:56.560 --> 03:03.200
Mother and father divorced, didn't they? How long you in court? Well, I went to

03:03.200 --> 03:08.600
queer studenters and set up a camp program for me. How long are you going to be there? Well,

03:08.600 --> 03:14.640
approximately from six, six months to nine. Going back to school and you get out? Yes, sir.

03:14.640 --> 03:20.280
What do you think you'll do when you get out of school? How many ideas? Well, I'll try

03:20.280 --> 03:26.760
not to get any more trouble for one thing. You got a girlfriend outside? Yes, I do a lot of

03:26.760 --> 03:32.040
thinking about her myself, you know. What does she think about all this, you know? Well, I don't know.

03:32.040 --> 03:38.240
She's also ashamed of me. Because she's mostly she, you know, I always tell her what

03:38.240 --> 03:44.480
happened. So, you know, usually when I got in trouble, I'll tell her and then she told me to

03:44.480 --> 03:50.600
go out of my wife's up and go straight, you know. And I told her, yes, I would. I'd just turn

03:50.600 --> 03:56.760
around and, you know, do the worst again. What do you think ought to be done about it to prevent

03:56.760 --> 04:04.000
that sort of trouble? Well, they say there were more things for the kids to do. It would keep

04:04.000 --> 04:13.760
them out of trouble. What do I think they get in here for? Well, it's not. On the mid-lust

04:13.760 --> 04:19.360
times, there's an air fall because sometimes they lose up. You know, see, like they say,

04:19.360 --> 04:23.200
their father and mother don't pay much attention to them. They don't get all the love they're

04:23.200 --> 04:30.040
supposed to get in. Last week, we picked up the composite case of a young

04:30.040 --> 04:36.200
car thief named Eddie Smith. The names and facts are scrambled because California law for

04:36.200 --> 04:41.800
bids identification of juveniles in matters like these. But there are no actors in this

04:41.800 --> 04:47.560
story. The people and the problems are real. And Eddie's problem is especially real for him,

04:47.560 --> 04:53.440
as he returns to court to hear the verdict of Judge William B. McCus. The boy has spent two

04:53.440 --> 04:58.960
weeks in juvenile hall while the authorities investigated his home, his family, and his trouble

04:58.960 --> 05:05.120
with the law. The probation report recommends that Eddie be sent to a county forestry camp. As he

05:05.120 --> 05:10.620
usually does, Judge McCus and follows that recommendation and he makes it an order.

05:10.620 --> 05:22.360
Eddie does go to a forestry camp, away from the neighborhood and friends and environment

05:22.360 --> 05:27.760
that up to now have worked against him. And incidentally, away from the parents who tried

05:27.760 --> 05:33.920
to make things work, but just didn't try hard enough or didn't know. So now, in the case

05:33.920 --> 05:39.640
of Eddie Smith, the law takes over. But let's listen, as the case of Eddie in juvenile court

05:39.640 --> 05:45.800
comes to a conclusion. Stand on your own feet and understand that your conduct

05:45.800 --> 05:51.040
had to be different in order to stay out of trouble. You may have just gone along because

05:51.040 --> 05:57.760
the rest of the guys did it. I think that you would benefit from the opportunity our forestry

05:57.760 --> 06:02.840
camp program, which we have available here for boys in Los Angeles County. We have five

06:02.840 --> 06:08.400
since camps, Mr. Smith. Two of them are what we call our school cast because they're for

06:08.400 --> 06:13.800
boys under 16 where they have full-time day school. The other three are for the boys over

06:13.800 --> 06:19.000
16 where the boys work eight hours a day for the county forestry and fire warden building

06:19.000 --> 06:22.560
fire trails and fighting forest fires and work of that kind.

06:22.560 --> 06:30.560
Now, Eddie, you are under 16 and you're therefore under the compulsory school age in this

06:30.560 --> 06:35.560
state and will be placed in a school camp or you'll go to regular day school. You'll

06:35.560 --> 06:40.640
get credit for this work when you come back into your own school. We don't send the boys

06:40.640 --> 06:46.040
to camp for a fixed length of time, Eddie. Depends on you. Kind of a record you make for

06:46.040 --> 06:51.920
yourself. Our program, of course, divided in the various stages and as you progress through

06:51.920 --> 06:58.800
the various stages, you may do it rapidly and it may take longer. But the kind of record

06:58.800 --> 07:05.400
you make is up to you. You're not sentenced to fixed length of time. That's what I want

07:05.400 --> 07:12.960
to impress upon you and therefore the opportunity is yours by making a good record to shorten

07:12.960 --> 07:19.280
your stay or by making a bad record that it's necessary for you to stay longer.

07:19.280 --> 07:25.000
It's official now. Eddie is legally a ward of the juvenile court of Los Angeles County.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.960
But the important thing to the boy is that he's leaving juvenile hall. No more steel

07:29.960 --> 07:36.120
screens on the windows. No more walls and gates and doors locked against escape. Judge

07:36.120 --> 07:48.520
McKesson has, in effect, decided that Eddie needs a fresh start in fresh new surroundings.

07:48.520 --> 07:54.200
This is one of five forestry camps operated by the county. Back in a secluded canyon,

07:54.200 --> 07:59.200
it's still close enough to get an occasional heavy dose of Los Angeles smog. But even

07:59.200 --> 08:04.840
so, for many of these boys, it's the cleanest air they've ever breathed. The newcomers

08:04.840 --> 08:10.160
are met by a staff member who takes their old clothes. They get a complete outfitting,

08:10.160 --> 08:17.480
denims and work shoes. No fancy teenage styles, but it's just right for outdoor living.

08:17.480 --> 08:22.840
If he never did before, a boy learns to take care of his own clothes. Then the old hands

08:22.840 --> 08:29.680
take the new ones to the dormitory. It's spotlessly clean. The boys do their own housework.

08:29.680 --> 08:39.120
Each has something precious, a rosary, a picture, a guitar, the flag, a crucifix, or an award

08:39.120 --> 08:49.560
perhaps for sports or citizenship. There is full-time schooling here. Many boys who never

08:49.560 --> 08:55.160
took to it before suddenly learn to read and write for the first time. True and C is an

08:55.160 --> 09:01.520
early symptom for many delinquents, and of course, there's none of that here. But it's

09:01.520 --> 09:08.200
not all work and no play. The camp setting is Southern California at its best, beautiful

09:08.200 --> 09:15.840
wooded mountains. The program includes swimming as a reward for good work and good behavior.

09:15.840 --> 09:26.720
It looks like the old swimming hall of a gentler time, and it certainly is invited.

09:26.720 --> 09:32.640
The boys earn their fun. It's their camp. It's up to them to keep it in shape. Responsibility

09:32.640 --> 09:38.080
is a good teacher, and every boy has certain duties he must perform. And you might guess

09:38.080 --> 09:44.000
that in this age group, kitchen duty is the most popular of all. Hungry boys surrounded

09:44.000 --> 09:51.120
by food. The self-reliance idea is carried out in craft classes like woodshop. A boy learns

09:51.120 --> 09:56.080
enough to help him get a job when he leaves, and in the mean time he makes things for himself

09:56.080 --> 10:02.440
and for the camp. The dining hall groups have taken the names of Indian tribes. The signs

10:02.440 --> 10:17.720
are made by the boys themselves. A pointed reminder goes straight. And another reminder of

10:17.720 --> 10:26.920
the right way to live. Not a fence or wall or gate anywhere, and after touring the camp,

10:26.920 --> 10:32.360
I talked with the director, Mr. Eugene Cox, a career man in the probation department.

10:32.360 --> 10:39.800
The boys who run away, why do you think they do it? Several boys that run away, in fact,

10:39.800 --> 10:45.160
quite a percentage, run away simply because they don't have enough stability to face this

10:45.160 --> 10:52.760
type of a challenge in a way. They are able to run away, and they know that we do not

10:52.760 --> 11:00.520
chase them, and since they are somewhat lacking in making good choices, some boys are run away simply

11:00.520 --> 11:06.520
because they can't help it. Other boys will run away because the liberty and the freedom here

11:06.520 --> 11:12.280
is simply too threatening for them and they can't face it. So they will use the usual routine

11:12.280 --> 11:18.120
of running away. The challenge is to speak up, by assuming the very freedom of the camp itself.

11:18.520 --> 11:24.440
Yes, and we try to use that as effectively as possible, given that each boy is much responsibility,

11:24.440 --> 11:30.120
as we think he is able to handle within the program. This, of course, is the responsibility

11:30.120 --> 11:34.680
degree is very slight with new boys and increases gradually as the boy becomes older.

11:34.680 --> 11:38.920
So what are you trying to do with them? By giving them an all-responsibility.

11:38.920 --> 11:45.320
We realize that most boys return to the same community that they leave, and we know that if we,

11:45.320 --> 11:52.520
in some way, can't alter them and improve their basic abilities, the handle of social situations,

11:52.520 --> 11:58.520
that they will become a domain claim again. So by giving them as much responsibility,

11:58.520 --> 12:06.360
social acceptance, and maturity, and equal strength as we can, then we are doing what we know how to do

12:06.360 --> 12:10.520
to enable them to have a better opportunity to behave when they return home.

12:11.480 --> 12:17.880
Cox refers to his camp as around the clock treatment center, not punishment, but treatment.

12:17.880 --> 12:23.720
Perhaps the most important part is the counseling, getting the boy to talk about his home and his

12:23.720 --> 12:31.640
trouble and himself. Again and again, the boys tell of broken homes, the same story with 100 variations.

12:32.280 --> 12:38.280
Judge McKesson tells us that two-thirds of all the boys he sees in court have broken homes behind

12:38.280 --> 12:45.720
them, broken by divorce, desertion, or cold indifference. The staff members who do the counseling

12:45.720 --> 12:52.200
are specially trained, highly skilled at drawing out the youngsters. The boys are looked on not as

12:52.200 --> 12:58.520
prisoners, but patients. The counselor is not a policeman, but more a father-confesser with

12:58.520 --> 13:04.600
training in psychology. It's the counselor's job to understand the boy and help him understand

13:04.840 --> 13:11.160
himself. To get him to talk out his troubles, instead of acting them out, in deeds of violence.

13:11.160 --> 13:17.320
You looked in on this counseling session a few minutes ago. The boy is 14 years old, intelligent,

13:17.320 --> 13:23.240
and good looking. Remember, we had to cut names and places to protect the boy's identity.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.880
This is his story in his own words.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.600
Finally school started and I started it off. School started your problems?

13:30.600 --> 13:35.320
I was the most of them. During the summer time I used to get drunk now and then have a fight.

13:36.040 --> 13:41.560
I didn't do too much damage, but then school started and I met new people, new guys, new girls,

13:42.280 --> 13:49.320
more fun. Friday nights we'd go to show you something. By the way, I'd get a little plaster

13:49.320 --> 13:53.720
to something. I get mad at the other guy because he tried to throw my friend out of something and I jump

13:53.720 --> 13:58.040
up and start fighting with him. One night I finally got a little too high.

13:58.040 --> 14:05.960
It was about four months ago. No, not four. More than that. It was about 10 actually.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.400
I walked into movie theater with a couple of the guys I went on with and other little drunk and

14:12.120 --> 14:15.400
walked in and sat down and he tried to throw out some of the guys.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.040
He said, I just got up and I told him, I was 18 years old and they were with me.

14:20.040 --> 14:26.600
He said, they still got to go. He said, well, you ain't got to throw him out or else.

14:26.600 --> 14:32.840
If you throw him out, you're going to get it. He said to me, you think you can do it.

14:32.840 --> 14:38.280
I said, I don't think I know. So I jumped again and I started swinging with him and everything

14:38.280 --> 14:42.600
and he would have fast-lighted. I pulled out a push button.

14:42.600 --> 14:48.680
Push button, knife, yeah. Got him in the leg. Didn't damage him too much, but I got him in the leg.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.600
How do you mean you didn't damage him too much? Just kind of sliced him.

14:54.120 --> 14:59.160
I didn't go in. I just cut him. There's a difference between sliced him and cut him in a

14:59.160 --> 15:06.440
measure. Jab him. You slash him and you just cut across. You get, well, not too deep of a cut,

15:06.440 --> 15:09.880
you know? Well, I've been a talk about it. It's kind of funny.

15:11.320 --> 15:16.040
Well, right now I just feel it, if it comes to stab him, I wouldn't stab anybody again.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.080
That wasn't one of the things that the police brought you in for. Is that right?

15:19.720 --> 15:24.600
You were in on numerous occasions, is that right? Yes, drunk charges and stuff like that.

15:24.600 --> 15:29.640
My father actually took me in. Your father actually took you in? How do you mean?

15:30.280 --> 15:33.560
Well, my father, well, he don't drink and he don't smoke and stuff, see?

15:34.520 --> 15:39.240
And so I'm one of the, well, out of my whole family, I'm the only one, me and my cousin

15:39.240 --> 15:44.920
about the only ones that have been arrested, smoking, drank, see? And you only lived with your father

15:44.920 --> 15:48.200
a short time about a year or something. Yeah, about a year or two once.

15:49.240 --> 15:54.280
And well, my father's kind of strict on it, saying, you don't like it. So I used to do it anyway.

15:54.280 --> 15:58.440
I didn't care. It was not a business, it was mine. Since he never did anything for me,

15:58.440 --> 16:02.600
I think, what should I do something for him? When he hadn't taken care of you, felt you owed him

16:02.600 --> 16:07.000
nothing and you didn't expect him to give you anything in return, is that right? That's true.

16:07.880 --> 16:11.800
Well, after a while, it kind of got to be a habit. I was hanging around with a bunch of

16:12.520 --> 16:18.040
hoodlums out here. We got together every night, you know, or something. The God messed up,

16:18.040 --> 16:22.520
through God was canned on people's porches and you know messed up, disturbed the peace, you know?

16:24.120 --> 16:29.240
Something to bother somebody. Yeah, felt the need to bother someone. Well, we couldn't just settle down,

16:29.240 --> 16:33.960
we couldn't stay still. We always had to be doing something. Kind of restless, nervous.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.680
I said, no, he's got to be on a move. He can't stay in one spot tomorrow.

16:37.640 --> 16:41.160
Well, like, you know, when I was a girl at that one, we went to a dance church, you know,

16:41.160 --> 16:45.560
church, you know, a little deals, you know? So we went up there enough. So I got home about five

16:45.560 --> 16:50.040
after ten. I started writing out this voluntary report of mine. To the police. Yes,

16:50.040 --> 16:53.160
for the old man, it's mad about it, you know? He said, let me read it. I said, there was

16:53.160 --> 16:56.840
none of his business. So he said, what'd you say? And I said, you heard me and he hit me in the back

16:56.840 --> 17:01.400
in the neck. I got mad about, and I jumped up and I told him, all right, you want to do it that way,

17:01.400 --> 17:05.880
let's get out with it. I hit him. So when I need to pull out his belt, he started to hit me with a

17:05.880 --> 17:10.680
bug buckle and I got mad about it. I told him, let me, like a man, like a coward. He wouldn't. So

17:10.680 --> 17:14.760
he turned around the walk away and I jumped him. And I had him in the corner where I was kicking him

17:14.760 --> 17:18.600
with a punch and I did everything. Finally, he just landed what good when that was it. I was out.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.120
So finally, call the cops about a little bit like he woke me up, you know?

17:23.400 --> 17:28.120
I fell asleep and went, everything. Just, you know how it is? Just see how I saw him.

17:28.120 --> 17:31.800
I brought you the juvenile hall and that's where he placed you.

17:32.760 --> 17:37.960
You learn a lot from these kids, like the difference between slicing and stabbing.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.880
That boy was a newcomer to camp in there only a couple of weeks, but already he's talking

17:43.880 --> 17:50.120
easily, working hard in school, and for the first time in his life, he's found a place. He's

17:50.120 --> 17:55.800
fitting in. The counselors think it's a good bet he'll make the grade. Now we'll listen in on

17:55.800 --> 18:01.240
another boy who's been around longer. He's stopped talking about the violence and hatred that got him

18:01.240 --> 18:07.800
in trouble. He's beginning to understand himself and his home, though for these boys, home is a

18:07.800 --> 18:16.680
word that has strange meanings. Before I got in trouble, I used to go home and I used to sit there,

18:16.680 --> 18:22.760
and I want to tell my mother, things would happen, you know? But I used to sit down there, she just

18:22.760 --> 18:29.480
used to look at me and tell me, well, you don't want to talk to me. You just, you know, you just want

18:29.480 --> 18:36.040
to be funny, you know? And I never got to ever say anything to my mother. I really wanted to get

18:36.040 --> 18:42.280
down to her. I used to call her mother because, well, I just heard that. You know, I mean, she was my

18:42.280 --> 18:46.440
mother. That's the only reason. I mean, I didn't have no feeling in storage as anybody, as I would

18:46.440 --> 18:52.200
anybody else. I mean, I don't know how she feel about me. She says she makes me and all that.

18:53.000 --> 19:01.160
She says I'm her son, but still, I mean, I never had much feeling, you know, and my home, I mean,

19:01.160 --> 19:06.360
I can't remember what my mother used to, you know, picking me up and putting her out from me and

19:06.360 --> 19:12.280
seeing I was her son because when they used to go out, then they never asked me if I wanted to go

19:12.280 --> 19:17.000
with them or anything. I mean, I mean, even if they did, probably I wouldn't want to do it anyway,

19:17.400 --> 19:23.080
you know? Because, I mean, every time I used to be home, I just wanted to get out of the house. I couldn't,

19:23.800 --> 19:28.600
I couldn't stand being there, you know? I didn't like to be home with them when they were in the house.

19:28.600 --> 19:35.160
I used to get up and walk by myself because my mother, well, I don't know, she just,

19:36.360 --> 19:40.600
I guess she wasn't used to it either, like I'm not used to it, you know? Yeah. But maybe that

19:40.600 --> 19:47.640
isn't the reason, but still, I mean, other people used to come to the house and she used to tell me,

19:47.640 --> 19:52.120
she used to how that meant everything when other people was there, you know? So, they were said,

19:52.120 --> 19:56.040
so then when people used to be there, you used to leave the house, you know?

19:56.760 --> 20:04.360
Oh, my father, I mean, I only see him, you know, a couple of times. I used to see him, I only

20:04.360 --> 20:11.560
called him a father because, well, you know, the people see you're fathering. I don't know, well,

20:11.560 --> 20:17.320
my father sees me, he acts nice to everything, but still, I mean, you can see them when he

20:17.320 --> 20:23.000
does, he's just trying to get back at my mother, you know? He's trying to get back at my mother

20:23.000 --> 20:28.280
through me, you know, not that he likes me or anything, they're each trying to, you know, fight, fight,

20:28.280 --> 20:33.080
fight, fight, they got me as a weapon, you know? The mother doesn't want me to see my father,

20:33.880 --> 20:38.920
my father wants me to come and do it, it's not because he likes me, but try and get back at each other,

20:38.920 --> 20:45.080
you know? So, have you in between now? Yeah, because I mean, I mean, I could be wrong, you know?

20:45.080 --> 20:51.080
But I mean, I think I should know more than anybody else, you know? But how much good does it do?

20:51.080 --> 20:58.040
How many of these boys leave camp? Never again to tangle with the law. The camp director, Mr. Cox,

20:58.040 --> 21:05.000
puts his success record between 70 and 80 percent. And at juvenile hall, when I asked the same

21:05.000 --> 21:10.520
question about success or failure, I got this answer from Mr. Clarence Cabell, the chief boys

21:10.520 --> 21:15.240
counselor. The talkers though a lot of them do make good, but how about those who don't? What

21:15.240 --> 21:22.520
happens to them? Well, unfortunately, we have occasion to go to the different institutions in

21:22.520 --> 21:29.560
the California and the honor farm and what I would consider the end of the live San Quentin,

21:30.680 --> 21:35.960
and the majority of the boys that end up in San Quentin have been boys that have repeated

21:35.960 --> 21:40.600
here so many times that we have told them that they're going to San Quentin if they didn't straighten

21:40.600 --> 21:47.080
up. And occasionally they walk up to you in institutions such as San Quentin and say, well,

21:47.080 --> 21:53.800
you told me so. So it's a pretty saddening thing to me to see them there, but although you have a

21:53.800 --> 22:00.840
feeling they're going to go years before it happens. There's one who made it in a hurry. Carol Chessman,

22:00.840 --> 22:07.320
the most notorious criminal since John Dillinger, the most publicized prison author of this century.

22:07.320 --> 22:15.080
And for his story, from his own lips, we went next to San Quentin. It's on a cold, windy arm of the

22:15.080 --> 22:22.520
Bay north of San Francisco. It's the biggest prison in California, 5,000 inmates. This is the

22:22.520 --> 22:27.880
big yard, every square inch of it under constant watch by the armed men on the gun walks.

22:31.080 --> 22:37.640
And this is death row, the small barred windows at the top of the North Salt Block.

22:37.640 --> 22:44.120
Chessman and 17 others are up there waiting to die. The size of the place is staggering,

22:44.120 --> 22:49.720
but it's not nearly big enough so they're doubling up two men to a cell. There are four blocks

22:49.720 --> 22:57.640
like this, hundreds of cells in each, five tiers high, a tremendous place with an odor that seems

22:57.640 --> 23:04.600
to linger on even after you leave. I toured the prison with the director of the State Department of

23:04.600 --> 23:14.040
Corrections, Richard McGee on the left and San Quentin's Warden Harley O'Teats. McGee and Warden

23:14.040 --> 23:21.480
Teats. They showed me Chessman's record. It's a long record, page after page of hand-lettered

23:21.480 --> 23:28.920
notations, dates, offenses, execution dates and delays. The record shows that Chessman once was a

23:28.920 --> 23:34.200
troublemaker in prison, fights with other cons and that sort of thing. But since he began writing

23:34.200 --> 23:39.240
nearly four years ago, he's had no trouble at all. He's fought only with the legal authorities

23:39.240 --> 23:51.320
of the State of California, fighting to save his life. The date 1941 was the first time he made

23:51.320 --> 24:00.120
San Quentin. He was 20 years old. After going through Chessman's record, there was one more stop

24:00.120 --> 24:07.880
before meeting the man himself. It was the little room that Chessman so far has avoided. The cell

24:07.960 --> 24:14.040
where condemned prisoners spend the last night and the gas chamber where the State has taken the lives

24:14.040 --> 24:23.960
of 182 persons. It made me sick to my stomach and I needed the cold blast of air from the bay that

24:23.960 --> 24:30.920
hit us when we left. I'd seen what Chessman is fighting, now I'd meet him and hear what he has to say.

24:31.640 --> 24:36.600
The visiting room was crowded but condemned men received their visitors over in the corner,

24:36.600 --> 24:43.080
a dim barred alcove where no cameras are allowed, no cameras and no recording.

24:50.840 --> 24:59.640
I'd read Chessman's books, sell two four five five death row, and trial by ordeal. I'd read his

24:59.640 --> 25:06.200
books and I'd read his record. I talked with him for a full hour, then they took him back to death row.

25:06.200 --> 25:10.920
While it was still fresh in my mind, I went over my notes of what he was like and what he'd said.

25:12.920 --> 25:19.400
I've just come from seeing Carol Chessman. Here in the high security visiting cell at San Quentin.

25:21.400 --> 25:25.160
Maybe you wonder why we're bringing him into this series on juvenile crime.

25:26.600 --> 25:32.440
But you have to remember, that Chessman went the whole route. He started out with the juvenile

25:32.440 --> 25:37.640
camps and schools and he's gone through most of them in the state. And now he's at the final end

25:37.640 --> 25:44.840
of the line, death row at San Quentin, waiting for the gas chamber. And when I told Chessman what we

25:44.840 --> 25:50.120
were doing on this series, he at first didn't seem interested. He wanted to know if it had

25:50.120 --> 25:55.000
been doing good for the kids who needed help. And I told him that we're going to show this series

25:55.000 --> 26:00.760
in all the juvenile halls and forestry camps in the state. And then he said he'd be willing to talk

26:00.760 --> 26:08.440
to us. He said the first thing to do, and handling kids who get in trouble, is to make the youngsters

26:08.440 --> 26:14.520
feel that they want to be on the right side. But they should be instead of just making it a game of

26:14.520 --> 26:21.080
cops and robbers. Chessman says that's what it was too often with him when he was a kid. Chessman said,

26:21.960 --> 26:27.000
youngsters have trouble adjusting to any authority. And when the authority figure that's presented

26:27.000 --> 26:33.240
to them is presented as an enemy, and there's bound to be an explosion of some kind. He says what we

26:33.240 --> 26:38.360
have to do is find what's right with youngsters, instead of telling them over and over what's wrong.

26:39.800 --> 26:44.440
I told him I couldn't help but feel that he was so detached in talking about himself and his

26:44.440 --> 26:50.040
predicament. It was almost clinical as though we were looking at the whole thing from somewhere on

26:50.040 --> 26:55.000
the outside. And Chessman's reply was that he had to take that attitude in self-defense.

26:55.640 --> 27:01.400
It was either become detached or end up in Mendocino, for hospital for the criminally insane.

27:02.200 --> 27:09.160
And what a Chessman seemed even more detached and unreal is that heavy steel screen mesh that they

27:09.160 --> 27:14.200
put between you and the prisoner you're visiting. It's kind of hard to see through the light

27:14.200 --> 27:20.360
bounces off and hard to keep your eyes in focus. And again and again I found myself listening to a

27:20.360 --> 27:26.440
voice that seemed to have nobody. I kept trying to get him back to the point of what he'd have to say

27:26.440 --> 27:31.720
to kids. He says that a lot of them are going through just what he did except that there are many

27:31.720 --> 27:37.640
more of them now. And he tells them this. He says get out of it now. It's a dirty business.

27:38.200 --> 27:45.240
There's no glamour, said Chessman, in seven years on death row. He said capsules have brought

27:45.240 --> 27:51.400
her dangerous. And when he was young and he'd heard from guys who had had it at San Quentin or at

27:51.400 --> 27:57.800
Folsom, he felt that the prison people had broken the will of the men he knew, that they'd broken

27:57.800 --> 28:04.280
them completely. And when they told Chessman and the other kids to lay off and to get out, Chessman

28:04.280 --> 28:11.560
laughed at them. But now he says tell the kids what it takes guts to go straight to. It takes a lot

28:11.560 --> 28:18.760
more guts to get out of it and to stay in it. That's the way it looks to him now looking back

28:18.760 --> 28:25.240
over the years from his cell in San Quentin. But Chessman says he wants to make it clear that he

28:25.240 --> 28:29.960
doesn't think he's a smart ally. And that he doesn't think he's a hero that any kid ought to be looking

28:29.960 --> 28:36.120
up to. He says to tell the kids that he knows he's not smart. And he knows he's probably the dumbest

28:36.120 --> 28:45.640
smart guy who ever went to cue. Chessman says finally that for every kid who looks as though he's

28:45.640 --> 28:51.560
going over the edge there ought to be a challenge or a responsibility given to him. Something to do

28:51.560 --> 28:57.560
instead of something to be taken away from him. So all of them he says wants something. It's up to

28:57.560 --> 29:00.120
us to find out what it is and provide it.

29:06.680 --> 29:12.440
Kids in trouble. We've seen a lot of them and we've heard their stories. Next week the juvenile

29:12.440 --> 29:25.720
problem as it looks to the police officers, judges and churchmen of our community.

29:27.560 --> 29:43.000
This has been a KNXT television production.
