00:00.000 --> 00:16.240
Ladies and gentlemen, I have endeavour to do this campaign to try to tell you what I have

00:16.240 --> 00:20.320
done in the 15 and a half years that I have been in the House of Representatives or in

00:20.320 --> 00:22.840
the United States Senate.

00:22.840 --> 00:27.980
What I think the problems of the future are and what I expect to do if I'm continued

00:27.980 --> 00:31.740
on for a second term in the United States Senate.

00:31.740 --> 00:37.300
I have hanging on my wall in my office a famous saying from Abraham Lincoln.

00:37.300 --> 00:42.140
That is that if he spent all of his time answering the charges and misrepresentations of his

00:42.140 --> 00:46.460
bitter critics, he would never have any time for public business.

00:46.460 --> 00:54.820
But in America today and in Tennessee during this campaign, we see a trend of just making

00:54.820 --> 01:02.740
misrepresentations, unwarranted charges, falsehoods, innuendos to try to put something into

01:02.740 --> 01:08.060
someone's record that is not fair or just outright misrepresentations.

01:08.060 --> 01:12.740
That seems to be the modern way in some places of running for office and I'm sorry that in

01:12.740 --> 01:20.540
this senatorial campaign one of my opponents has resorted to that kind of tactics.

01:20.540 --> 01:26.460
So that I feel on this occasion since I've been in Congress for 15 and a half years,

01:26.460 --> 01:31.580
many people may not remember or have forgotten, many new people have come into Tennessee

01:31.580 --> 01:37.780
and I'm not familiar with the fact that practically all of these matters have been gone into

01:37.780 --> 01:44.340
in my various campaigns for the Congress of the United States or back in 1948 when I was

01:44.340 --> 01:47.500
elected to the United States Senate.

01:47.500 --> 01:52.660
So very briefly I'm going to tell the facts about each one of these matters that I can

01:52.660 --> 01:54.180
remember.

01:54.180 --> 01:57.340
We have tried to keep up with them as best we could.

01:57.340 --> 02:03.580
Of course one of my opponents shifts his ground about every day, abandoned some set of

02:03.580 --> 02:08.180
charges and goes on to a new set of charges when the explanation of the first ones catch

02:08.180 --> 02:09.180
out with him.

02:09.180 --> 02:13.060
That's a trend we have in American politics today.

02:13.060 --> 02:19.100
But if I do not discuss any charges or representations or misrepresentations that you may have

02:19.100 --> 02:25.140
heard about, I would be glad if you would write me or write our office at the Maxwell House

02:25.140 --> 02:30.140
at Nashville and the facts will be given to you just as they are.

02:30.140 --> 02:36.660
We have here 10 charges that have been made and the truth about them showing to be them

02:36.660 --> 02:38.460
to be actual misrepresentations.

02:39.460 --> 02:43.980
And maybe others we will try to keep up with them and supply the information.

02:43.980 --> 02:50.680
I want to go back to the beginning of my career in Congress and during this time I have cast

02:50.680 --> 02:57.820
thousands and thousands of votes on all kinds of controversial issues.

02:57.820 --> 03:02.660
Undoubtedly I have made many mistakes but I have always voted my convictions after getting

03:02.660 --> 03:08.300
the facts as best I could and I have used my best judgment in trying to vote for what

03:08.300 --> 03:14.940
I thought was for the welfare of the people of Tennessee and of the whole United States.

03:14.940 --> 03:20.140
The first criticism that one of my opponents has been making is that he says that I am

03:20.140 --> 03:26.820
not a friend of the veterans on the grounds that I voted against a bill for Spanish and

03:26.820 --> 03:30.100
more war veterans back in 1940.

03:31.100 --> 03:35.180
Well now I want to say in the first place that I have supported all of the great measures

03:35.180 --> 03:42.180
for the welfare of veterans that have been passed during the last 15 and a half years.

03:42.180 --> 03:47.860
Co-sponsoring such bills as a GI bill of rights, the Vocational Rehabilitation Educational

03:47.860 --> 03:53.540
Program filing on my own, the little RFC for veterans being a co-sponsor of a bill to

03:53.540 --> 03:56.500
increase compensation for veterans right now.

03:57.100 --> 04:01.860
Let's see what was involved in this so-called vote against veterans on the grounds that

04:01.860 --> 04:08.500
I didn't support a bonus or a pension for Spanish and more American war veterans.

04:08.500 --> 04:17.500
In 1940 a bill was passed to give a certain compensation to some volunteers who remain

04:17.500 --> 04:21.580
in the Philippines after Spanish-American war.

04:21.580 --> 04:25.460
This bill was vetoed by the President of the United States.

04:25.460 --> 04:33.140
The President vetoed the bill on this grounds, quote, President Roosevelt.

04:33.140 --> 04:37.100
Congress has here before recognized the service of these officers and men by the award of

04:37.100 --> 04:44.100
a special medal and there was also an allowance by the act of Congress approved January 1899,

04:44.100 --> 04:49.540
a two months extra pay to all volunteers who served honestly and faithfully.

04:49.540 --> 04:53.740
Approval of this bill was resolved in the payment of a gratuited to each of the officers

04:53.740 --> 04:58.700
and men concerned and an amount exceeding his pay for a full year.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.860
And that this would set a bad precedent that they'd already been paid, they'd been given

05:02.860 --> 05:04.340
an apple compensation.

05:04.340 --> 05:11.580
This involved some eight or ten thousand-volunt men who remained in the Philippines.

05:11.580 --> 05:20.620
Well, that veto message was supported by Mr. John Rankin, Congressman John Rankin,

05:20.620 --> 05:24.500
who was the chairman of the Veterans Committee on the House of Representatives and who was

05:24.500 --> 05:28.780
one of the greatest friends the veterans ever had in the House of Representatives.

05:28.780 --> 05:34.980
Let's see who else round in Tennessee voted to sustain the President's veto.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.500
It was a ringing veto.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.100
Nobody took any real exception to it.

05:40.100 --> 05:44.540
It would have meant to not a precedent that could not have been followed as regards other

05:44.540 --> 05:45.540
people.

05:45.780 --> 05:53.640
Boarding to sustain the veto where the Representative Sam Rayburn, the majority leader, the Democratic

05:53.640 --> 05:59.980
leader, Albert Gore, my present colleague in the Senate, Lyndon Johnson, the minority

05:59.980 --> 06:06.780
leader in the Senate now, Leonard Hall and quite a number of other representatives from

06:06.780 --> 06:07.780
that we all know.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.380
Well, that's number one.

06:10.380 --> 06:20.160
Now my opponent says that in 1944 that I voted against a bill to enable our Tennessee

06:20.160 --> 06:23.060
soldiers to vote while they were abroad.

06:23.060 --> 06:30.300
Let me say that no one fought harder for enabling Tennessee veterans or all veterans to vote

06:30.300 --> 06:31.300
when they were in.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.300
I did.

06:32.300 --> 06:38.340
I supported a bill in 1942, which I thought would help, but it didn't help, because it required

06:38.340 --> 06:45.980
the veterans to write back and get absentee ballots and go through the usual procedure.

06:45.980 --> 06:50.780
So that under that bill almost no veterans in Tennessee got to vote.

06:50.780 --> 06:56.300
In 1944 the matter was up again and I supported Congressman Worley's bill, which would have

06:56.300 --> 07:02.380
cut out all the red tape and would have enabled our veterans from Tennessee to vote in elections.

07:02.380 --> 07:06.980
I made a speech on the floor of the House that the Committee bill, which was about the

07:06.980 --> 07:14.460
same as the bill in 1942, had enabled less than 100 veterans in Tennessee to vote in elections.

07:14.460 --> 07:18.540
And I wanted to support something that was worthwhile, which was Congressman Worley's

07:18.540 --> 07:25.440
bill, which practically all of the Democrats supported, which would have really enabled

07:25.440 --> 07:27.460
the veterans to vote.

07:27.460 --> 07:33.740
And I was against this thing, which had allowed only less than 100 Tennessee men out of 250

07:33.740 --> 07:36.940
soldiers to vote in the previous election.

07:36.940 --> 07:42.420
Standing with me in the matter, for instance, where practically all of the Democrats, including

07:42.420 --> 07:47.380
Senator Gore, who was then in the House of Representatives, Congressman Priest, Congressman

07:47.380 --> 07:50.780
Jerry Cooper, Congressman Cliff Davis, and others.

07:50.780 --> 07:55.940
Well, the third is that it's claimed that I voted against the Commodity Credit Corporation

07:55.940 --> 07:58.980
back in 1943.

07:58.980 --> 08:06.580
The issue there was that during this time of war the Republicans and certain others,

08:06.580 --> 08:13.300
certain conservative Democrats had gotten up a bill, which would have been inflationary.

08:13.300 --> 08:18.940
Now, the press had a plan to give certain incentive payments to farmers for increasing

08:18.940 --> 08:25.020
production, and at the same time, try to hold down the high cost of living so that prices

08:25.020 --> 08:26.860
wouldn't go so high.

08:26.860 --> 08:29.300
That was the Democratic position.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.100
I voted for that.

08:31.100 --> 08:35.260
I voted against the amendment to the Commodity Credit Corporation, or when it was written

08:35.260 --> 08:39.620
into the bill, which would have meant high inflation and would have been against the

08:39.620 --> 08:40.940
President's program.

08:40.940 --> 08:46.460
Well, voting with me in this matter was the Mr. John McCormick, the Democratic leader,

08:46.460 --> 08:49.780
and I say practically all of the Democrats.

08:49.780 --> 08:55.980
Here's Congressman Percy Priest and Lyndon Johnson, Mike Monroe and many, many other

08:55.980 --> 08:59.620
stalwart leaders in the Democratic Party.

08:59.620 --> 09:04.620
I have never voted against the interests of the farmers in this nation, and I think they

09:04.620 --> 09:07.940
know that President Roosevelt was their friend.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.740
Well, let's take another thing that's come up.

09:10.740 --> 09:17.900
I've heard many times that I sponsored a so-called organization, Wendell Peece, which was

09:17.900 --> 09:21.020
applied by the Attorney General, to be subversive.

09:21.020 --> 09:26.900
And I've been made over and over again in the face of information, which my opponent,

09:26.900 --> 09:32.740
of course, has, in which he knows that that is simply not true.

09:32.740 --> 09:40.380
The facts were that in the early part of 1946, a young Marine Lieutenant Captain came

09:40.380 --> 09:46.660
to my office in his uniform, saying that the service men felt they ought to be having

09:46.660 --> 09:51.300
some conferences in connection with the United Nations and other matters, try to see if

09:51.300 --> 09:53.420
they couldn't win the peace.

09:53.420 --> 09:59.220
If they had at least the auditorium in the National Press Club, if they had invited the

09:59.220 --> 10:05.420
Secretary of State, I think, Mr. Stinneus at that time, other distinguished Americans

10:05.420 --> 10:08.940
down to speak, and they were getting up a list of sponsors.

10:08.940 --> 10:12.900
I told this Captain Lackester that this sounded good, that, of course, everybody ought to

10:12.900 --> 10:17.940
discuss problems of NATO and United Nations, and we were all for winning the peace, and

10:17.940 --> 10:21.340
I thought service men particularly were interested.

10:21.340 --> 10:25.660
But that everything he had, that what he told me was merely prospective to get back in touch

10:25.660 --> 10:30.760
with me, and if it worked out that way, I would certainly be interested in becoming a

10:30.760 --> 10:35.460
sponsor, but that I wouldn't be interested until I saw exactly what he had worked out.

10:35.460 --> 10:40.420
I never heard from him again until the day before the conference was to take place, I read

10:40.420 --> 10:46.140
in the paper about the conference going to be in some unsavory characters, and some other

10:46.140 --> 10:50.540
people who I didn't know coming down to speak at this conference.

10:50.540 --> 10:57.540
Immediately issued a statement to the press, and I have the United Press ticker here, which

10:57.540 --> 11:07.220
I could show whereby here it is, the United Press ticker, that this man was supposed to

11:07.220 --> 11:12.620
get back in touch with me, that I was not a sponsor, that the use of my name was unauthorized,

11:12.620 --> 11:15.340
and that I was asking that it be immediately withdrawn.

11:16.340 --> 11:21.840
That was also carried in a number of editorials, and even my Chattanooga News Free Press said

11:21.840 --> 11:24.440
that there wasn't anything to this charge.

11:24.440 --> 11:29.340
Then I wrote a letter, which was sent special delivery to Captain Lancaster, a copy of which

11:29.340 --> 11:36.080
I have here, April 5, 1946, and which I said, when you are one of your representatives,

11:36.080 --> 11:40.260
talk with me about being one of the sponsors of the Wendell Peace Meeting to be held in

11:40.260 --> 11:41.260
Washington.

11:41.520 --> 11:45.060
I asked you to get in touch with me again about the matter after you had perfected your

11:45.060 --> 11:47.620
organization and worked up your program for the meeting.

11:47.620 --> 11:50.420
I have not heard from you since that time.

11:50.420 --> 11:54.660
I would appreciate it therefore if you would withdraw my name as a sponsor.

11:54.660 --> 11:59.820
This was brought out, I brought this out myself, when I started to run for the Senate back

11:59.820 --> 12:02.700
in June 1948.

12:02.700 --> 12:08.860
Everybody recognized that that was in fact, of course, the man, one of my opponents,

12:08.860 --> 12:11.260
I know who is these are the facts now.

12:11.260 --> 12:15.580
But in an effort to try to link me up with something that doesn't sound good, he still

12:15.580 --> 12:17.300
brings it out.

12:17.300 --> 12:22.620
This was in April when the Peace Thing was declared subversive by the Attorney General

12:22.620 --> 12:24.860
along about nine months later.

12:24.860 --> 12:27.780
The use of my name was never authorized.

12:27.780 --> 12:32.540
This fellow did a number of other congressmen and senators the same way, and they all repudiated

12:32.540 --> 12:34.060
him just as I did.

12:34.060 --> 12:36.940
Well, let's get on to the next one.

12:36.940 --> 12:43.420
The said very often that by one of my opponents that I always voted against the Un-American

12:43.420 --> 12:47.380
Activities Committee while in the House of Representatives.

12:47.380 --> 12:51.220
Well I voted far the Un-American Activities Committee when I thought it was doing a good

12:51.220 --> 12:52.220
job.

12:52.220 --> 12:55.820
I voted against it when I thought it wasn't.

12:55.820 --> 12:59.180
As matter of fact, during the ten years I was in the House of Representatives.

12:59.180 --> 13:03.780
They were about forty votes affecting the Un-American Activities Committee.

13:03.780 --> 13:10.500
I voted against the Committee about only five out of about forty times.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.420
Always supported it when I thought it was doing well.

13:13.420 --> 13:19.380
I remember on at least two occasions when we were trying to reorganize the procedures

13:19.380 --> 13:22.460
and the committees and the House of Representatives and in Congress.

13:22.460 --> 13:26.340
You all remember the Reorganization Act of 1946.

13:26.340 --> 13:30.620
We were trying to cut down the great number of committees and put the functions and permanent

13:30.620 --> 13:31.620
committees.

13:32.420 --> 13:38.700
I voted to have a to prevent this from becoming a permanent committee and to have it part

13:38.700 --> 13:43.220
of the Judiciary Committee feeling that it could do better work at that time.

13:43.220 --> 13:48.220
That was part of the Reorganization Act and in that I was supported by the majority leader

13:48.220 --> 13:51.620
and by and that was the Democratic position.

13:51.620 --> 13:57.140
Then on another occasion when Representative Pornail Thomas of New Jersey was chairman of

13:57.140 --> 14:00.060
the Un-American Activities Committee.

14:00.060 --> 14:05.020
It was commonly known around Washington that he is petting the payroll of this committee

14:05.020 --> 14:08.940
for which he was later convicted and went to the Penitentiary.

14:08.940 --> 14:13.140
On those occasions when in addition to the usual appropriation for the committee when he

14:13.140 --> 14:18.700
asked for additional funds under those circumstances I voted against it.

14:18.700 --> 14:24.140
I have always supported every good effort to try to root out the Communists in government.

14:24.140 --> 14:28.580
I have supported the government investigating committee in the United States Senate.

14:28.580 --> 14:34.580
I have always backed up the FBI and the appropriations and have tried to give it the authority to

14:34.580 --> 14:38.340
deal with Communists in government and other places.

14:38.340 --> 14:42.940
I think Mr. J. Edgar Hoover knows better how to handle these matters than anybody else.

14:42.940 --> 14:47.660
But when these committees have been have done a good job I have always supported them.

14:47.660 --> 14:52.860
And I have cast many many more votes for the Un-American Activities Committee than I did

14:52.860 --> 14:53.860
against it.

14:54.500 --> 15:02.860
Then there is another matter that's always brought up by political demagogues in every state.

15:02.860 --> 15:09.620
That is they try to smear someone by saying that they voted with Mark Antonio who was a somewhat radical

15:09.620 --> 15:13.100
and leftist member of Congress from New York City.

15:13.100 --> 15:18.460
That's always an effort to show any vote with Mark Antonio as being something to be used

15:18.460 --> 15:20.780
against the fellow who cast it.

15:20.780 --> 15:23.300
Well I have the figures here.

15:23.300 --> 15:27.620
If you'll compare any Congress I served in the House of Representatives for about eight years

15:27.620 --> 15:29.660
with Mr. Mark Antonio.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.780
He had his obligation and I had my obligation.

15:32.780 --> 15:36.660
Naturally we voted alike many many times.

15:36.660 --> 15:40.940
Naturally he voted the same as Senator Taft did many many times.

15:40.940 --> 15:48.540
Just because Mr. Mark Antonio voted for the TVA or for housing or for agriculture or for social security

15:48.540 --> 15:52.860
or for the resource development of this nation certainly wouldn't justify me

15:52.860 --> 15:58.780
and voting against the interests of the people in my state just in order to vote against Mark Antonio.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.340
Here are the figures.

16:01.340 --> 16:06.940
During this time, Keith Oliver with Mark Antonio is 73-1-10%

16:06.940 --> 16:12.940
Mark Antonio with a Democratic majority leader 71-5-10%

16:12.940 --> 16:19.900
Congressman or Keith Oliver, the majority leader Mr. Rayburn and Mark Antonio voted alike 61%.

16:19.900 --> 16:28.140
Compare that Mr. Mark Antonio's voting with most any progressive Democrat in the House of Representatives

16:28.140 --> 16:33.460
or compare it with Senator Taft and you'll see that they follow along about the same lands.

16:33.460 --> 16:39.340
That's just an old method of always brought out in every campaign to try to smear by

16:39.340 --> 16:42.100
ensignuation and innuendo.

16:42.100 --> 16:53.140
Well let's go on to some other votes and other matters that are being talked of by my opponent.

16:53.140 --> 17:02.060
Let's take for instance in the United States Senate here's a charge that's been made that I have voted against

17:02.060 --> 17:07.500
voted in favor of letting foreign nations try American soldiers.

17:07.500 --> 17:11.980
I never was an unfair this representation than that.

17:11.980 --> 17:18.060
This happened in the United States Senate and it involved a treaty between all NATO nations.

17:18.060 --> 17:26.540
This treaty had been signed by this nation under the auspices of the President of the United States

17:26.540 --> 17:33.100
and the Secretary of State and by the other NATO nations and it applied to everybody alike.

17:33.100 --> 17:42.580
I am the absence of treaties whenever any soldier from a foreign country here gets out and commits a civilian offense he's tried by a civilian court.

17:42.580 --> 17:46.140
The same is applicable to our men in foreign lands.

17:46.140 --> 17:56.820
The President and the Secretary of State felt that this treaty which was up for confirmation gave our servicemen some protections which they did not otherwise have.

17:56.820 --> 18:06.540
It gave them protection of interpreters of a benefit of counsel also of an appeal to NATO to see that no injustice was done.

18:06.540 --> 18:13.540
It did not have those in the absence of this treaty and I'm willing to rely upon the President of the United States.

18:13.540 --> 18:22.340
The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Army in protecting the rights of our people in the connection with this.

18:22.340 --> 18:25.420
This gave them additional rights they didn't have.

18:25.420 --> 18:39.340
Practically all of the Democrats voted for the confirmation of this treaty including Mao and good colleague, Senator Gore, Senator Sparkman, Senator Hill, Senator Fulbright, Senator McLellan.

18:39.340 --> 18:43.660
I think these surrounding senators in all of our states.

18:43.660 --> 18:51.580
Let's go on to some of the other problems that are being talked about.

18:51.580 --> 19:00.180
Here's the allegation that I endorse a magazine, a so-called Communist magazine called Infect.

19:00.180 --> 19:04.060
I want to tell you the exact facts about this matter.

19:04.060 --> 19:08.980
I had seen this magazine. It looked like a pretty good magazine around.

19:08.980 --> 19:13.780
I think I came out over two weeks or once a month.

19:13.780 --> 19:25.380
I was written a letter back in March 10th, 1950 by Mr. SELDES, the editor, asking if I wouldn't write them a little note,

19:25.380 --> 19:28.740
congratulating them upon ten years of journalism.

19:28.740 --> 19:32.020
I had no information that there was anything wrong with Infect.

19:32.020 --> 19:39.380
I wrote a general letter saying that congratulates you on the first decade of your publication.

19:39.380 --> 19:42.180
That was in March 1950.

19:42.180 --> 19:48.820
After shortly after it was brought to my attention that Infect had been listed as having some communist connections

19:48.820 --> 19:55.860
not by the Attorney General of the United States but by the Un-American Activities Committee of the House.

19:55.860 --> 20:01.140
On June 26th, just about a month after I had written the first letter or two months afterwards,

20:01.140 --> 20:08.180
I wrote Mr. SELDES, the editor of another letter saying that since writing you the said letter,

20:08.180 --> 20:16.500
I have had occasion to obtain from the files of the Committee of Un-American Activities information and allegations concerning you and your publication.

20:16.500 --> 20:20.100
Had I known these things before, I would not have complied with your request.

20:20.100 --> 20:25.220
Therefore, I shall appreciate you making no further use of my letter of March 10th, 1950,

20:25.300 --> 20:31.860
and request that you give the secondary viewpoint equal prominence in your publication.

20:31.860 --> 20:35.060
That was the fact about that.

20:35.060 --> 20:40.260
Now let's see what are some of the other charges that have been made.

20:40.260 --> 20:51.540
Oh yes, here's a charge that's been made about my service record or by registration under the selective service.

20:51.620 --> 20:56.260
I think that I should make some explanation about that.

20:56.260 --> 21:04.420
Then some inferences that I was a conscientious objector that I or that I had pled constitutional immunity or something of that sort.

21:04.420 --> 21:13.460
Facts are that on December 7th, 1941, when we deployed war, I immediately wrote the President of the United States President Roosevelt,

21:13.460 --> 21:17.540
Secretary of War Stimpson, Secretary of the Navy, Knox,

21:17.540 --> 21:25.700
told them that I had voted for war that I wanted to volunteer in my services in any capacity where I could best serve my nation during time of war.

21:25.700 --> 21:31.940
They wrote back that they were asking members of Congress to stay on their position on their jobs in Congress.

21:31.940 --> 21:36.100
The President of the United States publicly asked members of Congress to stay here,

21:36.100 --> 21:41.620
but I followed the recommendation of the President of the United States.

21:41.700 --> 21:54.500
On my selective service, I wrote down at the bottom that I claimed no exemption whatsoever by virtue of my position in government as a member of Congress or by virtue of my family.

21:54.500 --> 21:58.500
At that time, I had a wife and our youngest daughter had been born.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.580
So I did not claim any exemption.

22:00.580 --> 22:07.700
I followed the suggestion and the wishes of the President of the United States and I did my best.

22:07.780 --> 22:17.780
It's very difficult to run a campaign when you're confronted with just plain, outright, malicious misrepresentations.

22:17.780 --> 22:24.340
Let me give you two examples of that kind of thing, or about three examples.

22:24.340 --> 22:36.020
First, one of my opponents and his talker found out at Memphis gave an article from a Negro newspaper.

22:36.020 --> 22:44.660
But I don't remember the article, but from reading it over, I'm sure that I said what was in the article.

22:44.660 --> 22:52.500
This article was in explanation of why I would not be for a voluntary, for a compulsory FEPC.

22:52.500 --> 23:00.100
I pointed out that I thought we ought to try to decrease, eliminate discriminations between people, give everybody more opportunities.

23:00.180 --> 23:03.780
We had to have a program of education and persuasion.

23:03.780 --> 23:07.780
I was pointing out that you couldn't do things of that sort by coercion.

23:07.780 --> 23:13.620
Well, a strange thing was that just out of thin air, one of my opponents wrote into this article,

23:13.620 --> 23:20.980
I said that it stated that Senator Keith Oliver said that there would be no more segregation.

23:20.980 --> 23:23.540
One, it wasn't even talking about segregation.

23:23.540 --> 23:29.460
He just pulled a sentence out of the clear air and put it into something in which it had no context,

23:29.540 --> 23:33.540
whatsoever. Let's look at another one like that.

23:33.540 --> 23:41.140
I have one of my opponents when reading over a campaign contributions, my 1948 campaign,

23:41.140 --> 23:48.660
just injected out of a thin air in 1950, Donald Hiss, the brother of Alger Hiss, $10,000.

23:48.660 --> 23:51.060
Well, that's of course an absolute falsehood.

23:51.060 --> 23:54.340
I didn't even know Alger Hiss. I didn't know he had a brother.

23:54.340 --> 23:57.220
Neither one of them have ever given me as much as a post-it stamp.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.900
I've never seen any of what either one of them.

23:59.780 --> 24:03.940
And when Donald Hiss was approached by a newspaper man about it, he just

24:03.940 --> 24:06.340
was left, said there was nothing to it.

24:06.340 --> 24:12.020
Well, that was just a malicious effort without any foundation whatsoever to try to

24:12.020 --> 24:14.340
associate me in some way with Alger Hiss.

24:14.980 --> 24:18.500
And I don't think the American people particularly like that kind of business.

24:19.540 --> 24:24.420
Well, one of my opponents even goes so far that he tries to bring one's wife into

24:25.380 --> 24:29.700
controversy, which I do very bitterly resent.

24:30.820 --> 24:39.060
And Knoxville over a talkathon, he stated that I told some people that I wouldn't investigate

24:39.060 --> 24:44.660
the numbers, racket, and Knoxville because a wife or one of the people alleged to be involved

24:44.660 --> 24:51.300
had given my wife a mean quote. Well, of course, my wife, for Nancy, never had a mean quote and

24:51.300 --> 24:55.780
she's got a bill of sale for the coach she has and I, for which she never will have a mean quote.

24:56.900 --> 24:59.380
But well, my one of my opponents was still there.

24:59.380 --> 25:03.220
And after David was issued by the one of the people involved,

25:03.220 --> 25:08.660
the telegram came from person he was supposed to told him this saying that there was

25:08.660 --> 25:13.060
absolutely nothing to it. That did had no foundation whatsoever.

25:14.020 --> 25:18.980
But then strangely enough, about 10 days later, after knowing that what he said was untrue,

25:19.620 --> 25:25.460
if you didn't know it in the first place. And the Memphis talkathon he repeated exactly the

25:25.460 --> 25:32.100
same thing over and over again. Well, you know, my friend Edmund Orgel, now is that the,

25:32.100 --> 25:36.900
let's see if we have any other, yes, I do want to say just one other thing.

25:38.020 --> 25:45.220
It's been a very painstaking effort, probably originating from Bob Vin,

25:45.300 --> 25:49.140
who was connected with Mickey McBride, the owner of the mob liar service,

25:50.180 --> 25:54.820
and who is the paid publicist and talkathon man for one of my opponents,

25:55.940 --> 26:00.740
to smear and to discredit the work of the Senate crime investigating committee.

26:01.940 --> 26:05.540
Well, I'm always, I'm very proud of the work that our committee did.

26:06.420 --> 26:12.100
Anybody wants any evidence of the very close connection of Mr. Vin, with Robert Vin,

26:12.100 --> 26:18.180
with Mr. Mickey McBride, here's a letter from the public records of the Federal Communications

26:18.180 --> 26:24.820
Commission setting up the contract in the agreement back in 1948 between the owner of the mob

26:24.820 --> 26:30.820
liar service and his business partner, Mr. Robert C. Vin. I have that for inspection.

26:33.300 --> 26:37.380
I'm very proud of the work of our Senate crime investigating committee, asking anybody on any of

26:37.460 --> 26:42.180
the big cities where we held hearings in the place of all kinds of retaliation,

26:42.820 --> 26:48.820
although they don't think that we did a good job. They cleaned up, they broke up the gangs

26:48.820 --> 26:54.420
in many, many cities, and I'm proud of the fact that we broke up this nationwide wire service,

26:54.420 --> 27:00.500
which was the backbone of organized crime in the United States, which was owned by the McBride,

27:01.140 --> 27:06.740
with whom Mr. Vin, who is now probably inspiring a great many of these misrepresentations,

27:07.380 --> 27:17.220
was a working partner and a part owner of WMEI, the radio station of the McBride's and Miami,

27:17.220 --> 27:21.460
which always dispatched the work of our committee and of the Miami crime committee.

27:22.180 --> 27:27.540
But I would be willing to take the word of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover as to the work of our Senate

27:27.540 --> 27:34.660
crime investigating committee. Mr. Hoover testifying on March 26, 1951, before our committee,

27:35.060 --> 27:41.140
said Mr. Chairman and General of the Committee of the Chairman, the members of this special committee

27:41.140 --> 27:46.100
of the United States can take pride in its accomplishments during the past few months. You have

27:46.100 --> 27:50.820
developed facts which brought out into the open and pigments between the underworld and the upper

27:50.820 --> 27:57.460
world and unholy alliance between the criminal element and official to which established a

27:57.460 --> 28:02.660
shocking disregard for law and order. He went on to talk about the work of the committee,

28:03.300 --> 28:08.260
he said in this paragraph, may also express the hope that this committee under its particularly

28:08.260 --> 28:14.180
very able chairman will continue its unbiased, non-political exposure of the criminal element,

28:14.180 --> 28:20.500
which has polluted all too many communities of our nation. And if anyone would like the full

28:20.500 --> 28:27.300
text of Mr. Hoover's statement, I will of course be glad to finish it. But our friends, the unusual

28:27.300 --> 28:37.380
thing about this is that most all of these charges were back prior to 1948. They had been

28:37.380 --> 28:41.700
thrashed out in congressional campaigns when I was running for the House of Representatives.

28:42.340 --> 28:46.740
They were thrashed out in the campaign of 1948 practically every one of them.

28:47.620 --> 28:52.820
I'd always thought that when you ran a campaign and these and matters came up as issues,

28:53.460 --> 28:58.660
if you won that campaign then you usually start out from there. But not so in this campaign,

28:59.300 --> 29:06.180
this representations and false statements have been made going back to 1939 when I first went to

29:06.180 --> 29:11.700
the House of Representatives. And I felt that since some people would not remember, new people have

29:11.700 --> 29:18.900
come into Tennessee, a new voter since 1948 and since 1940 when I ran for the second time for

29:18.900 --> 29:25.060
the House of Representatives that I should make these explanations. And the interesting thing is that

29:26.020 --> 29:31.380
all of these things happened back of 1948 and one of my opponents was very, very familiar with

29:31.380 --> 29:36.900
the campaign of 1948. He knew all about it, he knew that the charges were made and the charges

29:36.900 --> 29:43.620
were answered, all of these things I've talked with you about today. And then November 3rd, 1948,

29:43.620 --> 29:50.740
I received a letter from one of my opponents saying congratulations, we are proud of you and proud

29:50.740 --> 29:55.860
for you. And then went on to tell what a great record I had made and how much he was going to enjoy

29:55.860 --> 30:01.140
serving in the House of Representatives with me. After an Edmund Orgle and talking down at Memphis

30:01.140 --> 30:09.700
said, what is it that makes a neighbor a false witness against his neighbor? I was already 1948

30:09.780 --> 30:16.660
when he once my office and running for it, everything I did prior to 1948 was no good and

30:16.660 --> 30:20.660
against the best interest of the people of Tennessee. Thank you very, very much.
