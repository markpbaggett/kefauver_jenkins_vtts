00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
Hello there.

00:08.080 --> 00:12.960
This is Robert E. Lee, your fax forum moderator speaking to you from our office in Washington,

00:12.960 --> 00:13.960
DC.

00:13.960 --> 00:19.200
Our question for tonight should the treaty making power of the president be limited by

00:19.200 --> 00:20.920
the Bricker Amendment?

00:20.920 --> 00:25.680
We have two very distinguished guests here, Senator John Bricker, Republican of Ohio, and

00:25.680 --> 00:29.360
Senator Estes-Keefe over, Democrat of Tennessee.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.680
Now Senator Bricker to start us off here, we'd like to turn our three-minute hourglass

00:33.680 --> 00:38.000
upside down and ask you to sketch for us the purpose of your amendment.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.160
The purpose of this amendment, which is sponsored by 63 other senators and myself, is to prevent

00:46.160 --> 00:53.320
treaty law from overriding the constitutional protection of the people of the United States.

00:53.320 --> 01:00.240
treaty law under this amendment must conform with the provisions of the Constitution just

01:00.240 --> 01:03.320
as acts of Congress do at the present time.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.880
In other words, a treaty will be entered into just as it is at the present time by the

01:06.880 --> 01:09.640
President and ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.

01:09.640 --> 01:15.200
But before that treaty becomes domestic law affecting the individual rights of citizens

01:15.200 --> 01:20.000
of the United States, it must be made so by act of Congress.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.840
That will bring it in the provision of the Constitution, which requires that acts of

01:23.840 --> 01:28.080
Congress must be under the Constitution itself.

01:28.080 --> 01:33.840
Treaty law is supreme in this country because of the fact that in the Constitution there

01:33.840 --> 01:39.400
is Article 6, which calls for treaties, the Constitution, and acts of Congress under the

01:39.400 --> 01:42.760
Constitution being the Supreme Law of the Land.

01:42.760 --> 01:48.760
Treaty is only have to be entered into with the approval of two-thirds of the Senate ratifying

01:48.840 --> 01:53.440
the President's agreement with any foreign country.

01:53.440 --> 01:58.480
Then a further provision of this amendment would require that executive agreements which

01:58.480 --> 02:06.080
have come to common use in recent years, and one man in the Secretary of State Department

02:06.080 --> 02:13.000
actually wrote a book a short time ago in which he said that hereafter treaties that are

02:13.000 --> 02:17.960
unimportant, relatively non-controversial will be submitted to the Senate.

02:17.960 --> 02:23.400
But those which are controversial and of high importance will be entered into as executive

02:23.400 --> 02:26.920
agreements, therefore bypassing the Senate and the Congress.

02:26.920 --> 02:32.160
It is to prevent that kind of thing, that the last section of the Constitutional amendment

02:32.160 --> 02:39.240
which I submitted with the sponsorship of three other senators was introduced.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.160
That would mean that Congress can control executive agreements, but foreign relations

02:44.160 --> 02:47.120
would go on just as they are at the present time.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.520
There is no delimiting of the power of the President.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.000
There is no attempt to take away from the Senate, the ratifying power which it has at the

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
present time, but only to require that treaty law comply with the provisions of the Constitution

02:59.000 --> 03:04.080
in the United States just as Congressional law has to at the present time.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.600
Senator Keith, all the way to your views on that?

03:06.600 --> 03:13.800
Mr. Lee, I am against the so-called Bricker Amendment, which does limit the pretty-making

03:13.800 --> 03:19.280
power of the President and Secretary of State, which makes it very much more difficult

03:19.280 --> 03:25.560
for us to carry on the very necessary position of leadership among the pre-nations of the

03:25.560 --> 03:28.280
world and the interest of peace.

03:28.280 --> 03:34.160
And in the interest of working out some kind of a system where we can get the best of this

03:34.160 --> 03:40.880
communist philosophy and aggressive tendency that has so threatened the peace of the world.

03:40.880 --> 03:49.480
I know that what Senator Bricker says about his amendment sounds good, as a matter of

03:49.480 --> 03:56.400
fact, it has many words that would attract anyone and it has very appealing philosophy

03:56.400 --> 03:59.000
that we want the Constitution to be supreme.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.960
Well, of course, the Constitution is supreme.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.600
I think it's very well to get down to just exactly what the sections of the Bricker amendment

04:07.600 --> 04:09.600
will do.

04:09.600 --> 04:15.120
I think, Mr. Lee, that we've grown to greatness under our present system, and now that we've

04:15.120 --> 04:21.600
gotten great, I don't see any reason for taking away the power of the President and the

04:21.600 --> 04:25.600
United States Senate by which we have grown to greatness.

04:25.600 --> 04:31.120
I think it's very well to keep in mind that the proponents of this bill do not argue about

04:31.120 --> 04:34.360
anything that has taken place in the past.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.840
They point to no treaty.

04:35.840 --> 04:40.840
They point to nothing has been done, but the Senate of the United States that they think

04:40.840 --> 04:42.200
is wrong.

04:42.200 --> 04:46.800
But what they are talking about is that they fear that in the future, that some way or

04:46.800 --> 04:50.120
another, we might not be able to protect the rights of the people.

04:50.120 --> 04:55.040
Well, you know, I think we have a pretty good system where treaties are made by the Secretary

04:55.040 --> 04:57.560
of State and by the President.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.520
We've got to have confidence in our President.

04:59.520 --> 05:05.560
I didn't go for a present hour, but I don't want to tie his hands at a very time when

05:05.560 --> 05:12.000
he must be able to carry on in the field of international affairs.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.720
I might not have selected Mr. Delos, the Secretary of State, but I have confidence in him.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.440
I don't think he's going to sell the United States down the river.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.640
And I have confidence in two-thirds of the Senate.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.720
Treaties must be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, as we all know.

05:28.720 --> 05:34.520
And at times, the effort has always been to try to make it easier to ratify treaties.

05:34.520 --> 05:39.640
There have been many complaints by many of our leading statesmen that it's impossible

05:39.640 --> 05:45.120
to get anything done in the field of foreign affairs because it's so hard to ratify treaties.

05:45.120 --> 05:50.120
John Hayes said one time, said, putting a treaty before the United States to just send it

05:50.120 --> 05:52.800
is just like putting a bull in an arena.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.040
You know what the bull looks like when it goes in, but you never can tell what it will

05:56.040 --> 05:58.600
be like when it comes out.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.520
Well, there is much to be said for making it easier to ratify treaties, but what I'm

06:02.520 --> 06:08.360
urging here is that we follow the constitutional method which has worked so well in the past

06:08.360 --> 06:10.200
and keep it like it is.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.280
Remember, this is something that has been debated for a long, long time.

06:14.280 --> 06:20.160
It was debated by our founding fathers when they met in Philadelphia in 1787.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.400
And they came to the conclusion that this was the best method.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.520
I have here what Mr. Madison said about it.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.360
I don't know if the sunglasses are going to run out before I reach out.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.800
All right, Senator, take a moment.

06:30.800 --> 06:37.600
Well, Mr. Madison said that I think if the treaty power rests on the safest foundation

06:37.600 --> 06:44.960
as it is, the object of treaty is the regulation of intercourse with foreign nations and is external.

06:44.960 --> 06:50.240
I do not think it's possible to enumerate all of the causes, cases in which such external

06:50.240 --> 06:52.840
regulation would be necessary.

06:52.840 --> 06:58.840
They'd be right to define all the cases in which Congress would exercise this authority.

06:58.840 --> 07:04.760
The definition and the definition might and probably would be defective.

07:04.760 --> 07:09.000
They might be restrained by such a definition from exercising the authority where it would

07:09.000 --> 07:13.200
be essential to the interest and safety of the community.

07:13.200 --> 07:18.920
It is most safe, therefore, to leave it to be exercised as contingencies may arise.

07:18.920 --> 07:23.240
And I think that's very sound philosophy.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.760
I think that the medicine philosophy is very sound.

07:25.760 --> 07:30.520
And if the present generation had followed his philosophy of treaty law, there would

07:30.520 --> 07:36.000
be any thought of the amendment which I have introduced and which 63 other senators have

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
sponsored.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.640
Mr. Madison says that treaties deal with international relationships.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.520
That was the concept of the founding fathers.

07:44.520 --> 07:49.520
That it was a relation between sovereign nation and sovereign nation.

07:49.520 --> 07:56.120
And nobody ever thought of a treaty as affecting the rights of Senator Keephover or Mr. Lee

07:56.120 --> 08:01.960
or the individual citizen in this country until the philosophy was evolved by Philip Jesse

08:01.960 --> 08:09.920
a few years ago and then under Section 55 and 56 of the United Nations, the various committees

08:09.920 --> 08:14.960
started to work on treaties which deal directly with the rights of individual citizens rather

08:14.960 --> 08:18.160
with the sovereign rights of nation.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.080
We are not limiting the power of treaty in any way, shape of form, we are not making it

08:22.080 --> 08:23.400
any more difficult.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.280
In fact, it will be much easier.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.080
There are many treaties now which are submitted to the Senate that two thirds don't vote

08:29.080 --> 08:31.040
on or even know about.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.160
One was ratified in the last session of Congress with only six senators present as Keephover

08:35.160 --> 08:36.160
remember.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.960
And another one with only one senator present.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.160
There is not a general interest.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.520
They may slip through that way and even if there is a contest, a treaty can be ratified

08:44.520 --> 08:47.800
by 33 senators.

08:47.800 --> 08:54.360
And that means that those 33 senators can affect domestic law and the rights of the American

08:54.360 --> 08:56.920
people under treaties.

08:56.920 --> 09:00.840
Without any act of Congress or with anything that Congress might say about it, let me

09:00.840 --> 09:03.880
read to you what Pastor Dulles had to say about this.

09:03.880 --> 09:08.920
He said the treaty making power is an extraordinary power liable to abuse.

09:08.920 --> 09:14.000
treaties make international law and they also make domestic law.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.120
Under our constitution treaties become the supreme law of the land.

09:19.120 --> 09:27.240
They are indeed more supreme than ordinary law or congressional laws are invalid if they

09:27.240 --> 09:29.760
do not conform to the Constitution.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.920
Whereas treaty law can override the Constitution.

09:33.920 --> 09:39.280
These for example can take away powers from the Congress and give them to the President.

09:39.280 --> 09:45.640
They can take away powers from the United States and give them to the federal government

09:45.640 --> 09:48.280
or to some international body.

09:48.280 --> 09:55.080
And they can cut across the rights given the people by the constitutional bill of rights.

09:55.080 --> 10:00.920
That was a speech well documented by the Secretary of State, given a year ago at the Bar Association

10:00.920 --> 10:03.560
meeting in Louisville.

10:03.560 --> 10:09.000
And it's absolutely true that there is no limit, as was said by Chief Justice Hughes,

10:09.000 --> 10:10.520
on the treaty making power.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.840
He does, if there were any limitation on it at all.

10:13.840 --> 10:20.400
Now Mr. Keepover has said, Senator Keepover has said that we don't complain of past treaties.

10:20.400 --> 10:28.400
But if Section 55 and 56 of the United Nations treaty is self-executing as it was held by

10:28.400 --> 10:33.520
one court in California and as it has been held by another inferior court, if the Supreme

10:33.640 --> 10:39.960
Court should sustain that position, then there has been a treaty enacted and ratified,

10:39.960 --> 10:44.440
which would change the whole domestic law of the United States because those two sections

10:44.440 --> 10:48.480
deal with every human relationship that we have in this country.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.480
Senator Keepover.

10:49.480 --> 10:54.880
Well, Mr. Leigh, quite through, Mr. Dallas made a talk about a year ago when he was just

10:54.880 --> 10:55.880
a private citizen.

10:55.880 --> 11:02.160
But I prefer to take what Mr. Dallas said before the Judiciary Committee just a few weeks

11:02.160 --> 11:03.160
ago.

11:03.160 --> 11:07.760
Mr. Dallas had had a whole lot more time to read the decisions of the Supreme Court and also

11:07.760 --> 11:12.680
to consider the difficulties he was going to have in Secretary of State if he went along

11:12.680 --> 11:15.360
with Senator Brickard's amendment.

11:15.360 --> 11:20.760
So he came before the Judiciary Committee representing President Eisenhower and he

11:20.760 --> 11:28.000
testified very, very strongly against the limitations that are included in this and the

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Brickard amendment.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.760
That's after he had time to think this matter over a whole lot more.

11:32.760 --> 11:39.360
I do not have all of Secretary Dallas's testimony, but he said among other things that the

11:39.360 --> 11:45.760
United States has always insisted in negotiations and debate with the Soviet Union that no limitations

11:45.760 --> 11:52.560
or control of armaments would be acceptable and less enforced by strict international supervision.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.320
This was the so-called Baruch plan.

11:54.920 --> 11:59.760
The Soviet Union has so far refused to exceed to set the international control.

11:59.760 --> 12:04.760
But surely this is no time for the United States to make itself unable to participate in

12:04.760 --> 12:07.280
the effective international control of armaments.

12:07.280 --> 12:13.880
And the quotation, Mr. Dallas, went on to say that the Brickard amendment was, uh, in

12:13.880 --> 12:19.880
pair and make it impossible to enter into aviation treaties, radio treaties, narcotics,

12:19.880 --> 12:20.880
quarantine requirements.

12:20.880 --> 12:26.560
I think we couldn't even enter into agreements relative to taking care of migratory birds

12:26.560 --> 12:28.920
when they fly in and out.

12:28.920 --> 12:33.800
Mr. Dallas said, Father, uh, said talking about one section of the treaty, quote, this

12:33.800 --> 12:37.800
would make it much more difficult to consummate effective treaties.

12:37.800 --> 12:42.320
Our nation's ability to deal with other nations would be gravely impaired in the quotation.

12:42.320 --> 12:49.240
Now, I think we all make it very clear in the beginning, Mr. Lee, and that the Constitution

12:49.240 --> 12:51.600
is now supreme.

12:51.600 --> 12:56.360
No treaty can be entered into, which is going to take away the rights of the people under

12:56.360 --> 12:57.360
the Constitution.

12:57.360 --> 13:04.160
It's always been held by our Supreme Court, uh, but that the Constitution is the Supreme

13:04.160 --> 13:05.160
Law of the Land.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.800
And of course, any treaty that might be in violation with our Constitution would simply

13:09.800 --> 13:11.520
be of no force and effect.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.000
That's the law now.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.040
Uh, that's what Section One of Senator Brickard's, uh, resolution deals with.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.040
Well, then you'd have no idea if you think this is one.

13:20.040 --> 13:24.360
Well, I know, but we don't want to be writing something into the Constitution when it's already

13:24.360 --> 13:26.200
the Law of the Land.

13:26.200 --> 13:30.600
I could think of a whole other things that this is a pretty day and the capitals are pretty

13:30.600 --> 13:31.760
building.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.840
No one would dispute that, but that's no reason to write it into the Constitution.

13:35.840 --> 13:42.680
Here they, uh, the Supreme Court back in the, uh, the rigs case, uh, says this.

13:42.680 --> 13:46.920
It would not be contended that it extends talking about treaty-making powers.

13:46.920 --> 13:54.200
So as so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids are to change, are a change in the

13:54.200 --> 14:00.720
character of the government, are in that, um, that are one of the states, are a session

14:00.720 --> 14:06.400
on the, are, are, are a session of any portion of the territory, the latter without its consent.

14:06.400 --> 14:11.560
Now, I suppose when we come to these constitutional questions, they, Attorney General of the United

14:11.560 --> 14:15.440
States is, because it's good enough one to go by as I know of.

14:15.440 --> 14:20.240
Well, let's discuss for just a minute before you proceed with that, uh, Senator, uh, Jeffrey

14:20.240 --> 14:21.240
against rigged.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.760
Jeffrey against rigged is 100 years old.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.960
And, uh, that was a short obiter on the part of the court.

14:26.960 --> 14:31.160
And you can find a lot of them up to the last, uh, 15 years to that extent.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.800
The contrary of that is what I've just read from Secretary Delas when he was a lawyer.

14:34.800 --> 14:40.000
And let me say to you that no executive likes to be curved in his power.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.880
Every JD wants unlimited authority.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.480
He does not Congress to curvy.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.400
He doesn't want the people to curvy.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.360
That's entirely contrary to the philosophy of the founder of the party whose cause you

14:49.360 --> 14:50.360
espoused.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.640
Domus Jefferson said, let us hear no more about the confidence in men, but let us tie

14:54.640 --> 14:57.640
them down by the terms of the Constitution.

14:57.640 --> 15:01.160
And that's exactly what we are doing in this case.

15:01.160 --> 15:05.920
We're trying down the representatives of the people of this country so that the inalienable

15:05.920 --> 15:10.640
God given rights of the American people expressed in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights

15:10.640 --> 15:13.160
can't be taken away by treaty law.

15:13.160 --> 15:18.360
And I say to you honestly that they can, the Chief Justice Hughes supported that philosophy.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.120
And you mentioned, you mentioned, the Secretary of Virgin.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.400
It was in the famous, the Secretary of Virgin case where this question first became a serious

15:24.400 --> 15:30.040
problem when Justice Holmes held it by a treaty with Great Britain that you enlarge the power

15:30.040 --> 15:35.400
of Congress to do something which it couldn't do under the Constitution.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.880
Now three judges are the Supreme Court of the United States in the recent steel decision.

15:39.880 --> 15:44.400
Well that because we have entered the United Nations because we have entered the NATO agreement

15:44.400 --> 15:49.680
that the President of the United States has unlimited power to seize the steel industry.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.600
Of course we can seize, I can seize anything else.

15:52.600 --> 15:57.120
But without regard to Congress and without regard to the constitutional powers, he held that

15:57.120 --> 15:58.120
they had that right.

15:58.120 --> 16:05.000
If two more would have joined with the three, the Republic would have ended right then.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.600
And we'd be subject to all sorts of international control and global theories.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.720
I've been telling you how dangerous they are.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.000
We've discussed a lot, you know.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.680
They covered it in human rights.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.360
That is the one which became most serious.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.320
The one which Mr. Dulles says that they will never present them, and have instructed their

16:20.320 --> 16:26.600
representative to the committee who have no more to do with it in English, joined with

16:26.600 --> 16:30.040
Herrinette Positions that had been trending in the wrong direction.

16:30.040 --> 16:35.200
But Mr. Malik, who was chairman of that commission, succeeded Mrs. Roosevelt.

16:35.200 --> 16:42.080
And Mr. Malik said definitely that this treaty has shown the influence of the Marxist philosophy

16:42.080 --> 16:46.960
and that he was surprised at the impotence of the Western powers first to get together

16:46.960 --> 16:51.800
and to have the imaginativeness to face the communist philosophy which was expressed in

16:51.800 --> 16:52.800
this covenant.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.040
Now that's from the chairman himself.

16:55.040 --> 17:00.560
And when we have these treaties, which will be submitted, that one was dangerous.

17:00.560 --> 17:04.960
The International Court of Criminal Justice is also a dangerous treaty which is being worked

17:04.960 --> 17:06.600
on at the present time.

17:06.600 --> 17:12.720
And under that international court of criminal justice, an American citizen could be tried

17:12.720 --> 17:18.480
any place in the world by an international court on which we might have and might not have

17:18.480 --> 17:21.080
even one representative.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.760
And he'd have no right of appeal.

17:22.760 --> 17:26.640
He'd have no right under the Constitution be tried at the site of the offense.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.680
He would not have a right of appeal.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.960
He would have no right of a trial but jury.

17:31.960 --> 17:36.840
And there would be no power in this country that could stop such a prosecution under

17:36.840 --> 17:38.240
an alien law.

17:38.240 --> 17:43.560
What I want to do and what this amendment does, Senator Keve, is to keep those inalienable

17:43.560 --> 17:49.640
rights and they were declared as divine, inspired by our creators, as you know in the

17:49.640 --> 17:50.880
Declaration of Independence.

17:50.880 --> 17:55.440
What I want to do and what this amendment would do would keep those rights beyond the power

17:55.440 --> 17:56.440
of any government.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.640
Hours are in the international government and keep them in the spiritual and out of the

18:00.640 --> 18:01.640
temporal realm.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.640
Yes, Senator.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.240
And, Bridges, I'm sure that's what you want to do.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.640
I mean, Senator, I'm not going to break her out.

18:07.640 --> 18:15.200
But of course, in doing that, what you effectively do is to tie the hands of the leading democracy

18:15.200 --> 18:18.000
in the world of time when it's got to have much freedom of mind.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
How would it tie the hands?

18:19.000 --> 18:26.720
I'll show you how to tie the hands if we can get on and discuss the section by section.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.280
But let me make one thing clear.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.720
Every bricker is amunciating a doctrine of fear.

18:32.720 --> 18:37.240
I don't think this is a time when we've got to be afraid of ourselves.

18:37.240 --> 18:41.640
He talks about the covenant of human rights and the international court of human justice

18:41.640 --> 18:46.880
about agreements that may be entered into and League of Nations conferences.

18:46.880 --> 18:51.680
And yet he, in the same breath, he says that President Mr. Dulles says he's not going

18:51.680 --> 18:52.680
to submit it.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.680
Well, I don't have any fear whatsoever.

18:54.680 --> 18:59.560
But the President of the United States and the Secretary of State and two-thirds of

18:59.560 --> 19:04.600
the United States Senate are going to be so negligent of their duties that they're

19:04.600 --> 19:08.840
going to let us enter the United States' enter into something that's not in the best interest

19:08.840 --> 19:09.840
of the people.

19:09.840 --> 19:14.240
If we don't have confidence in the President and two-thirds of the Senate, we might as

19:14.240 --> 19:15.960
well fold up.

19:15.960 --> 19:21.280
No prohibition is going to protect the people of the United States if these great institutions

19:21.280 --> 19:28.080
which have worked so well for 165 years if we're going to throw aside them because of

19:28.080 --> 19:32.640
lack of confidence on the idea that they might do something in the future, that they

19:32.640 --> 19:36.320
might ratify some treaty that is being thought about.

19:36.320 --> 19:40.760
Something the Secretary of State says he's not even going to go into present for the United

19:40.760 --> 19:41.760
States Senate.

19:41.760 --> 19:48.080
As Senator Bricker, there isn't a single decision of the Supreme Court anywhere that says that

19:48.080 --> 19:52.080
they treaty overrides the Constitution.

19:52.080 --> 19:56.480
The decisions of the Supreme Court are all of the contrary.

19:56.480 --> 20:00.360
Mr. Delos may have had that idea when he made a speech sometime back, but he'd changed

20:00.360 --> 20:02.120
when he came up to testify for the Court.

20:02.120 --> 20:05.600
Has there ever been any decisions the Supreme Court made sure we're ready or overrode any

20:05.600 --> 20:07.120
section of the treaty?

20:07.120 --> 20:14.920
Well, the decisions of the Supreme Court say that the Constitution is paramount.

20:14.920 --> 20:15.920
Does anybody-

20:15.920 --> 20:16.920
Has anybody-

20:16.920 --> 20:20.800
I think for one minute that a treaty of the United States is going to take away the

20:20.800 --> 20:27.040
right of habeas, porpoise, or the rights that we have under our Constitution?

20:27.040 --> 20:34.080
Mr. Brownell says that, and I hear as well as Mr. Justice Parker says, he's one of our great

20:34.080 --> 20:38.680
, he's a Republican, by the way, and one of our great Circuit Court of Appeals judges.

20:38.680 --> 20:41.720
And another great one was on the same question, but a policy.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.720
Judge Phillips.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.440
Well, he may have been, but I don't think he doesn't agree with anybody.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.440
Well, Justice Parker-

20:47.440 --> 20:48.440
I'm not a candidate.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.880
That used to be a part of Tennessee.

20:50.880 --> 20:57.480
But Justice Parker, I don't think Mr. Phillips disagreed with Justice Parker on the law, he

20:57.480 --> 21:02.200
says, do you think for a moment if this government should enter into a treaty or a series of treaties

21:02.200 --> 21:07.200
changing the basis of representation in Congress or abolishing the writ of habeas, porpoise

21:07.200 --> 21:12.400
of the right to compensation upon the exercise of them in the domain, or limiting religious

21:12.400 --> 21:17.120
liberty or freedom of speech or of the press, is the Supreme Court would uphold the treaty

21:17.120 --> 21:22.120
against the guarantees of the Constitution to ask such a question as to answer it.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.800
And as a matter of fact, in the hard money cases, is the Supreme Court of the United States

21:26.800 --> 21:32.400
even held that where, if the Congress didn't like the treaty that all they had to do is

21:32.400 --> 21:38.680
pass a law opposite from the treaty so that the treaty would have no force in effect,

21:38.680 --> 21:40.680
that said, they could have money cases.

21:40.680 --> 21:44.560
In the worst of the days of a monilateral treaty, such as we got at the present time,

21:44.560 --> 21:49.400
that would invite international chaos and confusion that might lead to war, the notification

21:49.400 --> 21:53.440
of treaties in the past has led to war in many instances.

21:53.440 --> 21:57.880
And we don't want any agreements with the only protecting influence that of the Congress

21:57.880 --> 21:59.400
of the United States.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.400
Now Senator Keefer, you said that that was a doctrine of fear.

22:03.400 --> 22:07.280
I want to say to you that I believe in the doctrine of fear when it comes to the unlimited

22:07.280 --> 22:10.840
power of men over the rights of people.

22:10.840 --> 22:17.280
If the founders of this country had not subscribed to the doctrine of fear, we wouldn't have had

22:17.280 --> 22:18.800
the Constitution.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.320
And if the first Congress had not subscribed to their doctrine of fear, we wouldn't have

22:23.320 --> 22:24.520
had to attend amendments.

22:24.520 --> 22:28.360
I fear the power of government as much as anything in the world today.

22:28.360 --> 22:32.000
It's the power of government that has ruined the liberties of people and destroyed nations

22:32.000 --> 22:37.240
within your lifetime and mine and even within the term within the Congress and the Senate.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.480
The greed for power and it's an insatiable greed.

22:41.480 --> 22:46.320
Maybe that has something to do with the attitude of those who are in power.

22:46.320 --> 22:50.120
And I want you to know that the only time you can protect the people of this country is

22:50.120 --> 22:53.360
when an administration is in power when you don't need it.

22:53.360 --> 22:57.440
And that's the reason that we're moving on this as rapidly as we can at the present time.

22:57.440 --> 23:04.160
Now the argument that you used about let us trust people was the argument that Alexander

23:04.160 --> 23:11.040
Hamilton used and it's Madison's youth in the Constitutional Convention and in the

23:11.040 --> 23:16.480
Federalist to prevent the adoption of the Bill of Rights.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.920
That was an effort to get the Constitution adopted in New York State without a Bill of

23:20.920 --> 23:21.920
Rights in it.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.760
And I'm very thankful today and I think you are.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.880
Not the Jefferson philosophy, the Patrick Henry's and the Samuel Adams's and the Mason's.

23:29.880 --> 23:35.040
One in that fight and we do have a Bill of Rights in the Constitution which protects

23:35.040 --> 23:41.480
the American people in their inalienable God-given rights and let's no power of government.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.400
Invade them or take them away.

23:43.400 --> 23:48.960
Now a treaty does not have to under the terms of the Constitution itself and home said so.

23:48.960 --> 23:53.600
In the migratory bird case does not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.

23:53.600 --> 24:00.120
And Justice Hughes said that, fostered us in his thinking as a lawyer said it also.

24:00.120 --> 24:05.480
And I am quite confident that if we had ratified the covenant of human rights and many of the

24:05.480 --> 24:10.840
other treaties that have been submitted by the ILO and the WHO which deal with the rights

24:10.840 --> 24:17.840
of the employer and labor in this country and even the rights of motherhood and the rules

24:17.840 --> 24:22.320
of industry in regard to mothers with babies and so forth.

24:22.320 --> 24:27.280
If those had been ratified they would become the supreme law of the land and cut across

24:27.280 --> 24:29.360
the rights of the people of this country.

24:29.360 --> 24:34.400
Now it's none of the business of an Italian or an Englishman or a Russian or a German

24:34.400 --> 24:38.080
or a Frenchman what our internal laws are.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.840
And I don't think that they don't have anything to say about them.

24:41.840 --> 24:42.840
International affairs, yes.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.960
We've got to cooperate and willing to cooperate.

24:44.960 --> 24:50.800
But this amendment, this amendment above mine sponsored by 63 other senators would make

24:50.800 --> 24:56.440
it easier to enter into treaties for this reason that the Senate of the United States

24:56.440 --> 25:01.200
could take a chance maybe if they knew that the rights of the American people, the free

25:01.200 --> 25:06.120
speech and worship of God according to their conscience and privilege of assembly and

25:06.120 --> 25:09.760
all those things could not be invaded or violated.

25:09.760 --> 25:13.200
Then we could afford to take a chance maybe which we can't afford to do now.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.920
And that's very apparent in the treaty which we discussed on the floor a couple of days

25:15.920 --> 25:16.920
ago.

25:16.920 --> 25:23.760
Well, Senator Bricker, I don't want the Senate of the United States to take any chance

25:23.760 --> 25:26.920
unless they are certain that what's going to happen.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.920
That's the reason we've gotten along so well so far.

25:29.920 --> 25:34.600
This is a very unique system we have here where we require two-thirds of the upper body

25:34.600 --> 25:39.640
of pungence to ratify something oppressed in the Secretary of State has done.

25:39.640 --> 25:46.000
If anyone thinks that we can write down my new laws for the governing of the ever-detailed

25:46.000 --> 25:50.160
law, and exactly what is going to be done in this field or that, and that that's going

25:50.160 --> 25:53.160
to save us, they're badly mistaken.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.640
If these present safeguards of two-thirds of the Senate and the President of the United

25:56.640 --> 26:01.120
States won't save us, then we're in for a bad situation.

26:01.120 --> 26:06.480
And I think provisions like you have here that show us a lack of confidence in the present

26:06.480 --> 26:08.320
setup that we have.

26:08.320 --> 26:14.720
You mentioned a few minutes ago, the Supreme Court and the seizure of the steel cases.

26:14.720 --> 26:20.080
The Supreme Court's late-free members voted to uphold the President's order because

26:20.080 --> 26:22.080
he's the commander in chief for the Army of the Senate.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.080
I'm sorry, Senator.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.080
Thank you very much, Senator Keif over.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.960
Senator Brick, they're bringing us both sides of this interesting question.

26:28.960 --> 26:35.400

26:35.400 --> 26:39.720

We would like you to become a member and join in this enduring crusade to preserve freedom.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.800

There are no charges of any kind.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.000
We'll be glad to add your name to our mailing list.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.120
Thanks for being our guest this evening and remember, freedom needs a soapbox too.
