00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this is not a very pleasant matter to talk

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
about, but it's a very important one.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.680
And I think it's one that people ought to have information about.

00:20.680 --> 00:26.600
That is, in the case of a nuclear attack or an old-out war, what will happen to our civilian

00:26.600 --> 00:28.320
population?

00:28.320 --> 00:32.040
What kind of civilian defense do we have?

00:32.040 --> 00:37.160
Back about 10 or 12 years ago, as chairman of a subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee

00:37.160 --> 00:43.040
in the Senate, I guided through the first Civil Defense Act.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.400
Since that time, we have seen many developments and a good deal has been done in the Civil

00:47.400 --> 00:49.560
Defense way.

00:49.560 --> 00:55.520
And I think that people, while they may not be interested, they don't like to think about

00:55.520 --> 00:57.920
civil defense particularly.

00:57.920 --> 01:02.920
This is a problem that they should have the most accurate and up-to-date information

01:02.920 --> 01:09.200
concerning because we never know what may unfortunately happen.

01:09.200 --> 01:14.080
Today we have is our guest, Stuart L. Pittman, who is the Assistant Secretary of Defense

01:14.080 --> 01:16.200
for Civil Defense.

01:16.200 --> 01:23.160
And he is running the show at the federal level, coordinating or attempting to coordinate

01:23.160 --> 01:26.160
the activities throughout the country.

01:26.160 --> 01:33.080
And we appreciate having you here, Secretary Pittman, to talk with the listeners and viewers

01:33.080 --> 01:37.120
of this station about the all-important matter of civil defense.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.120
Delighted to be here, Senator.

01:39.120 --> 01:47.000
Now, in the first place, of course, you are a Assistant Secretary of Defense.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.400
But is this a federal problem entirely?

01:49.400 --> 01:55.480
Or is it not, if we are going to be successful, I like the local aspects of it?

01:55.480 --> 02:01.600
Well, on the way, we picture a nuclear attack in the years ahead of heavy nuclear attack.

02:01.600 --> 02:06.440
It seems quite clear that each community has to be prepared to stand on its own feet

02:06.440 --> 02:10.240
for a matter of perhaps weeks, and they cannot be sure about side-help.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.160
So it's clearly a local problem.

02:13.160 --> 02:17.160
And then, of course, the federal government does play a role in trying to coordinate the

02:17.160 --> 02:22.640
effort and help where you can, but it is a largely a local problem.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.320
If it should ever happen, it would be very much a local problem, but in the preparations

02:26.320 --> 02:30.720
the federal government must support state and local efforts very heavily.

02:30.720 --> 02:36.880
Well, Stewart, how much has the President asked for this year for civil defense and

02:36.880 --> 02:37.880
the budget?

02:37.880 --> 02:42.760
Well, our request for fiscal year 1964 is 300 million.

02:42.760 --> 02:49.640
It's less than was asked for last year, but a video more than we got last year.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.480
How much did you get last year, and how much was spent on civil defense last year?

02:53.480 --> 03:02.560
Last year, our appropriation was 113 million, and we are requesting a supplemental, which

03:02.560 --> 03:07.360
would increase that to 175 million for this current fiscal year.

03:07.360 --> 03:14.360
Well, civil defense is an overall part of our defense program, is it not?

03:14.360 --> 03:17.040
It's very much so.

03:17.040 --> 03:22.080
And our overall defense program, I think, the budget this year is something like a 60-year

03:22.080 --> 03:27.040
request for appropriation is something like 60 billion dollars.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.040
It's 52.

03:28.040 --> 03:33.120
It turns out to be 6 tenths of 1 percent of the total defense budget that we are requesting

03:33.120 --> 03:34.120
for civil defense.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.120
I see.

03:35.120 --> 03:40.720
Well, one second here, and McNamara requested in the way of civil defense legislation.

03:40.720 --> 03:47.360
He's requesting legislation, which would permit us to start on the second leg of this

03:47.360 --> 03:48.360
program.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.480
We found a shellerspace for over 100 million people.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.480
It already exists.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.160
No money need be spent on the structure.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.400
It simply has to be stock now, that's not enough to take care of the population with

04:04.400 --> 04:06.800
minimal shellers protection.

04:06.800 --> 04:13.400
We need it far too to put some money into selected buildings in communities to create additional

04:13.400 --> 04:17.200
shellerspace, which would protect people against fallout radiation.

04:17.200 --> 04:22.440
You mean, at present time you found some kind of shellerspace for about 100 million of

04:22.440 --> 04:24.880
our 180 million population.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.480
Is that right?

04:26.480 --> 04:31.520
But how about supplies, medicine, food, water, things of that sort?

04:31.520 --> 04:38.280
As you have mentioned in an including radiation detection instruments, it's going into each

04:38.280 --> 04:43.200
of the shellers that have been found to be acceptable in this survey, which we have just

04:43.200 --> 04:47.160
completed, and they would also go into the new shellerspace created by the program we're

04:47.160 --> 04:48.160
asking for.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.800
Well, there's been a argument that's been raging for some time about the best way to save

04:52.800 --> 04:57.240
lives in case of nuclear attack.

04:57.240 --> 05:02.000
Some have said that shellers in our big cities offer the best opportunity of being protected

05:02.000 --> 05:05.160
against fallout.

05:05.160 --> 05:10.120
Others have argued that we ought to evacuate our cities in the event of a warning of a

05:10.120 --> 05:14.840
nuclear attack, get out in the country and the countryside.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.320
What has been resolved about that?

05:16.320 --> 05:18.160
What should people do?

05:18.160 --> 05:24.200
Well, the one big change in civil defense planning over the last few years has been a shift

05:24.200 --> 05:31.440
away from the idea of evacuation towards a take cover approach to the problem.

05:31.440 --> 05:37.960
This is largely because of the fallout radiation hazard we anticipate that under a heavy nuclear

05:37.960 --> 05:43.080
attack it would reach most of the country so there would be no place to run to.

05:43.080 --> 05:47.920
Unless you had a sheller at the end of your journey, you'd better stay where you are and

05:47.920 --> 05:55.360
take advantage of the massive building materials that are near where you live if you live

05:55.360 --> 05:56.360
in a city.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.200
Certainly it would be better to take advantage of that protection than to run out into

05:59.200 --> 06:01.760
the country where you'd be exposed to fallout radiation.

06:01.760 --> 06:06.760
I mean, you're just the exposed value where running out and then you'd have to have somewhere

06:06.760 --> 06:11.600
to go to then after you evacuate it.

06:11.600 --> 06:21.000
Well, aside from the war threat during the Cuban crisis, it doesn't seem to me that there's

06:21.000 --> 06:26.120
been very much and certainly not sufficient interest in civil defense.

06:26.120 --> 06:30.080
Is that right and what should be done about it?

06:30.080 --> 06:32.800
Well, I think that is generally right, Senator.

06:32.800 --> 06:39.760
The Cuban experience, however, did demonstrate clearly to the leadership in this country.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.920
I mean, local public and private leadership, not just the federal government, that people

06:44.920 --> 06:51.840
faced with a real crisis are deeply concerned about their chances of survival and a place

06:51.840 --> 06:55.960
to go to take their families that would give them some protection so that I don't think

06:55.960 --> 06:59.760
there's as much speculation as there was about whether people really want this.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.600
I think it's clear that an emergency they want it.

07:03.600 --> 07:08.480
It's also clear that between emergencies they're not going to think about it deeply and

07:08.480 --> 07:11.400
involve themselves emotionally in the problem.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.680
I think this is all right.

07:12.680 --> 07:21.320
I think it's up to the leadership to do the planning and the general public has a responsibility

07:21.320 --> 07:29.920
to understand the problem, but need not do extravagant and extraordinary things day-to-day

07:29.920 --> 07:30.920
basis.

07:30.920 --> 07:31.920
That's not necessary.

07:31.920 --> 07:39.720
Well, Secretary Pitman, if you were living in a suburb of the city, or if you're living

07:39.720 --> 07:45.160
in a small town, a nuclear attack came, what should people do?

07:45.160 --> 07:50.560
What would you recommend that they do?

07:50.560 --> 07:59.560
Well, of course, anything you can do at the last minute is negligible compared to what

07:59.560 --> 08:04.200
you could do if you faced the problem a little ahead of time.

08:04.200 --> 08:13.560
Every family in the suburb or anywhere else should have some idea of the best protection

08:13.560 --> 08:17.600
against a four-out radiation, which is the most predictable of the hazards that would

08:17.600 --> 08:18.960
take place.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.160
That means a pick out of place which might be a basement in your home, it might be a large

08:23.160 --> 08:25.760
building nearby.

08:25.760 --> 08:30.480
If you don't have any place that offers any kind of protection, consideration should

08:30.480 --> 08:36.480
be given to a home shelter, and we have designs that have been published to show how this

08:36.480 --> 08:42.160
can be done at very low cost or $150 if you do a little work yourself with a shelter

08:42.160 --> 08:46.000
in your basement or backyard.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.160
This kind of preparation is taken.

08:49.160 --> 08:53.160
Then you can build a family plan, a community plan that makes some sense.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.520
These things haven't been done.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.680
It's a very difficult thing to advise people what to do during an emergency.

08:59.680 --> 09:07.040
Of course, the best thing to do is to try to get acquainted with the location of the facilities

09:07.040 --> 09:13.600
of some good shelter or well-provisioned that's already been built that you could get to.

09:13.600 --> 09:21.440
In Nashville, for example, in your state, we have found Shellerspace to take care of

09:21.440 --> 09:23.240
the entire population.

09:23.240 --> 09:26.560
In Memphis, there's enough to take care of about half the population.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.760
So it varies from city to city.

09:29.760 --> 09:30.760
This is not evident.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.000
It hasn't come to the surface.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.240
It hasn't all been marked so that people don't see this, but this is a reality in over

09:38.240 --> 09:40.040
this coming year.

09:40.040 --> 09:44.640
It will be stocked in marks and there will be plans as to how people will use it.

09:44.640 --> 09:49.080
People will know living in various sections of Nashville where they are supposed to go

09:49.080 --> 09:55.080
and what the shelter is available to them.

09:55.080 --> 09:59.960
Yes, you have a very able state director and criminal fox who is working on plans to

09:59.960 --> 10:00.960
strut people.

10:00.960 --> 10:01.960
Yes, I know.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.200
He's got a lot of very able directors in our various cities and towns.

10:06.200 --> 10:13.280
When I take out state of Tennessee by the population of three million, 600,000 as an example, what

10:13.280 --> 10:16.880
facts have your studies revealed about civil events?

10:16.880 --> 10:18.720
How many shelter facilities are there?

10:18.720 --> 10:21.880
The number of spaces and what's the supply?

10:21.880 --> 10:27.680
The status of the supply of food and water and other things that people must have.

10:27.680 --> 10:32.680
The number of spaces that we've found in this nationwide survey in Tennessee are about

10:32.680 --> 10:36.800
one point space to take care of, about 1.6 million people.

10:36.800 --> 10:40.880
That's about 45% of the state population.

10:40.880 --> 10:45.600
The survey has also revealed that simply by adding ventilation and basements, it's been

10:45.600 --> 10:52.920
increased the capacity of the shelter space in these larger buildings to about 2.4 million

10:52.920 --> 10:57.800
people, which means that about 70% of the population could be taken care of.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.520
That's a 50% increase.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.320
This costs some money.

11:01.320 --> 11:05.600
The national average costs and the ventilation is around $11 per person.

11:05.600 --> 11:12.400
Sheldart, those institutions that are eligible under this proposed financing program that

11:12.400 --> 11:17.640
I mentioned earlier, which we're presenting to Congress, could have federal funds which

11:17.640 --> 11:19.600
would meet this cost.

11:19.600 --> 11:24.000
These include all nonprofit institution schools and hospitals and public buildings.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.440
It does not include industrial commercial establishments.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.840
What part is the TVA played in civil defense planning?

11:31.840 --> 11:40.520
The TVA has taken a very active interest in this and done what all federal agencies should

11:40.520 --> 11:44.000
be doing, which is to demonstrate some leadership.

11:44.000 --> 11:51.880
They have gone ahead and marked and equipped their buildings, which offer some possibility

11:51.880 --> 11:53.480
of community shelter space.

11:53.480 --> 12:00.840
They've also taken measures to assure continuity of the power system and so far as this can

12:00.840 --> 12:02.840
be done.

12:02.840 --> 12:09.840
In their own buildings or installations do they have civil defense, do they have

12:09.840 --> 12:10.840
shoulders?

12:10.840 --> 12:11.840
Yes.

12:11.840 --> 12:16.840
They have identified the buildings and moving in supplies and developing plans to use them.

12:16.840 --> 12:22.200
I suppose having a power facility in the event of a attack is very important too.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
It's of course vital.

12:23.200 --> 12:28.280
It's a very difficult subject as to how to switch power around from one station to another

12:28.280 --> 12:31.360
to restore services rapidly as possible.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.120
We're doing a lot of research on this.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.560
We're optimistic that a good part of the country would have power.

12:36.560 --> 12:40.200
Of course there would be important parts of the country that would be without power.

12:40.200 --> 12:46.400
Well, Stuart briefly, because you give us an example of a program supporting civil defense,

12:46.400 --> 12:50.600
which has been undertaken in the volunteer state in Tennessee.

12:50.600 --> 12:58.280
Of course, the, you mean perhaps these prototype shelters that...

12:58.280 --> 13:03.360
Well, I just know any, perhaps though, or any program that's been commissioned.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
I could.

13:04.360 --> 13:13.120
I could describe one community, which we've done some work with.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.320
They've asked us to keep this quiet for the time being because they're not sure what

13:16.320 --> 13:17.320
they're going to do.

13:17.320 --> 13:22.240
But an analysis has been made as to the shoulder space in the community and what they could

13:22.240 --> 13:25.000
do to survive under fallout conditions.

13:25.000 --> 13:33.400
And the result has been to generate enthusiasm and acidic committee to...

13:33.400 --> 13:37.480
Well, Stuart, sorry, we'll have to talk about that some other time.

13:37.480 --> 13:43.200
Well, thank you very much, Stuart Pittman, for coming and being with us until the next

13:43.200 --> 13:44.200
program is over.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.040
Thank you very much.

13:52.240 --> 14:05.160
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, during the past two weeks, this Congress,

14:05.160 --> 14:07.160
which is now in session, has...

14:07.160 --> 14:11.400
It's commenced to be known as the first of the space age.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.280
And I think that that is a true and a correct designation.

14:14.280 --> 14:18.800
Well, the things that we do in this Congress and the things that are done in the government

14:18.800 --> 14:20.800
are during this year.

14:20.800 --> 14:25.800
We'll have a whole lot to do with our future, whether we're successful in the space age

14:25.800 --> 14:26.800
or whether we're not.

14:26.800 --> 14:33.300
As soon as the President's new budget came to the Congress, there was a great deal of

14:33.300 --> 14:36.160
talk calling it the first budget for the space age.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.160
And I suppose it was.

14:38.160 --> 14:44.240
The budget was for almost $75 billion, the highest in the peacetime history of the United

14:44.240 --> 14:45.240
States.

14:45.480 --> 14:51.480
Is this a budget sufficient to do the research to make the missiles to have the weapons

14:51.480 --> 14:56.720
for the protection of the United States and also to catch up with the Soviet Union and

14:56.720 --> 14:59.800
the development of the development of this space age?

14:59.800 --> 15:03.880
So these questions cannot be in a quick immediate answer.

15:03.880 --> 15:10.400
It depends, of course, on how much other expenses can be cut down, on how much can be saved

15:10.400 --> 15:16.320
by cutting red tape and having better organization in the Pentagon, which are a preparedness subcommittee

15:16.320 --> 15:21.440
of which I'm a member has been working on holding hearings every day since almost the

15:21.440 --> 15:23.120
first of November.

15:23.120 --> 15:30.560
The military budget is up considerably, some $2.5 billion over what it was last year.

15:30.560 --> 15:37.080
And I think some substantial increase in the military budget is necessary and is justified.

15:37.080 --> 15:42.640
It was a concern to me to note right after the President set up his budget that there

15:42.640 --> 15:48.320
was a suggestion from Dr. Alan T. Waterman, the Director of the National Science Foundation

15:48.320 --> 15:53.600
that the funds requested for basic research had been substantially cut in the budget

15:53.600 --> 15:54.600
that is now before.

15:54.600 --> 15:59.600
So the question is, should we have more basic research and perhaps cut down on some other

15:59.600 --> 16:01.560
things?

16:01.560 --> 16:07.000
One thing we can be quite sure about, and that is that we get, have to give greater

16:07.000 --> 16:10.360
importance to basic research.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.280
I have here some models of some of the missiles that we have been hearing about and they

16:14.280 --> 16:15.880
prepared a subcommittee.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.320
This short one is Army Missile.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.320
It can be transported by truck.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.240
Here's a short range Air Force Missile.

16:25.240 --> 16:29.440
This is the Redstone Missile, which is made down at Huntsville, Alabama.

16:29.440 --> 16:34.800
The larger missiles, the intermediate range missiles, which go 1500 miles, they are

16:34.800 --> 16:35.800
hilarious.

16:35.800 --> 16:41.680
The far and the Jupiter are not shown here because they deal with them parts of them

16:41.680 --> 16:43.000
classified.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.840
Although they also, the ICBMs, the Titan and the Atlas, which are supposed to go 5000

16:49.840 --> 16:52.320
miles, they are not shown here.

16:52.320 --> 17:00.480
But they bring to our attention the fact that we are living in an age where speed is

17:00.480 --> 17:07.040
very great and where the space above the Earth and around the planets is going to be an

17:07.040 --> 17:10.720
increasing interest to all of us as we go on.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.480
The point that I want to make however is that all of these missiles would not have been

17:14.480 --> 17:18.720
possible unless we had had basic research.

17:18.720 --> 17:23.840
Too many people think of the scientists as a long-haired dreamer and impractical kind

17:23.840 --> 17:25.320
of person.

17:25.320 --> 17:29.680
And everybody is of the opinion that if we are going to catch up in the United States,

17:29.680 --> 17:36.200
we must treat our scientists better, pay them more respect, and know the importance of

17:36.200 --> 17:38.200
the work that they are doing.

17:38.200 --> 17:43.440
Hundreds of years ago, one of these so-called dreamers was named Isaac Newton.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.960
He wanted to know what makes the rock fall when you throw it up.

17:46.960 --> 17:52.080
He developed a theory of gravity, and today every high school boy and girl of course knows

17:52.080 --> 17:54.880
about Newton's laws of gravity.

17:54.880 --> 18:01.360
If it hadn't been for his curiosity and of those who followed after him, then these missiles

18:01.360 --> 18:05.240
never would have been possible because it's the law of gravity that has a whole lot to

18:05.240 --> 18:11.760
do but how we are going to be able to enter into conquer and find out about space.

18:11.760 --> 18:17.760
And how our scientists today are going to be able to compete successfully in this space

18:17.760 --> 18:19.040
age.

18:19.040 --> 18:26.080
So that all of us in Washington are determined that we are going to give basic research

18:26.080 --> 18:32.080
that will enable us to hold our own in this important new age, efficient funds and attention

18:32.080 --> 18:33.080
that it deserves.

18:33.080 --> 18:38.120
You will be hearing a great deal about that from the executive and from the halls of Congress

18:38.120 --> 18:39.680
and the days to come.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.680
That's all for now.

18:40.680 --> 18:46.680
Thank you very much.

18:46.680 --> 19:05.920
Ladies and gentlemen, Friends of Tennessee.

19:05.920 --> 19:11.360
I'm very happy to have this opportunity of being back on this station and to again have

19:11.360 --> 19:16.280
the opportunity of bringing you a short report about what is going on in the nation's capital

19:16.280 --> 19:17.680
here in Washington.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.920
The time for these broadcasts is being made as a public service.

19:21.920 --> 19:25.080
I'm very grateful to this station.

19:25.080 --> 19:29.480
As in the past I will try to make the broadcast a non-political infection.

19:29.480 --> 19:34.960
It will be my effort to keep you, my friends and my constituents and constituents in Tennessee

19:34.960 --> 19:40.080
advised about what I am doing and about what the Congress is doing.

19:40.080 --> 19:45.800
The value of these broadcasts will be increased and the value of you and to me if we make it

19:45.800 --> 19:46.800
on a two-way basis.

19:46.800 --> 19:51.720
In other words, I would appreciate your comments, your suggestions, your recommendations,

19:51.720 --> 19:56.360
that's what you think is right and what you think is wrong for the various programs that

19:56.360 --> 19:58.360
we have before.

19:58.360 --> 20:03.520
Representative government works best when the people speak up and express themselves on

20:03.520 --> 20:06.120
this program that are being considered.

20:06.120 --> 20:11.440
There is no doubt that this Congress is convening in the time of great potential halibut.

20:11.440 --> 20:18.080
Since my last such broadcast to you in August of last year, we have come into a new age

20:18.080 --> 20:21.560
to, we have come into this space age.

20:21.560 --> 20:25.840
As a nation we have been thoroughly shaken by the general knowledge and information that

20:25.840 --> 20:30.840
we may not be ahead in this new age which has been inaugurated.

20:30.840 --> 20:36.440
The Soviet Union has launched two sputniks since last October and our one effort to launch

20:36.440 --> 20:39.720
a sputnik has so far better failure.

20:39.720 --> 20:46.240
I think this is temporary and we are going to catch up, but we should not under-emphasize

20:46.240 --> 20:48.920
in necessity.

20:48.920 --> 20:53.880
For our nation to exert every effort to match and keep abreast in this world of science

20:53.880 --> 20:57.960
and education and military potential.

20:57.960 --> 21:02.560
I think that there is much work for this Congress to do and that this Congress means to

21:02.560 --> 21:06.080
get down to real business and to do its part.

21:06.080 --> 21:10.760
First and foremost we must regain our position or peace in the world.

21:10.760 --> 21:15.200
This I believe is essential to our survival as a free nation.

21:15.200 --> 21:20.960
This means that we must of course in the first place show off the defenses of our country

21:20.960 --> 21:23.760
and this is going to cost us a lot of money.

21:23.760 --> 21:28.800
So the first things we have to do is to catch up in the missile and satellite race and

21:28.800 --> 21:35.440
in the effort to gain the control of space to at least get on an equal basis.

21:35.440 --> 21:40.800
I think the reasons that we have gotten behind are not just the absence of the lack of money

21:40.800 --> 21:44.880
but we haven't had the organization, we haven't had the responsibility, we haven't given

21:44.880 --> 21:49.600
it enough emphasis for the government and among our people.

21:49.600 --> 21:55.680
We must also inaugurate new and thoughtful policies and programs to regain the political

21:55.680 --> 22:02.000
and the economic leadership among the peoples of the world particularly in the free world.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.640
Furthermore I think we must take steps to see that our economy remains stable and vital

22:07.640 --> 22:11.000
here in the United States itself.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.680
Along with several other senators I joined in to introduction of legislation this week

22:15.680 --> 22:20.160
which would alleviate some of the distress that has come to the small farmers and to the

22:20.160 --> 22:22.440
people in West Tennessee particularly.

22:22.440 --> 22:27.840
Whereas the result of the rain and the floods of last year they lost their crops and that

22:27.840 --> 22:34.560
certainly they need secure loans in order to get that enable them to continue on as farmers

22:34.560 --> 22:37.480
and continue on in our economy.

22:37.480 --> 22:43.000
This Congress convened and moved to meet the problems of the day and this connection I think

22:43.000 --> 22:48.120
with President Eisenhower stated the union message was the best address that he has made

22:48.120 --> 22:49.120
during his career.

22:49.120 --> 22:54.800
He had set forth general programs that most all Americans can agree with.

22:54.800 --> 22:59.120
Most impressive was his expression of the peaceful intentions of the people of the United

22:59.120 --> 23:00.120
States.

23:00.120 --> 23:07.600
His emphasis on improved world trade, on economic assistance, on people to people contacts

23:07.600 --> 23:11.000
but his vigorous call for disarmament.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.800
The force will put plea for peace if followed up and implemented and fought for in the Congress

23:15.800 --> 23:20.280
of the United States and do much to win back to us.

23:20.280 --> 23:24.320
Many of the friends that we have lost during the last few years as a result of having no

23:24.320 --> 23:30.320
policy are as a result of vacillating about what we are going to do.

23:30.320 --> 23:34.280
I feel that the Congress will cooperate with the President in trying to get these things

23:34.280 --> 23:35.280
done.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.120
We will all work toward that end.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.160
I will be back with you next week.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.160
Thank you very much.

23:40.160 --> 24:01.120
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, the Preparedness Subcommittee of the United

24:01.120 --> 24:08.080
States Senate of which Senator Lyndon Johnson is chairman and with seven or eight members

24:08.080 --> 24:13.520
of Republicans and Democrats have just completed the hearings which were commenced shortly

24:13.520 --> 24:18.600
after the launching of the first sputnik by the Soviet Union.

24:18.600 --> 24:23.200
As Deputy Chairman of that committee, I am most regular attendant and a person who has

24:23.200 --> 24:28.560
been tremendously interested in the work of the committee, is I are distinguished neighbor,

24:28.560 --> 24:32.080
the senator from Mississippi, Senator John Stennis.

24:33.080 --> 24:40.120
He is here today to talk with us about the whole missile program and about the work

24:40.120 --> 24:41.600
of this Preparedness Subcommittee.

24:41.600 --> 24:46.480
Certainly, I am glad to have you here, John.

24:46.480 --> 24:50.480
Tell us what you think about the accomplishments of the committee.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.480
Well, let's decide.

24:51.480 --> 24:55.440
First want to say that I certainly enjoyed sitting by you during all these hearings where

24:55.440 --> 25:01.280
we all had the benefit of your fine knowledge of national as well as international affairs.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.800
We've sat in that work together.

25:04.800 --> 25:14.040
I've been impressed tremendously by the fact that we have great military power now, our

25:14.040 --> 25:18.840
feet of two long range bombers and other striking power.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.600
I think we are superior now.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.200
We could meet any threat that might be thrown at us.

25:24.200 --> 25:29.640
Second, that within two or three years from now, unless we close the gap on this missile

25:30.640 --> 25:36.640
program and catch up, we could well be a secondary military power and that means that

25:36.640 --> 25:39.640
we have to take time, we wouldn't want to take it.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.640
Now, in all these hearings, that's one of my points and all these hearings I'd just

25:43.640 --> 25:49.640
like to ask you what some of their things impressed you so in an outstanding way.

25:49.640 --> 25:55.140
Well, one thing I was impressed was, and that is that on Thursday at the conclusion of

25:55.140 --> 26:01.100
the hearing, Senator Lyndon Johnson presented a statement which was agreed to unanimously

26:01.100 --> 26:04.420
by all of the members of the committee.

26:04.420 --> 26:09.180
That is, while things might have been different, different decisions have been made in years

26:09.180 --> 26:15.140
passed by both Democratic and Republican administrations, we're not concerned about the task, but

26:15.140 --> 26:18.140
where we are going to go from here.

26:18.140 --> 26:24.340
And I felt that in the long range of ballistic missiles and also the intermediate ballistic

26:24.340 --> 26:31.620
missiles, that the Soviet Union was ahead of us at present time, that we are ahead as far

26:31.620 --> 26:35.660
as the air force is concerned, but they are increasing their rate.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.620
Did you find that, do you think that's generally true?

26:38.620 --> 26:41.180
Yes, I think that's generally true.

26:41.180 --> 26:48.180
And another thing that impressed me was that even though our scientists are fine and outstanding,

26:48.180 --> 26:55.180
that these Russians have made tremendous headway and they train more minds in that direction,

26:55.180 --> 27:02.180
and therefore that contributes to a better system of concentrating and producing these

27:02.180 --> 27:05.180
terrible weapons and missiles as well as others.

27:05.180 --> 27:11.180
In other words, in our education that they have put more stress on scientists and physicists

27:11.180 --> 27:15.780
and engineers than we have, and that if we're going to catch up and stay ahead by more

27:15.780 --> 27:20.340
of our young people are going to have to have scientific education, then we're going

27:20.340 --> 27:24.060
to have to look at scientists more and more friendly way, aren't we?

27:24.060 --> 27:28.540
We're going to have to find that talent, yes, and look at them in a more friendly way

27:28.540 --> 27:30.540
and an honest standing way and another thing.

27:30.540 --> 27:34.780
Well, I wonder if you were impressed as I was, however, that since the beginning of the

27:34.780 --> 27:39.980
hearings that we actually have made considerable progress in getting started.

27:39.980 --> 27:42.020
Oh, yes, I've been throughout learning some of the things.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.540
Well, I think we've made tremendous progress.

27:44.540 --> 27:50.380
The Department of Defense has been eluded and they've stepped up our long-range missiles,

27:50.380 --> 27:54.780
our intermediate range missiles as much as they possibly can.

27:54.780 --> 27:58.180
They've taken off their overtime restrictions.

27:58.180 --> 28:01.100
Now a satellite program is not a failure.

28:01.100 --> 28:03.980
This Vanguard matter was just one experiment.

28:03.980 --> 28:07.380
After all, that's not a failure by any means.

28:07.380 --> 28:09.780
We are getting in motion on more front side.

28:09.780 --> 28:17.540
I'm anxious that we step up our submarine program more and also step up their B-52 bombers

28:17.540 --> 28:23.180
including that long-range, manless bomber that we have which is a missile itself.

28:23.180 --> 28:28.100
Yes, and ladies and gentlemen, all of us on the committee and Senator Stenner's certainly

28:28.100 --> 28:34.260
feel that while we want to catch up insofar as missiles and weapons and air force,

28:34.260 --> 28:39.700
that eventually we want to try to work toward peace for the same determination that we are

28:39.700 --> 28:42.420
working to prepare ourselves against any attack.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.860
Certainly a pleasure to have Senator Stenner's Willis on this program.

28:45.860 --> 28:46.860
We thank a lot of you.

28:46.860 --> 28:47.860
Thank you, Senator.

28:47.860 --> 28:48.860
I know.

28:48.860 --> 28:49.860
I have to be with you.

28:49.860 --> 28:50.860
That's all for now.

28:50.860 --> 28:51.860
Goodbye.

28:58.100 --> 29:06.740
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I want to talk with you today about a new problem

29:06.740 --> 29:09.540
with which our generation is faced.

29:09.540 --> 29:15.340
Mankind is on the very verge of what may prove to be the most dramatic breakthrough in history,

29:15.340 --> 29:20.700
ranking even beyond the immense consequences of his discovery of the new world.

29:20.700 --> 29:24.540
I'm speaking of course of the venture into outer space.

29:24.540 --> 29:29.020
Soviet Union has sent two satellites orbiting around the earth.

29:29.020 --> 29:33.780
We too are entering this into space with missiles and satellites.

29:33.780 --> 29:41.860
The spaceship of science fiction, the space platforms are no longer wild figments of imagination.

29:41.860 --> 29:47.620
Nationally this creates a whole new area of international problems sooner or later.

29:47.620 --> 29:52.100
And I think it should be sooner during the infancy of this new age.

29:52.100 --> 29:57.060
We will have to set up the rules by which there will be some regulation of the exploration

29:57.060 --> 29:58.940
of outer space.

29:58.940 --> 30:02.860
It would be a great shame perhaps mankind's greatest failure.

30:02.860 --> 30:08.540
If man's wars and man's ills were extended to whatever area, he may eventually reach

30:08.540 --> 30:11.220
in the far reaches of space.

30:11.220 --> 30:16.900
Certainly we should be able to make up for many of our failures on the earth by coming

30:16.900 --> 30:23.860
to firm agreements to explore and if possible to develop these new and ever-reaching frontiers

30:23.860 --> 30:28.580
in peaceful cooperation and for peaceful ends.

30:28.580 --> 30:33.180
Men have of course space problems not entirely disassembly before.

30:33.180 --> 30:36.180
We have rules for the use of the high seas.

30:36.180 --> 30:40.700
All nations have found these rules advantageous and follow them.

30:40.700 --> 30:46.380
Despite the fact that modern weapons, navies and aircraft make possible extension of control

30:46.380 --> 30:53.500
of adjacent high seas far beyond the accepted three mile limit of any nation's sovereignty.

30:53.500 --> 31:00.460
Following the advent of the airplane, we extended by common national sovereignty, consent,

31:00.460 --> 31:03.660
into space above all of our nations.

31:03.660 --> 31:09.580
However as a practical matter, sovereignty as we know it can be extended only where it

31:09.580 --> 31:11.620
can be enforced.

31:11.620 --> 31:17.060
It is unlikely that there will ever be any means to control objects which move beyond

31:17.060 --> 31:19.580
and around the earth's orbit.

31:19.580 --> 31:26.020
The advantage is therefore of agreement on basic rules for a space exploration right now

31:26.020 --> 31:30.540
before mankind is made such an adventure become very obvious.

31:30.540 --> 31:35.740
It would be my hope that no one or three nations will make an effort to hog space through

31:35.740 --> 31:38.060
the exclusion of all others.

31:38.060 --> 31:43.260
I hope that many nations can approach the exploration of space cooperatively and that

31:43.260 --> 31:48.460
nation and that small nations as well as large and powerful ones can have a share in this

31:48.460 --> 31:50.580
endeavor.

31:50.580 --> 31:54.180
Experience indicates that we are not going to be able to make agreements with the Soviet

31:54.180 --> 31:59.300
Union which will establish peace in any one grand design.

31:59.300 --> 32:04.640
I think the fact that we agreed upon the exchange of students and other peoples with the

32:04.640 --> 32:10.080
Soviet Union just the other day showed that you can do it a piecemeal and little by

32:10.080 --> 32:11.080
little.

32:11.080 --> 32:15.680
I do believe that there are limited areas in which we can reach other agreements and this

32:15.680 --> 32:18.240
is one in which we ought to try.

32:18.240 --> 32:23.920
Let us make a sincere effort to obtain an agreement with the Soviet Union looking toward

32:23.920 --> 32:29.040
the United Nations leadership and laying down the rules and conditions for exploration

32:29.040 --> 32:35.400
of space, rules which will respect the right and hopes of the people of all nations.

32:35.400 --> 32:42.000
The United Nations is the only body that I know of which could do this and if the UN had

32:42.000 --> 32:47.480
nothing else to its credit and of course it has a great deal many things to its credit.

32:47.480 --> 32:53.240
The opportunity and the challenge to perfect and maintain peaceful penetration and exploration

32:53.240 --> 32:57.840
by man of outer space would be enough justification for its existence.

32:58.800 --> 33:02.760
I hope that the administration will move boldly into this field.

33:02.760 --> 33:08.160
I hope it makes known its desire to the Soviet Union and through the United States representative

33:08.160 --> 33:10.000
to the nations of all of the world.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.360
Of our desire not to control space but to share in its exploration and development with

33:16.360 --> 33:20.680
all other nations under a body of international law.

33:20.680 --> 33:25.800
I believe that this is something that should be done soon because sooner or later all

33:25.800 --> 33:31.360
nations will be laying out this claim and that claim and there is bound to be a conflict

33:31.360 --> 33:34.680
unless we do have some rules and regulations.

33:34.680 --> 33:39.560
The United States by taking the lead I think could gain much respect and goodwill among

33:39.560 --> 33:42.400
the people of the smaller nations of the earth.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.400
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

33:44.400 --> 33:56.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.120
I wanted to talk with you today about the current work in which I am engaged as chairman

34:02.120 --> 34:07.120
of the Senate Committee on any trust and monopoly legislation.

34:07.120 --> 34:12.960
Everyone with whom I talk these days is concerned greatly about the current business recession

34:12.960 --> 34:17.440
and most certainly this is true in Tennessee where unemployment has been rising in the

34:17.440 --> 34:23.720
cities and where the farmers who are using the hit first in these recessions and are suffering

34:23.720 --> 34:25.760
real hardships.

34:25.760 --> 34:31.240
Now along with Senators Eastland, Fulbright in Sammington, I have sponsored legislation designed

34:31.240 --> 34:37.240
to loosen the tight credit restrictions on farmers so they can get back on their feet.

34:37.240 --> 34:42.280
We have been partially successful thus far and we intend to keep on working at this until

34:42.280 --> 34:44.440
we are fully successful.

34:44.440 --> 34:50.080
We haven't had very much cooperation from the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Benson.

34:50.080 --> 34:55.760
So this week we took our cause and presented it to the White House where we hope to get

34:55.760 --> 34:57.920
a little better cooperation.

34:57.920 --> 35:02.760
The situation is really bad in Tennessee particularly in the western part of the vomitting

35:02.760 --> 35:03.760
state.

35:03.760 --> 35:09.800
I am interested in proposals which will spur needed public improvement and thereby give

35:09.800 --> 35:12.120
additional employment in the cities.

35:12.120 --> 35:19.120
However these things we all admit are to the economy what a tough hill is to adopt.

35:19.120 --> 35:25.000
They give you a boost but they neither diagnose, nor cure the underlying knowledge.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.640
Our committee has been at work a long time, pains taking the trying to diagnose one part

35:30.640 --> 35:34.080
of what we believe to be a fundamental topic.

35:34.080 --> 35:40.360
What is or any trust laws really working in a way which will encourage full production,

35:40.360 --> 35:45.680
full employment, full flowering of our productive pre-entipized economy.

35:45.680 --> 35:49.680
Do they really encourage competition?

35:49.680 --> 35:53.920
We examine this problem in one of our basic industries, steel.

35:53.920 --> 35:59.560
We found very little evidence of real competition there and now we are examining this same problem

35:59.560 --> 36:03.560
in another basic industry, automobile.

36:03.560 --> 36:09.000
What happens to the automobile industry is our transcending importance to all of us because

36:09.000 --> 36:15.240
one out of every seven persons in the United States depend either directly or indirectly

36:15.240 --> 36:18.800
on the automobile industry or a livelihood.

36:18.800 --> 36:23.480
Let me show you two charts which we have been studying in our hearing.

36:23.480 --> 36:30.320
This chart shows the situation in the automobile industry with general motors as of the first

36:30.320 --> 36:36.240
of this year having more than 50% of all of the automobiles making that net.

36:36.240 --> 36:44.320
A forward about 25%, a Chrysler about 17%, and the American motors and student-backed

36:44.320 --> 36:47.840
record making only about 3%.

36:47.840 --> 36:51.840
Only really three industries in the automobile industry.

36:51.840 --> 36:58.400
You will see by this chart that general motors has a very dominant position as a leader and

36:58.400 --> 37:04.000
there is really very little competition in the farest place between the big three.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.320
Now here is another chart that shows this position of general motors of the total value

37:09.320 --> 37:13.680
of shipments and the transportation vehicles.

37:13.680 --> 37:18.040
Take locomotive, for instance, they are just in automobiles, they are in a lot of other

37:18.040 --> 37:19.040
things.

37:19.040 --> 37:22.040
locomotive, almost 70%.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.840
locomotives switching type about 50%.

37:24.840 --> 37:40.680
Now these charts show the part of the problem that we find that is an unbalanced concentration

37:40.680 --> 37:41.680
of economic power.

37:41.680 --> 37:46.880
Whether this is good or bad for the country the committee has not yet said.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.720
Our studies are still in their early stage.

37:49.720 --> 37:54.120
But this we do know that the results as of now are not good.

37:54.120 --> 37:59.240
For end industries we have studied production is down and way down.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.640
This is certainly true of steel.

38:00.640 --> 38:04.640
For only 55% of our steel capacity is being used.

38:04.640 --> 38:10.800
It is true of automobile and of course this results in a great deal of unemployment.

38:10.800 --> 38:17.160
We in the United States cannot maintain our place in the world here on this earth and

38:17.160 --> 38:23.960
we cannot compete with the Soviets and trade and must be utilized our own productive genius

38:23.960 --> 38:25.760
at 12 capacity.

38:25.760 --> 38:30.040
We are not doing that when our basic industries are running at half-drawling.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.160
What we have got to do is to push the throttle forward.

38:33.160 --> 38:51.680
Thank you and goodbye and we will next week.

38:51.680 --> 38:56.920
The ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, a proposal which I have previously discussed

38:56.920 --> 39:01.360
with you on this program, got a fine push forward this week.

39:01.360 --> 39:06.040
Last fall you will remember I attended the NATO Parliamentarians conference as a member

39:06.040 --> 39:08.640
of the United States delegation.

39:08.640 --> 39:12.800
The conference composed of representatives of parliament and congresses of all of the

39:12.800 --> 39:17.480
NATO nations met in the NATO headquarters in Paris.

39:17.480 --> 39:21.640
They honored me by electing me chairman of the political committee.

39:21.640 --> 39:27.320
This political committee proposed a resolution which I feel is a long step forward in our

39:27.320 --> 39:32.920
constant search for ways and means by which we may obtain a more durable method of assuring

39:32.920 --> 39:33.920
peace.

39:33.920 --> 39:39.520
The committee proposed a resolution recommending that the NATO governments bring about a conference

39:39.520 --> 39:46.000
composed of leading representatives citizens of the various countries selected on a nonpartisan

39:46.000 --> 39:50.600
basis and directed to convenes often as necessary.

39:50.600 --> 39:55.960
In order to examine and to recommend how greater cooperation and unity of purpose within

39:55.960 --> 39:59.040
the Atlantic community may be developed.

39:59.040 --> 40:04.800
Now what is the need of such a conference and what might we hope that it would accomplish?

40:04.800 --> 40:09.480
The need is evident every time that you pick up the paper to read and read of another

40:09.480 --> 40:10.800
answer to it.

40:10.800 --> 40:16.040
In NATO we have all agreed that the defense of one of us is important to the survival of

40:16.040 --> 40:17.040
all of us.

40:17.600 --> 40:22.720
Yet we frequently find occasions when our various nations are going along separate paths and

40:22.720 --> 40:25.240
in the version direction.

40:25.240 --> 40:28.080
Such an occasion was Suez crisis.

40:28.080 --> 40:31.360
The Tunisian arms incident of last year.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.640
The Hungarian revolution.

40:33.640 --> 40:38.840
And just this week when French planes bombed the Tunisian border town.

40:38.840 --> 40:43.240
An act which could have serious repercussions in the United Nations.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.720
And in which unfortunately American planes were used.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.360
We had a new example of this problem.

40:49.360 --> 40:55.080
The problem therefore is to work out some method by which we could have some prior consultation

40:55.080 --> 40:58.600
and consideration before these acts are committed.

40:58.600 --> 41:03.560
Some method by which we can be sure that we are all going in the same political and economic

41:03.560 --> 41:04.560
direction.

41:04.560 --> 41:11.360
For without common purposes we will not be, we will not long be militarily our scientific

41:11.360 --> 41:12.360
allies.

41:12.920 --> 41:17.480
Now the governments have worked on this on a government-to-government basis for a long

41:17.480 --> 41:18.480
time.

41:18.480 --> 41:21.960
We members of parliament and Congresses have worked at it.

41:21.960 --> 41:26.520
But I frankly don't think that we are going to be solved unless we bring about the best

41:26.520 --> 41:30.280
minds of all of our nations among our citizens.

41:30.280 --> 41:35.520
We can speak freely because they would not be officially representing their governments.

41:35.520 --> 41:40.920
Also to bear in this really thoroughgoing study of this problem.

41:40.920 --> 41:46.120
We would hope to accomplish the means by which unity of action might be achieved.

41:46.120 --> 41:53.280
This week, Theodore Francis Green of Rhode Island, the Senate Chairman of the Senate Committee

41:53.280 --> 41:58.600
on Foreign Relations, introduced a resolution in the Senate calling upon the President to

41:58.600 --> 42:03.080
implement our resolution and to help bring about this conference.

42:03.080 --> 42:08.840
I joined Senator Green in his resolution and he was also joined by Senator Solvenstole

42:08.840 --> 42:14.400
Massachusetts in Javits of New York, both Republicans and by Senator Henry Jackson and

42:14.400 --> 42:16.400
Washington and Democrat.

42:16.400 --> 42:22.040
I am hopeful that with this display of important and bipartisan interests in the proposal which

42:22.040 --> 42:27.600
are committed tariffs and which was unanimously approved there by the delegates of all of

42:27.600 --> 42:32.280
the NATO nations that the conference will be called this year.

42:32.280 --> 42:37.360
There is one other thing that I wanted to mention on this occasion.

42:37.360 --> 42:42.680
All of us became have become concerned by the new evidence that all is not well with

42:42.680 --> 42:45.320
our economy domestically.

42:45.320 --> 42:52.920
In the face of a rise in January of 1,100,000 unemployed, the post-mester general announced

42:52.920 --> 42:58.080
that post office modernization program to make work an employment.

42:58.080 --> 43:02.360
And the President said that other things will be done if the picture doesn't change next

43:02.360 --> 43:03.680
month.

43:03.680 --> 43:08.380
I want to say that one of the best things the President could do in the far as I region

43:08.380 --> 43:14.200
is concerned would be to really get behind the TVA self-financing bill and help pass it

43:14.200 --> 43:16.720
in the House of Representatives.

43:16.720 --> 43:22.000
Then we could start building steam plants and at no cost whatever to the federal government.

43:22.000 --> 43:27.120
And in addition to the work of building these steam plants, we would have a continuing economic

43:27.120 --> 43:33.440
spur to the economy through the years which comes from having adequate electric power.

43:33.440 --> 43:40.440
Thank you and goodbye until next week.

43:40.440 --> 43:51.640
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, in the present Congress as well as in several

43:51.640 --> 43:58.560
past congresses, two of the most important issues before the American people has been the

43:58.560 --> 44:05.800
effort to prevent the taking away of the regulation of the federal power commission of the producers

44:05.800 --> 44:07.280
of natural gas.

44:07.280 --> 44:12.400
If this regulation were taken away, they consumers would have to pay more and more for their natural

44:12.400 --> 44:13.400
gas.

44:13.400 --> 44:20.120
Also, we've had an issue for a long time of urban renewal trying to change the face

44:20.120 --> 44:24.200
and eliminate the slums in some of our major cities.

44:24.200 --> 44:27.000
This is a most important problem.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.560
So it happens that in Tennessee we have had the leader among the mayors of the nation

44:32.560 --> 44:35.880
on the right side of these two issues.

44:35.880 --> 44:41.360
The man that I'm referring to is our guest today and we certainly are delighted to have

44:41.360 --> 44:45.800
Mayor Ben West to the city of Nashville is our guest here today.

44:45.800 --> 44:46.800
Thank you, Senator.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.040
It's certainly nice to be here.

44:50.040 --> 44:53.120
Mayor West was in town on official business and I asked him down.

44:53.120 --> 45:00.040
Now the situation about the natural gas bill is that the Jack Porter, the Republican

45:00.040 --> 45:06.480
National Committeeman in Texas wrote a letter in connection with raising funds for a public

45:06.480 --> 45:12.320
and dinner which turned out to be very bad publicity and it made this aniquitous bill

45:12.320 --> 45:14.360
maybe put off for some time.

45:14.360 --> 45:21.040
But Mayor West has chairman last year of the American Municipal Association and has

45:21.040 --> 45:25.680
put chairman along with Mayor Wagner of New York as the committee to oppose this natural

45:25.680 --> 45:29.280
gas bill has done effective in human service.

45:29.280 --> 45:33.880
Now will you tell us about the bill and what you think about it, what it would do to Tennessee

45:33.880 --> 45:34.880
and what it is.

45:34.880 --> 45:41.680
Senator, I think first I ought to say to you that the gas consumers in Nashville particularly

45:41.680 --> 45:46.560
and all over the state of Tennessee are grateful to you for the great fight that you have made

45:46.560 --> 45:52.160
against the Harris O'Hara bill which would eliminate from regulation the producers of

45:52.160 --> 46:00.080
natural gas and of course when they are eliminated by any cost that is increased would just be

46:00.080 --> 46:01.080
passed on down.

46:01.080 --> 46:07.520
You might as well get control altogether for going to forget the control of the producers.

46:07.520 --> 46:11.640
We're very grateful to you and to the entire Tennessee delegation.

46:11.640 --> 46:17.120
The whole delegation is unanimous in opposition to the Harris O'Hara bill.

46:17.120 --> 46:22.600
Mayor Wagner of New York and Richardson Delworth of Philadelphia and Frank Zidler of Milwaukee

46:22.600 --> 46:26.480
and others from gas consuming areas.

46:26.480 --> 46:29.720
We're all very grateful to you for looking out after our people.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.080
Well, it's most important matter.

46:32.080 --> 46:38.840
It would have resulted in millions of dollars increase in gas rates we think and heard our

46:38.840 --> 46:39.840
section's valid.

46:39.840 --> 46:40.840
We're grateful to you.

46:40.920 --> 46:45.800
Well, all of our members of our delegation in the Senate and House have worked hard to

46:45.800 --> 46:50.280
try to keep the bill but just because it may be put off this time there's no reason why

46:50.280 --> 46:52.040
we should relinquish our efforts.

46:52.040 --> 46:53.040
Correct.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.040
Correct.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.040
Certainly correct.

46:55.040 --> 46:59.480
While we have just a few minutes remaining, I want to ask you about the Urban Renewal

46:59.480 --> 47:00.480
Program.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.480
You've testified up here before committees.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.640
You've been fighting for it as a chairman of the Mayor's delegation.

47:05.640 --> 47:11.920
We know that you're lifting the face of Nashville so to speak for this great program.

47:11.920 --> 47:15.160
How important is this to Nashville and Tennessee?

47:15.160 --> 47:21.840
Senator, without Urban Renewal, our towns and cities are going to die.

47:21.840 --> 47:26.240
It costs taxpayers a lot of money to maintain slums and they're beginning to realize

47:26.240 --> 47:27.240
it.

47:27.240 --> 47:32.680
Businessmen understand these cities and towns have to be renewed and this old rotten and decaying

47:32.680 --> 47:34.920
area has to be dealt with.

47:34.920 --> 47:42.760
And so we appreciate also your efforts in this respect to the towns and cities of Tennessee.

47:42.760 --> 47:48.400
I have some figures here showing that for a five year period the needs of our towns and

47:48.400 --> 47:53.120
cities in Tennessee amount to $53 million.

47:53.120 --> 47:59.000
And this program is absolutely a must for municipal administration.

47:59.000 --> 48:04.160
Well your testimony up here has made the program possible as you've effectively presented

48:04.160 --> 48:10.480
