00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
The booze and balihoo of prohibition spawned the shadowy and sinister organization known as crime and corporate.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
A sprawling empire, it is reputedly ruled by such men as Frank Castello.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
In 1950, Senator Estes Kefava challenges Castello and the Underworld.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
This is a story of men in crisis.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Death in the streets is the harsh and brutal signature of the 1920s.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
For these are the years of prohibition, when bootleggers pile up enormous fortunes making and selling illegal liquor.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
And to protect their empires, they recruit small armies of gunmen and killers.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
The public is intrigued by the exploits of the bootleggers and their henchmen.

01:53.000 --> 02:03.000
Gangsters become folk heroes like the notorious Tugun Crowley and his 16-year-old sweetheart captured after a day-long gun battle in a crowded city street.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
Even the newspapers portray the criminal as a kind of legendary, almost mythological warrior.

02:10.000 --> 02:21.000
A few spectacular arrests fail to stem the flow of bootlegg liquor.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
To the underworld, prohibition is a bonanza yielding an estimated $500 million a year.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
In 1933, however, prohibition is finally repealed.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
The days of bootlegging end, the gangsters who dominated this colorful era are also marked for extinction.

02:41.000 --> 02:50.000
The most glamorous John Dillinger, his career soon ends when he is gunned down by the FBI.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
Devonad Dutch Shus, the dandy of the protection rackets, is riddled with bullets by a rival gang.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
When Scarface Al Capone is indicted for income tax evasion, the wild and woolly gangster epic comes to an end.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
For almost 15 years during prohibition, the bedrock of survival for the gangs was organization.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Now the mainstay of their economy has vanished. They must seek new avenues.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Criminal leaders ban together, forming the syndicate.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
The country is divided into territories of bookmaking, vice, narcotics, gambling.

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
Organized crime becomes so vast and powerful, its arteries of corruption permeate all strut of society.

03:36.000 --> 03:49.000
The estimated return from backdoor gambling rooms and nationwide bookmaking operations reaches the astronomical sun of $20 billion a year.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Even the nickel pinball machine pays off.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I want you to pay for this.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I want you to pay for this.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Epee, hey, hey, hey.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
That's a bit of a draw. That was right too.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
It is in the cities that the cycle of corruption begins.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
With the use of a hidden camera, the operation of the numbers game is revealed.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
The racket brings an astonishing return.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
In New York alone, the income is calculated to be $250 million a year.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
The seemingly innocent facade of the Corners' Agarastore serves as an outpost for the criminal syndicate.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It takes only a nickel or dime to play.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
The payoff for picking the right three digit number is 600 to 1.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
The odds against hitting a number are almost 1,000 to 1.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
To protect this golden pipeline from interference, police must be paid to look the other way.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
And so, organized crime threatens the very structure of society.

05:12.000 --> 05:23.000
In 1951, one man begins to talk about the sinister mechanisms of organized crime.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
He is headed to Estes, Keefala.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
I think it should be brought to the attention of the public that the gangster, the modern day gangster,

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
is quite a different sort of person than they used to be during the 1920s, during the Al Capone days.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Today, they try to put on more respectability.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
They have more money.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
They dress better. They try to travel in better society and join the clubs.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
And try to gain respectability.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
But there's still the old racketeer methods present in the exercise of what they do today,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
even in many cases when they get into legitimate business.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
In many ways, Keefala is exactly the right man to launch a crusade against crime.

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
Raised amid the rolling green hills of Tennessee, Keefala is an impish child who learns to recite legal quotations

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
before most of his friends can add a subtract.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
A school baseball star, big bill, as he is called, goes on to become a big city lawyer.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
But Estes, Keefala, would rather shape the law than practice it.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
By 1947, he has engaged in a rough and tumble political battle for a seat in the United States Senate.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
He had spent eight years in the House of Representatives, acquired an unobtrusive legislator.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
He had effectively become an expert in illegal business combines and administrative corruption.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
People respond not to his record, but to the sense of strength, the warmth and sincerity he radiates.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
A D.A.J. of 45 in a stunning upset victory, Estes Keefala becomes the junior senator from the state of Tennessee.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
As a senator, he decides to launch an unprecedented crusade.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
While he was a congressman, Keefala had uncovered evidence of corruption and government,

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
and he is sure that at its root are the crime syndicates.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
He resolves to use the investigative powers of the Senate to crack the syndicates.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
He knows this is a brash political move. He might jeopardize his career.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
He might be pushing too far, too fast.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
But with great tenacity, he persists in his efforts.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
It takes this hard-driving senator only a year to be thrust into the spotlight,

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
as chairman of the Special Senate Committee to investigate organized crime in America.

08:15.000 --> 08:24.000
The Committee, counseled by the brilliant Rudolf Halley, composed of senators Alexander Wiley, Herbidokana, Estes Keefala,

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Charles Toby will soon become one of the most publicized in history.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
In March 1951, the Keefala Committee is in New York, believed to be the center of the criminal access.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
For almost a year, the Committee has carefully gathered information in some thirteen cities.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
The American will you state any legitimate occupation?

08:49.000 --> 08:57.000
Keefala has learned that some testimony will be valid, but many times, the questions will be more revealing than the answers.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Keefala has subpoenaed a colorful cast of characters to testify.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
All of them he charges are wise in the ways of crime.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
All he claims date their association with the syndicate from the time of prohibition.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
Jirubik Frank Erickson, a led czar of a $2 billion bookmaking ring.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
Dapper Joe Adonis, head of the estimated $250 million policy rackets.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
Paul The Wighter Rieker, called the labor boss, specializing in protection.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
Jake Greasy-Thum Gusik, the leader of the Midwestern bookmaking ring, valued at $500 million.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
Albert Anastasia, notorious leader of murder and corporated.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
Maya Lansky, reputed kingpin of the $250 million lottery rackets.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
Top Tony Anastasia, waterfront boss.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
For the first time through television, the Senate hearings captured the attention of the American public.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
Millions of people watch fascinated as the witnesses unveiled the misty workings of the underworld.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
You saw Maya Odua? Yes sir.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
And when you tell the committee what transpired.

10:23.000 --> 10:34.000
I told the mayor at that time I had promised him the support of the Feynman and I offered him some evidence of that support on the occasion in a form of $10,000.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
For most people have never seen a gangster except in a gangster movie.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
It is entertainment on a big scale.

10:41.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm sure some questions are not partner. Some may lead or tend to a criminal.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Have you, where did you get this phrase you've been using all the time?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
I've heard it on a television news.

10:58.000 --> 11:09.000
One of the witnesses to appear is Virginia Hill Hauser.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
She will be questioned about her relationship with the West Coast mobster Ben Siegel known as Bugsy.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
If she was friendly with him she must know his acquaintances how they operate.

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
In her own words Virginia Hill Hauser describes what it's like to be a friend of the underworld.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Get any money from a subdeleau? No.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
And did you ever get any money from my own?

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
I never got money from any of those fellows. None of those fellows.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
None of these that I've been reading about and none that I knew they never gave me anything.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
The men I was around gave me things were not gangsters or racketeers or whatever you call these other people.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
The only time I ever got anything from them was going out and having fun.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
It made me a few presence. When I was with Ben he caved for everything.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
By Ben you mean Ben Siegel.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
And he gave me some money too.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Bought me a house in Florida.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Did you have a patient to make hot cello?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
I don't know.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't know.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
I don't know anything.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm afraid I'll win and then they'll say I made more money than I did.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
To build the wall of indictment around the criminal syndicate witnesses other than criminals are brought in.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
Men like the former mayor of New York William O'Duire and his argument with New Hampshire Senator Charles Toby

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
spotlight the possibility of criminal influence in government agencies.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
I wonder who the bookmakers in Brettonwood support for public office in New Hampshire.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
Well I'll tell you one that didn't support. He's talking to you now and you know it.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
Well I can tell you Senator don't know who supported you because you sat down here to New York for money to help in the primaries

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
and for money to help you in your election and you got it and you're dealt now where it came from.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
You didn't send down to New York for a single dollar. You called up. I did not.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I'll know. Would you like to go under that? Yes I would.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
All right. I challenge you. Well I'm under oath and you're an ozzer.

13:31.000 --> 13:38.000
Well I'll take the oath right now. If you'll give it to Mr. Chairman. I hate a forefusher.

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
The Keefowler Committee claims that one man appears to control the entire criminal empire, Frank Castello.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
As Keefowler he will be our next witness.

13:53.000 --> 14:09.000
March 1951 in Foley Square a flurry of excitement. Frank Castello will testify.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
Convicted in 1915 for carrying a concealed weapon. Frank Castello is sentenced to one year in prison.

14:16.000 --> 14:25.000
Never again he vows. Will he be put behind bars?

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
During prohibition Castello reportedly establishes a gigantic rum running ring.

14:30.000 --> 14:44.000
Resembling a huge corporation there are traffic and distribution departments, a corruption department, specializing in bribes, and a squad of gunmen to squelch ambitious rivals.

14:48.000 --> 14:58.000
After prohibition the slot machine becomes Castello's personal domain. As the King of Slots his estimated return is some $10,000 a day.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
It is virtually a nickel and dime empire.

15:05.000 --> 15:17.000
When he allegedly spits in the eye of New York's mayor LaGuardia the little flower launches a personal vendetta to purge New York of what he terms the negative corruption.

15:17.000 --> 15:34.000
Politicians know these slot machines about the meanest device of law it was ever invented. The plan never had a chance.

15:34.000 --> 15:49.000
But LaGuardia's efforts have little effect. Castello is undaunted. He has money, prestige, power. He is big time now. And in city after city from New Orleans to Chicago, from Detroit to Los Angeles.

15:49.000 --> 15:57.000
Frank Castello has created an empire and he is Lord and Master of it all.

15:57.000 --> 16:17.000
Now he must testify before the key father committee. He knows a careless praise, a chance slip of the tongue, could mean disaster, the end of his power. But he is relaxed, confident, unappraised.

16:17.000 --> 16:36.000
Testifying will be only a minor inconvenience, a slight irritation, nothing more. For 35 years the law has been desperately seeking some way to link him with organized crime.

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
But their efforts have failed. He has remained aloof, lazily laughing at their attempts.

16:44.000 --> 16:55.000
Frank Castello is risen from small time punk to reputed over Lord of crime. Even now on the stand he insists that only his hands be televised.

16:55.000 --> 17:12.000
He has brains, wealth and influential friends. For he mingles with the best people, judges, congressmen, even senators. And it is the possibility of Castello's influencing these people that key father wants to make public.

17:13.000 --> 17:21.000
And your anthem at the Castello, we might have spoken, yes. I imagine we might have a saying start for something you know.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh that's not a problem. What would that be saying a few kind words for him? No absolutely not.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
For the judgment, you said you were against him? No I didn't, I took no part.

17:35.000 --> 17:50.000
Well what did you talk to Judge McHugh about, with relation to the delegate? Matter. Well I just don't remember but I'm sure that I didn't look to support him and I had no time waste for him or anyone else.

17:50.000 --> 17:58.000
But you might have favored him. I don't know who I might have favored. Well we were talking about Judge Bellatti where I'm from.

17:59.000 --> 18:12.000
Well I couldn't tell you right now who I might have favored. I might have favored. Yes. Well you're on a might of basis but you're talking about a man or Mr. O'Dwara stated at your support.

18:12.000 --> 18:22.000
And I think it's up to you to say whether or not not whether you might have spoken to several leaders about the candidacy of Valenti for Saragate.

18:23.000 --> 18:32.000
I don't think I disagree with Mr. O'Dwara. I don't think he said he made that statement, he could have never made that statement.

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
He made it. Well I can't help what statement he makes. I'll make it one now.

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
Keifal the Hammers away at what appears to be an insignificant point. How much money Castello has in a strong box?

18:47.000 --> 18:55.000
He wants to show that Castello has a mass such an enormous fortune that he seems to place no value on the money at his fingertips.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
Answer I wouldn't know. Question is impossible that you have over ten thousand dollars in it. Answer I wouldn't know.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
Question why would you know how much cash you have in your strong box? Answer because I have no occasion to look.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
Question why would you know how much cash you have in your strong box? Answer I wouldn't know what cash I have in my country.

19:15.000 --> 19:22.000
Question do you have one hundred thousand dollars in cash in that strong box? Answer I said I would not know.

19:22.000 --> 19:33.000
Question why did you decide to take out naturalization papers and...

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
America has given Castello everything but he is totally unprepared for Senator Toby's question.

19:39.000 --> 19:48.000
Why did you want to be an American citizen? Well I, of course, I love this country.

19:49.000 --> 19:58.000
Baring in mind all that you've gained and received in wealth, what have you ever done for your country as a good citizen?

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
Well I don't know what you claim, what you mean by that.

20:05.000 --> 20:12.000
Well you're looking back over the years. And now, to that time when you became a citizen, I'm in outstanding 20 odd years after that.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
You must have in your mind something you've done that you can speak up to your credit as an American citizen if so, what are they?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Paid by tax.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Tax.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
Keyfauver has exposed the enormous influence of Frank Castello to the American public.

20:35.000 --> 20:42.000
Often the questions have revealed more than the answers but now the questions are coming too close to home.

20:42.000 --> 20:50.000
Castello knows of his time to stop. Seeding with anger is throat sore and hoarse. Frank Castello has had enough.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
I have a question. Hanson questions. So I feel fully well in case of those.

20:56.000 --> 21:06.000
I, Mr. Castello, I wouldn't strain your voice if you just put the mic up a little closer so we can hear.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Met the Castello.

21:08.000 --> 21:15.000
You know, Mr. Jane was a major. You were directed to answer for short while. I think you can answer a few questions this afternoon.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
I don't care to answer any questions, Mr. Cezardo.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
Well, it's not a matter whether you care to answer them. It's not a matter of...

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
I don't feel I'm fit to answer any questions today.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
You refuse to testify, Father.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Absolutely.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
You ask questions, Mr. Halley, and we'll see.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
Senator, I want to figure out my health situation. I'm only here as a witness. And I want to protect myself.

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
When I testify, I want to testify truthfully. And I can't, my mind don't function.

21:50.000 --> 22:01.000
Well, you seem to... your mind seems to be functioning pretty well. You seem to be able to understand things pretty well, Mr. Castello.

22:01.000 --> 22:08.000
Am I defending in the squad room? No. Am I under arrest? No.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm under arrest.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
All the respect for the sound which I have to look at.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Not for all the respect for them. I'm not going to answer any other question.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
You're just... because I'm not under arrest and I'm going to walk out.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
Now, I should explain to you exactly what the legal situation is.

22:25.000 --> 22:35.000
You are under the painter. And if, as I assume, the chairman instructs you to remain and answer questions,

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
you will thereby become guilty of contempt of the Senate committee.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
And just to admit it, Mr. Walley, just to admit it, Mr. Stello.

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
You don't mean that... will you, as ever, resource in our command to see that he's both to contempt and that he's arrested by the United States Senate?

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
And so, with Castello's defiance, the hearings end.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
Too many, the results are inconclusive. A grandstand play.

23:06.000 --> 23:17.000
The nucleus of crime still remains. But Estes Keefala and his committee have produced the most detailed portrait of organized crime in a generation.

23:17.000 --> 23:24.000
I'm sure that you have witnessed the shocking criminal conditions which exist in some parts of the United States.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
And also the contemptuous attitude of certain witnesses we have had before us who refuse to testify.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
We will make our recommendations to the Federal Congress and we hope to secure the passage of some legislation that will help.

23:39.000 --> 23:52.000
But in this fight against the cartel of crime, it is going to take the all-out effort not only of the federal government but of state and local governments, and especially of the individual citizen.

23:52.000 --> 24:00.000
But I've always felt that when the people knew the facts that they would find a remedy, and that they will do so in this case.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
Frank Castello is one of the thousands of young men raised on New York's lower east side.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
He has achieved what most of them dreamed of, wealth, influence, power.

24:13.000 --> 24:23.000
But now, in the spring of 1952, the 61-year-old Prime Minister has sentenced to five years in prison for contempt of the Keefala committee.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
In the unwritten code of the underworld, he has become tarnished with the stigma of publicity and prison.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
No longer will he wield his enormous power.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
Later, an unknown assassin will make an unsuccessful attempt on his life.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
Because of the Senate crime hearings, Esther's Keefala is catapulted into the national spotlight.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
In Congress, he has no longer the unknown junior senator from Tennessee. He has a name, recognition.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
The passage of legislation is only the beginning for the law cannot legislate morality.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
He knows this is merely the prelude. The real job is yet to be done.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Now, the people must take up the crime.
