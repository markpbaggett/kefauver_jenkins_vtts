00:00.000 --> 00:25.440
Senator Keephover, face the nation.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.360
As the Senate Committee conduct hearings on the cost of wonder drugs, you're about to

00:29.360 --> 00:33.760
see the chairman of that committee, the former Democratic candidate for Vice President,

00:33.760 --> 00:36.840
Senator Estes Keephover, face the nation.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.120
In a spontaneous and unrehearsed interview with veteran correspondents from the nation's

00:41.120 --> 00:46.760
press, Robert Roth of the Philadelphia Bulletin, Charles Von Fremde of CDS News, and Warren

00:46.760 --> 00:49.360
Duffy of United Press International.

00:49.360 --> 00:54.640
And now here is the moderator of face the nation, CDS News correspondent Stuart Novens.

00:54.640 --> 00:59.360
Governor Nelson Rockefeller's withdrawal from the Republican presidential race is generally

00:59.360 --> 01:03.920
taken as meaning that Vice President Nixon will be uncontested at the GOP convention and

01:03.920 --> 01:07.960
that he will emerge as the Republican nominee.

01:07.960 --> 01:12.400
This puts into even sharper focus than before the situation among the Democrats where there

01:12.400 --> 01:15.320
is no clear cut front runner.

01:15.320 --> 01:21.360
Senator Estes Keephover, who was the Vice Presidential nominee in 1956, or the Democratic Party,

01:21.360 --> 01:26.160
may have some views on that situation and he's here now to face the nation.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.720
Senator, apart from party politics, your investigation at the drug industry and major professional

01:30.720 --> 01:34.680
sports and the fact that Congress will be coming back in about 10 days or also matters

01:34.680 --> 01:36.360
that we'd like to discuss.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.040
So if you would, let's take this first question from Mr. Duffy.

01:39.040 --> 01:43.640
Well, Senator Duffy, what's wrong with Governor Rockefeller first is the one thing that

01:43.640 --> 01:48.520
everybody is talking about here in Washington, I think, probably everywhere else in the country.

01:48.520 --> 01:53.600
In your opinion, you feel this is going to make it easier or harder for the Democrats

01:53.600 --> 01:55.600
to elect the President in 1960.

01:55.600 --> 02:01.960
Mr. Duffy, I think it will make it easier and I think that his withdrawal will cause

02:01.960 --> 02:05.560
the Democrats to fight harder to win the campaign.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.680
I think it's unfortunate from the viewpoint of the public interest and from the Republican

02:09.680 --> 02:15.840
party that the rank and file Republicans are not having a contest, not to be able to

02:15.840 --> 02:22.240
decide whether they like Rockefeller better or Nixon better.

02:22.240 --> 02:28.300
There won't be any discussion of a foreign policy and high interest rates in the Republican

02:28.300 --> 02:29.300
ranks.

02:29.300 --> 02:34.520
It shows that the oligarch Republicans are in complete control and Rockefeller apparently

02:34.520 --> 02:36.280
decided he didn't have a chance.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.320
Of course, that's not true of us Democrats.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.360
We have a lot of fine people who are candidates.

02:42.360 --> 02:48.200
Let me make it very clear that I have no national plans whatsoever and I'm not planning

02:48.200 --> 02:49.200
to be one.

02:49.200 --> 02:55.520
Senator Keifal, are our parties wide open and we do have some fine people and they'll be

02:55.520 --> 02:56.760
running in the prime areas.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.880
I think it would have been fine if Nixon, Mr. Nixon and Governor Rockefeller had run

03:00.880 --> 03:05.200
in some of the prime areas to give the people a chance.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.200
That's what we lead in this country.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.000
Senator Keifal, have you indicated indirectly anyhow that you think that Nixon will be

03:12.000 --> 03:15.320
easier to beat than Rockefeller?

03:15.320 --> 03:19.600
Of course, public opinion polls ever since 1948 had been somewhat suspect but nevertheless

03:19.600 --> 03:24.680
they do show Nixon running ahead of any of the Democratic possibilities.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.640
I wonder why you figure that Nixon can be beaten?

03:28.640 --> 03:32.520
Well, of course we have so many Democratic possibilities.

03:32.520 --> 03:38.600
Our public opinion expressions are spread among several candidates whereas in the case

03:38.600 --> 03:43.000
of Nixon, it's just been between him and Rockefeller.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.240
Then furthermore, this is a very dangerous time when one person may decide whether we're

03:48.240 --> 03:57.680
going to have an atomic war or not and I think his time goes on that a lot of people

03:57.680 --> 04:00.680
wouldn't want to place that confidence in Mr. Nixon.

04:00.680 --> 04:05.880
I think it's a nice fellow personally but I want to Democrat to be present with the United

04:05.880 --> 04:06.880
States.

04:06.880 --> 04:13.000
Senator, it's been said by many Democrats perhaps you agree that if Nixon is the candidate,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.920
the Democratic Party will be more united than it would be against any other candidate.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.080
Do you think that that's so?

04:20.080 --> 04:21.160
I think so, Mr. Roth.

04:21.160 --> 04:30.440
I think he's taken a very strong position against the Democratic Party from time to time.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.680
Whereas Rockefeller was considered more of a liberal.

04:33.680 --> 04:40.560
I think the independent voters and the liberals will unite in the Democratic Party more so

04:40.560 --> 04:43.800
against Nixon than what against Rockefeller.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.160
Well, it's clear enough why you're organizing.

04:46.160 --> 04:51.240
I don't want to say that I think we have an easy sailing in this race.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.760
I think we're going to win but it's going to be a tough contest.

04:54.760 --> 04:59.040
Our situation in Franklin is not as good today as it was six months ago.

04:59.040 --> 05:06.680
But I don't understand though, is why you think that Nixon's opposition will unite the Democratic

05:06.680 --> 05:07.920
Party.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.960
What is it that he has done as far as the rank and file of voters are concerned and independent

05:12.960 --> 05:15.720
voters except the mean to Democrats?

05:15.720 --> 05:21.280
Well, that's something of being mean to Democrats is something that will unite the Democrats.

05:21.280 --> 05:26.360
But I think you go back of course it's been a long history and I don't think it's worthwhile

05:26.360 --> 05:29.480
or probably appropriate to review that long history.

05:29.480 --> 05:35.080
And Simon Mr. Dixon, Nixon's campaign, he's has some pretty harsh words over the United

05:35.080 --> 05:42.000
States to say about Democrats in many various states and the Democratic rank and file and

05:42.000 --> 05:43.720
leaders haven't forgotten.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.520
Senator Keefe, former President Truman has had some pretty strong things to say about Republicans

05:47.520 --> 05:48.520
over the years too.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.520
Yes, he has, Mr. President.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.440
Well, why is it that this is something I've never been able to understand?

05:52.440 --> 05:57.360
Why it is that Democrats get so upset over things that Nixon says about them but they don't

05:57.360 --> 05:59.560
get upset over the things that they say about Republicans.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.800
Well, it's all just political give and take.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.920
Well, Mr. Truman, of course, have had our difference.

06:03.920 --> 06:08.560
I think in his big decisions he's been a great and good leader and I think he's growing

06:08.560 --> 06:11.840
in statute but he's not a candidate of either part of the president.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.640
No, but when he was a candidate he certainly had some strong things to say too.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.920
I can recall some comments about the 80th Congress he made to a pretty strong.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.520
But he didn't put it on a personal basis.

06:19.520 --> 06:24.880
Senator, you yourself had some strong things to say about some Democratic candidates at

06:24.880 --> 06:26.480
various times haven't you?

06:26.480 --> 06:29.400
I've usually expressed myself pretty freely, Mr. Raw.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.600
I can't remember exactly what you were talking about.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.400
Oh, we're quite aware there.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.880
And just a moment ago you made what I thought was very strong statement about your old

06:37.880 --> 06:40.920
neighbor and Richard Nixon only, you two used to live close together.

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
You're saying it?

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
I'm very fond of him.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
I mean, it's fine.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.680
Are you saying that you would not trust him with such important decisions as perhaps

06:47.680 --> 06:50.480
the decision whether or not to start a nuclear war?

06:50.480 --> 06:59.000
I say we're in a situation where in a little accident, both sides are armed with teeth,

06:59.000 --> 07:04.640
any accident, some misinformation might have set this war off.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.080
And I don't mean that I wouldn't trust him.

07:06.080 --> 07:10.240
I just don't think he has mature judgment as I would like to see in the White House.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.920
Well, by that, don't you imply that you wouldn't trust him with these decisions that

07:13.920 --> 07:16.120
may be in the fate of the world or the fate of the issues?

07:16.120 --> 07:18.600
I'd rather trust someone else with more experience.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.600
Other trust will move.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
Yes, naturally.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.040
Senator, you indicated a moment ago if I understood you correctly that the democratic situation

07:24.040 --> 07:26.040
was worse than it was six months ago.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.040
To what do you want to do?

07:27.040 --> 07:32.440
Well, I'll say frankly that I think Mr. Eisenhower has done a good job on his trip around

07:32.440 --> 07:33.440
the world.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.720
He's created a good impression, although that's different.

07:36.720 --> 07:42.000
That doesn't mean that the policies have been changed necessarily, but he's captured the

07:42.000 --> 07:47.360
imagination of the people, and that's given some strength to the Republican cause and

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
not opinion.

07:48.360 --> 07:55.200
And I want to say that I admire and appreciate the president for his very grueling trip.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.600
I think he's done a whole lot.

07:56.600 --> 08:01.200
He's brought a lot of goodwill, and I think he's contributed something toward the possibility

08:01.200 --> 08:02.520
of having peace in the world.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.440
Well, Senator, obviously, you can't be against peace in the world.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.760
And I'm wondering what the issues will be then.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.560
What are you going to carry your democratic campaign on?

08:10.560 --> 08:13.480
Well, we'll have the issues of peace.

08:13.480 --> 08:18.400
We'll have the issues of what our defense structure is going to be.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.200
We'll have issues of interest rates.

08:20.200 --> 08:26.120
We'll have the issue of foreign program, housing program, many, many domestic issues.

08:26.120 --> 08:32.240
Whether we're going to develop our country, or whether we're going to call a halt to

08:32.240 --> 08:36.680
building of hydroelectric facilities and building up the richness of our country, things

08:36.680 --> 08:37.680
of that sort.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.040
We'll have a lot of issues.

08:39.040 --> 08:46.000
I've just been reading the advisory council's program, and so that we've got so many issues.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.600
Senator, on the basis of those issues, which is the current Democratic hopeful who best

08:53.600 --> 08:55.600
to remit you or your kind?

08:55.600 --> 09:00.560
I'm not in position to say, because all of our democratic hopefuls say at the present

09:00.560 --> 09:02.040
time that they're not candidates.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.880
I mean, they haven't announced their candidacy.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.320
I want to see how they're going to run into primaries.

09:07.320 --> 09:11.520
I want to hear what they're going to say about public issues.

09:11.520 --> 09:17.960
They're a fine group of people, but before I make any statement, if I ever do make a statement

09:17.960 --> 09:22.520
about which one I'm going to be for, a lot of things I want to see.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.280
I imagine the primaries will eliminate some of these democratic hopefuls.

09:26.280 --> 09:31.120
So now which one do you think is ahead?

09:31.120 --> 09:34.880
I'd rather not be put to that question.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.720
I think it's a very difficult question to answer.

09:38.720 --> 09:43.160
Senator Long, at the same line, though, they posed for whatever they were in their

09:43.160 --> 09:44.960
suspect in many quarters.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.840
Polls, though, show that similar to candidate today is running ahead.

09:48.840 --> 09:53.160
But even though you are a declared non-candidate, you said that you're not running for anything

09:53.160 --> 09:55.160
but re-electing it.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.160
Senator, I'm telling you something.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.560
I want to make that a must, but I want to be in Tennessee.

09:59.560 --> 10:06.640
I don't blame you, but the fact is that even though you've been more or less out of the

10:06.640 --> 10:13.160
national contention seen for four years, that you are still running third among the democratic

10:13.160 --> 10:15.680
possibilities of the people in some of the polls.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.080
I appreciate that fact.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.600
I've been trying to get myself out of the national picture and Dr. Gallup puts me back

10:20.600 --> 10:22.800
in there, never so often.

10:22.800 --> 10:29.320
But the fact of the case is Mr. Duffy, the 1952 I campaigned in every nook and corner

10:29.320 --> 10:30.320
of the United States.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.320
I met a lot of people.

10:31.320 --> 10:37.320
I did the same thing in 1956 so that I just know a lot of people in the country.

10:37.320 --> 10:42.560
I appreciate their friendship and I appreciate the fact that many of them have expressed

10:42.560 --> 10:44.800
a favorable interest in me.

10:44.800 --> 10:50.840
But in spite of that interest, as much as I appreciated, I'm not in the national picture.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.160
Senator, when Dr. Gallup puts you back in the national picture, do you consider that a

10:54.160 --> 10:55.160
friendly act?

10:55.160 --> 10:57.360
Well, that's a flattering act.

10:57.360 --> 11:03.660
Senator, a moment ago when you were outlining what the issues of the campaign might be,

11:03.660 --> 11:06.200
you didn't mention the issue of civil rights.

11:06.200 --> 11:11.080
Does the fact that you are not a national candidate now, but are running for the Senate from

11:11.080 --> 11:14.400
a Southern state, have anything to do with it?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.440
I didn't intend to admit it.

11:16.440 --> 11:21.040
I don't know exactly how the different democratic and the Republican Party will stand on that

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
particular issue.

11:22.040 --> 11:27.760
As far as I'm concerned, I'm all in favor of doing everything we can to secure the right

11:27.760 --> 11:34.120
of people to vote and try to be thoughtful of the rights of all of our people, regardless

11:34.120 --> 11:36.120
of rates or religion.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.120
On a federal level?

11:37.120 --> 11:38.640
Yes, on a federal level.

11:38.640 --> 11:42.680
And I vote side each issue as it comes up.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.960
We do have, and I voted for the extension of the civil rights commission.

11:45.960 --> 11:50.600
It may be that on some issues, we ought to wait and see what they recommend, see what

11:50.600 --> 11:53.960
the findings they have, maybe we don't have enough information.

11:53.960 --> 11:59.000
I think an impunity of legislation against the South that make matters worse than they already

11:59.000 --> 12:01.440
are, have been doing the good.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.820
Unless an unexpected settlement should develop between labor and management on the steel

12:05.820 --> 12:09.960
front, it looks like this is going to be a major issue before the Congress when it comes

12:09.960 --> 12:11.120
back.

12:11.120 --> 12:15.160
If no agreement is reached, do you think that Congress will pass some remedial legislation?

12:15.160 --> 12:21.840
On-prem, that's a very distressing situation, this steel strike, and I think the 80 days

12:21.840 --> 12:24.880
expires about January 20th.

12:24.880 --> 12:29.560
Certainly Congress will have to do something about it if the strike continues on.

12:29.560 --> 12:33.320
I just what we'll be able to do will not be satisfactory to anybody.

12:33.320 --> 12:38.400
None of us will like labor courts, none of us like compulsory arbitration, and yet we can

12:38.400 --> 12:41.480
afford to see the economy of the country ground to a halt.

12:42.200 --> 12:47.360
Senator Smathers, I believe, suggested some kind of labor court.

12:47.360 --> 12:52.360
Whatever's done, I hope will be in a temporary basis and only a prior to those industries

12:52.360 --> 12:54.680
vested with a public interest.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.680
So do you, Senator?

12:55.680 --> 13:01.160
I hope in that connection also that the viewpoint of the consumer will be considered.

13:01.160 --> 13:05.720
We've had an increase in productivity and the steel industry between three and four percent

13:05.720 --> 13:08.040
for the last few years.

13:08.040 --> 13:13.280
That increase has been divided between industry and labor without the consumer getting much

13:13.280 --> 13:16.480
benefit in the way of reduced prices.

13:16.480 --> 13:21.200
I want somebody, if we're going to have some method of settlement or some formula to consider

13:21.200 --> 13:24.160
the consumer, the purchaser of steel also.

13:24.160 --> 13:28.360
Doesn't that get you into price fixing on a government level?

13:28.360 --> 13:35.160
Well, I don't like price fixing, but of course, if we're not going to have statesmanship

13:35.160 --> 13:40.560
and consideration on the part of industry and labor to get this strike over with, we're

13:40.560 --> 13:44.360
going to have to do something about it, but the solution will be, I don't know.

13:44.360 --> 13:49.000
No, but you feel that if labor and management can't get together on this, with an equitable

13:49.000 --> 13:51.960
relationship to the consumer, that the government will have to get in.

13:51.960 --> 13:57.800
They're going to have to do something because our defense effort, our rockets, missiles,

13:57.800 --> 14:02.400
guns, planes, everything that we're doing depends upon having steel.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.640
We've got to have supply of steel.

14:04.640 --> 14:09.080
Generally, you're a subcommittee, which is the Senate antitrust and monopolist subcommittee

14:09.080 --> 14:15.000
has held rather extensive hearings on this steel situation over the years on the possible

14:15.000 --> 14:18.800
antitrust aspects of it, price fixing and expectation.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.040
But have you ever recommended any specific legislation?

14:21.040 --> 14:24.440
Now, you're talking now about legislation may be needed.

14:24.440 --> 14:30.320
We made some specific recommendations along the line that I've talked about that first

14:30.320 --> 14:36.240
place that there should have been a fact-finding commission early in the game.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.680
The Secretary of the President should have used the force of his office at a long time

14:39.680 --> 14:45.720
ago to try to get the parties to settle this strike on a patriotic basis.

14:45.720 --> 14:51.440
Third, that the productivity gains should be, and that the consumer ought to be considered

14:51.440 --> 14:53.680
in connection with it.

14:53.680 --> 14:59.200
And of course, Senator Olmani has a price notification bill, which he's been sponsoring

14:59.200 --> 15:01.360
before our subcommittee.

15:01.360 --> 15:06.360
We also have legislation to have pre-notice of merger.

15:06.360 --> 15:12.320
And there are good many proposals that are come indirectly from our steel hearings, which

15:12.320 --> 15:13.840
are now before the Congress.

15:13.840 --> 15:18.840
So that same subcommittee in the years has been also lacking into another field of interest

15:18.840 --> 15:23.640
that right now is particularly timely, I think, because short time from now, a lot of Americans

15:23.640 --> 15:27.720
are going to be very much interested in this professional football playoff between the

15:27.720 --> 15:29.720
Baltimore Colts and the Democrats.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.480
I think you're not both like me or the Baltimore of the afternoon.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.280
Yeah, my son wanted to go over there very much.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.280
I'd like to go with it.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.280
Very disappointed.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.680
But I was asking you something.

15:39.680 --> 15:46.040
Do you feel that the major sports industries, and I'm referring mainly to Major League

15:46.040 --> 15:50.760
Baseball and Major League Football, have so far complied with the promises that they

15:50.760 --> 15:53.520
gave to your subcommittee hearings last year?

15:53.520 --> 15:59.800
I'm specifically asking Senator about Major League Baseball right now because I recall

15:59.800 --> 16:04.200
they came in and they gave your subcommittee what I thought was a pretty firm promise.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.400
They would cooperate with the formation of a third.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.800
They would leave you under the league.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.800
That's right.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.640
Do you feel that they've complied with that promise?

16:10.640 --> 16:15.160
My personal feeling is that they have not come through like they ought to.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.640
They've got to loosen up.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.960
They give up some of their contracts, some of their player contracts.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.800
I have been informed that the sponsors of the new Continental League have been having

16:24.800 --> 16:27.560
a very difficult time breaking loose any contracts.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.560
I'm not pretty obvious to any read of the fourth phase.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.760
But we'll have some more hearings about it later.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.760
We'll have more hearings.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.000
Yes, we will have some more.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.880
You have raised a very difficult point.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.280
It would seem to me being a bit of a sports fan myself.

16:40.280 --> 16:45.080
Having the present clubs give up the contracts, the players to this third league.

16:45.080 --> 16:50.600
Who would determine how players contracts would be shifted to another team and another league?

16:50.600 --> 16:54.080
Well, I've been hoping that they would do it themselves.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.480
They would see the necessity of the fact that the American people want another league.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.480
They want more teams.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.680
What would you expect the New York Yankees to say give up a Mickey Mantle or a...

17:03.680 --> 17:05.720
Well, maybe not Mickey, but maybe somebody else.

17:05.720 --> 17:10.480
They've got 450 or 500 contracts that they control.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.880
A lot of these people are formed out.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.040
They're actually playing.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.720
They're as limited to 40 players.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.080
It's not the same line before we leave sports.

17:21.080 --> 17:25.320
You feel that the football people and other late-virt Bell made a promise.

17:25.320 --> 17:30.160
In fact, you made the announcement that he was going to cooperate with the formation of a second

17:30.160 --> 17:31.960
major professional football league.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.040
Apparently, that's going to be more successful.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.520
You feel that they have more...

17:35.520 --> 17:40.040
I think Mr. Bell and the others in football

17:40.040 --> 17:42.960
feel have tried to cooperate.

17:42.960 --> 17:47.360
But there again, I don't have any immediate information.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.480
But you will have more hearing.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.080
Yes, we will have more hearing.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.960
We have some bills pending, and I have to definitely earn more.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.760
Senator, referring to another investigation that you're currently conducting,

17:57.760 --> 18:04.920
one into the cost of drugs and special pharmaceutical preparation,

18:04.920 --> 18:09.200
evidence before your committee has seen to indicate that the price is charged

18:09.200 --> 18:12.640
to the consumer or excessive.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.640
The...

18:13.640 --> 18:19.440
In some cases, your figures have been disputed, but assuming that the figures are correct,

18:19.440 --> 18:22.240
eventually what is your committee proposed to do about it?

18:22.240 --> 18:23.440
Well, Mr. Ross, may I...

18:23.440 --> 18:25.440
Oh, may I just lay prices, or how do you...

18:25.440 --> 18:26.440
May I?

18:26.440 --> 18:30.960
May I give you just a brief summary about what our committee has found so far.

18:30.960 --> 18:37.360
We've been studying, of course, the steroid hormones, which is the very wonderful...

18:37.360 --> 18:41.280
And wondered drug is used in the treatment of people who suffer from arthritis,

18:41.280 --> 18:44.440
heart-as-zone and misterivities.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.600
We find the first place that...

18:47.600 --> 18:52.360
That there are prices in England, for instance, says...

18:52.360 --> 18:55.840
Seven cents, seven and a half cents a pill to the drugist.

18:55.840 --> 18:59.280
In this country, almost 18 cents a pill.

18:59.280 --> 19:06.560
We find also that the raw material after being tested and put in tablet form and bottled

19:06.560 --> 19:11.920
at the prices are less than two cents a pill, two cents a tablet, whereas the charge

19:11.920 --> 19:15.920
on almost 18 cents to the drugist.

19:15.920 --> 19:21.160
We find also, since the hearing that we've had that some small companies are actually selling

19:21.160 --> 19:29.320
the drugists, these same pills, which meet USP specifications for less than two cents a

19:29.320 --> 19:30.320
pill.

19:30.880 --> 19:38.400
We find also that the drug industry is the highest in the profit field, considering that worth

19:38.400 --> 19:40.200
of any industry in the United States.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.520
I have a chart here that shows that very graphically.

19:43.520 --> 19:52.080
There's drugs after taxes, about 22 percent, all manufacturing, generally, about 11 percent.

19:52.080 --> 19:58.520
And you will see motor vehicles and soap and petroleum, all of them are very much under

19:58.520 --> 19:59.520
drugs.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.840
And these are medicines that people have to have.

20:03.840 --> 20:07.880
And I also see that in case of shearing and the same is true of up-john and work than

20:07.880 --> 20:15.520
we have had before our committee, but they made enough profits in four years to repay the

20:15.520 --> 20:20.560
net worth of their corporations during those four years.

20:20.560 --> 20:30.200
We find also, strangely enough, that, for instance, in 1959 shearing was bidding to the

20:30.200 --> 20:40.960
government, the M-M-S-A, the Military Medical Supply Agency, for 23 cents a thousand capsules

20:40.960 --> 20:45.680
of pills, whereas they were selling the same to the drugists for $170.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.560
The Senator Keith over the crowd, why that should be?

20:48.560 --> 20:49.560
I don't know.

20:49.560 --> 20:53.800
So I only conclude that I can reach, and the inevitable conclusion is that among these

20:53.800 --> 20:56.320
big companies there just isn't any competition.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.880
They've got their prices way up.

20:57.880 --> 21:05.600
The other thing is that the small companies can are making and selling the same product

21:05.600 --> 21:10.960
for about two and a half or three cents a capsule, whereas the big companies are charging

21:10.960 --> 21:11.960
almost 18.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.400
Senator, if you'll forgive me for pointing it out.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.600
I don't think you answered the question.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
I was wrong, Vass.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.320
What are you going to do about it?

21:17.320 --> 21:24.720
The question is too early to say exactly what legislation that we might recommend, but

21:24.720 --> 21:31.960
the harassed doctor with all the detailed information advertising and the medical journals that

21:31.960 --> 21:38.720
he gets is only natural that he wants to prescribe some drug, dealt with that trade name

21:38.720 --> 21:40.440
that he has confidence in.

21:40.440 --> 21:46.200
Well, the government and the veterans' administration has confidence in these little companies, and

21:46.200 --> 21:50.240
they buy them for a thuzard and a water read.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.320
So we must have asked some way so that the government, so that the private position will

21:54.320 --> 21:59.960
have confidence and will be willing to recommend the drugs of these small companies too, then

21:59.960 --> 22:01.680
we'll have real competition.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.520
But you already have government supervision of any drugs of that nature.

22:04.520 --> 22:09.000
Yes, we have the USP standards, and they're standards with teeth in them.

22:09.000 --> 22:18.000
But the medical profession generally feels that they want their physicians to get something

22:18.000 --> 22:21.360
that they're absolutely sure of its efficacy and its quality.

22:21.360 --> 22:26.200
And so, and then they're given a lot of information about these detailed people.

22:26.200 --> 22:32.200
So they use to recommend by the trade name of the high price of the high price.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.680
Would you eliminate the trade name?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.240
No, I wouldn't eliminate the trade name.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.240
And how do you meet the...

22:36.240 --> 22:41.240
Some people, some people have actually recommended that since this is a captive group, that is

22:41.240 --> 22:44.880
the patient is captive, he has no alternative.

22:44.880 --> 22:50.480
He has to take a prescription that the doctor recommends that there ought to be price controls.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.800
I hope you don't have to get to that.

22:51.800 --> 22:57.040
I hope we can find some other method of getting competition and get the prices down, of course,

22:57.040 --> 22:58.440
they certainly ought to come down.

22:58.440 --> 23:04.920
Senator, how do you meet the contention of the pharmaceutical houses that is there independent

23:04.920 --> 23:10.720
research that has developed many of these new drugs and that the profit incentive is what

23:10.720 --> 23:12.600
has spread them to do it?

23:12.600 --> 23:15.040
Do you want to remove the large profit incentive?

23:15.040 --> 23:19.600
No, I want them to have a profit incentive.

23:19.600 --> 23:25.400
But I submit that 22% after taxes is a pretty high profit.

23:25.400 --> 23:29.240
Other manufacturers seem to get along on 11% after taxes generally.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.240
Well, so they've been in the same way.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.720
The situation is this.

23:31.720 --> 23:37.160
So they have done a lot of fine research and I think some of these big drug houses are

23:37.160 --> 23:38.920
fine organizations.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.280
But it just doesn't make sense.

23:41.280 --> 23:48.320
It's upside down economy for them to be selling the pill at almost 18 cents, a tablet almost

23:48.320 --> 23:53.760
18 cents like Pregnant Zone, whereas a small company and many of them do fine research

23:53.760 --> 23:54.760
themselves.

23:54.760 --> 24:01.360
They sell the same pill, tablet, meeting US peace specifications, or less than two cents.

24:01.360 --> 24:06.280
So even if you found in your subcommittee in your opinion that these people are charging

24:06.280 --> 24:09.320
too much and perhaps they're probably not agree with you.

24:09.320 --> 24:13.040
But unless you found evidence of collusion and price fixing, do you think that the Congress

24:13.040 --> 24:15.240
ought to be in the price fixing business?

24:15.240 --> 24:17.840
It's not a matter of fixing prices, Mr. Duffy.

24:17.840 --> 24:24.440
What we are interested in is why does it happen that the prices of these drugs are

24:24.440 --> 24:29.720
really big companies always wind up exactly the same and very, very high.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.680
Why is there no competition?

24:31.680 --> 24:34.400
What can we do to get competition between them?

24:34.400 --> 24:37.480
But you're suggesting that there's some kind of violation of the antitrust laws.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.040
Don't we have a mechanism now established to handle that sort of thing?

24:40.040 --> 24:42.800
Well, the antitrust laws need to be remodeled with great deal.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.520
There's also this additional problem.

24:45.520 --> 24:50.280
The issuance of patents.

24:50.280 --> 24:55.120
We found that in the prednisone, for instance, that five of the big companies were trying

24:55.120 --> 24:59.760
to tie up the market for the future, even though no patent had actually been issued.

24:59.760 --> 25:06.260
So that if a patent is issued, the little companies would have to buy in finished form and

25:06.260 --> 25:10.200
boxes couldn't buy in bulk anymore and they would be put out of business and they'd

25:10.200 --> 25:12.200
be unable to sell with these low prices.

25:12.200 --> 25:16.600
Senator Keith Oliver, a moment ago you made a passing reference to detail men and possibly

25:16.600 --> 25:19.400
some people in our audience aren't aware of what you were talking about.

25:19.400 --> 25:25.240
As I understand it, detail men work for the drug companies such as Murkup, John, Sherring

25:25.240 --> 25:26.240
and so forth.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.880
And it is their job to go to the doctors and explain to the doctors the latest drugs they have,

25:30.880 --> 25:34.120
how they can be used and in some cases even give them samples of it.

25:34.120 --> 25:39.720
Now, we heard testimony before your group that a lot of doctors are appreciative of this

25:39.720 --> 25:41.720
service and they are for the detail men.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.320
Would you do away with the detail men?

25:43.320 --> 25:47.680
I think we still need some detail men, although I think the matter has been carried entirely

25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
too far.

25:48.760 --> 25:55.560
So, in a sense, one third of the price that the drug store pays for the drug goes into

25:55.560 --> 25:59.960
this promotion, this advertisement, 33% and a third percent.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.640
I think that's entirely too much.

26:01.640 --> 26:05.400
We ask a doctor up John, up John and company, how many employees they have.

26:05.400 --> 26:09.240
He said you had about a little more than 5,000.

26:09.240 --> 26:13.720
And he said there had more than 1,000 detail men.

26:13.720 --> 26:18.800
So what I think the physicians would really appreciate would be some authentic and more

26:18.800 --> 26:24.880
public information from the food and drug department on just what these drugs are, what

26:24.880 --> 26:29.800
they'll do, what the side effects are, so that they can have confidence so that they

26:29.800 --> 26:32.640
can know and won't have to rely so much on the detail men.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.760
So I tend to get a little bit back to your home base for just a moment before we have

26:36.760 --> 26:38.360
to close.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.560
You have said you have not announced yet what you're going to run.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.280
Now, it is generally the same that you will.

26:44.280 --> 26:48.120
It's also generally the same that you probably will have strong opposition.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.560
You honestly expect to win an election down the agency?

26:50.560 --> 26:54.760
Well, this is definitely your trying to ask me around the bad way.

26:54.760 --> 26:58.600
I appreciate your friendship.

26:58.600 --> 27:03.320
My happy being a senator and that's what I'm going to try to continue being.

27:03.320 --> 27:08.160
Well, that's the same, although this is not the time, there's enough place for me to be

27:08.160 --> 27:09.160
making an announcement.

27:09.160 --> 27:14.840
Well, it's only if you do announce and if you do run and if you do win, you'll

27:14.840 --> 27:15.840
win.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.600
I think I hope that will be a wonderful.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.640
Do you foresee any chance in your afternoon to the future senator?

27:22.640 --> 27:27.440
When you might again be a candidate for National Office, you think I have Mr. W.

27:27.440 --> 27:31.680
No plans whatsoever for an election with the National Picture.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.680
I don't mean that.

27:33.680 --> 27:37.400
I've flattered him and somebody speaks to me enough connection.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.600
I'm not definitely ruling yourself out in any future contingency.

27:40.600 --> 27:45.960
Certainly, and that's a present campaign.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.800
I have no expectation of being put before the convention in the meanwhile.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.240
Of course, the present changes every moment, Senator.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.440
Well, no, I think that's not very important.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.440
Thank you very much today, sir.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.720
I'm becoming a face to the nation and thanks also to today's news car respondents.

27:59.720 --> 28:05.360
The Robert Roth of the Philadelphia Bulletin, Charles M. Fremde of CBS News, and Warren Duffy

28:05.360 --> 28:07.680
of United Press International.

28:07.680 --> 28:08.680
This is Stuart Novens.

28:08.680 --> 28:12.080
We invite you to join us next week at a new time.

28:12.080 --> 28:17.080
We ask that you consult your TV files to find the time in your area.

28:17.080 --> 28:21.680
Our guest will be Paul Butler, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, a program

28:21.680 --> 28:23.320
today originated in Washington.

29:21.680 --> 29:43.880
This is the CBS television network.
