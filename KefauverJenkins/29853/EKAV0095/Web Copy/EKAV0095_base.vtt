00:00.000 --> 00:29.160
This has to be clear from the very beginning.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.920
These pictures are not pretty, but they are real.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.800
We shot this film on the streets of Southern California during the past few weeks.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.360
The people you see are not actors.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.640
This is not make-believe.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.600
You're seeing the real thing.

00:44.600 --> 00:50.760
You're looking at yourself, your time, your kids perhaps, or your neighbors.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.960
These youngsters have several things in common.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.560
They're quite young.

00:54.560 --> 01:04.120
They live in or around Los Angeles, and they're in trouble with the law.

01:04.120 --> 01:12.840
When that happens, we get headlines like these.

01:12.840 --> 01:23.680
Books are written with sensational titles and lurid illustrations.

01:23.680 --> 01:35.880
And lately, movies have been made, because kids in trouble are red-hot at the box office.

01:35.880 --> 01:41.120
Again today, a shocking story of juvenile crime that has people everywhere shaking their

01:41.120 --> 01:44.960
heads, asking how and why.

01:44.960 --> 01:52.120
More of those big headlines, teenage killing, rich boy held in $19 murder.

01:52.120 --> 01:57.960
It's the story of Eric Bass, the 16-year-old son of a millionaire, a rich man's son who came

01:57.960 --> 02:01.320
to Los Angeles and drifted to Skid Row.

02:01.320 --> 02:06.520
He took up with three young puffs, went out on a night of crime that ended in murder.

02:06.520 --> 02:14.120
A grim reminder that delinquency is not limited by family, or position, or wealth.

02:14.120 --> 02:18.640
Almost the only youngsters we hear about or read about are those who do get in trouble.

02:18.640 --> 02:24.000
Because the kids say those who've messed up with the law, because of this emphasis on the

02:24.000 --> 02:29.200
bad, too many people think the juvenile and delinquency are the same.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.360
But the facts, as we find them, prove otherwise.

02:32.360 --> 02:40.120
And that's the point of this series to bring the facts into focus.

02:40.120 --> 02:46.920
So, program one of Focus on Delinquency.

02:46.920 --> 02:53.520
It was a special report from the KNXT Department of Public Affairs.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.040
Look at them, the teenagers of this generation.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.680
It's not important that these kids live in Southern California.

03:00.680 --> 03:05.880
Here or anywhere else, they come in all sizes, all shapes, all colors.

03:05.880 --> 03:10.040
The experts say they're biggers, smarter, and healthier than their parents.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.600
The best generation yet.

03:13.600 --> 03:19.520
Despite the screaming headlines, the lurid books and movies, the prejudice of many adults,

03:19.520 --> 03:25.400
the experts insist that these youngsters get into less trouble than their parents did.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.920
Does that surprise you?

03:26.920 --> 03:30.160
Do you think it is not true?

03:30.160 --> 03:33.320
Are you thinking now about the rat tax?

03:33.320 --> 03:36.600
The juvenile crimes of theft and dope addiction.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.520
Rape and sometimes murder.

03:39.520 --> 03:53.440
That's the stuff that makes the headlines alright, but it's not the whole start.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.600
These are the typical youngsters.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.320
They like fast games.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.440
They play hard and fast, the faster the better.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.040
Speed is the byword of this generation.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.720
They like fast cars.

04:06.720 --> 04:13.720
They like to drive them or watch other people drive them.

04:36.720 --> 04:43.720
In school, they learn quickly and they have more to learn.

04:43.720 --> 04:48.720
And in their free time, they dance to some of the fastest music that's ever been popular,

04:48.720 --> 04:53.720
like this.

04:53.720 --> 05:03.480
To get the facts, we started at the new police building.

05:03.480 --> 05:07.880
We met with the man who knows most about the crime picture in this area, Chief of Police,

05:07.880 --> 05:12.640
William H. Parker.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.640
When Senator Keep-Hobber was in town recently, Chief, what did you tell him about the juvenile

05:16.640 --> 05:18.440
crime picture in this area?

05:18.440 --> 05:23.720
Well, I told Senator Keep-Hobber that in reality, adult misbehavior was a greater problem

05:23.720 --> 05:30.600
to us than us, and us, and us, that juvenile misbehavior, as reflected by our arrest statistics.

05:30.600 --> 05:38.600
There has been a 9% increase in adult arrests so far in 1955, but only a 6% increase in juvenile

05:38.600 --> 05:44.560
arrests, so that actually the adult problem is more serious than the juvenile problem.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.120
You still don't believe it?

05:46.120 --> 05:48.960
Well, the picture is much the same from different angles.

05:48.960 --> 05:54.600
So from Chief Parker, we went to Carl Holton, Chief Probation Officer for Los Angeles County,

05:54.600 --> 05:58.840
recognized everywhere as one of the top men in his field.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.840
Can you tell us, sir, what's the juvenile crime picture now?

06:01.840 --> 06:03.480
Is the rate up or down?

06:03.480 --> 06:06.680
And what's the outlook, as you see it?

06:06.680 --> 06:11.400
Well, the rate has been levelling off in California, particularly here in Los Angeles County

06:11.400 --> 06:17.640
for the last two years, and the last year we had for the first time in a long time an

06:17.640 --> 06:21.240
actual decrease in the number of juvenile court findings.

06:21.240 --> 06:26.440
We feel that it's on the whole picture is steadily improving.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.640
To pin it down even tighter, let's check the record.

06:30.640 --> 06:36.000
The police say that only 2.4% of our children get into trouble with the law.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.320
Turn that around.

06:37.320 --> 06:42.200
It means nearly 98% of the kids don't get in trouble.

06:42.200 --> 06:48.800
It's true that in the past 10 years, the number of crimes by kids has gone up 31%.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.320
A shocking figure.

06:50.320 --> 06:55.920
But look also at the increase in the number of youngsters in those same 10 years, up 41

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
percent.

06:56.920 --> 07:01.160
The crime total has gone up, but not as much as the population.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.880
And here's the important point.

07:02.880 --> 07:10.680
The rate of crime has gone down from about 22 per thousand in 1944 to fewer than 18 per

07:10.680 --> 07:13.440
thousand last year.

07:13.440 --> 07:17.920
Most offenses are what the police call crimes against person or property.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.320
Theft, robbery, assault.

07:20.320 --> 07:26.440
Most common teenage crime, GTA is the kids call it Grand Theft Auto.

07:26.440 --> 07:30.240
Then comes traffic offenses and sex delinquency.

07:30.240 --> 07:34.720
Narcotics you'll be surprised to learn is very near the bottom of the list.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.680
The people of this area can be proud of their kids.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.720
The picture looks pretty good.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.600
But even that 2% cannot be ignored.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.600
Think of it.

07:43.600 --> 07:49.320
10,000 youngsters a year in trouble with the law in Los Angeles County alone.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.400
10,000 flexible young minds.

07:52.400 --> 07:58.160
10,000 children easily influenced for good or for bad.

07:58.160 --> 08:03.520
We're used to hearing about crime among adults, but we're shocked by juvenile crime.

08:03.520 --> 08:08.600
And rightly so, it could be your youngster or mine.

08:08.600 --> 08:14.880
And another thing, the juvenile problem cost Los Angeles nearly 9 million dollars a year.

08:14.880 --> 08:21.160
A staggering bill and it's paid by the taxpayer out of your pocket and mine.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.120
These are the reasons why tonight and for the next 5 weeks, we're going to study the

08:25.120 --> 08:28.120
youngsters of this area and the world they live in.

08:28.120 --> 08:32.360
We'll spend a lot of time with the kids who fill the lockups and courtrooms and forestry

08:32.360 --> 08:33.360
paths.

08:33.360 --> 08:37.360
But we'll look at the other side too, the kids who don't get in trouble.

08:37.360 --> 08:41.720
We'll try to answer the biggest question of all, why do kids get in trouble?

08:41.720 --> 08:46.760
We'll show you what happens when they do and we'll try to find out who's to blame.

08:46.760 --> 08:52.560
In all juvenile cases, the first official contact is made by the police, the youngsters first

08:52.560 --> 08:54.960
contact with authority.

08:54.960 --> 08:59.440
In Los Angeles, all cases involving kids go to the juvenile division.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.960
Men and women carefully selected, specially trained to work with youngsters.

09:03.960 --> 09:08.200
They don't wear uniforms, their cars are unmarked.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.520
Let's follow a typical trouble call.

09:10.520 --> 09:14.840
It's an on-the-spot investigation, with the officers talking to all those involved to

09:14.840 --> 09:17.080
learn exactly what happened.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.120
Perhaps a fight over a girl or a car.

09:20.120 --> 09:25.000
It may surprise you to learn that in most cases, 80 to 90 percent of them, it ends right

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
here.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.520
The officers restore order, the group is broken up and the kids sent home.

09:30.520 --> 09:35.920
But when the trouble is serious, the kids are questioned, thoroughly searched, booked

09:35.920 --> 09:47.680
at the station and their parents are notified.

09:47.680 --> 09:53.280
These boys are taken into the Lincoln Heights station for further questioning a closer study

09:53.280 --> 10:01.960
of the case.

10:01.960 --> 10:09.160
I said thoroughly searched.

10:09.160 --> 10:14.360
The officers know just how to find the tiny grains of marijuana that stick to a pocket

10:14.360 --> 10:16.720
line.

10:16.720 --> 10:22.320
And these are deadly weapons in the real sense of the word.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.720
This is another deadly weapon.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.360
That's right, it's a can opener.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.920
But whenever the police shake down a gang of kids, they end up with a box full of these,

10:31.920 --> 10:36.360
with the edges filed razor sharp, it's a vicious weapon.

10:36.360 --> 10:41.840
And a lot of youngsters who don't get in fights carry them anyhow as a kind of pocketpiece.

10:41.840 --> 10:48.720
And the kids have a wild and scary name for it, they call it a church key.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.240
Most of the time, the youngsters are sent home with their parents.

10:52.240 --> 10:56.560
But if the trouble is big, if there's any reason to think the kid may run away, or if

10:56.560 --> 11:01.920
his home is such that he's better off out of it, that means a trip to juvenile hall.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.920
Juvie, as the kids call it, on East Lake Avenue in the shadow of General Hospital East

11:06.920 --> 11:07.920
of Downtown.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.640
There's one side for boys, the other side for girls.

11:26.560 --> 11:45.400
When a juvenile arrives, he has a police escort.

11:45.400 --> 11:49.760
He's taken from the car inside to the reception desk.

11:49.760 --> 11:53.880
There his papers are waiting, and there the police check him in.

11:53.880 --> 12:00.880
Then he's turned over to the probation officer, and the man in charge starts asking questions.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.880
Hi, Felicia.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.880
We're facing you from East Long, Danielis.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.880
There are the papers for Edward Smith.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.880
Eddie Smith, yeah, the office call we've been expecting, yeah.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.880
Thanks a lot, fellas.

12:13.880 --> 12:17.880
Oh, hi, Eddie.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.880
Sit on, son.

12:20.880 --> 12:21.880
Sit down.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.880
Right, your Edward Smith?

12:24.880 --> 12:25.880
Yes, sir.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.880
My name is Sirot Eddie.

12:27.880 --> 12:33.880
I'm one of the intake and detention control officers of the Los Angeles County Prohibition Department.

12:33.880 --> 12:38.880
My job is to interview all the boys that have brought the juvenile hall.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.880
This is the boys introduction to juvenile hall.

12:41.880 --> 12:46.880
He'll have more interviews, he'll answer many more questions.

12:46.880 --> 12:50.880
At that time, take a good look at juvenile hall.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.880
For the odds are you've never been there.

12:52.880 --> 12:58.880
For that matter, this is the first time television has ever been allowed inside.

12:58.880 --> 13:10.880
Built by the County of Los Angeles in 1953, juvenile hall is the biggest and most modern facility of its kind in the entire nation.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.880
It's clean and not crowded.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.880
The food is good, and there's plenty of it.

13:16.880 --> 13:23.880
Better food, in fact, than many of these boys ever had on the outside.

13:23.880 --> 13:38.880
On the girls side of the hall, there's lots of open space, green and airy, room for outdoor activities, gains of all kinds.

13:38.880 --> 13:45.880
Though, as you can see, the smog in that part of town is sometimes pretty thick.

13:45.880 --> 13:53.880
The hall has its own chapel, a beautiful modern building that offers services of all faiths.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.880
And again, gains.

13:55.880 --> 14:00.880
The idea is to keep the youngsters busy and keep them out of trouble.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.880
And again, the smog.

14:04.880 --> 14:14.880
These are the older girls.

14:14.880 --> 14:22.880
But some of the inmates are awfully young. Some are still playing with dolls.

14:22.880 --> 14:31.880
You find many good things to say about juvenile hall, and certainly its greatest asset is its staff, headed by superintendent David Bogan.

14:31.880 --> 14:41.880
We met many of the men and women who worked there. We were struck by their intelligence and their understanding of the troubled young minds and bodies put in their care.

14:41.880 --> 14:47.880
The program includes fine, well-equipped classrooms and up-to-date teaching methods.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.880
Some of the teaching is quite basic, like this.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.880
Character is what you are.

14:54.880 --> 15:00.880
Reputation is what people say you are.

15:00.880 --> 15:08.880
Class is in painting. And time for study.

15:08.880 --> 15:16.880
From class to class, the young inmates march. For boys, there are things like woodshop.

15:16.880 --> 15:23.880
And the music class. They tell us it helps the kids unwind.

15:24.880 --> 15:33.880
Oh, I love, I darling, I want you for your class.

15:33.880 --> 15:39.880
I love you, my love.

15:39.880 --> 15:49.880
Time goes by. From the days of the years of your time.

15:49.880 --> 16:01.880
I need your love. I need your love. I need your love.

16:01.880 --> 16:09.880
I need your love. I need your love. To me.

16:11.880 --> 16:17.880
Time goes by so slowly for the youngsters in juvenile hall.

16:17.880 --> 16:22.880
Juby is clean and modern and it is copied by cities all around the country.

16:22.880 --> 16:28.880
And while there are no bars on the windows, the heavy steel screens are just as effective.

16:28.880 --> 16:35.880
There is one thing you can't forget. With all the well-kept plants and carefully-tended grounds, you still can't get out.

16:35.880 --> 16:44.880
The gates and doors are always locked. All in all, as nice a jail as you can find, but it's still a jail.

16:44.880 --> 16:49.880
A glimpse of juvenile hall. Now let's see how it works.

16:49.880 --> 16:54.880
Take the case of a young cart thief named Eddie Smith. You saw him arriving a few minutes ago.

16:54.880 --> 16:59.880
That name isn't real, but the boy is and so is his problem.

16:59.880 --> 17:05.880
California laws as a juvenile can be held no more than 72 hours before he gets a hearing in court.

17:05.880 --> 17:12.880
That gives the probation department just three days to make a quick investigation of the case and the circumstances around.

17:12.880 --> 17:19.880
The boy and his family and his offense. And then the boy is on his way to his first meeting with the court.

17:19.880 --> 17:29.880
This will be a predetention hearing. Eddie and his fellow offenders travel a long and well-protected route from juvenile hall to the courtroom.

17:29.880 --> 17:34.880
Stairways and corridors all fenced and locked against a scheme.

17:34.880 --> 17:40.880
At the end of Eddie's journey, he'll meet the presiding judge of the juvenile court William B. McKesson.

17:40.880 --> 17:44.880
The probation officers first report his already on the judge's desk.

17:44.880 --> 17:51.880
And the question before the court of this preliminary hearing is whether the youngsters should be sent home or kept a juvenile hall.

17:51.880 --> 17:58.880
Full investigation takes two or three weeks and it's this time that's at stake. Does Eddie go home or stay at Juve?

17:58.880 --> 18:04.880
Predeention hearings as they're called are held by Judge McKesson and this is a typical day in his courtroom.

18:04.880 --> 18:10.880
Prompoli at 9 a.m. the judge enters and let me tell you again this is not make believe.

18:10.880 --> 18:16.880
RKNXT cameras were right there as Judge McKesson opened Juvenal Court for another day's business.

18:16.880 --> 18:22.880
So I'm going to have a case to have when I'll predetention Caledity this morning.

18:22.880 --> 18:27.880
We have two girls and five boys, Your Honor.

18:27.880 --> 18:31.880
I see you have one more girl that's been scratched off of something.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.880
I've been taken care of from her way.

18:33.880 --> 18:39.880
I worked out other arrangements on that. The girl is going to be covered by the field probation officer.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.880
She's not in detention.

18:41.880 --> 18:47.880
She is being detained but the field officer is going to get a detaining order instead of putting an unpretentious morning.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.880
Are the parents of these boys and girls here as far as you know?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.880
Yes, they're ugly. They are.

18:54.880 --> 19:02.880
You say we have two girls and four boys, let's take the boys first then this morning instead of the girls.

19:02.880 --> 19:06.880
So Mr. Longville, if you'll tell the bailout to bring in the first boy please.

19:06.880 --> 19:07.880
Yes, Your Honor.

19:07.880 --> 19:12.880
The law says names or identifying details in Juvenal Court matters cannot be revealed.

19:12.880 --> 19:19.880
So what you see now is a composite case, names and facts scrambled to prevent identification.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.880
But the setting is real, the people are real and so is the prompt.

19:23.880 --> 19:30.880
No play acting here, if you've ever been to Juvenal Court with a youngster in trouble, this will be painfully authentic.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.880
You made a ward of our Juvenal Court.

19:33.880 --> 19:40.880
Juvenal Court, Joe, it is not a criminal court.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.880
It is a court of protection.

19:42.880 --> 19:50.880
The petition has been filed not against you, but in your behalf, asking to have you made a ward of the Juvenal Court.

19:50.880 --> 19:59.880
The Constitution of the United States and of this state guarantee you certain rights which are applicable to this court even though it's not a criminal court.

19:59.880 --> 20:09.880
You're entitled here to have any person who testifies as a witness in the case, a do so in your presence so if you can be there and hear what they say,

20:09.880 --> 20:18.880
you're entitled to be represented by an attorney today or at any other time to connect some of these proceedings if you and your parents want an attorney.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.880
And you're entitled to have an early hearing on the matter.

20:23.880 --> 20:28.880
His pre-attention this morning, Mr. and Mrs. Smith has three purposes.

20:28.880 --> 20:35.880
One is to advise Eddie the contents of the petition that is telling why he's here.

20:36.880 --> 20:51.880
Secondly, to set a date for a hearing on that petition, and then thirdly for the court to determine as a judicial matter whether Eddie should be detained in custody or released home or face someplace else.

20:51.880 --> 21:06.880
Between now and the date of the hearing, under our law, it is the obligation of the probation officer of the county to make a full investigation in a written report to the court before we can have our hearing.

21:06.880 --> 21:13.880
Now, I'd end the read to petition to you. I'll ask you whether the statements are true or not true in this petition.

21:13.880 --> 21:35.880
The petition says, in honor of about the 27th June of this year, you took a 1951 Cadillac, lies in number X41327, away from 1423 18th Street in Santa Monica without the permission of the owner.

21:37.880 --> 21:43.880
All of which is in violation of Section 503 of the vehicle code of the State of California.

21:43.880 --> 21:48.880
Is that true or not true? Say there is.

21:48.880 --> 21:55.880
Our interpretation admitted and the sub-tameter are down for hearing.

21:55.880 --> 22:02.880
I'll set this matter for hearing a two weeks from next Monday.

22:03.880 --> 22:14.880
Mr. Smith, the probation officer will be in touch with you people during the course of his investigation to learn what he can about this matter.

22:14.880 --> 22:22.880
Also to learn what kind of a boy Eddie is at home and at school and in his community.

22:23.880 --> 22:31.880
Then on the day of the hearing, we will go into the matter fully and we want you back here at the time of the hearing.

22:31.880 --> 22:37.880
The court will decide then what the next step in the matter is going to be.

22:37.880 --> 22:47.880
Ms. Wallace, representing the detention control unit of the probation department, do you have any report on this board?

22:47.880 --> 22:57.880
We are recommending your honor that the boy remain in juvenile hall as we feel that the home situation is such that it would not be wise for him to return at this time.

22:57.880 --> 23:03.880
As he does in most cases, the judge follows the recommendation of the probation officer, the first step.

23:03.880 --> 23:08.880
Now for two or three weeks, the probation department will sift all the facts in the case.

23:08.880 --> 23:12.880
Then the boy returns to Judge McKesson for a full hearing.

23:12.880 --> 23:17.880
You will see that on the next program in this series, the first time ever on television.

23:17.880 --> 23:23.880
One of the chief aims of this KNXT series is to put the juvenile problem in focus.

23:23.880 --> 23:31.880
You know how the facts have been twisted by scare stories, how the teenager has become a monster in the minds of many.

23:31.880 --> 23:37.880
To learn what people think about the problem, we talked with men and women on the street all around Los Angeles.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.880
And here's what some of them said about kids today.

23:40.880 --> 23:45.880
I think that the kids today are a little bit too wild.

23:45.880 --> 23:51.880
They have too many automobiles to ride around in.

23:51.880 --> 23:55.880
Well, actually, I don't think there's too much difference.

23:55.880 --> 24:01.880
I think most of them are more intelligent than those boys and girls in my day.

24:01.880 --> 24:06.880
I think they are much worse, but yet much brighter.

24:06.880 --> 24:11.880
Well, I think that children have more freedom getting away from the harm.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.880
And we as our parents get away from them considerably.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.880
And we're not as close sniff as we used to be.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.880
We used to be at home more.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.880
We didn't have the transportation of the means of transportation as we have today.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.880
And consequently, the harm is such.

24:26.880 --> 24:32.880
Isn't conducive to people being together as much as they should be.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.880
They allow it considerable liberty.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.880
And we enjoy liberty too as grown ups and imagine.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.880
And the only time we're aware of the problem is when we get the arises.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.880
But when we're personally concerned.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.880
There should be more strict at school and the parents should be more strict at home also.

24:47.880 --> 24:52.880
And that gives them all the things they are doing given them today.

24:52.880 --> 24:58.880
Well, I think these kids that do get into trouble should be sent to a boys camp up in a mountain somewhere

24:58.880 --> 25:07.880
where they could live with a lot of nice young healthy boys with good ideas and they'll probably change.

25:07.880 --> 25:13.880
Well, I think they should have a more understanding with mothers and the fathers.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.880
And they should have shown them and shown them the right way to live.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.880
Charply differing views of a big problem.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.880
Big enough to draw the attention of a special subcommittee of the U.S. Senate.

25:24.880 --> 25:29.880
And recently, there were hearings in Los Angeles given a lot of sensational publicity.

25:29.880 --> 25:35.880
Senator Estes-Keefe, Auburn, in charge of those hearings, talked about the problem and our plans for this series.

25:35.880 --> 25:42.880
First of all, sir, what is the nature of the problem of juvenile crime?

25:42.880 --> 25:53.880
The main difficulty we have in dealing with the length and sea of non-juveniles is the lack of interest, the unwillingness of parents.

25:54.880 --> 25:58.880
Very frequently to accept the fact that there is a problem.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.880
After that, on the part of the average citizen is the big difficulty.

26:02.880 --> 26:09.880
We find juvenile, more intelligent today, more aware of what's going on.

26:09.880 --> 26:17.880
And there, of course, is subjected to more 20th century influences today than ever before.

26:17.880 --> 26:24.880
So while we have the finest bunch of young people, we also have a larger number that's getting in trouble with the police,

26:24.880 --> 26:28.880
that commit more and more violent offenses.

26:28.880 --> 26:37.880
We've had a larger number that have come engaged in addicted to narcotics and affected by the narcotic business.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.880
Well, thanks very much, Senator Keith Lawyer.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.880
A bill I certainly thank you for letting me be on this program.

26:43.880 --> 26:50.880
I just want to commend CBS Television, Channel 2, for taking interest in this very important problem.

26:50.880 --> 26:58.880
It's a series such as this and interest of this kind that will eventually licked the curse of juvenile delinquent city,

26:58.880 --> 27:02.880
getting our people interested so that they know what the facts are.

27:02.880 --> 27:07.880
And you and the station are certain to be commended upon this splendid series.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.880
We hope we can live up to it.

27:09.880 --> 27:15.880
Next week, a full hearing in juvenile court and some of the most dramatic film we've ever made,

27:15.880 --> 27:18.880
Kids in Trouble, telling their own stories.

27:18.880 --> 27:25.880
Also, a visit to the place the kids call CUBE, the grim wall city of San Quentin.

27:25.880 --> 27:29.880
End of the line for those who can't be stopped.

27:29.880 --> 27:37.880
Men like the notorious Carol Chessman, whom we interviewed in Death Row, especially for this series.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.880
That story next week.

28:07.880 --> 28:17.880
This is the KNXT Television Production.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.880
You
