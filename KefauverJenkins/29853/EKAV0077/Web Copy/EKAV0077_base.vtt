00:00.000 --> 00:09.080
Ladies and gentlemen, with a few notorious exceptions, every American is aware that our

00:09.080 --> 00:11.680
farmers are in great trouble.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.520
The few who do not seem to realize this appear to have found jobs in the Department of Agriculture

00:16.520 --> 00:17.520
in Washington.

00:17.520 --> 00:23.160
It's a sad but true fact that today for the first time in our history, the farmer has

00:23.160 --> 00:26.880
become to regard the Department of Agriculture as his enemy.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.400
While foreign income goes down and down, Secretary of Agriculture of Benson is still

00:32.400 --> 00:37.440
talking about modernized, charity and flexible price supports.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.880
Instead of coming up with a imaginative ways to solve the problem, the administration

00:41.880 --> 00:48.760
concentrates on inventing lived phrases to discuss the failure of its farm program.

00:48.760 --> 00:53.160
These phrases make confuse some of our city people, but they certainly do not fool the

00:53.160 --> 00:55.000
American farmer.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.800
The DOP approach to the farm problem is clearly illustrated in its attitude toward the

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
dairy farmer.

01:00.800 --> 01:07.400
A few years ago, Secretary of Benson told the dairy man, the flexible price support program

01:07.400 --> 01:12.520
would increase consumption, reduce production and raise the farmer's income.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.400
Well, exactly the opposite has happened.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.880
Production has increased, not decreased.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.800
Consumption has fallen, not risen.

01:19.800 --> 01:24.480
And the dairy farmer's income has every dairyman in your state knows only too well, has

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
dropped drastically.

01:25.480 --> 01:31.520
Don't you think that it's about time that the Eisenhower Benson team admitted that it has

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
failed?

01:32.520 --> 01:36.440
Don't you think it's about time that the dairyman got an even break?

01:36.440 --> 01:41.280
The problem of the dairy farmer is shared by all farmers throughout the country.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.400
Big business is making bigger and bigger profits, but the farmer and especially the small farmer

01:46.400 --> 01:48.720
just can't make ends meet.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.920
For instance, Secretary of Benson's idea of how to solve the farm problem.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.600
It's quite simple.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.400
Just move some farmers off the land and into the cities.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.720
In other words, treat them like coal numbers.

02:00.720 --> 02:05.920
But you know and I know that you can't deal with human beings in terms of coal numbers.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.600
The administration has another way to solve the farm problem.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.760
Eliminate the small farmer.

02:11.760 --> 02:16.240
Ever since the Republicans took office, they have deliberately followed a program which

02:16.240 --> 02:22.880
can only succeed in killing off the family-type farm, which is the basis of our nation's economy.

02:22.880 --> 02:28.160
Now what are we going to do about the farmer since the GOP won't help him?

02:28.160 --> 02:33.560
The farmer needs the immediate sort of relief which rigid, full parity payments bring him.

02:33.560 --> 02:38.800
He also needs long-range problems to assure his continued existence.

02:38.800 --> 02:43.680
My first act as president will be to find a Secretary of Agriculture who really understands

02:43.680 --> 02:48.080
the needs of the farmer, and especially the small farmer.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.360
I'll choose a man who has actually formed and who can sympathetically represent the

02:53.360 --> 02:56.960
farmer's side of each question in our cabinet.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.640
I consider the Secretary of Agriculture to be the spokesman for the farmer, and he will

03:01.640 --> 03:05.080
be so considered at any cabinet at a point.

03:05.080 --> 03:10.160
I will urge that Congress determine the two needs of the farmer and pass legislation which

03:10.160 --> 03:11.800
will meet those needs.

03:11.800 --> 03:17.240
Charity will be geared to the small farm and not to the huge corporate-owned farm by

03:17.240 --> 03:19.280
absentee landlords.

03:19.280 --> 03:25.320
It pains me to hear surplus food regarded as a calamity when there are hungry people throughout

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
the world.

03:26.320 --> 03:31.780
I contend that we can solve the surplus problem, that we can use this precious surplus food

03:31.780 --> 03:38.280
as a national asset by using it to feed the hungry abroad and the needy here at home.

03:38.280 --> 03:44.520
I have already introduced legislation which calls for a food stamp plan to help distribute

03:44.520 --> 03:48.280
this surplus among our less fortunate citizens at home.

03:48.280 --> 03:52.480
I intend to push for its passage as rapidly as possible.

03:52.480 --> 03:57.560
Here in the United States the Lord has seen fit to bless us with plenty.

03:57.560 --> 04:02.360
Let us use that plenty to help achieve our goal of peace and a free world.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.040
By helping others we shall also be helping ourselves.

04:06.040 --> 04:11.920
I say these things not idly for campaign purposes but out of a deep conviction.

04:11.920 --> 04:17.000
Throughout my 17 years of service in Washington I have voted consistently for the best interest

04:17.000 --> 04:19.680
of the farmer and his family.

04:19.680 --> 04:25.080
I have never wavered in my conviction that any so-called prosperity which does not include

04:25.080 --> 04:28.360
the small farmer is a small prosperity.

04:28.360 --> 04:34.600
I pledge that if I am elected president I shall continue to do all in my power to guarantee

04:34.600 --> 04:37.000
the farmer an even break.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.600
Thank you very much.

04:44.600 --> 04:59.960
I was very pleased to open the current issue of look and find four pages devoted to my

04:59.960 --> 05:05.520
family and me, my four little children and my wife Nancy.

05:05.520 --> 05:12.400
Of course I like any man in public life or any man with a family it's very flattering

05:12.400 --> 05:19.920
to have a picture like this.

05:19.920 --> 05:26.320
I know that any of us in politics particularly when we have a busy year in the United States

05:26.320 --> 05:31.760
Senate or when we are running for some national office with all of the vicissitudes and

05:31.760 --> 05:38.280
partakes that one of the things that gives us confidence that makes us go on and do the

05:38.280 --> 05:52.120
best we can is the fact that we have back home some children and a wife rooting for us.

05:52.120 --> 06:00.000
I will ask a friend I first knew him long ago I knew him when we served together in the

06:00.000 --> 06:07.720
house of representatives even then he wasn't just another congressman his abilities and

06:07.720 --> 06:12.280
his qualities of leadership had singled him out for attention.

06:12.280 --> 06:17.920
I have known him since he's service in the United States Senate.

06:17.920 --> 06:28.160
I have watched him grow in stature and in influence like you I have seen his fame spread across

06:28.160 --> 06:29.920
the nation.

06:29.920 --> 06:35.880
During all these years he has been a last his friend the most striking instance of this

06:35.880 --> 06:41.200
friendship came in 1952.

06:41.200 --> 06:47.680
He was in Iowa in the early spring of that year in behalf of his presidential candidacy.

06:47.680 --> 06:54.080
He had an important meeting when he heard that that very day there was going to be a vote

06:54.080 --> 07:00.880
in the Senate on Alaska Statehood he cancelled the meeting through onto Washington at his

07:00.880 --> 07:05.760
own expense and voted for Alaska Statehood.

07:05.760 --> 07:15.520
I say there could be no finer demonstration of his friendship for Alaska.

07:15.520 --> 07:23.080
So it is my proud privilege to present to you a great leader of the Democratic Party my

07:23.080 --> 07:31.440
friend the tall man from Tennessee the man of integrity of honor of the people Senator

07:31.440 --> 07:33.440
Estes P. Hoffman.

07:33.440 --> 07:38.280
Very much delegates Bob Barton I certainly do appreciate the kind words that you have had

07:38.280 --> 07:39.280
to say about me.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.480
You have been a mighty good friend and you are a good friend and I want you to know that

07:43.480 --> 07:47.480
I am a good friend of yours and of the people of Alaska.

07:47.480 --> 07:52.640
I have enjoyed these many years Bob serving with you in the House of Representatives and

07:52.640 --> 07:56.680
since I have been in the United States Senate I have been very close to you too.

07:56.680 --> 08:00.400
You have always fought hard for the people of Alaska for every project that they have

08:00.400 --> 08:06.200
been interested in and nobody could be more diligent in trying to secure the right which

08:06.200 --> 08:11.240
the people of Alaska so greatly deserve the right of Statehood.

08:11.240 --> 08:17.480
You have many friends and the United States Senate as well as in the House of Representatives.

08:17.480 --> 08:22.760
You have presented your cause well and you are highly esteemed in the departments of

08:22.760 --> 08:23.760
government.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.520
I appreciate the good work you have done and I certainly am grateful to you for what you

08:28.520 --> 08:31.120
have had to say about me here today.

08:31.120 --> 08:37.000
It is always wonderful to have a chance of being with you and to talk about the prospects

08:37.000 --> 08:43.440
of a great new wonderful part of the United States about the prospect of it being the

08:43.440 --> 08:45.960
49th State.

08:45.960 --> 08:55.240
Ladies and gentlemen, many years ago before Bob Bartlett came to the House of Representatives,

08:55.240 --> 09:02.040
when I was still a member of the House back in 1939 I believe a dynamic Alaskan buttonhole

09:02.040 --> 09:07.320
me and proceeded to lecture me on the merits of Alaskan Statehood.

09:07.320 --> 09:12.440
He was so eloquent and so forceful and he had so many facts to back up his arguments

09:12.440 --> 09:17.440
that I just had to listen and I heard from him of course the same thing I have heard

09:17.440 --> 09:22.000
from many of my Tennessee friends who had gone to Alaska and had been entranced by

09:22.000 --> 09:26.400
that great country and the possibilities there.

09:26.400 --> 09:32.240
When he had finished Tony Diamond who is the delegate at that time at another convert

09:32.240 --> 09:36.120
ever since then back in the late 1930s.

09:36.120 --> 09:41.160
I have either sponsored or have joined in sponsoring and fighting for legislation designed to

09:41.160 --> 09:45.360
bring about a statehood for Alaskan.

09:45.360 --> 09:52.040
As a matter of fact in 1949 and Bob this was before I ever thought about running for

09:52.040 --> 09:54.880
the presidency of the United States.

09:54.880 --> 10:00.440
You came over here to the Senate and you asked me to take the lead and filing the bill

10:00.440 --> 10:04.800
in the United States Senate to get statehood for Alaskan.

10:04.800 --> 10:10.760
I circulated the bill among all of the senators and we got a whole lot of sponsors from all

10:10.760 --> 10:16.440
parts of the United States and joining and asking for statehood.

10:16.440 --> 10:24.840
I made a speech on the floor of the House on June 10th 1949 which I had told you about

10:24.840 --> 10:29.780
Alaska while they should have statehood and we wanted to fight for it and I just want

10:29.780 --> 10:34.080
to read the last two paragraphs of that speech.

10:34.080 --> 10:40.720
I said to my fellow senators I am sure it would have been inconceivable to the founding fathers

10:40.720 --> 10:47.120
that Americans anywhere or in any area should exist for long under the under a form of government

10:47.120 --> 10:52.120
which denies them the benefits of suffrage and representation.

10:52.120 --> 10:57.320
Alaskans have been denied statehood for more than four store years.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.680
They should be denied no longer.

10:59.680 --> 11:07.160
I speak for Alaska statehood and I speak for the bill the earnest and expeditious consideration

11:07.160 --> 11:13.400
from the committees and the members of the Senate which it so rightly deserves.

11:13.400 --> 11:18.640
And I wish I had time to read all of that speech but maybe some of the voters up there will

11:18.640 --> 11:24.080
have a chance of reading it before they make up their mind in this Alaska primary which

11:24.080 --> 11:26.760
is coming off shortly.

11:26.760 --> 11:32.720
And then in 1952 when the statehood bill came up before the Senate it's true as you said

11:32.720 --> 11:39.680
bill of Bob that I cancel an important engagement in Iowa to fly back to vote.

11:39.680 --> 11:45.320
I did so because to me statehood is one of the vital issues before our Congress and I

11:45.320 --> 11:49.000
wouldn't have thought about having the bill come up for consideration without being

11:49.000 --> 11:50.680
here to vote on it.

11:50.680 --> 11:55.520
And I was happy to fly back because I believe in the cause and not only flew back but I made

11:55.520 --> 12:00.440
a statement at that time to my colleagues in the Senate as you know Bob.

12:00.440 --> 12:08.120
Well in 1952 statehood we lost our fight but each year just as this year we introduced

12:08.120 --> 12:11.120
legislation for our Alaskan statehood.

12:11.120 --> 12:15.760
I think our chances for success this year are better than ever before.

12:15.760 --> 12:20.920
We still face a long uphill battle but we won't give up the fight.

12:20.920 --> 12:26.880
If I could invite all of the reluctant members of Congress to Alaska as I came last summer

12:26.880 --> 12:30.520
we would have no trouble passing this legislation.

12:30.520 --> 12:36.840
Your wonderful cities, your vigorous spirit, your fine people would convey to them far more

12:36.840 --> 12:41.800
than my viewpoint that Alaska must be the 49th state.

12:41.800 --> 12:47.240
If they came they would learn first hand what it means to be an American without the right

12:47.240 --> 12:49.040
to vote.

12:49.040 --> 12:54.160
In the past you have been moderate and patient in your demands for statehood but your efforts

12:54.160 --> 12:58.440
to obtain home rule by degrees has always been unsuccessful.

12:58.440 --> 13:04.800
Personally I favor immediate statehood and will fight for it until we get it.

13:04.800 --> 13:10.320
Last studies of Alaska studies undertaken at great length to answer critics of my proposal

13:10.320 --> 13:12.400
for statehood.

13:12.400 --> 13:18.520
Convents me at the well and extent of Alaska's resources once they are properly developed

13:18.520 --> 13:24.160
will make a great contribution to the economy of the entire United States.

13:24.160 --> 13:28.760
These resources would be quickly developed if you had home rule.

13:28.760 --> 13:34.400
The prospects for development of timber is only one example of what could happen if Alaska

13:34.400 --> 13:36.200
had statehood.

13:36.200 --> 13:43.000
The great timber resources of the Congas National Forest could feed the pulp mill at Ketchikan

13:43.000 --> 13:48.480
as well as the two new pulp mills that pose that sicken and do know.

13:48.480 --> 13:54.880
Development like this would place out eastern Alaska on a sound economic basis.

13:54.880 --> 13:59.800
Economic stability will be further recognized when Alaska is gaining administrative control

13:59.800 --> 14:01.680
over the fisheries.

14:01.680 --> 14:06.440
And when the salmon runs are restored to their former condition.

14:06.440 --> 14:12.060
In recent years opposing forces have always been powerful enough to block many important

14:12.060 --> 14:15.600
measures like the abolition of fish traps.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.920
With statehood this problem would not exist.

14:18.920 --> 14:23.080
Government would be back in the hands of the people where it rightly belongs.

14:23.080 --> 14:28.800
The great mineral potential of the sword to mention it is not a potential merely for

14:28.800 --> 14:31.880
Alaska but for all of America.

14:31.880 --> 14:37.760
Your vast hydroelectric possibilities can provide cheap electricity to make a laskan industry

14:37.760 --> 14:38.760
boom.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.720
Go mining too.

14:40.720 --> 14:46.320
May one day make a comeback to its former important position in your economy.

14:46.320 --> 14:52.040
If the service made to know that Alaska is now the only political subdivision of the United

14:52.040 --> 14:56.120
States, not included in the Federal Highway Act.

14:56.120 --> 14:59.800
And even Puerto Rico and Hawaii are included.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.920
Alaska has been under the American flag since 1867.

15:03.920 --> 15:09.280
You have today you have less than 4,000 miles of roads.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.160
The reason you don't have roads is simple.

15:12.160 --> 15:18.040
You must depend upon the up and down chiefly down let me say, direct appropriations from

15:18.040 --> 15:21.480
the Interior Department or your road building.

15:21.480 --> 15:26.920
If you have the vote, government departments would be more responsive to your wishes.

15:26.920 --> 15:32.520
If you Bob for instance had a full vote in the House of Representation and we had two

15:32.520 --> 15:37.480
United States Senators from Alaska, things would be very different.

15:37.480 --> 15:43.880
The report of the Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency of which I am the chairman

15:43.880 --> 15:49.440
gathered information which proves that Hyundai doubt that Alaska is being treated like

15:49.440 --> 15:52.040
a stepson of our republic.

15:52.040 --> 15:56.360
The Federal services to youth and the territory are appalling.

15:56.360 --> 16:02.520
Alaska unfortunate youngsters who come into trouble with the law and who need sympathetic

16:02.520 --> 16:07.600
help must be sent thousands of miles from home for treatment.

16:07.600 --> 16:12.040
A condition which in itself can breed delinquency.

16:12.040 --> 16:20.040
As a senator I have fought hard for a laskin statehood as president I will continue that fight.

16:20.040 --> 16:24.880
I would consider it an important part of my legislative program and I want you to know

16:24.880 --> 16:29.160
very positively that I am against fish traps too.

16:29.160 --> 16:34.680
On April 24th friends the laskins will have their only chance to vote their choice for

16:34.680 --> 16:35.680
president.

16:35.680 --> 16:41.560
Whether you vote with the Democrats or with the Republicans I know you will vote.

16:41.560 --> 16:46.920
The sound of your vote will be heard in the United States and I certainly hope that you

16:46.920 --> 16:50.240
will support me in the primary.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.560
I have fought for you.

16:51.560 --> 16:56.800
I hope that you will give me a chance in an even more important position in the United

16:56.800 --> 17:03.480
States Senate to continue to fight for your welfare and this I certainly promise to do.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.480
Thank you very much.

17:11.560 --> 17:31.280
Ladies and gentlemen you remember the 1952 presidential campaign when the Republicans promised

17:31.280 --> 17:34.960
to reform and give the working man an even break.

17:34.960 --> 17:39.840
Well labor was suspicious of the Republican campaign promises and labor had good reason

17:39.840 --> 17:41.520
to be suspicious.

17:41.520 --> 17:46.140
The American working man had remembered only too well the raw deal he received under the

17:46.140 --> 17:50.960
Republicans before Franklin Roosevelt gave him a new deal.

17:50.960 --> 17:55.680
But in 1952 the Republicans did a good job of persuading a lot of Americans that they

17:55.680 --> 17:58.120
had in truth reformed.

17:58.120 --> 18:03.160
They promised the working man a secretary of labor sympathetic to labor centers.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.560
They also promised changes in the task partly law.

18:06.560 --> 18:11.440
So what happened you and I know that the Republicans never made good on their campaign

18:11.440 --> 18:12.680
promises.

18:12.680 --> 18:16.720
The Eisenhower team had been in the White House only six months when its own secretary

18:16.720 --> 18:21.880
of labor resigned because the administration had broken faith with labor.

18:21.880 --> 18:26.840
As for the promised changes in the task partly law the Republicans proposed changes all

18:26.840 --> 18:27.840
right.

18:27.840 --> 18:33.600
They proposed changes against the best interest of organized labor and sent them to Congress.

18:33.600 --> 18:38.480
Millions of other Americans the union man has learned of his regret that Republican

18:38.480 --> 18:41.880
campaign promises just can't be trusted.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.240
Take the tragic flight of the farmer.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.320
You all know how important that is in the future of this area.

18:48.320 --> 18:55.360
Back in 1952 the Republicans promised 90 or 100% of parity and rigid price supports.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.520
To the farm they broke that promise.

18:58.520 --> 19:03.840
Instead of rigid supports the farmer was given a so-called sliding scale and you know

19:03.840 --> 19:05.360
what that meant.

19:05.360 --> 19:10.840
Under the GOP scheme the farmers always sliding to the bottom of the scale.

19:10.840 --> 19:16.480
Well thanks to the NF Republican policy millions of farmers are being driven off their land

19:16.480 --> 19:21.360
because they can no longer make ends meet and yet the price is paid by housewives with

19:21.360 --> 19:24.800
food in the cities hasn't come down a bit.

19:24.800 --> 19:29.280
You know this administration talks a lot about its faith in our American system of free

19:29.280 --> 19:30.600
enterprise.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.080
But how does it demonstrate that faith?

19:33.080 --> 19:38.520
Well by encouraging bigger and bigger mergers while more and more small business men are

19:38.520 --> 19:43.080
going under because they are being squeezed out by the monopolists.

19:43.080 --> 19:47.560
All of you know how important it is to have plenty of cheap electricity.

19:47.560 --> 19:54.040
You also know that the cheapest electricity results from competition by public power agencies.

19:54.040 --> 19:57.240
And what is the Republican record on power?

19:57.240 --> 20:01.960
Ever since they took over they have been doing their very best to give away our public power

20:01.960 --> 20:06.160
facilities and put them in the hands of Wall Street.

20:06.160 --> 20:11.080
Their attempt to sneak through the fraudulent Dixonates contract is just one example of

20:11.080 --> 20:13.040
their giveaway program.

20:13.040 --> 20:18.480
You people here know that this attack on public power involves an attack on R.E.A. which

20:18.480 --> 20:22.560
is so vital to the prosperity of your state.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.200
Workers are only asking for an even break in the marketplace.

20:26.200 --> 20:30.800
And all the small business men ask is protection from the monopolies which are squeezing him

20:30.800 --> 20:32.400
out of business.

20:32.400 --> 20:38.880
And all of us in this nation of working men and women want jobs and wage security.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.600
We also want peace and a free world.

20:41.600 --> 20:46.360
I feel that the prime task of government is to create an atmosphere in which all can

20:46.360 --> 20:47.360
be successful.

20:47.360 --> 20:52.920
A stable, well-balanced economy is the only way in which security can be achieved, not

20:52.920 --> 20:59.520
by a tough, heavy economy, in which the privileged few are favored above the great majority.

20:59.520 --> 21:04.400
It is also the duty of government to see to it that laws are not passed which will restrict

21:04.400 --> 21:10.120
the rights of labor to organize, to bargain collectively, or to restrict the individual

21:10.120 --> 21:14.200
worker from expressing his personal political views.

21:14.200 --> 21:19.440
Throughout my 17 years in Congress, I have energetically defended the best interest of

21:19.440 --> 21:20.520
organized labor.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.920
I invite you to examine my voting records.

21:23.920 --> 21:27.520
You will find that I have been consistently on the side of the wage earner.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.520
I voted against the Taff Partley Act for instance.

21:31.520 --> 21:36.840
When I supported President Truman's veto audit, and I intend to do all in my power to

21:36.840 --> 21:43.640
draft a new law or to amend the old one, a long line sparing to America's great unions.

21:43.640 --> 21:49.480
If I am elected President, I intend to see that our government accepts its full responsibility

21:49.480 --> 21:52.040
for the well-being of every citizen.

21:52.040 --> 21:57.680
I believe in the American dream of equal opportunity and equal rights for every citizen.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.680
I shall strive to make that dream come true.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.680
Thank you very much.

22:14.640 --> 22:20.040
Thank you very much, Congresswoman Koye Kanutsen.

22:20.040 --> 22:24.320
My friends in Minnesota, I want to speak to you for a few minutes to urge the re-election

22:24.320 --> 22:27.560
of my very good friend Koye Kanutsen.

22:27.560 --> 22:33.240
I came to know your representative in Congress at the National Convention in 1952.

22:33.240 --> 22:38.280
Through the years of our association, both before and after her first election, I have gained

22:38.280 --> 22:44.160
great respect for your representative in Congress as a person of hard work and dedication

22:44.160 --> 22:46.200
to her constituents.

22:46.200 --> 22:51.200
Koye Kanutsen has brought into politics her very kindly feeling toward people and has

22:51.200 --> 22:54.920
brought into politics a high ethical approach.

22:54.920 --> 22:59.960
First is your vice presidential nominee, along with Adelaide Stevenson, appreciated the

22:59.960 --> 23:03.960
solid support of Congresswoman Koye Kanutsen.

23:03.960 --> 23:08.560
On her first year in Congress, she became a voice for the family farmer.

23:08.560 --> 23:15.480
From years of experience as a teacher, this lady legislator knows the need of education.

23:15.480 --> 23:22.040
Her experience on a family farm as a triple-aid farm-filled woman gave the family farmer a real

23:22.040 --> 23:24.040
voice in Congress.

23:24.040 --> 23:29.240
Koye Kanutsen's service on the Red Lake County Welfare Board is the type of experience

23:29.240 --> 23:32.160
few congressmen have had.

23:32.160 --> 23:37.400
Since small business, another attribute makes her well-qualified and her present fight for

23:37.400 --> 23:43.320
small business as opposed to the mergers which are constantly taking place.

23:43.320 --> 23:47.520
These qualifications serve you well in Washington, D.C.

23:47.520 --> 23:53.080
Second Koye Kanutsen has won national acclaim for the high moral approach she has provided

23:53.080 --> 23:55.360
as a lady legislator.

23:55.360 --> 24:00.480
She holds great respect among the leaders of Congress both in the House and in the Senate.

24:00.480 --> 24:05.240
She has won nationwide respect for the work of her office.

24:05.240 --> 24:10.520
Just this year she was awarded an engraved silver cup for a successfully moving legislation

24:10.520 --> 24:16.120
to fight the most dreadful children's disease, septic fibrosis.

24:16.120 --> 24:21.080
Congresswoman Koye Kanutsen has been called upon to speak on ethics and government before

24:21.080 --> 24:23.440
national church meetings.

24:23.440 --> 24:28.520
Koye Kanutsen was given a citation for Kristen Leadership, another woman of the National

24:28.520 --> 24:30.720
Council of Churches.

24:30.720 --> 24:36.000
These among other things demonstrated the love and affection of which Minnesota's congresswoman

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
is held.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.160
Third year congresswoman has achieved major accomplishments in the halls of Congress.

24:43.160 --> 24:47.680
Normally it would take years of seniority before a member of Congress is able to produce

24:47.680 --> 24:49.160
major legislation.

24:49.160 --> 24:55.400
However, hard work and intelligence has made it possible for her to do so earlier.

24:55.400 --> 25:00.400
This is in addition to an above average attendance record on roll call votes.

25:00.400 --> 25:06.280
You should remember these accomplishments of Koye Kanutsen when you cast your ballots.

25:06.280 --> 25:13.680
The college student loan program past this year is the principle of Koye Kanutsen's student

25:13.680 --> 25:19.560
loan program which she introduced several years ago and has been fighting for a long time.

25:19.560 --> 25:26.040
The C-5 doses, the second most dreadful children's disease, has over one million dollars

25:26.040 --> 25:29.480
in research appropriations due to her efforts.

25:29.480 --> 25:35.040
The small business tax relief investment fund was passed this year with Koye Kanutsen's

25:35.040 --> 25:36.440
good health.

25:36.440 --> 25:42.080
The first step toward a family farm parity income legislation program was passed out of

25:42.080 --> 25:47.440
the House Agriculture Committee, viewing good part to her efforts.

25:47.440 --> 25:52.520
I want to urge each and every one of my friends to vote to re-elect Koye Kanutsen.

25:52.520 --> 25:56.840
You have every right to vote with pride for Congresswoman Koye Kanutsen.

25:56.840 --> 26:02.920
On the basis of experience and the triple A teaching business four years in the Minnesota

26:02.920 --> 26:09.640
legislature with six state-wide bills as a result of her work, four years on the powerful

26:09.640 --> 26:15.320
agricultural committee of the House of Representatives and four years as your voice in the House of

26:15.320 --> 26:17.400
Representatives.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.200
Be sure to vote November 4 for Koye Kanutsen.

26:20.200 --> 26:24.400
Thank you very much.

26:24.400 --> 26:37.920
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Senator Estes Tiefalvers speaking to you from the at the conclusion

26:37.920 --> 26:44.840
of the fourth annual NATO Parliamentarian Association which has been held at the Talley de Chiro

26:44.840 --> 26:46.080
in Paris, France.

26:46.080 --> 26:52.920
We are very happy to have with us on this occasion a distinguished and able president of the

26:52.920 --> 27:00.680
NATO Parliamentarians Association for two of our four sessions, panel Jay-J Fenn of the

27:00.680 --> 27:01.680
Netherlands.

27:01.680 --> 27:08.520
Panel Fenn is one of the leading members of what is equivalent to our Congress in the

27:08.520 --> 27:14.120
Netherlands and he has presided over and has given excellent direction to the NATO Parliamentarians

27:14.120 --> 27:15.120
Association.

27:15.120 --> 27:21.920
It is good to have you with us, Colonel Fenn and to have you speak to this American audience.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.120
Thank you very much.

27:24.120 --> 27:32.680
Senator, I am very glad to meet you again in this week in Paris and in the first place

27:32.680 --> 27:38.680
I should like to say that I am very grateful to you personally for the support and the

27:38.680 --> 27:45.320
very great cooperation, you have been asked in our work this week.

27:45.320 --> 27:52.840
Well, Colonel Fenn, then there is a task to work with you, personally has been so dedicated

27:52.840 --> 27:57.080
to the cause of NATO and of the unity of the NATO countries.

27:57.080 --> 28:03.800
I should like to ask very, you, the state is basically what do you feel the principal accomplishments

28:03.800 --> 28:07.680
of this session of the parliamentarians has been?

28:07.680 --> 28:16.400
Well, Senator, I think we should make a difference between a accomplishment done by the parliamentarians

28:16.400 --> 28:22.280
and the settlers and I should say by the very distinguished archipers we have invited

28:22.280 --> 28:24.600
to address you and in the conference.

28:24.600 --> 28:28.240
I think we had a marvelous list of speakers.

28:28.240 --> 28:33.800
We had in the first place General Norstead, the Prime Minister and a light commander of

28:33.800 --> 28:42.500
the NATO, we had the Secretary General of the NATO, the Michel Polaris Park, we had the

28:42.500 --> 28:50.720
German Minister of Defence, head of the Strauss, we had the very well known Michel General

28:50.720 --> 28:58.960
of the United States, John B. Medehrs and we had the Secretary General of the OEC,

28:58.960 --> 29:00.840
the Michel de Nassau, John.

29:00.840 --> 29:07.120
I suppose, Senator, that this gentleman had filled to us was very and very important

29:07.120 --> 29:15.960
and it could be only been very instructive, not only in general, but especially to us as parliamentarians.

29:15.960 --> 29:22.720
But to now Colonel Fenn, one of our great programs is that the NATO Parliamentarians' association

29:22.720 --> 29:28.040
is sponsoring the London Citizens Conference in June of next year on the Kent anniversary

29:28.040 --> 29:33.960
of NATO and you have had a great hand in the direction of the arrangements for this meeting.

29:33.960 --> 29:40.280
I would like for you to tell our American listeners are the importance and of the aims of

29:40.280 --> 29:44.440
this most important London Citizens Conference of next year.

29:44.440 --> 29:50.480
Now Senator, I should say I have to return back to the compliment you made me.

29:50.480 --> 29:57.800
I think and I should say here, publicly, that you have been one of the, I think the

29:57.800 --> 29:59.800
principal originator of this congress.

29:59.800 --> 30:03.200
Well, you're very kind, but sure they made one and you.

30:03.200 --> 30:12.600
And then the, it would be very unfriendly from us to say the assumed UIDs, but you were

30:12.600 --> 30:19.560
kind enough to give UIDs to us and then we went on with the organization of this congress.

30:19.560 --> 30:26.920
And well, I think the aim of the congress, I can put it in a few words, the aim of the

30:26.920 --> 30:36.000
congress is to reconsider the status of the Atlantic community.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
As you have already said, the, they'll have this congress as a, to commemorate the 10th

30:43.000 --> 30:45.440
anniversary of NATO.

30:45.440 --> 30:52.680
NATO of, 9th of 49 is not the same one as NATO in 59, I suppose, and I think you agree with

30:52.680 --> 30:53.680
me.

30:53.680 --> 31:02.320
And therefore, the intended to have a congress of citizens out of the 50 NATO countries.

31:02.320 --> 31:07.840
There will not be a parliamentary congress, it will be a citizen congress.

31:07.840 --> 31:14.480
And we thought that we should give the citizens supporting the NATO ID and the NATO community

31:14.480 --> 31:20.040
of the Atlantic community ID, that we should give them the opportunity to give their opinion

31:20.040 --> 31:26.520
not what has been done in NATO and in the Atlantic community, but what we should do in the

31:26.520 --> 31:34.040
next 10 years in order to, to fortify the Atlantic Alliance and the Atlantic ID.

31:34.040 --> 31:38.360
Well, I think that's a very good description of the intention of this most important

31:38.360 --> 31:44.400
congress to give the people who must back up the NATO efforts and opportunities to speak

31:44.400 --> 31:50.440
and to talk and to understand and discuss the problems of NATO and of the Atlantic community.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.760
Well, kind of ends, I want to thank you very much for being on this program.

31:53.760 --> 31:58.640
It's been an inspiration to be with you and to work with you throughout these years.

31:58.640 --> 32:03.560
And we will look forward to the London Conference and its great success.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.360
Thank you very much.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.880
Thank you, Tanya.

32:06.880 --> 32:13.540
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Estes Keepovers speaking to you directly from the NATO Parliament

32:13.540 --> 32:19.360
Parian Association in the Palais de Chau and Paris France.

32:19.360 --> 32:25.120
We have had a very successful conference here in Paris, where representatives from the

32:25.120 --> 32:30.320
Parliament and Congresses of 15 nations have been meeting for one week to discuss common

32:30.320 --> 32:31.320
problems.

32:31.320 --> 32:36.360
I'm very happy to have it our guest in the studio today, one of the most distinguished members

32:36.360 --> 32:39.280
of Parliament of the United Kingdom.

32:39.280 --> 32:46.600
Sir Thomas Duddale has been a member of the House of Commons for more than 30 years,

32:46.600 --> 32:53.600
and he is the leader of the British delegation here at the NATO Parliamentarians conference.

32:53.600 --> 33:00.600
Sir Thomas is good to have you on the program, the other listeners over this station, what

33:00.600 --> 33:04.600
you think of our meeting and of its accomplishments.

33:04.600 --> 33:10.600
We also have a huge pleasure for me to be here with you today in the studio, meeting from

33:10.600 --> 33:19.100
Paris, because it does happen to be a first occasion that I have attended a parliamentary

33:19.100 --> 33:25.600
conference of this nature, and I do happen to be the leader of the United Kingdom delegation.

33:25.600 --> 33:32.100
For the first thing that has impressed me in all our proceedings during the week is the

33:32.100 --> 33:39.100
large amount of human inhumane, which prevails amongst the NATO countries.

33:39.100 --> 33:46.100
Sir Thomas, we have discussed matters of a political significance.

33:46.100 --> 33:49.100
General Nostrad has briefed us.

33:49.100 --> 33:54.900
We've talked about political matters, economic matters, social matters, and you say there's

33:54.900 --> 34:00.100
been a tremendous meeting of the minds of delegates from all of the 15 nations.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.100
That's correct.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.100
And I think it's actually correct.

34:02.100 --> 34:08.100
And it has been a great privilege to me, and I'm certain those of you who are listening

34:08.100 --> 34:13.100
and doing this particular kind of our proceedings, when there is a set time of the chairmanship

34:13.100 --> 34:16.100
or the Kiteva on a political committee.

34:16.100 --> 34:21.100
And it is quite remarkable the way in which all the nations gathered around the table on

34:21.100 --> 34:26.100
these chairmanship followed the guidance he gave us in the chair.

34:26.100 --> 34:30.100
Sir Thomas, you are very kind, and I did appreciate that being elected chairman of the

34:31.100 --> 34:32.100
political committee.

34:32.100 --> 34:37.100
And I might say that I think on the political committee, the principal accomplishments

34:37.100 --> 34:44.100
were first a united stand insofar as the problem of Berlin is concerned, so that the Soviet

34:44.100 --> 34:51.100
Union and its puppet government of East Germany would make no mistake that if they do not

34:51.100 --> 34:56.100
follow their responsibilities, if they beat their obligations and connection with Berlin,

34:56.100 --> 35:03.100
all of the NATO nations would be united for the defense of the free world and West Berlin.

35:03.100 --> 35:06.100
Do you think that was a fine accomplishment?

35:06.100 --> 35:07.100
I think it was.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.100
They found it accomplishment.

35:08.100 --> 35:14.100
And again, the interesting was how much everybody was in agreement in passing that resolution

35:14.100 --> 35:15.100
on the your temperature.

35:15.100 --> 35:21.100
And we had a resolution of the main disputes that seemed to exist between NATO nations

35:21.100 --> 35:28.100
present time, as in connection with Cyprus and also the Icelandic fishery matter.

35:28.100 --> 35:34.100
And we passed a resolution to try to set up a better machinery for the settlement of disputes

35:34.100 --> 35:36.100
among NATO nations.

35:36.100 --> 35:39.100
And I think that is maybe a contribution that is worthwhile.

35:39.100 --> 35:47.100
Sir Thomas, we are having the citizens conference in London next year, which I think is going

35:47.100 --> 35:51.100
to be one of the most important things for the free world that has ever happened.

35:51.100 --> 35:54.100
And will you tell about the importance of this?

35:54.100 --> 36:00.100
You will be in a leading, you will be the leader of the British delegation at this conference.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.100
And I hope to be there myself.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.100
That is a very good deal, I think.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.100
Well, I think it will all right.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.100
I hope they are great success.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.100
We are getting hold of citizens.

36:08.100 --> 36:11.100
I do ask people to remember that we are citizens.

36:11.100 --> 36:15.100
Not only part of the Italians, but the stingless citizens in the NATO countries.

36:16.100 --> 36:27.100
The carbon gather together in London in June of next year to make a definite exhibition to the world.

36:27.100 --> 36:33.100
How united we are after the NATO organization has been in being a ten years.

36:33.100 --> 36:40.100
I want to say again, friends, I think this is one of the most important international meetings I have ever had

36:40.100 --> 36:42.100
and opportunity of attending.

36:42.100 --> 36:50.100
I am delighted with the solidarity of purpose and the unity of action on military, economic and political matters

36:50.100 --> 36:59.100
that has been brought about between the 15 North Atlantic nations, composing NATO at this most important meeting in Paris.

36:59.100 --> 37:06.100
I know that as long as we can stand together, there will be little danger of war because together we have great strength.

37:07.100 --> 37:15.100
But our purpose is to have peace and freedom and whenever we can have this armament, the under proper inspection and controls,

37:15.100 --> 37:17.100
all of the NATO nations want that.

37:17.100 --> 37:22.100
And again, thank you very much Sir Thomas Duddale for appearing on this program.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.100
That is all for now.

37:25.100 --> 37:27.100
Thank you very much Sir Thomas Duddale.

37:31.100 --> 37:38.100
Back in 1952, my good friend Fred Fiat traveled the Vermont campaign trail in my behalf.

37:38.100 --> 37:45.100
And I have been keeping in touch with this outstanding public servant and with his good record since that time.

37:45.100 --> 37:48.100
I saw him again in Vermont in 1956.

37:49.100 --> 37:53.100
I took great pride in having a man like Fred engage in my campaign.

37:53.100 --> 38:03.100
His record of public service as an outstanding member of the state legislature makes me equally proud at this time to support his candidacy for the United States Senate.

38:03.100 --> 38:10.100
Fred's fight to obtain low cost power for farmers and electric cooperatives has been truly outstanding.

38:10.100 --> 38:17.100
He deserves the support of the farmer, labor and small business man, as well as all forward-thinking people of the state of Vermont.

38:17.100 --> 38:25.100
I am looking forward with a great deal of pleasure to serving in the United States Senate with Vermont's outstanding candidate Fred Fiat.
