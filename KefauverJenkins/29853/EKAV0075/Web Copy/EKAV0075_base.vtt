WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.180
We in Tennessee and in the Tennessee delegation are very proud of some of our distinguished

00:10.180 --> 00:16.180
Tennessee insuroccupied half places in the federal government here in Washington.

00:16.180 --> 00:21.820
I'm sure that you're familiar with all of these gentlemen.

00:21.820 --> 00:27.460
For instance, Bill Henry, who comes from Memphis, is the chairman of the Federal Communications

00:27.460 --> 00:28.460
Commission.

00:28.860 --> 00:32.640
It's your swedler who used to be with the Tennessee Valley Authority and the lawyer

00:32.640 --> 00:35.900
in Tennessee is chairman of the Federal Power Commission.

00:35.900 --> 00:42.220
But a man that I have been more closely associated with and I expect that over Tennessee is better

00:42.220 --> 00:46.700
known for many many reasons than most anyone else is.

00:46.700 --> 00:52.460
None other than Paul Rand Dixon, who is the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

00:52.860 --> 01:00.040
We are very glad to have you around on our program today and to have you stick to the

01:00.040 --> 01:03.940
listeners over the station and to your many friends in Tennessee.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.740
Nice to be here with you, Senator.

01:05.740 --> 01:08.740
It's always a pleasure to be around you.

01:08.740 --> 01:15.340
May I say by way of background that Rand comes up a very fine family at Davidson County

01:15.340 --> 01:17.540
in Nashville.

01:18.540 --> 01:24.540
I remember that he used to be the old Southern half back on the Vanderbilt football team

01:24.540 --> 01:26.540
for four years.

01:26.540 --> 01:31.180
Rand, I think that we used to, this Vanderbilt football team used to play Tennessee

01:31.180 --> 01:32.180
once in a while.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.980
Didn't you and you were over there?

01:33.980 --> 01:36.180
I went to Nashville many times.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.380
I didn't come home happy very often.

01:38.380 --> 01:45.180
Well, as I remember, the back of those days you used to win one game once in a while.

01:45.180 --> 01:48.100
I was on one team at the Big Vanderbilt in fact.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.100
Big Vanderbilt.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.100
A big Tennessee.

01:50.100 --> 01:54.340
I think it was in 1935.

01:54.340 --> 01:57.180
It's about the first time in ten years we'd beaten Tennessee.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.580
Well, of course I was just a few years after I had been at the University of Tennessee.

02:01.580 --> 02:07.340
But I remember I used to go back to all the Tennessee Vanderbilt games and you were a great

02:07.340 --> 02:08.340
heart back.

02:08.340 --> 02:12.940
It was a great joy to watch you play but I was always glad to see you come out on the,

02:12.940 --> 02:15.860
usually come out on the losing side.

02:15.860 --> 02:23.900
Anyway, friends, Randix has always taken an active part in Tennessee affairs here in

02:23.900 --> 02:24.900
Washington.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.180
Of course he goes back to Tennessee quite often.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.180
He's been down many times with me.

02:30.180 --> 02:35.640
He was there for two years, the president of the Tennessee State Society here in the

02:35.640 --> 02:40.940
nation's capital and I think was one of the most successful presidents we ever had.

02:41.940 --> 02:48.060
And then along about six or seven years ago I got to be chairman of the Antitrust and

02:48.060 --> 02:50.460
Monopoly subcommittee.

02:50.460 --> 02:56.560
This is committee in which we investigated high price of drugs and worked out of drug

02:56.560 --> 03:02.540
act and what he worked on other Monopoly and antitrust legislation carry on investigations

03:02.540 --> 03:08.220
of the high cost of steel, bread and many other things.

03:08.220 --> 03:14.540
So I was looking around for the very best man I could get to be the chief counsel for

03:14.540 --> 03:17.060
that and staff director of that committee.

03:17.060 --> 03:23.540
I was finally able to persuade Rand to come and be our chief counsel and staff director

03:23.540 --> 03:29.060
which he was before he went down to be chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.860
Rand, how'd you ever get to Washington in the first place?

03:31.860 --> 03:37.140
I remember when I graduated from Vanderbilt, Josh Cody took me down to Florida with him as

03:37.140 --> 03:39.580
an assistant football coach.

03:39.580 --> 03:45.300
I finished my long day out and as soon as I graduated I came looking for a job really

03:45.300 --> 03:50.980
and when I got here I met a great tennis player and a great friend of yours, Judge

03:50.980 --> 03:57.100
Yuan Davis who was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and he hired me and so I started

03:57.100 --> 03:58.100
with God.

03:58.100 --> 04:02.340
Yes, I remember Judge Yuan Davis, he's a great tennis see-on.

04:02.340 --> 04:09.340
He was a congressman from one of the middle districts of Tennessee for many many years

04:09.340 --> 04:12.500
and was made by chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.700
When was it you joined the Federal Trade Commission around?

04:14.700 --> 04:16.900
It was in July 1938.

04:16.900 --> 04:20.940
And I think you had a hitch in maybe for him.

04:20.940 --> 04:26.620
I mean, it's not short of four years in the Navy and four years with you, I bent the

04:26.620 --> 04:28.620
Federal Trade Commission.

04:28.620 --> 04:34.020
Well some people may not understand the great importance of the Federal Trade Commission

04:34.020 --> 04:37.620
and the business and to the consumers.

04:37.620 --> 04:41.540
I tell us generally about the work of the Federal Trade Commission.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.860
I don't know of any of these.

04:43.860 --> 04:47.060
How many members are of the Commission?

04:47.060 --> 04:54.420
Well, it's a five-man commission and no more than three can be a member of one political

04:54.420 --> 04:55.420
party.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.900
The terms are for seven years.

04:57.100 --> 05:00.020
I suppose you remember one of the political parties that I ran.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.020
I'm a good strong downfall.

05:02.020 --> 05:04.140
Yes, I do.

05:04.140 --> 05:10.460
And of course you know this agency was formed in 1914, created 1914.

05:10.460 --> 05:14.860
And it was created to help preserve the free enterprise system.

05:14.860 --> 05:19.340
They followed through with the old chairman act that was passed in 1890.

05:19.340 --> 05:25.220
By the time 1914 had come I think Congress had learned by that time that many of the

05:25.220 --> 05:32.780
problems that ultimately resulted in chairman act actions or causes of action should be dealt

05:32.780 --> 05:34.100
with in the beginning.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.500
And so they created the Federal Trade.

05:35.500 --> 05:42.020
Otherwise the chairman act which was passed in 1890 was during the time of the Greg Rubber

05:42.020 --> 05:47.300
Ballons and the big trust and so forth and was for the purpose of trying to break up

05:47.300 --> 05:50.340
monopolies and cartels after they've been formed.

05:50.340 --> 05:52.300
That's quite a problem once it's happened.

05:52.300 --> 05:59.020
And then the idea of the Federal Trade Commission act among other things was to try to prevent

05:59.020 --> 06:02.420
these monopolies and cartels from getting formed in first place.

06:02.420 --> 06:06.300
The things that lead to them, I see, in the Incipient Institute.

06:06.300 --> 06:13.460
I remember when I was on the House Judiciary Committee way back in the 40s that during

06:13.460 --> 06:21.180
Davis used to come up every year in urge that a loophole in the Clayton Act be which

06:21.180 --> 06:23.620
the Federal Trade Commission and ministers be plugged.

06:23.620 --> 06:29.820
And that is that corporations could join together by buying the assets of one another but

06:29.820 --> 06:33.580
they couldn't join together by buying the capital stock.

06:33.580 --> 06:40.620
I mean they could buy the stock but they couldn't start the could buy the assets.

06:40.620 --> 06:46.900
So that one corporation was by the assets of another and nothing would ever happen.

06:46.900 --> 06:52.640
And I worked with you and we finally got the so-called Solar Chief Oliver Bill Pass which

06:52.640 --> 06:55.300
plugged that loophole in 1950.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.780
That's one of the laws that you administer.

06:57.780 --> 06:58.780
Yes, yes, yes, sir.

06:58.780 --> 07:03.540
They're tough for them to deal with because these are mixed years as you know more than anybody

07:03.540 --> 07:04.540
else.

07:04.540 --> 07:09.060
They're mixed questions of fact, law, economics, and everything.

07:09.060 --> 07:11.580
You know what's interesting about that law?

07:11.580 --> 07:15.820
All the time and the effort that you in Congressmen's cell have put into the passage of this

07:15.820 --> 07:16.820
amendment.

07:16.820 --> 07:24.460
It's taken until just this past this year practically before we really fully understand

07:24.460 --> 07:30.020
it because with the Browns you decision the Supreme Court really under wrote the legislative

07:30.020 --> 07:31.020
history of that act.

07:31.020 --> 07:37.260
I've never seen a decision that quite was this specific in adopting the philosophy of the

07:37.260 --> 07:39.020
legislators in its past.

07:39.020 --> 07:44.980
Well then it's finally been pretty well defined by the court system what it means and that

07:44.980 --> 07:51.820
is that one corporation can require the capital stock or assets of another if it's going

07:51.820 --> 07:55.580
to suppress competition or tend to create them enough.

07:55.580 --> 07:58.980
And it may substantially lessen or tend to create them anopoly.

07:58.980 --> 08:04.980
But this doesn't mean it's a misunderstood statute as you probably will know.

08:04.980 --> 08:09.540
Many people think this says no one can merge and that certainly is not the law because many

08:09.540 --> 08:10.860
mergers are desirable.

08:10.860 --> 08:11.860
That's right.

08:11.860 --> 08:17.860
Those tight mergers that have this effect that you spoke of that must be eliminated.

08:17.860 --> 08:23.180
By administering a section seven of the Clayton Mac which is the merger provision is a very

08:23.180 --> 08:28.100
small part of your remarkable work with the Federal Trade Commission.

08:28.100 --> 08:34.900
And I think all businessmen and the chambers of commerce know that you brought new life

08:34.900 --> 08:39.260
and new vigor and a new outlook to the work of the Federal Trade Commission and trying

08:40.260 --> 08:41.260
to help small business.

08:41.260 --> 08:43.060
Would you tell us something about that right?

08:43.060 --> 08:48.220
Well I've been back to those four years that I spent with years your council on your

08:48.220 --> 08:51.340
animal and anopolis subcommittee.

08:51.340 --> 08:56.260
I remember the many instances of letters that you would get and would all be referred to

08:56.260 --> 09:02.900
you by other senators asking the question that well the Federal Trade Commission or the

09:02.900 --> 09:08.020
Department of Justice and the Trust Section is preceded against my constituent.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.100
Now I'm doing no more than the other competitors are doing.

09:12.100 --> 09:17.100
Why can't they proceed against all of them instead of me or us let me alone or us get

09:17.100 --> 09:18.900
them all?

09:18.900 --> 09:23.940
This taught me a very good lesson senator because traditionally for some 40 some ideas the

09:23.940 --> 09:30.180
commission had preceded case by case hoping that once it was completely litigated and

09:30.180 --> 09:36.220
approved by the high court that if someone else was doing the same thing they would voluntarily

09:36.220 --> 09:37.700
stop.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.700
This hasn't quite worked out but it took a long time to go through all the courts and

09:41.700 --> 09:44.060
all the other ones would be busted by that.

09:44.060 --> 09:49.900
That's correct so when I went there I thought that maybe the time had come for the commission

09:49.900 --> 09:56.040
to try to use new innovations to try to move against a substantial group against the

09:56.040 --> 10:01.340
practice instead of the one violated if they were all doing it for whatever reason caused

10:01.340 --> 10:02.340
it.

10:02.340 --> 10:06.220
We should try to do it as equitable as possible now.

10:06.220 --> 10:12.700
So I think that we've brought one other innovation there that is if you remember when the

10:12.700 --> 10:19.540
very sponsor such as President Wilson in 1912 or 1314 when he sponsored the Federal Trade

10:19.540 --> 10:25.140
Commission he had many things to say among which was that there should be created some

10:25.140 --> 10:31.620
agency where the businessman could come to and seek some kind of guidance and advise

10:31.620 --> 10:37.940
as if possible before he found himself in the throws of litigation and starting last

10:37.940 --> 10:44.180
July and just a little over a year ago we've offered this service to every American businessman

10:44.180 --> 10:50.020
that comes within our statutory obligations to come and if we can we'll give them this

10:50.020 --> 10:51.020
advice.

10:51.020 --> 10:57.500
I mean see if I understand if a businessman wants to start some new kind of practice and also

10:57.500 --> 11:06.060
you have control over the end of the property advertising, not for false advertisement and

11:06.060 --> 11:11.140
if they rather than take a chance on doing something you offer them the service of coming

11:11.140 --> 11:16.500
and giving them an opinion which you are bad by which is binding upon us we will be we

11:16.500 --> 11:20.260
will not change our mind unless we give them an opportunity to change this.

11:20.260 --> 11:26.980
Well I think that's very fun and should the service and should be highly employed as

11:26.980 --> 11:30.980
the business community cooperate with you in this round.

11:30.980 --> 11:36.820
So until they have been very accepted to this in fact the Chamber Commerce when they

11:36.820 --> 11:41.780
recently met here and the nation's capital has to resolution endorsing this effort on

11:41.780 --> 11:49.340
our part and as long as we can do this and do it well I think that will be better for

11:49.340 --> 11:53.940
our system because if a man as you say is going to spend millions of dollars in advertising

11:53.940 --> 11:58.260
campaign he shouldn't have to take a risk if there's some way it can be resolved.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.460
Any questions before?

12:00.460 --> 12:07.260
Well I'm Rand Urum you also administer the Robinson Prepman Act which is very important

12:07.260 --> 12:08.780
for smaller business.

12:08.780 --> 12:09.780
The end is that.

12:09.780 --> 12:13.180
That part of the Robinson Pärtman Act that amended the Clayton Act which is commonly

12:13.180 --> 12:19.140
the price discrimination, the discrimination section we exclusively practically enforce

12:19.140 --> 12:23.420
this law because justice has pretty well left this to us.

12:23.420 --> 12:28.700
Well your attitude in the Federal Trade Commission is to have good healthy competition but not

12:28.700 --> 12:34.340
to have one fellow doing something improper to his competition.

12:34.340 --> 12:39.300
We hold ourselves sent out as the servant of business.

12:39.300 --> 12:44.660
A fair business, every businessman wants to be fair and we want to help them to eliminate

12:44.660 --> 12:49.220
those unfair practices and destroy and hinder good competition.

12:49.220 --> 12:53.060
We also want to do our dead level best for the consumer.

12:53.060 --> 12:56.860
You know we have these four consumers that we enforce.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.700
We'll for a textile and infamible fabric act.

13:00.700 --> 13:05.820
This is the enforcement to see that the labels and the representations that Mrs. America

13:05.820 --> 13:09.380
goes in the store and reads are true.

13:09.380 --> 13:16.660
And the Federal Trade Commission is against price fixing on any kind of basis feeling that

13:16.660 --> 13:17.660
is that right?

13:17.660 --> 13:20.060
That's right sir, that's the law of the lands.

13:20.060 --> 13:24.460
Supreme God said price fixing is illegal per se and we enforce that.

13:24.460 --> 13:29.660
Well ladies and gentlemen I know you have enjoyed seeing and hearing from the chairman

13:29.660 --> 13:35.620
of the Federal Trade Commission, a great Tennessee and from Nashville, who is one of the finest

13:35.620 --> 13:39.260
public servants that we have in the Federal Government today.

13:39.260 --> 13:41.100
That's all for now until next time.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.100
Goodbye.

13:47.660 --> 13:59.020
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we are very proud and have volunteered

13:59.020 --> 14:05.420
state on the part that many of our distinguished citizens are playing in the Federal Government

14:05.420 --> 14:07.660
at the present time.

14:07.660 --> 14:14.300
We have as you know a citizen, Rand Dixon, who is chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,

14:14.300 --> 14:18.580
one of the most important regulatory agencies in Washington.

14:18.580 --> 14:24.280
Also Joe Svetler, who had a long and fine record with the Tennessee Valley Authority, is

14:24.280 --> 14:29.700
chairman of the old powerful Federal Power Commission that has to do with fixing gas rates

14:29.700 --> 14:32.260
and other matters of that kind.

14:32.260 --> 14:38.260
We are proud of the fact that they are doing very good jobs in their respective positions.

14:39.260 --> 14:45.740
But I know that all of you were related as I was when a few weeks ago President Kennedy

14:45.740 --> 14:51.220
announced the appointment of William Henry of Memphis, Tennessee, to be chairman of the

14:51.220 --> 14:54.700
Federal Communications Commission.

14:54.700 --> 14:58.420
This is a most important agency in Washington.

14:58.420 --> 15:04.020
We are honored to have Bill Henry of Memphis with us on this occasion and Bill Amp had

15:04.020 --> 15:09.700
introduced you to the listeners and viewers of this good television station.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.700
Thank you very much.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.540
I am pleased to be here for my first time.

15:12.540 --> 15:16.700
For your information you can see that Mr. Henry is a very young man, of course both

15:16.700 --> 15:18.700
others are.

15:18.700 --> 15:26.660
Young, I said he came from Memphis where he was practicing law as one of the leading young

15:26.660 --> 15:29.020
attorneys of that city.

15:29.020 --> 15:34.940
He graduated at Yale University of Yale with its AB degree and came down to Vanderbilt

15:34.940 --> 15:37.180
to get his law degree as LLB.

15:37.180 --> 15:43.620
He was very active in the last campaign during a great job and he has made a fine impression

15:43.620 --> 15:51.260
in Washington among people in the broadcasting industry and others that he has had an opportunity

15:51.260 --> 15:53.940
of being associated with.

15:53.940 --> 16:02.380
So part of the best part about him is that he has a lovely wife Sherry who is very popular

16:02.380 --> 16:04.820
with the ladies in Washington.

16:04.820 --> 16:12.300
He has daughter Elizabeth VI and Sherry III and you have a...

16:12.300 --> 16:14.780
Don't leave out junior.

16:14.780 --> 16:15.780
Don't leave out junior.

16:15.780 --> 16:16.780
We have a two-year-old son.

16:16.780 --> 16:19.780
We have a two-year-old William Junior.

16:19.780 --> 16:20.780
Right.

16:20.780 --> 16:21.780
A very fine family.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.900
That picture was in Washington, it was just a few days ago.

16:24.900 --> 16:29.220
Bill, how you like being in Washington and tell us something about the Federal Communications

16:29.220 --> 16:30.220
Commission?

16:30.220 --> 16:34.260
Well, I like it very much and I think the reason I like it is because I like my job so much.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.140
It's fascinating, challenging work.

16:37.140 --> 16:42.500
Well, what is the most important job about the Federal Communications Commission?

16:42.500 --> 16:44.860
Well, we have a lot of them.

16:44.860 --> 16:50.340
We have set up to regulate not only the broadcasting industry, radio and television but also telephone,

16:50.340 --> 16:52.420
telegraph, international communications.

16:52.420 --> 16:56.180
I think perhaps the Minnesota elements repay for our phone rates.

16:56.180 --> 17:04.180
We have to fix interstate phone rates, telegraph rates, overseas cables, rates and so on.

17:04.180 --> 17:10.060
I think our most important job at the moment is to implement the communications satellite

17:10.060 --> 17:14.300
bill that was passed last year by the Congress to see that gets off the ground properly and

17:14.300 --> 17:20.100
that it integrates properly with the rest of the countries in the world.

17:20.100 --> 17:25.580
So that we can truly have an international space communication satellite.

17:25.580 --> 17:26.580
That's right.

17:26.580 --> 17:29.420
I think I hope you consider some of the good amendments that some of us offered to the

17:29.420 --> 17:30.820
bill when we had it up.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.820
We consider all of those.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.900
It's extremely important now because it's a unique thing.

17:37.900 --> 17:38.900
It's never...

17:38.900 --> 17:39.900
Tell us something about it.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.900
We talked about it on the floor, the Senate for weeks and weeks and weeks at Interim

17:43.900 --> 17:48.100
but tell us something about space communication satellites.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.100
We could take up the whole program with that.

17:51.100 --> 17:58.540
Briefly, it's a unique combination of business enterprise and government regulation.

17:58.540 --> 18:07.140
It's 50% owned by the so-called Common Carriers which would include AT&T, IT&T, RCA and so on

18:07.140 --> 18:10.980
right communication carriers and 50% by the public.

18:10.980 --> 18:15.140
And then it's regulated thoroughly by the FCC.

18:15.140 --> 18:17.100
We established the rates.

18:17.100 --> 18:23.820
We decided where the ground stations will be, what type they'll be, whether the corporation

18:23.820 --> 18:26.980
will own them or whether they'll lease them and so on.

18:26.980 --> 18:34.220
And the corporation itself has the job of putting the orbiting satellites into operation

18:34.220 --> 18:38.180
and the dealing with all of the foreign countries that they must deal with to interconnect over

18:38.180 --> 18:39.180
there.

18:39.180 --> 18:43.860
So all in all, it's a most challenging job that we have in front of us.

18:43.860 --> 18:51.780
The communication satellite is put up by NASA by a rocket.

18:51.780 --> 19:01.200
Some of, I believe, the Pleasant ones or six or 700 miles high has been proposed to

19:01.200 --> 19:07.060
UND in orbit 22,000 miles hasn't it, 23?

19:07.060 --> 19:13.860
The signal is sent and then it's from here then sent back to a ground station in England

19:13.860 --> 19:16.340
so that people can talk back and forth.

19:16.340 --> 19:19.500
Television can be sent by way of the satellite.

19:19.500 --> 19:24.460
The idea is to bring the world closer together to make it easier to communicate.

19:24.460 --> 19:28.460
And that will be the way of communication in the years to come.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.300
I don't think there's any doubt about that.

19:30.300 --> 19:36.980
The problem is to, it's extremely expensive to get a satellite system in operation.

19:36.980 --> 19:44.260
And that's why it's got to be so carefully watched and guided so that it can be done

19:44.260 --> 19:45.260
in a practical manner.

19:45.260 --> 19:51.900
But even in this nation, as between Washington and San Francisco or Washington and Hawaii

19:51.900 --> 19:58.660
or Alaska, communication satellite can be used rather than the regular telephone lines

19:58.660 --> 19:59.660
can't they?

19:59.660 --> 20:02.500
They can, of course, it's not operational yet.

20:02.500 --> 20:07.500
And many of the companies are going ahead and putting in the regular cables.

20:07.500 --> 20:12.420
So it's got to be all tied in together and it's just tying in and coordination that

20:12.420 --> 20:13.900
really makes it the job that it is.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.980
Do you think it will be operational?

20:15.980 --> 20:20.140
Well I tried to say some people say it will be in 1970 or so, some people say it will

20:20.140 --> 20:21.980
be in the mid-60s.

20:21.980 --> 20:29.580
Of course, we all hope that it will be as soon as possible but not oversold and put

20:29.580 --> 20:30.580
up before it's really ready.

20:30.580 --> 20:37.460
There will have to be a number of satellites in order to have communications available

20:37.460 --> 20:39.180
for all parts of the world at the same time.

20:39.180 --> 20:42.740
You can't have just one or two up because if one goes out then you've lost communications

20:42.740 --> 20:44.700
and you've gotten a real system at all.

20:44.700 --> 20:50.660
Well, are you, the FCC and others talking with the British and the French and the Germans

20:50.660 --> 20:53.700
and even the Russians about Johnny and the program?

20:53.700 --> 20:59.380
That's one of the jobs that the corporation satellite itself is now doing.

20:59.380 --> 21:05.220
We at the FCC and we are using our good offices to put them together and to help them.

21:05.220 --> 21:09.500
But they are in the process now talking with the Canadians and I think they plan to go

21:09.500 --> 21:14.900
Europe very shortly and talk to the British post office and the offices on the continent.

21:14.900 --> 21:21.220
And then there will be a meeting I believe at the end of this year, the reference to the

21:21.220 --> 21:23.380
assignment of channels in Geneva.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.980
Then it's in January, it's in Geneva in October.

21:25.980 --> 21:31.140
That will go into the allocation of all the frequencies for all purposes that will be used

21:31.140 --> 21:32.140
in space.

21:32.140 --> 21:36.740
Well, that's all very interesting and that in itself is a big job.

21:36.740 --> 21:38.740
How many members of the FCC are there?

21:38.740 --> 21:40.220
Well, there's seven commissioners.

21:40.220 --> 21:42.580
Seven commissioners, one of whom is Chairman.

21:42.580 --> 21:46.260
Then you have quite a staff, but we in the Congress never give you quite enough money

21:46.260 --> 21:47.260
to do it.

21:47.260 --> 21:50.740
Well, we never get enough money but on the other hand, we are trying very hard to abide

21:50.740 --> 21:57.060
by the president's order which he issued some time ago saying to try to let the president

21:57.060 --> 22:01.820
personnel do the extra jobs instead of hiring extra men and try to get along on the same

22:01.820 --> 22:02.820
budget.

22:02.820 --> 22:10.180
Well, you have a charge of program programming of television and radio.

22:10.180 --> 22:14.420
What's the FCC's concern about programming at the present time?

22:14.420 --> 22:19.260
Well, programming, of course, is the end product of broadcasting and therefore we must be concerned

22:19.260 --> 22:24.020
with it since we are required to see that television radio operate in the public interest.

22:24.020 --> 22:31.540
It's a very fine line, however, between regulation on our part in the public interest and in

22:31.540 --> 22:37.420
no censorship provisions of the First Amendment and Section 326 of the Communications Act,

22:37.420 --> 22:44.100
we operate somewhere in between and we are concerned primarily with the overall operations

22:44.100 --> 22:45.780
of the stations in the public interest.

22:45.780 --> 22:53.460
What I mean concern at the moment is to see that the programs which the people can listen

22:53.460 --> 23:01.140
to and can pick from and choose from is a variety of subjects, not just the same old thing

23:01.140 --> 23:05.940
every night or every weekend and I think they could stand some improvement around those

23:05.940 --> 23:06.940
minds.

23:06.940 --> 23:13.300
Yeah, well, I had the flu here a while back and I was in bed and seemed to me about the

23:13.300 --> 23:17.340
programs I could find would be to shoot them up programs, the violent programs, while

23:17.340 --> 23:19.820
some of my enjoy do.

23:19.820 --> 23:26.220
Of course, again, you got problem censorship, but I do know that you're interested in

23:26.220 --> 23:30.340
trying to get television stations to have more public service programs more.

23:30.340 --> 23:34.940
Well, the reason that we are is because I think there are a lot of people who feel that

23:34.940 --> 23:39.420
they should be more and that's our job after all is to see that what they get, what they

23:39.420 --> 23:43.820
feel, what the people feel there is a need and an interest in.

23:43.820 --> 23:50.220
And then how about the programs that are the educational channels?

23:50.220 --> 23:51.700
Do they come under your supervision?

23:51.700 --> 23:56.100
Yes, we have to, we license not only the commercial broadcasts but also the educational

23:56.100 --> 23:57.100
television stations.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.100
How are they going along?

23:58.100 --> 23:59.100
I've been very interested in that.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.340
Well, they are progressing pretty well.

24:01.340 --> 24:05.940
There's been a great deal of recent interest in educational television.

24:05.940 --> 24:13.020
With the passage last year by the Congress of authority for the federal government to

24:13.020 --> 24:18.460
provide matching funds to states for educational television facilities.

24:18.460 --> 24:21.860
A lot of the states have now applied for networks.

24:21.860 --> 24:27.500
We must issue the licenses for those educational networks.

24:27.500 --> 24:30.140
The whole thing is developing, I think, very well.

24:30.140 --> 24:37.580
And it's interesting, I think, your audience will be interested in the fact that we believe

24:37.580 --> 24:43.060
some of us do it anyway, that the more educational television succeeds, the more it gets an interest

24:43.060 --> 24:50.140
in the community and people begin to look at it and enjoy it, it will upgrade all television.

24:50.140 --> 24:54.780
The commercial television will then have some competition will better itself.

24:54.780 --> 24:58.620
Commercial television then have programs like we're putting on very educational, struck

24:58.620 --> 24:59.620
by people.

24:59.620 --> 25:04.820
How many educational channels do we have or stations do we have in Tennessee?

25:04.820 --> 25:10.340
I don't know, offhand, I think the Tennessee legislature, so I'm not mistaken, just passed

25:10.340 --> 25:18.220
the law authorizing the proper state authority to petition the FCC for some channels looking

25:18.220 --> 25:20.380
towards the state in-school network.

25:20.380 --> 25:23.940
There's some in-school, there's some out-of-school.

25:23.940 --> 25:29.780
The one in Memphis I do know was one of the early television stations, and of course

25:29.780 --> 25:31.300
I think it can be far of that.

25:31.300 --> 25:33.300
And we have one in Nashville, I believe.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.300
Very soon.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.300
Very soon.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.300
Very soon.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.300
And we have one in Nashville too, yes.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.940
I heard a ton of these, the Tennessee stations doing generally, I think we have some

25:39.940 --> 25:41.940
modified television, I'd rather.

25:41.940 --> 25:46.140
Well, I haven't heard any complaints, and so I can assume that they're doing well.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.540
You mean, if they won't do well, you'd be hearing complaints.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.180
Well, hopefully we would, yes.

25:50.180 --> 25:52.940
Well, what is the public's rule in broadcasting?

25:52.940 --> 25:55.540
Well, that points it up.

25:55.540 --> 26:01.140
The public's rule, as I see it, is to let the stations know what they like, what they

26:01.140 --> 26:05.260
don't like, and when they're interested in not being served.

26:05.260 --> 26:09.340
And I think one of our big jobs is to try to get across to the public that they do have

26:09.340 --> 26:12.420
a role in what's put on.

26:12.420 --> 26:17.020
We're set up by law to try to get the stations to put on what they want.

26:17.020 --> 26:19.740
And I think it's a good combination.

26:19.740 --> 26:22.820
The more they would be interested in it, the more they would let us know about it.

26:22.820 --> 26:24.820
And I think the better they'd be served.

26:24.820 --> 26:28.820
In other words, are you like to have suggestions from the public, what kind of programs they

26:28.820 --> 26:29.820
like?

26:29.820 --> 26:35.700
Well, I think it's more important that they tell that to the broadcasters, and if they have

26:35.700 --> 26:41.540
general suggestions about lack of variety, or that programs they like are not at the right

26:41.540 --> 26:45.220
time, or things like that, they're all helpful.

26:45.220 --> 26:49.980
As we can't, as I say, we can never get into specific programs because of the censorship

26:49.980 --> 26:50.980
provision.

26:50.980 --> 26:51.980
And rightly so.

26:51.980 --> 26:57.180
And there must be commercials in order for the television radio stations to make money,

26:57.180 --> 26:59.180
which is, come out even.

26:59.180 --> 27:02.700
And I don't have all of these very, very loud commercials.

27:02.700 --> 27:07.460
Well, we've had a lot of complaints about that, and we're looking into it.

27:07.460 --> 27:11.100
It's a tough question because it's a subjective thing.

27:11.100 --> 27:14.940
What is loud to one person may be a little bit different to another, and the problem is

27:14.940 --> 27:15.940
measuring it.

27:15.940 --> 27:19.060
But we're hopeful, and I think we'll get out of rule on a chart.

27:19.060 --> 27:23.500
Well, Bill Henry, I want to thank you for coming and being with us, and we are

27:23.500 --> 27:24.500
very proud of you.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.300
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

27:27.300 --> 27:44.300
Let's see you again later on.

27:44.300 --> 27:49.420
Ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank this station for carrying this program as a

27:49.420 --> 27:51.300
public service.

27:51.300 --> 27:57.900
We will bring you news from Washington from time to time and interview outstanding personalities

27:57.900 --> 27:59.900
in our nation's capital.

27:59.900 --> 28:04.620
We will appreciate any suggestions that you make from time to time about the subject matters

28:04.620 --> 28:06.740
to be discussed on these programs.

28:06.740 --> 28:12.020
I'm very happy on this, the first program of the year, to have with us in the studio

28:12.020 --> 28:19.420
is our guest, one of the most brilliant soldier statesmen of this country and indeed of

28:19.420 --> 28:21.180
the world.

28:21.180 --> 28:25.940
With a possible exception of the late President Eisenhower, I do not think in recent years

28:25.940 --> 28:33.020
we have any person who has had such a brilliant military and civilian life as General Larris

28:33.020 --> 28:34.020
Northstead.

28:34.020 --> 28:41.420
General Northstead, it's wonderful to have you on this program with us and talk with you.

28:41.420 --> 28:48.740
General Northstead, as you know, was the Supreme Commander Allied Command Europe from 1952

28:48.740 --> 28:54.500
until he retired the 1st of December this year and he was also commander of the United

28:54.500 --> 28:56.900
States Forces in Europe.

28:56.900 --> 29:02.140
I can say of my own knowledge because I have been very interested in him and of course

29:02.140 --> 29:08.780
in the strength and building of NATO throughout the years that he has done a remarkable job

29:08.780 --> 29:14.940
in bringing together the might and strength of the 15 NATO countries.

29:14.940 --> 29:19.980
I think General Northstead that Nancy and I first got to know you early in the 1940s when

29:19.980 --> 29:22.380
you were probably a major.

29:22.380 --> 29:23.700
I guess true Senator.

29:23.700 --> 29:33.260
I think that perhaps 42 or 43 something about that time I would like to say how much this

29:33.260 --> 29:39.040
thesis made this opportunity to appear on this program with you not only because it

29:39.040 --> 29:45.380
gives me an opportunity with you to speak to an important segment of the American people

29:45.380 --> 29:52.940
but it also gives me the chance to express to them the great sense of gratitude that

29:52.940 --> 29:57.180
I feel toward you for the very active part.

29:57.740 --> 30:04.620
You have played over these last many years now in furthering the cause of the Atlantic

30:04.620 --> 30:07.660
Alliance and in supporting NATO.

30:07.660 --> 30:15.420
I remember seeing you and hearing your very forceful presentations at the NATO Parliamentary

30:15.420 --> 30:20.460
and conferences for instance, in particular this year when under your leadership it's

30:20.460 --> 30:26.100
very strong resolution supporting the Atlantic community, the Atlantic Alliance and NATO

30:26.100 --> 30:28.860
was adopted by the NATO parliamentarians.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.260
So I'm delighted to have you.

30:30.260 --> 30:31.260
Well thank you.

30:31.260 --> 30:32.260
Thank you, Larus.

30:32.260 --> 30:40.820
Listeners, we were seeing this program, of course at the NATO Parliamentarians have a meeting

30:40.820 --> 30:43.140
every year in Paris in November.

30:43.140 --> 30:49.180
Part of that meeting we have an opportunity of hearing General Northstead, visiting him

30:49.180 --> 30:55.860
at shape and he always receives this and has been over the years very, very highly respected

30:55.860 --> 31:01.860
by the military and the civilian leaders, the political leaders of all of the nations

31:01.860 --> 31:04.500
of Europe and of North American.

31:04.500 --> 31:11.180
General Northstead, we were talking about your original career, you were a lieutenant or

31:11.180 --> 31:17.220
major back in the forties then you got to be a Brigadier General, you ended the wars

31:17.220 --> 31:22.220
in major general and you went from there to obviously a full, full, full, full, full,

31:22.220 --> 31:26.780
well that's an unfortunate expression I think.

31:26.780 --> 31:32.140
When you took over as Supreme Commander in 1952 many of us had a feeling that our Allied

31:32.140 --> 31:37.820
strength was not sufficient to protect Europe, that we were purchased the week.

31:37.820 --> 31:41.520
How have things progressed since during the 10 years that you were Supreme Commander?

31:41.520 --> 31:48.620
Well I think that the progress is, it's been very considerable not because of anything

31:48.620 --> 31:53.460
that I have done but because of the support that has been given to the program by all

31:53.460 --> 32:00.060
of the countries of the alliance and I must say the particularly by this country, the United

32:00.060 --> 32:01.380
States.

32:01.380 --> 32:05.220
We must remember that other countries and all of the other countries of the alliance have

32:05.220 --> 32:07.220
made very major contributions.

32:07.220 --> 32:11.700
It was set at the time of my predecessor, I think he, as a matter of fact, he said it when

32:11.700 --> 32:17.020
he replied to a question of what the Russians need, moved the channel, the answer was

32:17.020 --> 32:19.340
shoes.

32:19.340 --> 32:26.500
I must say that in the end of 1962, beginning in 1963 the forces have grown and have been

32:26.500 --> 32:32.300
organized and are so equipped and deployed that they must be regarded as a very significant,

32:32.300 --> 32:39.420
a very significant factor both in the deterrent that is in the prevention of war but also a significant

32:39.420 --> 32:44.580
to force a factor for the defense and the vital part of the free world should this become

32:44.580 --> 32:45.580
necessary.

32:46.140 --> 32:50.660
General Norstead, you spoke of your predecessor, your immediate predecessor was General Grant

32:50.660 --> 32:56.260
for I believe and before him was Ridgeway and the first Supreme Allied commander was General

32:56.260 --> 33:00.060
Eisenhower's at the correct, that's correct, that's correct.

33:00.060 --> 33:06.500
It's very hard to contemplate the great, to realize the tremendous job of bringing together

33:06.500 --> 33:14.220
the armed forces of 15 nations speaking different languages, that's been your job and

33:14.220 --> 33:15.220
you've done it remarkably.

33:15.220 --> 33:16.220
Thank you very much.

33:16.220 --> 33:22.740
How do you feel that the NATO forces are, are we in a position to defend ourselves or

33:22.740 --> 33:26.620
to defend Western Europe against the Soviet Union and just war?

33:26.620 --> 33:36.820
I think Senator that, well I must freely acknowledge shortages, certain deficiencies within

33:36.820 --> 33:37.820
the alliance.

33:38.300 --> 33:45.500
The same time we must recognize that very real strength has been built up, real strength

33:45.500 --> 33:52.820
in the sense of divisions, of squadrons, of ships, real strength in terms of weapons,

33:52.820 --> 33:55.580
conventional and nuclear.

33:55.580 --> 34:01.020
In addition to that we've organized so that we can direct these forces.

34:01.020 --> 34:10.260
I'm sometimes impressed, perhaps almost depressed, by our constant criticism of ourselves.

34:10.260 --> 34:13.300
We were always talking about our weakness.

34:13.300 --> 34:17.860
I think it's well as necessary for us to be aware of our weakness.

34:17.860 --> 34:24.300
The same time we must also realize our strengths, we not have not only military strength.

34:24.300 --> 34:29.660
We must remember that because of the action that we've taken, the determination that our

34:29.660 --> 34:36.220
countries, including this great country, have shown and facing up to the threat that we've

34:36.220 --> 34:39.260
achieved great strength in many forms.

34:39.260 --> 34:45.540
For instance, the one thing that you were very familiar with, from your work with NATO and

34:45.540 --> 34:51.300
with the parliamentarians, which you have contributed, is the unity of the alliance, which I feel

34:51.300 --> 34:55.300
at this time is very, very important.

34:55.300 --> 34:59.460
I'm going to go on for just one more minute.

34:59.460 --> 35:06.820
You have the news of disagreements, divisions, of different views, particularly now because

35:06.820 --> 35:12.180
we've had some notable statements by General De Gaulle, by Chancellor Abnaur, and by Prime

35:12.180 --> 35:14.380
Minister McMillan in recent weeks.

35:14.380 --> 35:19.180
But we shouldn't let these differences of opinion, which I think are natural between free

35:19.180 --> 35:20.420
countries.

35:20.420 --> 35:24.420
We shouldn't let them, these differences obscure the fact.

35:24.420 --> 35:32.060
But at time of crisis, such as the crisis of Cuba, all of these countries supported and

35:32.060 --> 35:39.580
supported promptly the position of the United States without equivocation and in the positive,

35:39.580 --> 35:42.620
most positive possible terms.

35:42.620 --> 35:47.020
This was really a proof of unity.

35:47.020 --> 35:52.340
When unity really counted, and this is the record of the alliance, when unity really counts,

35:52.340 --> 35:55.260
it has always been here, and I'm confident this could continue.

35:55.260 --> 35:57.340
And it's always been there in the case of Berlin.

35:57.340 --> 35:58.860
It's always been there in case of Berlin.

35:58.860 --> 36:04.500
Well, I was highly pleased that the last NATO parliamentarians conference only issue a

36:04.500 --> 36:11.020
Berlin and Cuba with past strong resolutions without a dissenting voice, as you have said.

36:11.020 --> 36:14.980
And I think undoubtedly that had a great deal to do with Mr. Krukshire pulling back

36:14.980 --> 36:16.620
in connection with Cuba.

36:16.620 --> 36:18.460
There's no question about it.

36:18.460 --> 36:20.580
This is demonstration of unity.

36:20.580 --> 36:26.900
I've been working on the European side and you have been working with the Atlantic Alliance,

36:26.900 --> 36:29.060
so I'm particularly aware of that.

36:29.060 --> 36:33.620
See, alliance, the NATO countries, the unity of the NATO countries, but you add to that

36:33.620 --> 36:40.740
the quite remarkable unity at that particular time of the American states, the countries

36:40.740 --> 36:42.260
of North and South America.

36:42.260 --> 36:50.140
Together, this must have been a formidable force in support of the United States in this

36:50.140 --> 36:52.140
particular instance.

36:52.140 --> 36:57.660
Down in Australia, of course, the largest contribution to the NATO armed forces has been made

36:57.660 --> 36:59.060
by the United States.

36:59.060 --> 37:02.820
But other nations do make substantial contributions.

37:02.820 --> 37:07.620
Of course, a very substantial, and I would point out that it's awfully hard to measure

37:07.620 --> 37:09.340
precisely the contributions.

37:09.340 --> 37:15.420
The Germans, for instance, Federal Republic of Germany is coming up and making a very

37:15.420 --> 37:17.940
great contribution, for instance.

37:17.940 --> 37:23.820
They've committed to us, I think, 11 divisions at the moment, and remember that they're

37:23.820 --> 37:27.900
all deployed in the front line because Germany happens to be in the front line.

37:27.900 --> 37:35.100
They also have given us very substantial air forces and very substantial naval forces.

37:35.100 --> 37:39.540
So their contribution is very substantial.

37:39.540 --> 37:45.100
All of the countries, all of the countries, are making very considerable contributions.

37:45.100 --> 37:51.260
I might, when I was in command, have hoped that some of them might have done a little

37:51.260 --> 37:55.020
more, a little faster, in fact, before a few harnessed I did.

37:55.020 --> 37:59.380
But I still, at the same time, was recognized that they all, every one of them, is making

37:59.380 --> 38:01.100
a very substantial contribution.

38:01.100 --> 38:06.980
And these contributions added to that of the United States, has created a force, a factor

38:06.980 --> 38:09.100
of major significance in our time.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.100
Yes.

38:10.100 --> 38:18.260
Well, General Norse did, how about the De Gaulle, Idenar, PAC, and the disagreement between

38:18.260 --> 38:20.900
De Gaulle and, like, Millen over the common market?

38:20.900 --> 38:26.740
I think we, you see, what do you think these things are going to work out eventually?

38:26.740 --> 38:32.900
I think we have one case here of, talking about Paris and Bonne, the Adenauer, and De Gaulle,

38:32.900 --> 38:39.500
we have an example, I think, of cohesion, of a greater cohesion, and perhaps in the case

38:39.500 --> 38:45.660
of the UK, of relationship between De Gaulle and the Millen at this particular point, on

38:45.660 --> 38:49.900
the question of the common market, it appears, and I emphasize the fact it appears, to be

38:49.900 --> 38:52.660
evidence of some division.

38:52.660 --> 38:57.820
From the standpoint of the first, that is the German-French relationship, I think this

38:57.820 --> 39:03.260
is something that we all should applaud and should approve, because there has been, as we

39:03.260 --> 39:10.980
all know, this historical enmity between these two countries, which, for now, for hundreds

39:10.980 --> 39:14.700
of years, has caused wars, has caused wars.

39:14.700 --> 39:20.060
The purpose of these two men, and I know from talking to the two men, has been to bury

39:20.060 --> 39:24.540
this particular hatchet for all time, and this clearly is a contribution to this, and

39:24.540 --> 39:28.900
for that reason, I think it is the greatest possible significance.

39:28.900 --> 39:34.540
What springs from this, no one knows, but I would hope that there would be a very close

39:34.540 --> 39:39.740
relationship, a relationship of growing, of friendliness, it's very friendly at the present

39:39.740 --> 39:44.060
time, and that this, in turn, will contribute to understanding and to unity within Europe

39:44.060 --> 39:46.060
and us within the West.

39:46.060 --> 39:55.780
I am not willing at this time to be too pessimistic about the relationship between France and England,

39:55.780 --> 39:59.700
for instance, the United Kingdom on the question of the common market.

39:59.700 --> 40:06.260
I personally feel that the larger format of the seven countries, that is, including

40:06.260 --> 40:13.260
the UK, is a sounder, more viable arrangement than six, and I would certainly hope that

40:13.260 --> 40:19.460
conditions would permit the introduction of the United Kingdom into that body.

40:19.460 --> 40:24.660
Finally, I pursue this as just one second longer, Senator, something that, and say something

40:24.660 --> 40:30.380
that I know that is important to you, that it's important that we have these smaller

40:30.380 --> 40:35.780
groupings for specific purpose, such as this economic purpose, in this economic community.

40:35.780 --> 40:41.220
But the real pattern of the future is something that you and I have both supported, and that

40:41.220 --> 40:44.620
is the full pattern of the Atlantic community.

40:44.620 --> 40:50.960
This must remain our objective, because this is the way of peace, and this is the way of

40:50.960 --> 40:52.740
prosperity for all people.

40:52.740 --> 40:56.860
Well, I certainly wish we could go on longer, because this is very interesting talking

40:56.860 --> 40:57.860
with you.

40:57.860 --> 41:00.580
General Norse Stead is a leaving government.

41:00.580 --> 41:06.120
He's going to be vice president of Owing's Corning Fabbard-Las Corporation and president

41:06.120 --> 41:08.540
of their International Division.

41:08.540 --> 41:13.420
We hope you well in your suit and private life, and we want you to come to Tennessee

41:13.420 --> 41:15.140
to visit us sometime.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.140
Thank you very much.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.140
Thank you very much, Senator.
