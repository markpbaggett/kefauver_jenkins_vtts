00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Esteske Palmer face the nation.

00:16.000 --> 00:26.840
Through the eyes of this live television camera in Washington, DC, your obfsee, Senator

00:26.840 --> 00:31.940
Quastiske Palmer, Democrat of Tennessee, face the nation with questions from veteran

00:31.940 --> 00:36.180
correspondents representing the American press here in the national capital.

00:36.180 --> 00:40.420
And now the moderator of face the nation and director of CBS News and Public Affairs

00:40.420 --> 00:43.180
in Washington, Ted Koop.

00:43.180 --> 00:47.780
Senator Keep Auver, this morning, they occurred one of the major news events of the year.

00:47.780 --> 00:52.220
The Austrian peace treaty was signed in Vienna, and plans were made for a meeting at the

00:52.220 --> 00:57.360
summit of the Chiefs of State of Russia and the Western powers.

00:57.360 --> 01:01.520
These developments may mark the first easing of tension in the Cold War between East

01:01.520 --> 01:03.220
and West.

01:03.220 --> 01:07.880
As a prominent senator and as a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination,

01:07.880 --> 01:13.300
your views on these important subjects as well as on domestic issues carry great weight.

01:13.300 --> 01:16.720
To ask you about your opinions, here is our panel of newsmen.

01:16.720 --> 01:21.340
Will you make Lawrence National Correspondent for the New York Times, Dark Mullin-Hoff,

01:21.340 --> 01:25.940
Washington Correspondent for the Minneapolis Star and Tribune, and Roland Evans Jr. of

01:25.940 --> 01:28.540
the Washington Bureau of the Associated Press?

01:28.540 --> 01:30.660
Now with the first question, Mr. Lawrence.

01:30.660 --> 01:37.420
Senator, I suppose that all of us are happy that today in Vienna, Austria, at long last

01:37.420 --> 01:42.660
and after 17 years, finally received her, received back her independence and sovereignty.

01:42.660 --> 01:48.580
But I'm wondering whether your view of this is one of, shall we say, undiluted optimism

01:48.580 --> 01:52.900
or do you have some misgivings about the treaty that went with this ceremony?

01:52.900 --> 01:58.140
Well, Mr. Lawrence, we are of course glad that the communists are finally, relentless,

01:58.140 --> 02:03.740
some of their more drastic claims in connection with giving Austria sovereignty, such as the

02:03.740 --> 02:09.940
control of the oil fields and other items of dispute.

02:09.940 --> 02:14.420
I think we should be glad about it and happy about it.

02:14.420 --> 02:19.400
I do think that the communists have a good deal to gain themselves and that they hope

02:19.400 --> 02:25.300
to form a, hope to have a neutral block in that part of Europe.

02:25.300 --> 02:28.420
That certainly has been a very unsatisfactory condition in Austria.

02:28.420 --> 02:31.420
They've made a fine recovery economically.

02:31.420 --> 02:36.460
And I'm glad that the communists have come down from some of their higher demands and

02:36.460 --> 02:40.860
that we can have this nation restored as a sovereign nation.

02:40.860 --> 02:47.780
Well, Senator, aside from the mandatory neutrality provisions which were included in this treaty

02:47.780 --> 02:53.860
on the insistence of the Kremlin, this is basically the same agreement which the German

02:53.860 --> 02:59.860
administration had negotiated long ago with the other Western allies and which the Soviet

02:59.860 --> 03:01.700
Union at that time refused to sign.

03:01.700 --> 03:02.700
Is that right?

03:02.700 --> 03:03.700
Yes, that's my understanding.

03:03.700 --> 03:08.700
Well, what's your impression of why they now came to the point of signing?

03:08.700 --> 03:10.540
Oh, that is the Russian.

03:10.540 --> 03:16.700
Of course, there is the hope and we hope that it may be true that there is a different

03:16.700 --> 03:21.820
attitude on the part of the communists that they may really want to less intentions and

03:21.820 --> 03:26.380
to work out all of the different disputes and points of controversy so that we might

03:26.380 --> 03:30.660
eventually have a satisfactory peace in the world.

03:30.660 --> 03:37.500
But if that's not the case, then I suppose that their second reason would be that this

03:37.500 --> 03:43.700
would be preparatory to trying to gain some concessions from the West.

03:43.700 --> 03:49.900
I think that they might consider that by giving a liberal settlement to Austria, it might

03:49.900 --> 03:55.700
have some influence upon the settlement of the German problem, try to keep West Germany

03:55.700 --> 04:00.540
from being a full part of NATO and joining completely with the West.

04:00.540 --> 04:06.580
Senator, along that line, I noticed that Mr. Molotov, the foreign minister of the Soviet

04:06.580 --> 04:12.780
Union said today in Vienna that he hopes other states will follow the pattern, unquote,

04:12.780 --> 04:18.580
of complete neutrality, mandatory neutrality that Austria has agreed to.

04:18.580 --> 04:25.260
Do you feel that the possibility is that West Germany will also buy this new neutrality

04:25.260 --> 04:28.780
line that Russia apparently is selling through Central Europe?

04:28.780 --> 04:34.940
I'm certain that that would be one of the ambitions of the Soviet, but as long as Chancellor

04:34.940 --> 04:39.100
Adonar is the head of the West German government, I don't think they will.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.980
I think they're firmly committed to the West.

04:41.980 --> 04:48.180
And I think that poses one of the big problems for the democracies of the North Atlantic to

04:48.180 --> 04:52.060
integrate Western Germany firmly into the Western economy.

04:52.060 --> 04:54.660
I think we've done very well.

04:54.660 --> 05:01.300
And I think the Soviet hope of having a neutral block beginning with Yugoslavia and Austria

05:02.300 --> 05:07.900
including Western Germany will not be realized as long as Chancellor Adonar is.

05:07.900 --> 05:13.940
You spoke a second ago, Senator, of a hopeful attitude and the possibility of a hopeful attitude

05:13.940 --> 05:17.740
that Russia really is changing her course.

05:17.740 --> 05:22.540
Do you feel that the Eisenhower administration deserves a good deal of credit in its persistent

05:22.540 --> 05:28.940
foreign policies in the last two years in this possibility of a change of direction in

05:28.940 --> 05:30.580
Russia's foreign policy?

05:30.580 --> 05:34.340
You feel that the President and the Secretary of State deserve credit for that?

05:34.340 --> 05:38.260
I think the Eisenhower administration, particularly the President, have done many good things in

05:38.260 --> 05:40.540
the foreign policy field.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.740
I think they have made many mistakes.

05:42.740 --> 05:46.980
Specifically what good things could we get that first and go to the States?

05:46.980 --> 05:50.340
Well, they've at least recommended a substantial amount of foreign aid.

05:50.340 --> 05:55.780
They've kept up the support for the United Nations for NATO.

05:55.780 --> 06:02.540
They have generally followed the line of the Democratic foreign policy under President

06:02.540 --> 06:06.420
Truman and Secretary of State Dean Atterson.

06:06.420 --> 06:13.860
But I think if the Democrats had suggested such a summit conference two years ago or three

06:13.860 --> 06:20.860
years ago that they would have had treason and communism and everything else scream that

06:20.860 --> 06:22.340
them.

06:22.340 --> 06:27.020
So that I think such Democratic leaders as Senator George and others and not only backing

06:27.020 --> 06:36.460
up the idea of a top policy talk with communist Russia, but then fathering it and holding

06:36.460 --> 06:41.220
up the President's hand, hands deserves a great deal of credit.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.700
What about Senator Nolan and Bridges, Senator Keefer?

06:43.700 --> 06:45.220
You mentioned Senator George.

06:45.220 --> 06:50.940
Well, of course, Mr. Eisenhower's had a cold war in his own party with Senator Nolan

06:50.940 --> 06:54.780
and with some others ever since he's been in power.

06:54.780 --> 07:00.580
So that there is a point of no co-operation in support of Senator Nolan and some others

07:00.580 --> 07:01.580
are concerned.

07:01.580 --> 07:09.180
Now do you think of how we ought to go into this discussion with some optimism that we

07:09.180 --> 07:13.820
must realize that it's going to be impossible to change a great deal.

07:13.820 --> 07:17.660
We are only feeling out the Soviet intentions.

07:17.660 --> 07:22.140
I think we would make a great mistake if we felt that everything was all over and now

07:22.140 --> 07:32.620
that we could cut down our defense department, the interests and keeping militarily strong

07:32.620 --> 07:38.820
because even if the Soviet is in, if they are in good faith, it's going to take years

07:38.820 --> 07:42.780
and years and many, many other conferences, of course, to work out in any detail.

07:42.780 --> 07:48.220
Senator, the polls would indicate that people generally feel that our foreign affairs

07:48.220 --> 07:53.100
are being handled better under the Eisenhower administration and under the Truman administration.

07:53.100 --> 07:56.900
I wonder if you feel I've seen those.

07:56.900 --> 07:57.900
Difficult.

07:57.900 --> 08:02.940
And I wonder if you could tell us why you think the people would feel this if there are

08:02.940 --> 08:06.700
these things wrong with the policy that you indicate.

08:06.700 --> 08:11.020
Well, of course, of course, the Korean War was brought to an end during the Republican

08:11.020 --> 08:16.380
administration on terms, but I think there are great many people in certain of the

08:16.380 --> 08:21.580
outfield, we're not too satisfactory.

08:21.580 --> 08:25.740
We've had the unfortunate situation in the foremotion of the straits.

08:25.740 --> 08:32.100
There have been other mistakes, such as the threat of massive retaliation that Secretary

08:32.100 --> 08:36.380
Delos has made is an unfortunate debacle at Geneva.

08:37.380 --> 08:41.660
There's a banditment for some time of the Western Alliance and leaving the problems

08:41.660 --> 08:50.500
in Western Europe largely to Mr. Eden, but the turn of events have been rather favorable

08:50.500 --> 08:56.260
toward an easing of attention recently, and I think the people are grateful for that.

08:56.260 --> 09:00.300
You think that things are in better shape now than they were?

09:00.300 --> 09:06.220
I think they're in better shape now than there were two months ago.

09:06.220 --> 09:10.660
And I think there is a good possibility that there may be a substantially better shape

09:10.660 --> 09:13.300
than they have been in a long, long time.

09:13.300 --> 09:18.020
That is, if the communists are sincere, which we must find out in these conferences.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.700
The Secretary of the House of Representatives, Secretary Delos, is going to make a report

09:20.700 --> 09:23.460
to the nation Tuesday night in the President's office.

09:23.460 --> 09:27.140
Do you expect that will be a bipartisan report that everyone can accept?

09:27.140 --> 09:32.060
Well, Ted, I had the hope that after the injection of politics in our foreign affairs on some

09:32.060 --> 09:37.060
occasions and the Democrats going along, and just the same, even though we've been

09:37.060 --> 09:42.460
likely very much, had certainly in this very important conference, which is coming up, that

09:42.460 --> 09:45.300
there would be a bipartisan approach.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.900
I think it's a fine thing for the Secretary of State to come back and talk to the nation

09:48.900 --> 09:50.900
and for the President to be there with him.

09:50.900 --> 09:56.380
But I must say, in reading the paper this morning, that I was disappointed in the kind

09:56.380 --> 10:00.060
of presentation that this is going to be to the people.

10:00.060 --> 10:05.140
It looks like it's staged as another political affair, such as we saw Mr. Robert Montgomery

10:05.140 --> 10:09.380
put on with a cap and sometimes back.

10:09.380 --> 10:14.780
He's going to have there Mr. Delos, and of course the President and Vice President Nixon,

10:14.780 --> 10:22.700
Mr. Secretary of Defense Wilson, Secretary of the Treasurer Umphries, Delegate Lodge, under

10:22.700 --> 10:28.860
Secretary of State Herbert Hoover, Jr. Harold Stassen.

10:28.860 --> 10:34.300
The Democrats who have done so much to strengthen our foreign policies, such as Senator George

10:34.300 --> 10:38.220
and others, apparently are not to be included.

10:38.220 --> 10:43.380
This looks like another presentation of Robert Montgomery presents the White House.

10:43.380 --> 10:53.220
I can just imagine Mr. Umphries saying, well, Costa, how much is this going to cost in

10:53.220 --> 10:55.180
Mr. Delos with planks?

10:55.180 --> 10:59.100
Well, George's won't cost anything except my traveling expenses.

10:59.100 --> 11:04.420
Senator, I get the impression you think the Democrats are going along too much, or do you

11:04.420 --> 11:06.340
think this is a good idea for them to go along?

11:06.340 --> 11:08.940
You raised some objection to the way the Democrats are going along?

11:08.940 --> 11:13.300
No, the Democrats are going to go along in spite of the rebuffs that they might receive

11:13.300 --> 11:14.700
from the Republicans.

11:14.700 --> 11:20.340
But certainly we would have a better backing car, whatever comes out of a great conference

11:20.340 --> 11:25.940
of this kind if we put on a bipartisan basis rather than may they just a political show

11:25.940 --> 11:28.540
as it's indicated this will be.

11:28.540 --> 11:32.940
Would you recommend that the President take Senator George or some other Democratic advisor

11:32.940 --> 11:34.260
to the big foreign meeting?

11:34.260 --> 11:36.420
I think he'd be very wise to do so.

11:36.420 --> 11:41.020
Senator George is already indicated he wouldn't be too enthusiastic about going, Senator,

11:41.020 --> 11:43.820
so that you might have to find another Democrat.

11:43.820 --> 11:47.740
Well, I imagine there would be plenty who would be willing to go, but I would ask that

11:47.740 --> 11:48.740
you would be prepared.

11:48.740 --> 11:49.740
Would you, or yourself, Senator Keifl?

11:49.740 --> 11:54.460
I think we would put up to Senator George that he would be of service, and certainly

11:54.460 --> 11:56.260
he would be glad to go.

11:56.260 --> 11:59.220
Of course, I'd be happy to go, but I'm not on the Foreign Relations Committee.

11:59.220 --> 12:05.820
I'm not intimately the tales to date brought out in executive sessions, so properly someone

12:05.820 --> 12:09.620
on the one of the Foreign Relations Committee should go.

12:09.620 --> 12:15.020
Senator, in such as Dick Richards in the House, the Mike Mansfield, or many very capable

12:15.020 --> 12:16.020
men.

12:16.020 --> 12:19.300
Senator, a few minutes ago in listing some of the blunders of the administration, you

12:19.300 --> 12:24.100
spoke not only about the Korean War, settlement not being satisfactory in your point of view,

12:24.100 --> 12:29.020
but also about the dangerous situation in the four most estates.

12:29.020 --> 12:34.540
You aspired, sir, to be president in 1952.

12:34.540 --> 12:40.580
How would you handle the four most in problem if you were president?

12:40.580 --> 12:45.920
Build a beginning with, I wouldn't have gotten into this political business of unleashing

12:45.920 --> 12:47.780
Shanghai's share.

12:47.780 --> 12:53.540
I think that was the basic mistake made by this administration in dealing with permosis.

12:53.540 --> 12:57.220
Even let Oshang himself to believe he might have the strength to get back on the mainland

12:57.220 --> 13:04.740
when all the proof even Admiral Radford was that at no time could he move unless he had

13:04.740 --> 13:06.740
courses of the United States of helping.

13:06.740 --> 13:10.580
Well, Senator, I think generally in the Far East that we've been looking at the small

13:10.580 --> 13:17.500
things and overlooking the big important matters, the keys to whether in the Far East I think

13:17.500 --> 13:24.500
or whether we will have a chance of democracy and surviving, lie with Japan and India and

13:24.500 --> 13:28.500
not with these little offshore islands.

13:28.500 --> 13:34.340
I would have first placed tried to settle and get some disposition made of for most a long,

13:34.340 --> 13:36.020
long time ago.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.980
I think it's been our obligation to do so.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.220
We have been a trustee of that island.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.220
It doesn't belong to us.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.380
It doesn't belong to Shanghai's share.

13:43.380 --> 13:44.980
Who doesn't belong to you, Senator?

13:44.980 --> 13:51.980
It belongs to whoever the victors in the last World War decided it should belong to.

13:51.980 --> 13:53.980
Senator, I was taken by the people.

13:53.980 --> 13:58.540
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think you've yet answered my question as to what you would

13:58.540 --> 13:59.540
do if you were president.

13:59.540 --> 14:06.740
We're getting pretty far, you're getting pretty academic if I were president.

14:06.740 --> 14:09.300
Well, no, I don't think that's academic, Senator.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.860
We're talking now in the field of policy.

14:11.860 --> 14:14.060
What one man does is right or wrong.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.060
How would you handle it?

14:15.060 --> 14:16.540
Well, I think I've told you.

14:16.540 --> 14:19.420
I certainly wouldn't have gotten mixed up with the islands.

14:19.420 --> 14:23.980
I think we should have done something to dispose of for most of them and get it out of our

14:23.980 --> 14:24.980
hands a long time ago.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.660
I mean, the Red Chinese should have the islands.

14:27.660 --> 14:28.660
No, I don't.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.660
Oh, the islands.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.660
The island offshore.

14:30.660 --> 14:34.740
No, I would leave that as a matter of the civil war between Shanghai and the Red Chinese.

14:34.740 --> 14:39.340
That's a matter of their own civil war in which we're not involved.

14:39.340 --> 14:45.660
And I think it would be tragic to be drawn into a war over these islands, the names of which

14:45.660 --> 14:49.260
we didn't know or many people didn't know until a few months ago.

14:49.260 --> 14:53.180
And they're certainly in a very different position from Formosa and the Pesidor.

14:53.180 --> 14:58.980
Senator, you say we're not involved in this war, in this civil war about the offshore

14:58.980 --> 14:59.980
islands.

14:59.980 --> 15:00.980
Do you think we will be?

15:00.980 --> 15:03.980
We came precariously close to be.

15:03.980 --> 15:04.980
We will.

15:04.980 --> 15:10.500
I'm certain that if better judgment and calmer hands have not prevailed, we might have been

15:10.500 --> 15:11.500
now.

15:11.500 --> 15:16.900
What's going to happen now, apparently, Joe and Lai didn't do so well at Bang Gang as

15:16.900 --> 15:21.100
he expected to do and he's now willing to arbitrate.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.900
So there's a listening of the tension there, too.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.300
But whether we will be involved later on, there's no one knows.

15:27.300 --> 15:32.540
Senator, six weeks ago, along this same point, you made a, what some of us thought was

15:32.540 --> 15:33.860
the fairly serious charge.

15:33.860 --> 15:38.940
You said people in high places were plotting and planning to get the United States into

15:38.940 --> 15:41.340
war over Formosa.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.340
What people, Senator?

15:42.340 --> 15:48.620
Mr. Evans, I said that inside of the Republican Party, there was a war party whose aim seemed

15:48.620 --> 15:54.860
to be to get us into a war over the matter in China and the four Muslim streets.

15:54.860 --> 16:02.860
By that I meant to have us take up the defense of Khmer and to Matsu, which I felt

16:02.860 --> 16:04.500
would get us into war.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.780
You only need to look at what's set on the Senate floor.

16:07.780 --> 16:12.660
There are a number of senators who take that position.

16:12.660 --> 16:18.860
Senator Bridges has taken that position, General Nolan.

16:18.860 --> 16:22.860
And Admiral Radford, for some time, back has taken that position.

16:22.860 --> 16:24.860
I'm plotting to get us into war.

16:24.860 --> 16:29.380
Well, I'm planning to defend these islands, which I consider loving to get us into war.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.780
Senator, I'd like to turn around.

16:30.780 --> 16:32.100
Senator, I'm going to rhetoric, Mr. Evans.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.820
I was going a little stronger than I should have.

16:34.820 --> 16:39.100
I would like to turn from past politics to future politics and ask you the direct question,

16:39.100 --> 16:42.700
are you going to be a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination next year?

16:42.700 --> 16:47.100
Well, Mr. Cooper, I'm not a candidate and I have no plans to be a candidate.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.620
Would you decline to be one?

16:48.620 --> 16:50.420
If we're pressed upon you?

16:50.420 --> 16:55.300
I mean, would I make a Sherman statement?

16:55.300 --> 17:00.260
Well, Mr. Cooper, I happened to live in that part of the South where Sherman had a scorched

17:00.260 --> 17:03.260
policy of March to the sea.

17:03.260 --> 17:08.260
I never have liked Mr. Sherman very much, General Sherman, and I'm not going to emulate it.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.260
Senator?

17:09.260 --> 17:11.420
Anyway, I have no plans at present time.

17:11.420 --> 17:15.900
Senator, you had 360 delegates at the 1952 convention.

17:15.900 --> 17:16.900
Yes, ma'am.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.140
I wonder what you're doing to keep in contact with those people.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.420
Are you doing anything?

17:21.420 --> 17:22.260
No, I really have it.

17:22.260 --> 17:31.380
I haven't tried to keep together any organization and I haven't purposely followed up with any

17:31.380 --> 17:32.380
of these delegates.

17:32.380 --> 17:35.540
Well, Senator, you have a committee, a juvenile and a juvenile and a juvenile committee,

17:35.540 --> 17:43.500
and I know a lot of your enemies point to this as something I don't have any particular

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
enemies.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.780
Political enemies, shall we say.

17:46.780 --> 17:52.620
Right of this is something similar to the crime show, which you would use to put yourself

17:52.620 --> 17:56.980
on the road again in 1956.

17:56.980 --> 18:03.220
And I wondered, what is the reason for a federal investigation of juvenile lengthency and something

18:03.220 --> 18:08.980
which is basically state and local problem?

18:08.980 --> 18:15.300
This problem of juvenile to lengthency is one that we must be have some action on it,

18:15.300 --> 18:17.460
all levels of government.

18:17.460 --> 18:21.740
The federal government plays a much more important part than many others realize.

18:21.740 --> 18:23.420
After all, there are many federal laws.

18:23.420 --> 18:26.740
We have young people violating those laws.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.380
We have charge of narcotics.

18:28.380 --> 18:33.780
We have charge of things that happen in interstate commerce, such as the transportation of

18:33.780 --> 18:37.940
horror and cram books and a salacious literature.

18:37.940 --> 18:44.220
We have charge of what goes on the television and great many things of that sort.

18:44.220 --> 18:48.620
I became interested in the juvenile to lengthency investigation as a result of what we saw in

18:48.620 --> 18:52.780
the crime committee that many of these criminals might have been good citizens if they had had

18:52.780 --> 18:54.100
better opportunities.

18:54.100 --> 19:02.900
So I felt a committee could point out for other people in the nation what could be done

19:02.900 --> 19:09.620
in this field, bring about interest in the problem, pass a great many federal statutes

19:09.620 --> 19:10.620
which would help.

19:10.620 --> 19:15.820
But Senator, we are doing a very professional modest kind of job with that.

19:15.820 --> 19:19.060
Senator, are there a lot more things that the Senate could be doing?

19:19.060 --> 19:23.620
You talked before the first of this year, you talked a great deal about investigations

19:23.620 --> 19:25.260
in the power field.

19:25.260 --> 19:29.980
And there was one started in the Republican Congress by Senator Langer and you're on a committee

19:29.980 --> 19:31.340
that hasn't followed through on that.

19:31.340 --> 19:33.100
I wonder what the problem is there.

19:33.100 --> 19:37.900
Well, it just dumps me that we haven't followed through with more of these investigations.

19:37.900 --> 19:45.940
I think in the field of favoritism to the private electric utilities and to the big interest

19:45.940 --> 19:48.980
generally that the Republican Party is very vulnerable.

19:48.980 --> 19:55.140
Well, is the, and I think our economy generally is in danger of where the little fellow, little

19:55.140 --> 19:59.780
businessman is not going to have much of a chance if this merger and monopoly trend goes

19:59.780 --> 20:00.780
on.

20:00.780 --> 20:04.500
Well, is this also with the Democratic leadership in the Senate because you can't get these

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
investigations going?

20:05.500 --> 20:09.180
Well, where's the fall there, regardless of the merit of the investigation itself?

20:09.180 --> 20:13.660
Well, as far as the Senate, the anti-monopoly committee was concerned, it was Senator Langer

20:13.660 --> 20:18.460
who, with his own staff, carried on the investigation last year.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.980
No money was appropriated by the Republican Congress.

20:20.980 --> 20:26.700
I've been bitterly disappointed that this Congress has not gotten started earlier.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.820
Have you taken up with the leadership?

20:28.820 --> 20:33.900
Yes, I have discussed the matter with the leadership and Senator Johnson has hoped that the

20:33.900 --> 20:35.420
investigation would get going too.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.220
Has he done anything to get it moving?

20:37.220 --> 20:43.580
Yes, when the resolution came, he got the resolution through the Senate and the appropriation

20:43.580 --> 20:44.580
through.

20:44.580 --> 20:45.580
Where's the roadblock on this, Senator?

20:45.580 --> 20:49.300
The roadblock has been in getting the staff and getting an internal matter of the committee

20:49.300 --> 20:51.780
settled so that we can get started.

20:51.780 --> 20:54.220
Well, Senator, to return to politics, if we may.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.540
Anyway, I hope we do.

20:55.540 --> 20:56.940
And we've wasted a lot of time.

20:56.940 --> 20:58.140
I'm awfully disappointed.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.140
We're missing.

20:59.140 --> 21:04.260
We should be doing this in the public interest.

21:04.260 --> 21:09.060
And then I think it's one of the most important issues before the nation today.

21:09.060 --> 21:15.380
To return to general politics, you say that you're not a candidate and you have no intention

21:15.380 --> 21:16.380
of being one.

21:16.380 --> 21:20.580
Is there no significance then in the fact that you're up in streethouses for sale and

21:20.580 --> 21:23.620
I thought maybe you might be getting ready to move into 1600?

21:23.620 --> 21:26.940
Oh, Mr. Lawrence, I didn't know our house for sale.

21:26.940 --> 21:30.140
We've been thinking about trying to get a larger one because we have four children

21:30.140 --> 21:31.140
that are growing up.

21:31.140 --> 21:34.300
There is a bigger one down there on the avenue.

21:34.300 --> 21:35.300
But the 1500 Pennsylvania.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.300
That's the one I meant.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.300
Yeah, so there's a bigger building.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.300
I don't know.

21:38.300 --> 21:42.580
The children like it out of where we are and they're one of the chief objectives to doing

21:42.580 --> 21:45.180
anything except the time to stay in the Senate.

21:45.180 --> 21:49.300
You would have to be saying that you've made no effort to keep in contact with what could

21:49.300 --> 21:53.140
have been described as your organization in 1952.

21:53.140 --> 21:57.340
But I checked the record here just briefly and find in the last six months or so you have

21:57.340 --> 22:04.860
spoken in Texas Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, Oregon, California,

22:04.860 --> 22:05.860
several other states.

22:05.860 --> 22:08.100
I didn't know anybody was following me so closely.

22:08.100 --> 22:09.660
Well, so you have a lot of it.

22:09.660 --> 22:14.540
You have a lot of it in my reserve and I just wondered if this fits with your previous statement

22:14.540 --> 22:19.220
that you may know effort to keep in touch with the delegations you had patched to you

22:19.220 --> 22:20.220
with the future.

22:20.220 --> 22:21.220
And you have passed.

22:21.220 --> 22:26.100
I have spoken a great many more places than I have during the past.

22:26.100 --> 22:30.940
This is not to be taken as an indication that you want to keep contacts going with your

22:30.940 --> 22:33.500
friends in these states, your democratic friends in these states.

22:33.500 --> 22:37.900
No, always when the Democratic National Committee has asked me to go somewhere, I usually

22:37.900 --> 22:38.900
go.

22:38.900 --> 22:39.900
One other question along that line, Senator.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.900
What happened to the...

22:40.900 --> 22:43.380
Of course, I must say I'm glad to see my friends.

22:43.380 --> 22:47.820
What happened to the organization for the Chattanooga, I think in November, called the

22:47.820 --> 22:51.180
organization for 10 million signatures for a key fall for president.

22:51.180 --> 22:52.180
Is that still happening?

22:52.180 --> 22:56.820
That was a youth group and I told them I thought that the better not to go on with it.

22:56.820 --> 22:57.820
That isn't defunct.

22:57.820 --> 23:03.980
It's not defunct that just defunct is a bad connotation.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.620
I didn't mean that connotation.

23:06.620 --> 23:07.620
It's not actually...

23:07.620 --> 23:10.780
Well, when I heard about it, I suggested that they not to carry it on.

23:10.780 --> 23:15.140
Just me doing favor for the presidential nomination, Senator.

23:15.140 --> 23:18.580
Well, I haven't been taking it a size in that context, Mr. Cruz.

23:18.580 --> 23:21.500
This is the fact that you're not going to run mean that you're going to leave the Tennessee

23:21.500 --> 23:23.860
delegation go to Governor Clement.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.860
He seems to have very definite ambition.

23:25.860 --> 23:31.660
Well, I imagine Tennessee delegation will make up its minds the time draws near and they

23:31.660 --> 23:32.660
see what the...

23:32.660 --> 23:33.660
The Elecates are...

23:33.660 --> 23:36.540
The Elecates have to be wooed a little bit, do you know?

23:36.540 --> 23:37.540
You found that out.

23:37.540 --> 23:43.180
It's a good time, yet though, Mr. Lawrence, from now until the time of the convention.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.380
You have no plans, though.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.380
No, I don't.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.380
No, I'm not.

23:46.380 --> 23:47.380
Well, that's the time already.

23:47.380 --> 23:48.380
I do not have any plans.

23:48.380 --> 23:51.900
There's another subject we should discuss this afternoon, Senator, and that's the polio

23:51.900 --> 23:55.780
vaccine situation, which has aroused a great deal of interest throughout the country and

23:55.780 --> 23:56.780
in Congress.

23:56.780 --> 24:00.540
Do you feel that the administration, particularly the Department of Health Education and

24:00.540 --> 24:02.860
Welfare, has handled the situation properly?

24:02.860 --> 24:07.300
I think this has been one of the worst bungled programs and needlessly bungled that I've

24:07.300 --> 24:08.300
ever seen.

24:08.300 --> 24:13.700
There's been no excuse for this on again, off again, where it's been handled.

24:13.700 --> 24:18.420
They've handled it in Canada so that it haven't been any mishaps.

24:18.420 --> 24:24.060
They haven't been the bad vaccine and they're uncertainly about the program that we've had

24:24.060 --> 24:25.060
here.

24:25.060 --> 24:28.900
They had a well thought out regulations before they started.

24:28.900 --> 24:35.420
I think that they should have taken a little more time, gotten up a system for handling the

24:35.420 --> 24:40.500
program, and then which would anticipate all of these difficulties and gone at it.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.500
Senator, who do you think is the president?

24:42.500 --> 24:47.060
As a present time, I think the only thing to do is for the government to allocate the

24:47.060 --> 24:54.580
vaccine and also for us to adopt a bill prohibiting profiteering from the manufacturer.

24:54.580 --> 25:00.100
Senator, who's to blame for this bungling that you speak out here?

25:00.100 --> 25:03.580
Well, the president of the United States and Secretary Haby, of course.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.580
In what specific way are they to blame?

25:05.580 --> 25:07.380
Do you have anything in fact?

25:07.380 --> 25:11.180
First place for not having a program for the proper inspection to see that the vaccine

25:11.180 --> 25:17.220
was pure, not having a program where when they started out they could carry it on for

25:17.220 --> 25:18.700
the vaccination of these children.

25:18.700 --> 25:24.180
There's no excuse whatsoever for starting and stopping and starting and stopping and

25:24.180 --> 25:28.980
scaring a lot of people to death and also apparently hurting the health of some young

25:28.980 --> 25:32.460
people by allowing the impure vaccine to be used.

25:32.460 --> 25:36.660
Wouldn't they be depending upon people further down in the department with the tech nations?

25:36.660 --> 25:37.660
Or do you think they were flooding them?

25:37.660 --> 25:42.820
I think the time has come when we can't just place the burden on somebody way down in the

25:42.820 --> 25:43.820
department.

25:43.820 --> 25:48.860
The president and the cabinet members themselves must assume responsibility and they have done

25:48.860 --> 25:51.500
a horrible job in connection with this vaccine.

25:51.500 --> 25:56.180
Well, it was just part of the strategy that you and some others have been advocating in

25:56.180 --> 26:01.620
recent months in the Democratic Party to take what, taking it easy with the president

26:01.620 --> 26:06.620
and put all the blame on its abordinates and that they really ought to level on the number

26:06.620 --> 26:09.340
one target at these the fellow they're going to have to run against.

26:09.340 --> 26:13.620
Well, Mr. Lawrence, I think Democrats all the way through have been very generous in

26:13.620 --> 26:21.820
not letting the president pass off responsibility and it's not a matter of strategy, it's just

26:21.820 --> 26:27.500
a matter of the facts of life that he and he alone is responsible for these big mistakes

26:27.500 --> 26:29.900
that are occurring in his administration.

26:29.900 --> 26:32.340
And the polio is one of the big mistakes in your view.

26:32.340 --> 26:36.380
I think it's a very substantial one in which the people are tremendously.

26:36.380 --> 26:39.220
You're going to hurt him politically, Senator?

26:39.220 --> 26:41.660
Uh, yes, I'm sure it will.

26:41.660 --> 26:45.460
Senator, this coming week, I believe you're bringing out a report on civil defense after

26:45.460 --> 26:47.460
some hearings that you and the subcommittee held.

26:47.460 --> 26:50.220
Could you give us an advance look into that report?

26:50.220 --> 26:55.360
Well, we are fine, generally, that there's been a tragic lack of interest both in the

26:55.360 --> 26:59.100
administration and in Congress and among the people in civil defense.

26:59.100 --> 27:05.140
It is a vital part for the protection of the nation if we should get into war and plans

27:05.140 --> 27:07.140
must be made.

27:07.140 --> 27:14.940
More specifically, we are going to recommend that the military departments should take more

27:14.940 --> 27:15.940
responsibility.

27:15.940 --> 27:19.700
There should be better working out of programs.

27:19.700 --> 27:24.980
We're going to recommend that a commission be set up to study and report on the matter

27:24.980 --> 27:28.620
of dispersal of industries.

27:28.620 --> 27:33.980
We want to find the responsibility for who is going to feed and take care of people when

27:33.980 --> 27:38.060
they're evacuated and why the Department of Health, Education and Well Centre have done
