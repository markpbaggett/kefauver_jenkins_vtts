00:00.000 --> 00:10.840
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, from time to time on this program, other visitors

00:10.840 --> 00:17.600
and I have had an occasion to say something about the Tom Bigby Waterway in which I have

00:17.600 --> 00:20.880
been interested for a long, long time.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.960
I think it's important that all Tennesseans and people in Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky

00:25.960 --> 00:30.280
and the whole nation know about this very remarkable project.

00:30.280 --> 00:36.240
For our section of the country, I think it is the most important proposed development

00:36.240 --> 00:42.280
that we have had since the coming of the Tennessee Valley Authority back in 1933.

00:42.280 --> 00:48.880
It's going to affect our communities and our industry, our agriculture and there will

00:48.880 --> 00:55.680
be a great advancement for every section of our state and several adjacent states.

00:55.680 --> 01:01.800
To describe and talk about the Tennessee Tom Bigby Waterway and more detail, I have

01:01.800 --> 01:08.160
invited and I appreciate his acceptance Colonel Robert C. Marshall, who is the Assistant

01:08.160 --> 01:13.560
Director of the Civil Works Division of the Corps of Engineers under whose jurisdiction

01:13.560 --> 01:15.680
this waterway comes.

01:15.680 --> 01:20.800
To come and tell us something about it and to tell the meaning of it and what's going

01:20.800 --> 01:24.520
to be done to the listeners over this station.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.640
Colonel Marshall is awfully good to have you with us and we appreciate very much your coming

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
here.

01:29.640 --> 01:35.160
You've been in the Corps of Engineers for many years, I believe, have you not?

01:35.160 --> 01:36.840
Well, about 20, sir.

01:36.840 --> 01:41.880
And you were telling me that during the war you spent some time in the volunteer state.

01:41.880 --> 01:42.880
I did indeed.

01:42.880 --> 01:50.200
It was my pleasure to be assigned to Camp Forest, Tennessee, Nertelahoma, and also to engage

01:50.200 --> 01:52.680
in what were then known as a Tennessee maneuver.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.800
Well, Camp Forest was a very important military establishment.

01:57.800 --> 02:04.160
It has gone as you may know and Arnold Engineering Development Center occupies much of the same

02:04.160 --> 02:09.000
territory that we would welcome you back to Tennessee whenever you can come.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I thank you, sir.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.800
Now, Colonel Marshall, tell us something about the Tom Bigby Waterway.

02:14.800 --> 02:23.120
It shows where it starts and where it goes to and a little bit about the history of it

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
if you would.

02:24.120 --> 02:31.720
Well, sir, the Tennessee Tom Bigby, as it is known now, is designed to connect the Tom Bigby

02:31.720 --> 02:35.200
River with the Tennessee River.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.280
This route has been considered for many years.

02:39.280 --> 02:44.600
The early French settlers looked at the divide just below the Tennessee and hoped to build

02:44.600 --> 02:50.040
the canal to the south in order to connect to Tennessee River with the Gulf.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.840
Now, the Tom Bigby River comes up to about where this arrow is.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.840
Is that correct?

02:54.840 --> 02:55.840
Yes, sir.

02:55.840 --> 03:01.480
The natural stream terminates about this area and then we would go into a canal type operation.

03:01.480 --> 03:07.560
As I recall, back in the 1870s, the Corps of Engineers actually recommended the building of

03:07.560 --> 03:12.760
a shallow channel connecting the Gulf with the Tennessee River.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.760
Is that?

03:13.760 --> 03:20.640
In 1875, the Corps of Engineers rendered a report to the Congress indicating that a four-foot

03:20.640 --> 03:29.080
channel could be constructed, essentially along this alignment, at the cost of only $1,700,000.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.080
Yes.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.080
Another...

03:31.080 --> 03:38.800
Picklick Bamm was built here, I believe, about 1935 or six.

03:38.800 --> 03:47.840
And that is toward Chattanooga, where the canal, where the waterway would enter.

03:47.840 --> 03:53.760
And how water that does make it possible for water to come down to the ten locks of the

03:53.760 --> 03:57.040
Tennessee Tom Bigby waterway.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.040
Is that...

03:58.040 --> 03:59.040
Yes, sir.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.920
Just like Gattu and Malayka on the top of Panama Canal makes it possible.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.600
Yes, sir, the fact that Tickwick Pool is available and has an adequate supply of water,

04:09.600 --> 04:16.200
which could be diverted to the canal, will permit the operation of these various locks.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.920
And in fact makes it canal much more feasible.

04:18.920 --> 04:25.760
I was in the House of Representatives at the time back in 1946 when the Tennessee Tom Bigby

04:25.760 --> 04:29.720
was approved by the Congress in that year.

04:29.720 --> 04:36.920
And then I believe that there was some restudy, a proclamation for a restudy in 1956,

04:36.920 --> 04:41.640
or the engineers didn't make a restudy about that time.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.640
That's correct, sir.

04:42.640 --> 04:48.640
There was some debate and perhaps some doubts regarding the economic aspect of the project.

04:48.640 --> 04:55.640
And so we were directed to undertake a restudy of the economics, which we have recently finished

04:55.640 --> 04:57.880
and have under the report.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.560
And what is the report, the economics of this great development?

05:01.560 --> 05:07.400
Well, fundamentally, as in all our projects, the determination was made of the total cost

05:07.400 --> 05:08.400
of the project.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.640
It's about $250 million, a little more than that.

05:13.640 --> 05:20.120
And then based on the 50-year, expected, at least 50-year, expected economic life of the

05:20.120 --> 05:23.640
project, an annual cost was determined.

05:23.640 --> 05:30.360
An annual cost of about $12 million, and compared to that annual cost, an annual benefit

05:30.360 --> 05:32.440
was also determined.

05:32.440 --> 05:37.560
And we then found that the benefit exceeded the cost, and therefore that it was, in fact,

05:37.560 --> 05:41.200
an economically justifiable project.

05:41.200 --> 05:46.680
And how much traffic on the waterway to you in this debate will be the average over

05:46.680 --> 05:48.640
a period of 50 years?

05:48.640 --> 05:52.880
About 12 million, a little over 12 million tons per year, sir.

05:52.880 --> 05:58.640
Now the details as I understand it, how deep will the waterway be?

05:58.640 --> 06:03.760
It will be a nine-foot project initially throughout its length.

06:03.760 --> 06:10.200
In constructing the ten locks, which you mentioned earlier, we will provide for 13-foot

06:10.200 --> 06:17.480
depths, should in the later life of the project traffic warrant a construction to that added

06:17.480 --> 06:18.480
depth.

06:18.480 --> 06:25.360
But fundamentally it will provide for a nine-foot navigable waterway, a varying widths 150 feet

06:25.360 --> 06:28.800
in some sections and wider in others.

06:28.800 --> 06:36.920
Yes, but eventually if it needed to be done, it could be a 13-foot depth, and the locks

06:36.920 --> 06:42.600
will be built so as to accommodate traffic with 13-foot, that's correct.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.600
That's correct.

06:43.600 --> 06:52.460
Then we will have a slack waterway from the Oehaw River here at New York, the Duke of

06:52.460 --> 06:53.460
course.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.460
This is a Tennessee lake.

06:54.460 --> 06:59.800
Sometimes it's called a Kentucky lake, but really the part in Tennessee is a slack water

06:59.800 --> 07:00.800
lake.

07:00.800 --> 07:07.200
And then the slack water all the way down to the Gulf so that the barges and ships can go

07:07.200 --> 07:11.320
either way to the Oehaw in slack waters.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.320
That's fundamentally correct.

07:13.320 --> 07:18.940
If they want to go up the Tennessee to Knoxville, the water, of course the river is navigable

07:18.940 --> 07:21.840
and the water is comparatively slack.

07:21.840 --> 07:30.840
Then of course there is a canal between the Kentucky lake and the Cumberland bark lake on

07:30.840 --> 07:35.920
the Cumberland River, which will make it available for traffic on the Cumberland.

07:35.920 --> 07:44.500
What will be shipped down the canal largely and figuring the economic benefits of Colonel

07:44.500 --> 07:45.840
Marshall?

07:45.840 --> 07:53.800
We have predicted based on comparison of rates and market areas, areas, growth of population,

07:53.800 --> 08:00.480
and the other factors, we predict a considerable movement of middle-western grains either to

08:00.480 --> 08:07.040
the Gulf and to southerly markets or perhaps to the Alabama Mississippi Georgia area.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.320
This would be feed grains, primarily.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.000
Our feed grains are farmers and tonuses.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yes, they are.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Absolutely.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.640
We also visualize that there is a potential movement of coal from Tennessee to markets in

08:20.640 --> 08:22.200
the south.

08:22.200 --> 08:28.840
Primarily the markets would be in the steam generation of electricity.

08:28.840 --> 08:34.280
Perhaps in Florida or even places where they use gas at the present time.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.280
Yes, sir.

08:35.280 --> 08:44.680
Florida right now is a large consumer of Tennessee and Kentucky coal for its generation of electricity

08:44.680 --> 08:50.320
and we visualize that coal will remain competitive in that area.

08:50.320 --> 08:55.720
As we all know there is a great deal of coal in the Cumberland section of Kentucky and Tennessee,

08:55.720 --> 09:04.000
which we hope will be subject to being barged on the Cumberland River.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.040
This east and middle Tennessee section has a great deal of coal so there is northern Alabama

09:10.040 --> 09:16.240
and of course western Kentucky is rich in coal so you do envision a great deal of coal

09:16.240 --> 09:18.240
traffic down to the Gulf.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.960
It's a great potential, yes sir.

09:20.960 --> 09:25.880
Then how about from the Gulf back north among the waterway?

09:25.880 --> 09:32.200
Primarily a waterway of this nature inherently lends itself to the movement of bulk commodities

09:32.200 --> 09:36.600
and probably the most significant is petroleum products.

09:36.600 --> 09:43.640
Well, what of course benefit consumers along the waterway by virtue of less expensive

09:43.640 --> 09:49.560
transportation of heating fuels and gasoline.

09:49.560 --> 09:58.640
And there is also a potential and a predictable movement of fertilizers from the Caribbean

09:58.640 --> 10:01.000
and Florida area to the north.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.560
A phosphate and things that that's ordered.

10:04.560 --> 10:09.480
So it is going to be one of the great important waterways in our country.

10:09.480 --> 10:14.000
The colonel as you know, they could people along the Mississippi and Memphis, Dixburg

10:14.000 --> 10:22.600
and New Orleans have now joined in recommending the development of the Tom Bay because they

10:22.600 --> 10:27.320
do not feel that it meant the in that it's going to interfere with the good traffic that

10:27.320 --> 10:29.680
they have on the Mississippi River.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.160
I think so, sir.

10:31.160 --> 10:36.200
I think Mississippi, the state of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and more recently Kentucky

10:36.200 --> 10:42.320
have joined together and formed an authority and this authority and hence Mississippi and

10:42.320 --> 10:48.960
the other states recognize the advantage, the flexibility and the cheap transportation

10:48.960 --> 10:50.760
that is afforded by this waterway.

10:50.760 --> 10:57.440
Yes, there is a comeback between the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky

10:57.440 --> 11:03.400
and perhaps some other which was approved by Congress and they do have an association

11:03.400 --> 11:07.560
that's been very effective in pushing the Tom Bay Bay waterway.

11:07.560 --> 11:12.880
A colonel, I know this isn't in the budget because your report didn't come to the Congress

11:12.880 --> 11:18.800
in time for it to be or rather to the administration in time for it to be put in the budget but it's

11:18.800 --> 11:26.960
my understanding that you can efficiently expand or your capability of expanding for the

11:26.960 --> 11:32.840
next year, next fiscal year is a million dollars in advanced planning for this waterway.

11:32.840 --> 11:40.280
It would be actually our planning is pretty well along so it would not only permit the completion

11:40.280 --> 11:48.200
of some added detail plans but actual construction could be initiated at the, we would start at

11:48.200 --> 11:54.360
the most southerly lock, the Gainesville lock which is this area.

11:54.360 --> 12:00.400
And so that if we get the million dollars as we hope to and on the appropriations committee

12:00.400 --> 12:05.760
we are working for it for this next fiscal year you can actually begin some construction.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.760
That's correct.

12:06.760 --> 12:13.240
I understand that this may be a place where atomic energy will be used to a good advantage

12:13.240 --> 12:20.200
on the blasting and the moving of dirt it may be necessary as part of the contemplation.

12:20.200 --> 12:27.640
This project does lend itself to the peaceful application of nuclear energy particularly

12:27.640 --> 12:35.240
in the section known as the divide cut which is just south of the Tennessee River.

12:35.240 --> 12:44.560
In this area the depth of cut is approximately 150 feet and by use of nuclear explosives

12:44.560 --> 12:54.400
detonated below the surface with no fallout or other radiation problems this excavation

12:54.400 --> 13:03.800
could be constructed at a cost at least 10% less expensive than if conventional excavation

13:03.800 --> 13:06.120
methods were used.

13:06.120 --> 13:15.120
So we do hope that the current test series and perhaps subsequent test series will provide

13:15.120 --> 13:22.440
the engineering and safety information necessary for us to more accurately determine these

13:22.440 --> 13:31.120
costs based on current information we are confident that it is feasible to employ nuclear

13:31.120 --> 13:33.120
explosives in this area.

13:33.120 --> 13:38.320
Well ladies and gentlemen I know that you've enjoyed having this explanation of this great

13:38.320 --> 13:44.720
new imaginative and wonderful project that's going to come our way by the explanation that's

13:44.720 --> 13:49.560
been made by Colonel Marshall and we thank you very much for being with us today my

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
pleasure.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
Thank you.

13:51.560 --> 13:58.920
Until next to the program that's all for now.

13:58.920 --> 14:13.240
Ladies and gentlemen friends of Tennessee from time to time on this program we have talked

14:13.240 --> 14:19.320
about the Trade Expansion Act which President Kennedy has recommended and about which we are

14:19.320 --> 14:21.320
also interested.

14:21.320 --> 14:27.320
This I think is the biggest matter that will come before this Congress by far.

14:27.320 --> 14:32.120
Bill has passed the House of Representatives giving the President extended authority

14:32.120 --> 14:38.920
and connection with our trade agreement program and it will soon be coming up in the Senate.

14:38.920 --> 14:45.480
So I thought that we would use this program today to talk about it and to give us some

14:45.480 --> 14:51.000
facts and information about the program we are very fortunate today in having with us Mr.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.440
Howard C. Peterson the assistant to the President on trade policies.

14:56.440 --> 15:01.600
We certainly would like to have you with us Mr. Peterson real pleasure Sunday and I

15:01.600 --> 15:08.320
Mr. Peterson has been appearing before committees giving information telling what our present

15:08.320 --> 15:14.240
situation is what the New York expansion will mean and why it's so necessary.

15:14.240 --> 15:18.320
But Mr. Peterson I believe that you are a very distinct well you are a big bank for big

15:18.320 --> 15:23.280
and several ways I'm sure physically and otherwise from Philadelphia aren't you.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
I am.

15:24.280 --> 15:28.280
I have good many friends in the banking fraternity and Tennessee too.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.280
Yes I know you do.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.280
I was lemming.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.280
Oh, I was saying it.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.280
We had American bankers as well.

15:33.280 --> 15:37.600
We are all very proud of Sam Fleming from over at Nashville and he is the President of

15:37.600 --> 15:38.600
American Bank Association.

15:38.600 --> 15:44.600
Of course I know a lot of bankers but I'm not always very happy to see them Mr. Peterson.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
I know.

15:45.600 --> 15:50.160
You know some of my people asked me to come down and pay notes and loads of that sort.

15:50.160 --> 15:54.960
But friends of course in Tennessee we have always been internationally minded.

15:54.960 --> 16:05.360
We understand the importance of exporting goods to other nations and of course we've

16:05.360 --> 16:09.960
been able to create statesmen of Tennessee and Mr. Cordell Hold founder of the Trade

16:09.960 --> 16:10.960
Agreement Act.

16:10.960 --> 16:17.640
The inception of really the whole liberal trade policy of the United States started with

16:17.640 --> 16:27.480
Mr. Cordell Hold in 1934 and Trade Expansion Act which is now before the Senate is a natural

16:27.480 --> 16:34.560
continuation of these policies which were approved some 11 times by the Congress of the

16:34.560 --> 16:36.160
United States in extending the act.

16:36.160 --> 16:44.720
Well Mr. Hold and his great statesmanship showed that how trade was necessary for employment

16:44.720 --> 16:52.040
for industrial expansion for the farmers of America and also a very important part which

16:52.040 --> 16:58.560
I have been interested in as a person who attends NATO Parliamentary meetings and other

16:58.560 --> 17:04.600
things is that Mr. Hold preached and showed that if you trade with the people of the world

17:04.600 --> 17:08.400
you have a better chance of living in peace with them.

17:08.400 --> 17:14.160
So that we are interested in Tennessee but I think at this time we might also hear from

17:14.160 --> 17:19.720
the President of the United States and his State of the Union message he very briefly put

17:19.720 --> 17:25.800
forth the challenge in connection with the Trade Agreements Expansion Act and so they'll

17:25.800 --> 17:27.800
hear from the President of the United States.

17:55.800 --> 18:15.200
Now Mr. Peterson this new bill that we are considering gives the President an extended

18:15.200 --> 18:19.640
power in connection with tariffs and trade agreements.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.480
What is the necessity for it?

18:21.480 --> 18:26.280
It has taken place in the world and it makes this situation necessary.

18:26.280 --> 18:33.940
There is a new trading world and the best demonstration of this is the great and phenomenal

18:33.940 --> 18:37.920
growth of the common market in Europe.

18:37.920 --> 18:45.120
This was only started in 1958 which was the last time that the Trade Agreements program

18:45.120 --> 18:46.720
came before the Congress.

18:47.720 --> 18:56.720
You have the Battle of Luxe countries, Belgium and Holland and Netherlands and Luxembourg

18:56.720 --> 19:02.340
and France and Germany and Italy and they are going to abolish the tariffs between

19:02.340 --> 19:07.880
the Britain and Britain who is now asked to join and it is succession to this market.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.520
I think seems reasonably assured and they are really doing.

19:11.520 --> 19:20.200
When they are creating a market just as we create a market in the 1789 with no tariffs

19:20.200 --> 19:26.000
between the States and with a common external tariff against the outsiders.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
This is the most important market which our exporters enjoy.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
How much did we accept?

19:34.000 --> 19:38.840
Seven like six billion dollars last year and then we united Kingdom and the Western Europe

19:39.560 --> 19:45.120
and from this market something we are taking about four billion so we have a very favorable

19:45.120 --> 19:49.720
balance of trade with the balance on the plus side of about two billion dollars.

19:49.720 --> 19:54.000
It is our most important market for farm produce.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.440
They take great deal of our wheat, our tobacco, our cotton, many of our products of our farm

20:01.440 --> 20:07.560
but even in manufacturers we have a balance of terrible balance of trade with them.

20:07.560 --> 20:13.200
One thing we know is that they are going to abolish all the tariffs between the member

20:13.200 --> 20:20.160
states and erect this common external tariff and unless we can kind of batter down this

20:20.160 --> 20:26.160
common external tariff so that the discrimination against this is at least tolerable and we can

20:26.160 --> 20:32.880
still get in and sell our goods we are going to lose our position in this important market.

20:32.880 --> 20:36.840
This is kind of the threat side but there is also a challenge side.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.200
Just talk a little bit more about what it means.

20:40.200 --> 20:48.200
In the world generally last year we exported something from neighborhood of 20 billion dollars

20:48.200 --> 20:59.240
and we imported about 15 so that we sold about 5 billion more than we took in.

20:59.240 --> 21:03.040
What does this mean to the American people and to the manufacturers and to the farmers

21:03.120 --> 21:06.200
and the pyrrhicians and the factories?

21:06.200 --> 21:13.640
Well it means jobs, it means profits, when you analyze these figures, there is not really

21:13.640 --> 21:14.640
that I have.

21:14.640 --> 21:19.240
There is no reason to talk about the difference between the 20 billion and the 15 because of

21:19.240 --> 21:21.920
this 15 billion of imports.

21:21.920 --> 21:28.400
About 60 percent of things we either do not produce at all or produce an insufficient

21:28.400 --> 21:36.480
or a whole range of industrial goods which create jobs because without them our factories

21:36.480 --> 21:44.120
could run all the things like tropical agriculture products which we like like bananas and coffee

21:44.120 --> 21:45.960
and cocoa and tea.

21:45.960 --> 21:52.480
So that you only really in terms of job competing have imports of about 6 billion dollars.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.440
You have to compare this with the 20 billion dollar figure.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.760
There have been lots of estimates made of what the jobs involved are.

21:58.760 --> 22:03.960
I think the labor of the department, the labor of the statistics is about 3 million jobs

22:03.960 --> 22:06.920
and factories directly related to export.

22:06.920 --> 22:13.360
Industrial plants and about great many on the farms of the United States where we export

22:13.360 --> 22:15.120
a great deal of our farm products.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.800
There was, and that truth is right.

22:16.800 --> 22:22.320
Well I think the 10 billion dollars I would like to know just briefly but the present export

22:22.320 --> 22:25.680
program means to the people of Tennessee.

22:25.680 --> 22:33.520
According to the record almost 78 million jobs in Tennessee in 1900 and 78 thousand.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.520
78 thousand.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.440
I know that Tennessee is a lot of the important ones.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.440
Quite that many.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.240
Not quite that many.

22:41.240 --> 22:52.160
But anyway, almost 77 thousand employees worked in factories that exported more than 220 million

22:52.160 --> 22:53.160
dollars.

22:53.160 --> 22:59.400
And also that we are 60th in that year in manufacturing exports.

22:59.400 --> 23:07.560
And we found that in agriculture in Tennessee in 1961 that we exported products amounting

23:07.560 --> 23:10.960
to 93 million dollars.

23:10.960 --> 23:19.400
Eight million in livestock and animals, 600 thousand fruit and nuts, 600 thousand

23:19.400 --> 23:20.400
vegetables.

23:20.400 --> 23:28.000
That we had 37,600 farm workers were employed in producing things that were exported.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.240
And we have a substantial stake in Tennessee in this program.

23:33.240 --> 23:37.960
We are of course worried about the fact that we have had a Google drain against the United

23:37.960 --> 23:41.360
States for off and on for some years.

23:41.360 --> 23:46.000
Unless we can export and have a favorable trade balance, that Google drain will continue

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
to be larger.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
We will get larger and larger.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.680
And if we could actually increase our export surplus, this is one possible way of avoiding

23:55.680 --> 23:57.720
any drain on our goal.

23:57.720 --> 24:04.280
And well, Alan, I would say our export surplus has meant a whole lot to employment and industries

24:04.280 --> 24:05.280
on the farm.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.280
There is people of this country.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.280
Yes.

24:08.280 --> 24:13.520
Now, what is your prediction if we can negotiate somehow with this great common market that

24:13.520 --> 24:14.760
has become a reality?

24:14.760 --> 24:20.200
Do you think it will mean even more additional employment for the people in the United States?

24:20.200 --> 24:25.560
Well, I wish though, Sun Gerrit, I think it's very hard to kind of prove anything about

24:25.560 --> 24:32.180
the future because the future is rather inscrutable and so much depends on the general level of

24:32.180 --> 24:35.320
the economic activity of the trading partners.

24:35.320 --> 24:39.520
But we know that we're going to be worse than in our position if we're not able to deal

24:39.520 --> 24:41.320
with the common market.

24:41.320 --> 24:47.280
And I think we have the opportunity of enhancing our export position in this market because

24:47.280 --> 24:49.080
it has to big demand factor.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.120
It is growing so rapidly and it is our most important.

24:52.120 --> 24:55.160
Now, of course, some industries are going to be adversely affected.

24:55.160 --> 25:02.600
We know that because in some they perhaps can manufacture things in other countries so

25:02.600 --> 25:04.640
reasonably than we can.

25:04.640 --> 25:10.000
All their provisions and the bill for taking care of these adversely affected.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.420
And I think that the proposal in the trade expansion act make better provisions for

25:17.420 --> 25:23.840
these possibilities and have ever been suggested to the Congress before because there's a program

25:23.840 --> 25:31.480
of trade adjustment assistance whereby small firms, if they're hurt by import competition,

25:31.480 --> 25:36.120
can obtain governmental assistance in the forms of loans.

25:36.120 --> 25:40.200
And workers, if they're unemployed or if they find they're under employed because of

25:40.200 --> 25:46.160
import competition, can obtain the allowances which will permit them to be retrained for jobs

25:46.160 --> 25:48.600
in which they can better compete.

25:48.600 --> 25:52.720
But I don't think really where going to feel these hurts.

25:52.720 --> 25:57.200
In the first place, this program will go into effect only very gradually.

25:57.200 --> 26:02.800
The act has the odds that any reductions in tariffs may not be put into effect in a period

26:02.800 --> 26:04.320
of less than five years.

26:04.320 --> 26:08.440
So this gives a lot of time for, and I just a normal adjustment.

26:08.440 --> 26:13.000
And of course the big thing that appeals to me and I think all Americans is that by having

26:13.000 --> 26:20.000
a great trading area that we are gaining in strength as against the Soviet bloc.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.560
And I think it might be well to hear the President again as to what this kind of leadership

26:24.560 --> 26:25.240
means.

27:04.320 --> 27:22.360
Well, I know that Mr. Kruyshev doesn't want to see this common market become a reality

27:22.360 --> 27:23.560
and he doesn't want to be sweating.

27:23.560 --> 27:28.960
He's fighting it to come a part of it because that means that economically and industrially

27:28.960 --> 27:34.420
and in all kinds of strength we'll have a much greater advantage over the communist

27:34.420 --> 27:37.560
bloc block and therefore a better chance for peace in the world, doesn't it?

27:37.560 --> 27:39.600
I still only believe that, sir.

27:39.600 --> 27:44.560
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Peterson, for being with us and that's all for this

27:44.560 --> 27:57.280
time, friends.

27:57.280 --> 28:02.080
This is Estes' Keefe over speaking and I'm happy to say a few words in behalf of my

28:02.080 --> 28:07.840
very good friend and my able colleague in the United States Senate Wayne Morris.

28:07.840 --> 28:13.160
Senator Morris and I have shared many fights for worthwhile causes in the Senate and I have

28:13.160 --> 28:18.720
always been proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with him in these efforts.

28:18.720 --> 28:24.240
He enjoys the highest regard of his colleagues, the cost of his courage and his great devotion

28:24.240 --> 28:25.920
to principle.

28:25.920 --> 28:30.160
Let me tell you about a special talent for hard work that is one of Senator Morris's

28:30.160 --> 28:33.120
many able qualifications.

28:33.120 --> 28:37.120
I have the privilege of being a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

28:37.120 --> 28:43.320
I know firsthand about Senator Morris's diligent work and his testimony and behalf of

28:43.320 --> 28:47.000
appropriations to be made for the state of Oregon.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.840
I have jotted down some of the highlights in the last few years of Senator Morris's effort

28:52.840 --> 28:58.680
to effectively pursue and persuade the getting of appropriations for great projects in

28:58.680 --> 29:00.200
the state of Oregon.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.920
Let me list just a few.

29:01.920 --> 29:06.960
In the nature of public works, there are many great bams under construction which he

29:06.960 --> 29:12.280
has fought far successfully in the Senate and before the appropriations committee.

29:12.280 --> 29:20.040
John Day, Krueger, Green Peter, Hills Creek and of course recently the 40-foot channel

29:20.040 --> 29:25.280
on the Columbia which means so much to Portland and to that section generally.

29:25.280 --> 29:31.200
In range work, he has fought for special appropriations for receding burned ranges.

29:31.200 --> 29:38.840
This year he obtained funds to begin a model range rehabilitation program in eastern Oregon.

29:38.840 --> 29:43.400
Senator Morris has framed the appropriations committee with the material to support appropriations

29:43.400 --> 29:51.800
for water pollution control, hospital construction in the nation and in Oregon also.

29:51.800 --> 29:59.240
His work to increase forest access road construction in the national forest is not matched by that

29:59.240 --> 30:01.080
of any other senator.

30:01.080 --> 30:06.240
I think it would be difficult to find another member of the United States Senate who does

30:06.240 --> 30:12.760
more than Senator Wayne Morris does to protect the economy and the welfare of the state that

30:12.760 --> 30:15.120
he so ably represents.

30:15.120 --> 30:20.440
Oregon and the nation need Wayne Morris and the Senate and I hope that you are going

30:20.440 --> 30:21.440
to keep them there.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.200
Thank you.
