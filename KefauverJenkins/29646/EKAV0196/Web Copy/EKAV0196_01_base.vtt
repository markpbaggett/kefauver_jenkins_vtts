00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The demand is dropping, Gabel, and just a moment.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
The hearing will continue.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Let me welcome back to our guest.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
The demand is called at the order now, and the men are hearing another one.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
The current roll call hasn't been completed, and I'm sure I guess they're the same as those who have the audience on their east side.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
We will proceed with the interrogation of Lieutenant Blue, and the direction has been completed.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
They will also address the way back to the vote, but what is Lieutenant-Storming's interest, if he has any questions?

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Hello, I was listening to one of my distinguished colleagues.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
You were in those dilemma with Inspector Ford Monmouth, were you?

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
I said, I know, sir. You were simply doing your duty at the Civil Office, everyone.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
That's right, sir.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
I've been looking at you for some day, but you got sick. How many battles?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm a cracker, you got there.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Hello, through the European's got a base, through all the campaigns from London, and the Czechoslovakia.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Tell the gun him up, take the time.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Well?

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
I like that. Five campaigns in New York, three in Korea.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Before you were admitted in 1936, sevens, or fours, how old were you?

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
You want to see. I'm again to believe you have no other clue.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
You've got to turn about twenty-two at Treason.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
I tell you, we're roomed in fights, today I'd like to talk to Norman, once in a truce.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
And in Korea, you've got to have firm disabilities, that right?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Yes, sir. I lost my left leg, all in the...

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I'd say you've also got to tell the stars that you like to go out and see an action.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yes, sir.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
You work in the Secretary's office?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Yes, sir.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
I count the lab that he thought that he made a mistake and be able to provide at one point.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
What would you answer to that?

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
I don't think he made him stay zero. He's a courteous gentleman.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
If you can't...

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
You do things in politeness when a man gets from your house, he was a guest for an army court.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Now, uh...

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, you were bringing with me that...

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
One of the most important things in the world, the preventable, the Communism,

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
all over the world, Communist aggression, is the morale of the United States Army.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Yes, sir.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Have you ever had any action that you've ever taken, or have you ever had that in mind?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I hope so, sir.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
I have said before, and I've been in the army so many people in this country have relatives in the army that in my opinion,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
along with other witnesses here, here are great credit for the country.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
No further comments or questions, Mr. Jim?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I have no questions.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
And then, I think that's all you were thinking about, you know, how I'll figure it out.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
Mr. Chairman, on their side that I've had to be honest and strongly committed hearing for several hours,

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
a pair of other geniuses that had to be asthmined to him, and I regret that I haven't heard the rest of the moment of the weaponry.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
And I do not want to be the person.

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
As I understand you have testified to certain statements that Mr. Cohn made on their case in the left,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
as it took a month, the left, the left, the left, the right.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
And I'll not ask you to repeat the statement that can be both in the left hand.

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
You have to record your whole gun as beautiful as it has been certified to.

03:54.000 --> 04:03.000
And I assume you have confirmed that these charges and allegations that have been made.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
But I want to know here that if you personally heard the statement,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
yes sir, now you heard them.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I know the statement started out at your station.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
But I'll not ask you the repeatment, but I'll ask you there.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
You saw the expressions of the awful statements after the timing, yes sir.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
You were able to evaluate and analyze, is that a few at that time,

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
the meaner as well as the verbal expressions that you heard.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
Well, if you immediately summed it with your person to the secretary of the Army,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
what's your idea?

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Maybe reporting to him there on that occasion, will it be left to post, yes sir.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
Or if you're the one who heard them, you're the one who had the best opportunity to evaluate them.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
Did you regard those statements as they said against the secretary and against the Army?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Yes sir, I just have time.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Take it hard and heard.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
Did you regard them as an effort to intimidate the secretary of the Army?

05:16.000 --> 05:24.000
I don't think I've just done so particularly because I don't see how man can't intimidate the secretary of the Army.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
All right, but that's just so.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Yes sir, you did regard them as an attempt to do so.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I think I did.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Yes sir.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
There are everywhere now.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
You so took them at that time,

05:40.000 --> 05:52.000
did you realize at that time, were you evaluating them at that time as a threat or an attempt to enforce the accident decision of the secretary of the Army?

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
I think at the time they actually assured I took them at that time,

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
and I think that the evidence of this temper

06:05.000 --> 06:15.000
and the act of what happened with the press, so-called press release that was prepared beforehand.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
And I know it's not too much about that.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
I see the required obvious, but I at least thought that that incident had not occurred.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
The press release would probably have been the issue.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
That's my case.

06:29.000 --> 06:37.000
I don't think the AFF was in a statement made by Mr. Coleman at the time that it made me a better remark

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
to go up and stood up for the release, that it would not be accurate or he'd cheated his money.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
No, sir, nothing.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
He did not.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Just my recollection, I just don't know that.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
I didn't hear you at that time, only did he state to use that.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Well, not a case, and that he did have access to the AFF.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes, sir.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
We all heard those statements.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Why do those persons hear they made? Mr. John Adams was there.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
He testified here.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
I do not know that all cases of presence heard all portions of the state,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
because this was not a stationary group.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
It's moving around a lot of the time you've already gone mad in detail.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I don't want to be reputated, so that's all.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I'm going to go ahead and get my tickets.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
I have a minute left.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
A ton of balloons.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Who else was denied access to the laboratory on that day?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
A very principal.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
And the visuals, who were denied access were Mr. Cohn, Mr. Harold Rainbow,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
and Mr. John's the Santa Potter's office.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Now, I would assume that there were the other people on the model of post-boot

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
who had no need to know that information, but I say, yes,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
but I mean, not the immediate group.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
That's, I think, the only tree that would stay there.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Well, it would be denied.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Did any of them complain?

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Mr. In the Mr. John's students, they expressed his pleasure as to say one,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
but they didn't complain vocally or allow that.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
I've went over and talked to them and see what they added to the words.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
So they used any comparable language to not what you testified to as an outburst?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
No, sir.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
How long did they think that they'd land?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I say 15 to 20 minutes.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
That's my judgment, sir.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Were the statements repetitive?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Some like, yes, sir.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
That's all.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
You're welcome, Mr. Cohn, sir.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Nothing's that I'm not happy about Mr. Cohn.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Mr. Chairman, this way, in my opinion,

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
the mission of the case has a question.

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
Currently, as nothing here has to do with any endopterine problems and the change.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
This was the subject of I, the material of anger,

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
because it was rather important moments in such as facilities.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
Facilities, sir, security risk will come if connections are working when he got to the door.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
He was in either way to going in.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I could also testify that Mr. Cohn is angry.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
The surrender of love with the Do's love.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I would be also, I just think of the vast waste of time,

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
therefore I'm not going to spend any more on that question of the different questions.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Mr. Cohn, if the man who I just completed, I can present it to you.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Anybody else?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
The cabinet is ready to meet you.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Thank you very much.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
All right, all right.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
The cabinet is going to be in the call, I guess.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Another panel?

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
This is Lieutenant Colonel coming now.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Very good, I guess.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
Lieutenant Colonel, I guess the lander also will be here with you over there, so.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
I believe he was being interrogated by a comforter on Mr. Cohn,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Mr. Cohn, you may be just...

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I'd miss you, Cohn, when you three back to the foot of the gam,

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
and took the food charge from him.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
Then Mary, I'm going to refer to the first charge as the private sign charge.

10:36.000 --> 10:44.000
And the second charge has the typical penny chart, how much?

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
Now this is a fact, I don't know if it's expected to be two charge.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
And the effect is the black mark from the sign sign charge,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
where only a little I show to you,

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
and that some revision was made so long,

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
that reason are the revision in certain information and figures given to you.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
That's correct, it is not.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
You say you do not know who is responsible for using,

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
that the particular charge of insignia that we find on this charge to meet the black mark?

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't know who selected that pattern initially, sir,

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
I accepted it when I saw it and it seemed to be graphically to portray what we wanted to portray.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
It is designed to be a record that our baby's shine

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
has reached the November, December and January,

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
and particularly, his reference to his absences is that right for him, Mary?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Yes, so that's what the title on it says.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
The pattern and Mary,

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
these black marks indicate that times he was all either at normal times,

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
or the times that he was all with the consent and permission of his commanding officer.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Is there anything, whatever,

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
with respect to these black marks,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
that is a reflection on shine,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
or on his record as a soldier at four days?

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
No, sir, I believe that the title merely states the record of his absences and telephone messages received by the commanding general.

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
Sometimes we refer to a man or a child in school as having a black mark opposite its name,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
if being a term of stigma,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
this is an intended disaster call of his penumery,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
no, sir, as far as I know, it's not.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
Now, penumery, picking up the average inductive charge.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
There is no black mark on it.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
If I have it in my hand now, and if you have it in your hand,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
I would leave a calling miniatur of the average inductive charge.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Yes.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
It has no black marks, whatever.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
As that is, insofar as these, the squares are rectangle versus concern.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
That's correct, isn't it, penumery?

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Well, it's not exactly in the Jenkins, I believe that these, they're all black marks.

13:23.000 --> 13:31.000
The only distinction is that the lettering on this charge too is entirely in black ink.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Whereas on charge one, we have some lettering in white ink,

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
because we had to lettering on days when there were no taxes,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
as well as on days when there were tax.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, if I'm number one, you mean the shine charge?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I believe you call that number one just a minute ago, yeah.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
And I'm not sure, I'm sure I see the file, the shine charge is me tickets to your testimony,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
and now it's to the file number two.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
The typical inductive charge, as we see the thing, if that has not already been done.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I can't believe that it's his name.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
When you expect to remember two, the typical inductive charge,

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
there were seven days when the typical inductive is entitled to be a way away on me,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
as a matter of life.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
That's correct, yes sir.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
And the typical inductive charge that you now hold before you is,

14:27.000 --> 14:36.000
though not how a blackout or a black mark on the days when he would be entitled to be away as a matter of course,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
is that correct, yes sir?

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
As a graphic presentation of Mr. Jenkins, I really believe you have to read the chart as well as look at it.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yes.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I was just saying my specific question.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Well, I'm not a nice speaker.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I see your black marks on there.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
You have a different nature than the ones on the other charts.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I'll ask you. Let's see if this way, Colonel Murray.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
This, the same standards have been used in the preparation of both of these charts.

15:02.000 --> 15:12.000
The same things, the same charts, are better than the reviews in their making of the reviews,

15:12.000 --> 15:20.000
and the coloring, assumed that the same standards were used.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
Whether or not charts number two have a different appearance,

15:25.000 --> 15:34.000
and we just now have more black marks on it, than it's now has as I hold the miniature of it in my hands.

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
On the days that the individual got a pass, we could have used the same type of black mark as on the signs.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And so obviously, you ain't just not supposed to use the same kind of thing.

15:44.000 --> 15:53.000
I think, yes or no, now it's seen that the same draftsmen prepared both of these charts,

15:53.000 --> 16:01.000
that he prepared both of them by the same standard and members of the direction of the same man,

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
using the same names, the same chalks, the same insignia, the business, the records,

16:08.000 --> 16:15.000
our signs and censuses from this, and the record of the absences of the average embassy from this,

16:15.000 --> 16:24.000
isn't a fact. That charts number two, the testing record of the average embassy at this,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
would have a different appearance.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
So the charts as it was originally presented to the committee this morning,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
yes or no, yes or no, all right, they will.

16:35.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm sure it would have more blockages of facts that shall we say.

16:43.000 --> 16:52.000
It would certainly, you say, have a different appearance, I would have more facts, painters, chalks,

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
indicated on it's been the one as originally presented here today.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
That's like, it's just half an of my worries, it's the other one, but still...

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
As I say, I must indicate that there is any sinister movie on the part of anybody

17:09.000 --> 17:17.000
and using the color of black instead of red, I just know that sometimes a child comes home with a past grade

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
and you say he's got a black mark of his name and that, hey, you understand that.

17:23.000 --> 17:31.000
I think it's a very famous color school directed, the type of charts to be prepared,

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
the flow's prepared in both instances. You say you didn't do this, was not your brain child.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
Who's brain child looked at? On the first chart, I say we inherited a chart

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
which is somewhat like this when we maintain the same pattern.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I'll give you a little bit of a room here, did you guys...

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I'll have to follow that data, you later, I'll try to run it down.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
I picked it up in the secretary's office, I believe, when I started gathering a number of materials

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
together when I was assigned to work in his office in the preparation of this case.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
That chart was there, among them. I had heard of Shrine, do we understand?

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
Yes, the Shrine chart. Not the same type, not the same one, but one book that looked very much like this one.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
It had already been prepared and that would be prior to the 27th of March,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
which was the day that I was sometime out when I first saw it.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
Now on the second chart, I don't know who prepared that first one of my own knowledge.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm the lack of that's all I'm trying to get at. You followed the same pattern in the second chart.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
On the second one, when we were getting ready, it closed to the day of preparation.

18:40.000 --> 18:49.000
The second one was that we were told by members of Yacht staff that we wanted to present the four-six people to tell our story.

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
I believe you saw the earlier charts that we had and the copies of it that we had.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
We did not have at that time a typical chart.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
That's if it began to seem apparent that maybe we ought to have the chart in itself, the Shrine chart,

19:07.000 --> 19:20.000
representing a comparison with nothing, was probably not the graphics to show that a amount of time he was away from the post as if we had something to compare it with.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
So I on short notice we were told to get the four-six people.

19:24.000 --> 19:31.000
I directed one of the officers that was working with me, the captain for long, was sitting in the second row here now,

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
to get a typical chart prepared from the materials that we had finished and fixed.

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
And he was the one that actually dealt with Mr. Wood, the supervisor of the drafting section.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
I have never seen this. The wood I wouldn't recognize it if I saw.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
The chart was prepared in substantially the way you see it, from the information that we had.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
That was one of the days when we brought General Ryan and everybody else over here.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.000
And I recall looking at it and I say, well, this chart looks a little different than the other one.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
And the answer that I got then was, well, we had to have it in a hurry.

20:12.000 --> 20:21.000
And if we had to do it exactly the way the other one was done, we'd have had a wait for the blackings to dry, the foliage could put white ink on top of it.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
The amount of time that we had to get over here to get ready with the fixed people,

20:25.000 --> 20:36.000
did he allow us that time? And we said, well, go ahead and do the best we can so that we'll have a chart that is representative of these typical absences of the private of the city.

20:36.000 --> 20:44.000
I believe, Colonel, that as the time members of my staff and I have just been in the Pentagon to the purpose of preparing the Army's case entirely with me,

20:44.000 --> 20:56.000
and we were shown the shining chart, perhaps not in its person form, but in the form that it was in just fire to the revision.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Is that correct? Yes sir.

20:58.000 --> 21:07.000
So at the next pan, Colonel Murray, as I recall, I do not believe he had chart number two in the typical chart.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
So we did not. Now Colonel Murray has this further question.

21:14.000 --> 21:26.000
You have given us the history of the present giant chart. You still say that you saw its counterpart.

21:26.000 --> 21:35.000
I wanted to introduce you in the office of the secretary and I used the coloring on it, the black coloring on it.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
I represent the time the shine was the way either normally or that specialist inflation.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
Yes sir. And in lightness there's the group designed the original chart.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
So that if all parties are not satisfied, we might just give him a bath.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Well, as far as the color is, I can only say what was recorded to me.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
So did you tell us that?

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
I believe you've already heard that the events, so-called events were prepared in fire midst of brown.

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
I understood it concurrently with the preparation of those events, just went on this chart.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
I had heard that it was prepared under the supervision of a Mr. Copeland.

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
I have never met Mr. Copeland. I don't know on the five saws, but that was the information I received.

22:26.000 --> 22:36.000
However, when he was a lecture, Copeland, I used the preliminary, as I understand it, COU used C OU-GH-L-I-N.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I don't know, I'm sorry.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Is he an army, is he in the Pentagon now?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I don't know if he is, I believe he is.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Is he an army, never thought he's not an army officer.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
A civilian employee is the army. I believe he's just a very unemployed.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I have heard that he is, so I don't know.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I sure.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
In order to use the fees, the authors of the original chain chart.

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
I had heard that he had prepared it, and when we received it, it had been in his office one time.

23:06.000 --> 23:17.000
That's a little weird, who is the author of the original number two,

23:18.000 --> 23:27.000
typical inductive chart. I presented here this morning before it's under what I was going over by Senator McCarty.

23:27.000 --> 23:37.000
Well, in so far as giving instructions to someone who had a chart to pass on the absence of a typical training at Fort Dick,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I am the author.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
You are the author.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
The criminal did not occur to use it perhaps this was this.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Have led the less confusion?

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
Has he smoothed the frame in the signal?

24:00.000 --> 24:08.000
Our coloring on the typical inductive chart has been used on the chain chart.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
It has a curve to make sense this morning.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
I think it's all action answered first.

24:18.000 --> 24:26.000
I think the criminal you said is that the reason why you prepared the second chart,

24:26.000 --> 24:37.000
which we now call the typical chain each chart, was to have some standards that are basis for comparison with the G-Dave Chine chart,

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
that the G-Dave Chine chart standing by itself, you said comfortable with nothing,

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
would not be very clear chart or informative to the killer.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
You decided to put the third check in chart.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
I think you now are considered in your lab statement.

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
The answer to the question I was about to ask you, but I will ask it again and make sure

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
that you will see that it would have been more informative and let the steps be achieved to the killer.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
When you are preparing for the check to be compared, you should have used comfortable sim.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
In fact, the two steps are similar to the G-Dave Chine chart.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, I didn't know that anyone would be deceived by it,

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
and as much as we have a very accurate description on it,

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
which has been specified too by General Ryan as seeing the absences of shine and the absences of the truth.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
The typical train needs.

25:36.000 --> 25:43.000
The point of being to read my question is that I am sure your answer is not with money.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
You are a redevelopment agent.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
First, I don't call you instead of the reason why you prepared the second chart

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
to be compared to the G-Dave Chine chart.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
For us, I was not a standard of basis for comparison with the G-Dave Chine chart.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
That G-Dave Chine chart stands by itself, you said,

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
comfortable with nothing, do not be both core threat or embarked into the committee.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
So you decided you would start the second chart.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
I think you have not concluded in that statement for the answer to the question I was about to ask you,

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
but I will ask you again to make sure that you really feel that you have done more informed through the last research

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
to the committee when you are preparing for our next chart to be compared.

26:36.000 --> 26:43.000
That you already use top of those sunbows instead of two sets of sunbows, such as your ideas.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
The little boy, all of them in the next day is calling you in and having his comparison.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
We would have understood his practice in a very beginning point.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
Yes, and I think it would have been more informative, but so far as the subject,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I had not thought that it had deceived.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
I am now accusing you of attempting to deceive very frankly or just to deceive me.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
Because this meeting is very small, you sit up here in the lead light, and if you talk to Steve,

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
I would rather sound when I heard the testimony and when I had time now to compare them.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
I find that on the typical Chine chart, there are 15 spots that should be blocked out.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
On the GJ, there is a time chart.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
As you present them blacked out equally, we would have seen that there were 10 more here, then there were here.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I thought there were a great many more.

27:31.000 --> 27:38.000
Now I am using only the month of November and December, which has quite obviously, on your January chart,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
you didn't mark out anything in your typical end of each other, it was up in the entire event.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
But the truth is, it was basically compared to the one half, 13 and one half, 23.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
That would have been clearer and easier to find out.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
May I add something for you, please, will you, me?

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
I do not believe that we presented the so-called typical chart this morning.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I know that I was in a pretty much a circle.

28:02.000 --> 28:10.000
Well, I brought these charts, copies of them, to the committee staff about a week to show a goal.

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
And how, I mean, we presented on the blackboard this morning the GJ-Bag Shine chart.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
Where did the other thing white chart go behind it, sir?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Who brought it here?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
I did, sir.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
And then you presented it?

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
I don't know. I believe it was first uncovered when some of them had copies uncovered it.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
We had issued, however, the smaller charts, then...

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
That I now hold with them.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Yes, sir.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
We had...

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I had to go with it, but it was on the easel.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I just tidied it though this morning.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Yes, sir.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
You know what I'm talking about.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
And they are identical.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Yes, the nature was always true before I sent it in the chart, but on the blackboard,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
it was rejected to put on.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
That's correct.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
Well, I thought there was an influence over that I was trying to deceive them there.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
And I know I'm going to give proof by the two charts that you told here.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I am not saying you were trying to deceive me.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
You did deceive me very definitely.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Because of the fine print here.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
And I had no reason to question about all of these black spots,

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
and here also I am a copy about the fusion of the easel.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
I think we now agree anyhow that if you had presented the chart,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
each with the same kind of symbols,

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
you would have a clear sense of fusion to begin with if there were 43 in the one instance for...

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
November and December and December and only two on the up.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Maybe if I got the two black ones.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
September and January.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
That was undercover.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Now I would like to call your attention to another.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
I am sure in that version, each option,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
but a very genuine one.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
And that is just a two original chart which you said is the curve that is to call.

29:53.000 --> 30:03.000
Looking at this chart, I assumed the correct that all of these black spots were sometimes the black marks on the record of GJs and Shines.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
Or at least were indicative of the same kind of special treatment for special spots.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
But I find that your 23 black spots in December and January,

30:14.000 --> 30:22.000
that several of them contained in one language or another the fact that C.S.P.P. will occur company policy.

30:22.000 --> 30:31.000
So that there again you would have compared 16 or 16 spots which were granted special spots.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
Apparently with 7 passes which were just regular or given with each.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
So that you have not only confused me,

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
but you have in that very early and unintentionally received me.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
And I think the other members of the committee because there is an original chart.

30:46.000 --> 30:53.000
Next, no differentiation whatsoever between the perfectly routine and ordinary passes that Shines receive.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
And only if you receive according to the testimony of General Ryan,

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
it has a cause and an agent from the members of the committee staff.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
So you should feel that he was going to present this original chart that Mr. Kaufman prepared.

31:05.000 --> 31:14.000
That you should have differentiated between the unusual and extraordinary passes and those which are just ordinary repeat.

31:14.000 --> 31:22.000
No sir, I don't agree with you on that latter thing because each of these charts has a legend which is descriptive.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah, I think it's the first chart has been presented by a self-president.

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
The legend is a label that's atop would accurately portray what the chart is attempting to display.

31:33.000 --> 31:40.000
A chart is intended to make clear what the legend shows is that it's not known whether it's our religion to clarify the charts.

31:40.000 --> 31:47.000
But we have to use the fine tin here to know what you're talking about in these black blocks because you're all the same.

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
As you have black blocks for the extraordinary passes, some kind of shaded blocks for the ordinary passes.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Here we have a funny clear set, what's right start.

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
But you have to be easy individual little legend, which is very difficult up here to find the time to do.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
You know, you know what it's like actually today.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Well, this is a complicated picture to portray you, Senator.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
And that's why we have the lettering on there to read it.

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
That's my complaint that your black is there, makes it more self-president and confused.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
That can be raised in all together if you're only a sensation as you pick up the chart and look at it.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
And it can be the dimensions.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
So the fact speaks for themselves, if you have time to read them, then you have a box what general is I am justified.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Now, I don't think this is deliberate.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I think it was unquestionable.

32:37.000 --> 32:46.000
If we did not vote then I don't think we can design a really intended to think this is an area where you have certainly considered it with a situation as a profile.
