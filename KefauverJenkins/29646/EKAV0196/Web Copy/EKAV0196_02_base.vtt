WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
The question was in left to the wrong, the third day of November, we received no pass during

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
that month.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Is that correct?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Yes.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
That's great, James.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Of all that month, they can say it.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Yes.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Nothing disrupted about that.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
All right, let's take the month to be remembered.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Again, with the first day of the month and go down to the 19th.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
There's the other private in the camp, so they're inside of the room and the private is

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
doing that time.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Most of them.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
They got no passes during that time.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Then, so, is that right?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
The typical private got in the heart, or I thought I was calling out if it's so private.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
What do you mean with this private?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
I just didn't want to give an answer that was indicated.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
There was no one on task during that month.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
I will take a picture from 11.30, then let's go down.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
There's no one on the board, they have no members.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
They're the ones.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
We'll call them all.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Just to make that work.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Access one.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Is that what you're talking about?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Yes, I told them on the spot.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
It's not typical.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
She gave it a shot.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
All right, then.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
It's all about all others who have been in the dark in all the third of November.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Did you use any summer like those suggested things?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Since you've been caught in the air.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
What summer, what mark would you face?

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Or any day from the first of December down to the 19th of December?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
That's not now there.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
No.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
So down to the 19th of December then there's not the map.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Is that correct?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yes.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
All right.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Using every suggestion that's been made to you, there's nothing that would have belonged

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
or any day from the third day of November down to the 18th, including the 18th day of December.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yes.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
They still remain as they are.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
So the only conclusion of either this is from the 19th day of December when you thought,

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
or out on one map, all in black was black, and on the other chart you sent the show

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
that in white was black, right?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Is that the only difference?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
In white.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
In white, white.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
So, and it's like a slam by the black board.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So, I'm about black board.

02:06.000 --> 02:15.000
So whatever confusion there is, if the reasoning is must combine it from the 19th day of December down to the 16th day of January.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yes.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
The 19th region of the West Bank.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
That's right.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I thought.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Before the next anniversary starts, the question, Colonel Murray, let us return to our studio to cut the company to permit our station.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Colonel Murray, it's not a happy late-day black mark song.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
This is ABC Television Network.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
After the dollar, failed right by Hammer.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
It's almost a ginger ginger ale.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Ask your dear, all right, beverages by Hammer, Brooklyn 8th.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
New York.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Well, I've just went through to you.

02:46.000 --> 02:55.000
According to that, my comment, I think I took only the last two months because of the fact that General Ryan testified that there should be changes made in November.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
I didn't know what in future to be about that.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
However, and the pattern that's all I knew.

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
Colonel Murray, did I only say to you that you made just one report the second shot by the typical bomb.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
So, what about the...

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
You made it in the hurry and presented it to the committee, was it?

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
In my position, I've been charged with getting the Army witnesses ready when Mr. Jenkins wants them.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
General Ryan made three trips to Washington to testify on this subject before he was called as a witness.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
That isn't his fault, and I don't think it's mine.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I think it's just the way the hearings have been going.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
But when he came here for the first time, I had to have this ready.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
That was when the first year was on.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
Now, I took a fan and we had it here at that time, and I've been bringing it in and out of this committee room every day since the first day of it.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
We were ready to take General Ryan.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
That we were on the first year when I prepared it.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
Yes, the game as a thought, it wasn't an original thought with me, it was still free of talking.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
We decided we ought to have a yardstick to compare it with, and I ordered another shot.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
Did I understand you that by the reason there's a difference in the symbol that one is black,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
or lighting on the white, and the other will start on black,

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
is the fact that if you had made this second shot, the symbol is black,

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
or would it take longer to grind, or foldable lighting, because that's the best time.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
That was the way I remember it.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
I asked that the chopper he prepared to make another one exactly like this one,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
with the passes of the average trainee.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
I gave those instructions to chop them full on, and as I left it like he came back to me and he said,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
we want the able to have it ready in the time we needed.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I believe that we had only one night to work on it.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
He says, we won't have it ready if you want it that way.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
As well, do the best you can. We've got to have it ready.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
I've given many an order like that, and it's usually been tied up.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
In a fair liquor, or you move that canary at the time,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
that there was a difference that one was black, and the type,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
or I didn't the other one was black, but black.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Do you recognize that?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I remember that they told me they couldn't make it exactly alike.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
I said, well, it should be as narrow-like as possible, but do the best you can.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And then I didn't see the shot again until it was prepared,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
and I had to bring it over here that first morning.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
That's all.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm sorry I'd like to pursue a little with you.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
The conversation behind some of the other officers here

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
is going to do when the Army is on the first of July in 1937.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
1937. How old were you? How was 18?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I see you've got quite a few battles there, and I'll leave you an emergency.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Is that correct?

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I have two battles to ask for a European campaign.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Now, I thought you had a court below.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
They're pinned here.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
My boy said, I think it's unfortunate that it isn't used as black color

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
on five of the shine and a five color for the other way around.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
But the world has seen you come into this picture,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
and I came to vote for that from what your decimal is.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
As I understand it, you only produce one large chart that exists here.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I brought both of the charts here.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Only one chart was here.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
One chart, the shine chart was on top of the other chart.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Both of them work here, and I go up an inch.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Now, you gave the committee members copies of both charts.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yes, I did.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
And if anybody was to see you by not reading both charts,

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
their deceptions would be largely eliminated if they hadn't read the charts.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
That's the way you did in my opinion, yes.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Because all the facts were on both charts,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
although the colors were unfortunate.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Yes, their full charts were produced for the television audience.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Then the colors themselves might have been deceptive.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Yes, but that was not your intention as you put them in.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Is that correct?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
No.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Now, I just want to get that straight.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
I think you can make a mistake, but a mistake in the seat,

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
especially from an officer in the Army, or two different things.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I noticed today that you happen to see in the paper

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
that there are a lot of vacancies for West Point.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I've seen reports on that.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yes.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
No more questions, Mr. Chairman.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Let's hope you want to stop the color of them, though,

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
so that you're left with more levels.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
We have an over-to-flyers' application to end point and stop the color.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I don't like that stuff to be stopped.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I don't like that stuff.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I don't like the state of the Army that we don't have to say

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
if it was going to give us that position 40 on.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Well, as many good things are thought to go, we've got to be.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
So far, it's about to be under the light.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It's a welcome, Mr. Timber.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Nothing.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
I'm in the taxi, Mr. Home Arts.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Mr. Chairman, the senator.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm not going to get some very open-air lights on.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I'm going to get some of the questions.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Any time, sir.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
So, why don't we just all like that a week?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
We'll read these legend on these two shots here.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
They could be known as the section.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Is that right, sir?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yes.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
So, even if I said the legend itself on the Shining Shot

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
is the set of...

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
It's not in my opinion, sir.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Well, sir, sir, if I might direct your attention

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
to the Shining Shot, it says,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
the record of absences and messages.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And tell a call message to the commanding general,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
9th and 3rd of the division.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
While it's time to 4th week's New Jersey,

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
I will then direct your attention to Black March

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
for the day Tuesday the 3rd, Wednesday the 4th, Thursday the 5th,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Friday the 6th, Saturday the 7th,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Sunday the 8th and Monday the 9th.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And ask your whether or not on those days,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Shining was absent from 4th 6th.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Only legend is served while assigned the 4th 6th New Jersey

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
for the period through November 19th, 1953 to 16th January, 1964.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Any other pilot in Black for the 4th time,

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Black, New York, on the 4th November, once a 4th 6th,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
pilot Shining was absent from 4th 6th at that time.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
I think it's time for the according to your testimony on November 19th.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I do not know whether he was assigned the 4th 6th at that time,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
but I do believe that the information that was prepared

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
has been accurately checked.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
And I think what presents where he should have been assignment at 4th 6th.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
So is it not a fact that he was not assigned the 4th 6th and isn't so indicated

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
on your own shot until the 10th of November,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
and that from the 3rd to the 10th,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
he was not absent from 4th 6th,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
but was on temporary duty attached to first Army headquarters in New York.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
What temporary duty is a manner of assigning the person

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
to counting for while he's out of particular device

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
so that he can get quarters and rations and be paid for that period.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I am not a competent witness to determine

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
just how shine was what the arrangements were at the time shine was inducted.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I don't know, well, if I'm not wavering the point, Colonel,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
would you agree with me that are showing when not assigned

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
to 4th 6th until the 10th of November that fits the legend

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
on this chart which has been submitted is inaccurate?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
No, sir, I would not.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
You think that even if he were not assigned to 4th 6th,

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
by the November 10th,

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
we should have black marks for 12345 6th,

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
7 days indicating absence from 4th 6th when he was not in fact assigned it.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
As a chart showing his absence is from the date of induction

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
and while assigned as a typical trainee

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
would have gone direct to Dix,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
shine did not, I believe it does accurately portray that fact.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
So the thing that's publicly as it does,

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
it doesn't say what he says,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
it says while assigned to 4th 6th New Jersey.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Now, isn't this the fact that he was not assigned to 4th 6th New Jersey?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You can't just tell my life from your own chart.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
I can read the chart and it says while assigned to 4th 6th for the period,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
3 November 53 to 16 January 54.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, that's not going to go back and forth,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
but I would suggest that you look at the date of an attempt he would chime,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
and if you would check the record,

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
you would find that no assignment to 4th 6th was made until the 10th November.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
And it's hardly likely that he could have been absent from a place

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
where he has not been assigned for the 5th 7th day.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Well, I think that on a technical little point like that,

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
I think that the chart is still accurate because I don't know how this was originally prepared,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I testified to that, but we have three lines.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
We think private key goes in shine on the first.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Then we have a two line block that says record of absent,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
and telephone messages.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
The commanding general might make a reservation while assigned to 4th 6th.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Then we have a third method of describing the thing.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
4th a period.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Why did they intend to have that 4th a period?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
The connection with 4th 6th with a prior mine or not?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
I don't know.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
It would seem unlikely because there's a space there.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I'm making wrong, but that's my feeling about it now.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm going to ask you a question, William.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Yes.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
The first is you, apparently, you've heard of the three reasons

11:55.000 --> 12:06.000
for using the black mark on the shine set and the white spaces on the average training set

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
or because it takes you so long to drive at a difficulty using the same type of symbols

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
and both of them, misunderstanding.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Yes, sir.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I said that I can recall it.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
When we had to get the chart up initially, we had a very short time schedule.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
I said prepare a chart very much like shine for the record of a typical accent tape.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
I gave our instructions and I recall the all-time ticket to the question.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Was it what did you use?

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
The pure white sheets for the average inductee and the black person because of the length of time that it took you to drive.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
That was the reason I guess that it was you, sir.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I didn't make that decision myself.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
But it was because of the length of time that it took you to drive.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
So I had been told.

12:54.000 --> 13:04.000
And I have, between me and the young man who has been doing much drafting for us, he tells me it takes about 10 minutes for the incident to drive.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
If it takes 10 minutes for the incident to drive, it seems that it's hardly a valid excuse for this type of,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
but I call it a 20 chart.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Do we have a different description of it?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Do you know what it only takes about 10 minutes for the incident to drive?

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Also, I don't know how long we're taking for drive.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Now, what can you ask you of this?

13:24.000 --> 13:32.000
As far as the information is concerned, the information for the people of Pentagon, you don't need a chart.

13:32.000 --> 13:44.000
The chart was prepared for the withdrawal of the total purposes, for television, for trade as to the public or the committee.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Well, I believe that that was part of the reason.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yes.

13:50.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, it was filmed, and normally, we'd use the same type of symbols to show the absence of the average trainee,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
as we would use to show the absence of chance.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
If you want this merely for, or it's the total benefit,

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
do you think this is purely active, therefore, as you have a purified seat for the average trainee?

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
And this black belt seat for shane?

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Well, I don't believe it's a pure white seat, nor was it when it was presented,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and it wasn't active at all.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
It was probably a deliberate attempt on the part of the man that did it to get to my instructions compiled with,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
in the time that I gave him.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And if you look to him, you even know what it's going to be used for.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
It's a little bit different, as to the modern.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
And it looks like the most deliberate attempt that I have seen here for some time,

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
the most deliberate attempt ever before our committee, to create a deceptive pony chart.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
I think the no-reason probably wouldn't black out the average trainee,

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
absolutely, the payment to blackout trains.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I assume you perhaps would not be responsible.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
Most of our difficulty so far is not that there's one in uniform,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
but with the civilian politicians over in the Pentagon.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.000
Now, I claim that you say that the Mr. Cardone and Mr. Wood were in charge of it.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Are they uniform, or are they civilian?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I've never seen either of them.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Mr. Wood is a draftman. He was below me and the chain you might say.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
He took instructions that I gave.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
Mr. Copeland was a civilian, who I have never seen, but I understand he was involved in me,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
and I accepted something that he had heard prepared.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
No, Colonel, you were not, you personally are not responsible, are you?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Well, I mean, I am a person.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
You personally are not responsible, are you?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
For using a different type of symbol,

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
I am a child from the charge of the average trainee.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I believe I am more responsible than any other living person.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
All right. We're good.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm not going to get this down. Can you both eat over?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
You personally have ordered a drink.

16:14.000 --> 16:23.000
The plate charge for the average trainee, the black child for a child.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I brought them over in that fashion.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
How many comforts are there prepared in here?

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
One original of each of the large charts and 200 prints of each of the small charts.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
The external footprints.

16:38.000 --> 16:51.000
I inquired about that during the lunch hour, and I understand that the cost of the $450

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
or $200, and the rest of the makes the cost of the large charts of $6,75

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
since each of 1350 for a total expenditure of $213.50.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
This term, you mentioned a good question. The question was handed to the press.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
You were talking about the cost. I did mention it.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
I thought he said, you know, I answered that question, it's an exception, but the term is handed.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I thought you mentioned a good question, and the question.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
I did hand those out to the press because I had learned a little by experience here.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
The first day when we entered an exhibit, I had the press asked me for copies.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
We only had two or three, and I had to go back and get 150 of them run off from the press.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
I had tried to make the needs of the committee. I'm a press.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Mr. Council, do you have any other questions?

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
The chair has met at this time, Senator McGillen.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I'm going to send this to my right. To my left.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
I said, well, shall we send this to the press?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
We can clear.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
I have only one question, and I will not be talking about the current situation here.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
The shirt is present. I was a private question, and I think it is not a fact that G-Day

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
and China wasn't signed before this or more of a certain basis on November, 1954.

18:06.000 --> 18:18.000
I see an entry in a form I recognize as a service record form with states of company A1299,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
ASU, reception station, board section, and journey.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
A sign from three November 1953 to 22 November 1953.

18:29.000 --> 18:36.000
So that it follows that the legend at the top of the first column, China.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
China, is that here? Is that correct?

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Yes, sir.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
It's in the collection.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
And I'm going to try to get it to the conference.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm telling you, Mr. General, I'm quite interested in this.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
I'm going to say that on this one shirt, which you admit was not for the information of anyone in the department,

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
not for the information with the committee, because all the testimony covering this could be presented all the way.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
You sign $200.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
The tax fair is money for publicity for the military.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
And I have to put out these only shirts.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
Now, who authorized the June colonel to spend $200.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
Any $200, men up to much, with spending billions, for the way that the June colonel is up to when they get to the billion.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Who authorized you to do this?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
$200 is a lot of money, sir.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And I recognize as well as you do.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
I have a certain general authority in the Pentagon working where I am in the handling of this case.

19:38.000 --> 19:47.000
And I felt that this was a need that was apparent from the testimony, from the exhibits that we had,

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
and the way the things have been going through the floor, and I authorized the expenditure on my own.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
Now, which more have you authorized, Colonel, for public relations or for the listening?

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
I can't say that I have ever authorized anything for public relations or for the listening, sir.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
How many public relations, information, and interviews, do you have working on this?

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
I have no public relations or information, men working on the niece, sir.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
How many, the Mr. Stevens, Mr. Adams, are going to connect with this?

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
The show is now available to me, man.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
I do not know, sir.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Do you know them, Eddie?

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
I presume there is a chief of information in the Pentagon who has a function, but I do not know,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
the technical scope of this case.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Let me ask you that.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
I have a manual available, so I think.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
You are back around in the case.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
I have a manual, but you are putting it so you can.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
In fact, I couldn't be learning to criticize about you as a soldier.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I think you are taking a wrap here today.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
There is a true criminal that this was not thought up by you,

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
but there are about upwards of 50 public living in research men, public relations,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
and so much in range.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
Working over the Pentagon every day on this sort of freedom, this was not your idea.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
In my case, I have concluded that I didn't design it up prepared.

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
On the second chart, the one that you did not point to, I asked you how a second chart prepared

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
is very much like the first one.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Could you get the first chart?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Isn't that it?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I thought the first one chart before.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
There was an earlier chart, yes, which I do not know where it is now.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
I do not know if it will be long for this.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
It may still be available, so I am not sure of that.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
We will check.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
Did you find out and bring it along the way?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Yes.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
If it is available, yes.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
I have concluded who made the criminalization to have a different symbol on the sign,

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
and it is from the other chart.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
I can only guess that a draftsman charged with a responsibility of how to put it in the

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
frame of the law.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
I tried to call Mr. Jones just towards the draftsman, and he is on active duty right now.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
He is up in New York somewhere.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I called his office at lunch time.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
I was told to be able to work while at the top of anyone else on such a point.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
But he can be made available with the committee request, am I?

22:34.000 --> 22:42.000
You may not think of worthwhile thoughts on the point of what I consider to a good defense.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
While you are ordering not you, but someone orders the inspector general to make an investigation

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
find out whether they shine, walk in front of a Jeep or behind a Jeep,

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
because if he shines shine down town or not, I would think this is rather important.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
Do you think you can find out who made the decision to put out the swanly chart?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Yes, the moment.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
To help?

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
I object to the use of the red folic chart.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I have no choice.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
The Jackson will be required in the record.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
I need to check if this model is not very well before the chart is rolled down here.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Which model, sir?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Did you still be sure to move through the world?

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
I believe Mr. Walsh saw them, yes, but I'm not sure that.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
He didn't just approve of them.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
I don't know if so whether he did or not.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
I think the point was, other way, is there's any question about it, Mr. Walsh?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Very busy man.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I only handle a few of those.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
The mind of jobs on this thing.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
How many people do Mr. Walsh never even told the over the Pentagon right now?

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
I am working as a military assistant, you might say.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
I have three other officers from the Judge Advocate General's car that assist me.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I think we have seen them all in here.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
I have a captain in the AG who keeps track of our records, stays back there.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
And I believe we have five semaphors.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
The right to my first fan, Pierre.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
We search for the police.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
The list of the men.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
That's men.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
No, I don't give any others anybody except the both of us.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
I understand, Mr. Chairman, could you give me some estimate?

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
The number of people who are working on this project, you say Mr. Walsh is very busy man.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
I wonder how many people are handling his work over the point.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
Well, I've listed the groups that are handling the work that's necessary for the case.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I must say that I don't want to emphasize my part.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Mr. Walsh prepares most of his own case himself.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
I don't think he understood the question.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
How many people are calling you in an audience?

24:53.000 --> 25:00.000

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
The typical authorized actions, since there's no attempt to make any phone calls,
