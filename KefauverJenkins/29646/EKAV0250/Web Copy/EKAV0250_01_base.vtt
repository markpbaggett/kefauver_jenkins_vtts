WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.420
I held a front-side print, man, that is extremely unusual for me to have a mini-aggressive

00:12.420 --> 00:13.420
relief booth.

00:13.420 --> 00:20.920
I may do it on a rare occasion, but part of my gnarly, I am to their custom and that's

00:20.920 --> 00:22.620
a front-side print, by now.

00:22.620 --> 00:23.620
I claim that to sound.

00:23.620 --> 00:31.940
If you look very much at the efforts of Mr. Adams, it's usually used by the release.

00:31.940 --> 00:40.300
As indicative of his state of mind, the width of the moment is used to pull out your investigation

00:40.300 --> 00:47.380
and continue your work at Fort Monmouth, particularly over the Army's efforts.

00:47.380 --> 00:56.220
If you regard that as a serious effort on this part, to prevail upon the veto, it's

00:56.220 --> 00:59.820
well absurd and the right to have any effect.

00:59.820 --> 01:09.300
Not only as not only is judging the exact concept of the proposed festering, but in the light

01:09.300 --> 01:10.940
of all that has gone on before.

01:10.940 --> 01:16.500
Your conversation with the secretary and Mr. Adams and the conversations between Mr. Adams

01:16.500 --> 01:23.500
particularly and Mr. Colman, in the light of all the other things he was saying, did

01:23.500 --> 01:29.500
you regard that as a serious effort on this part of the secretary's counselor to get

01:29.500 --> 01:32.100
you to continue your investigation at Fort Monmouth?

01:32.100 --> 01:34.860
You and Army have a different definition of seriousness.

01:34.860 --> 01:39.300
I would say not serious because I have paid no attention to it.

01:39.300 --> 01:44.140
He certainly was trying very hard and nothing just honorable about it, I don't think.

01:44.140 --> 01:52.900
He was trying very hard to get us to put in investigating the Army.

01:52.900 --> 01:57.740
He always indicated when he would do that, that they would do the job as we were doing.

01:57.740 --> 02:00.740
Senator, do you ever made the impurities upon Fort Monmouth?

02:00.740 --> 02:03.060
I'm on there about October 1, 1953.

02:03.060 --> 02:10.740
I think I met him up in Oregon during the Dewey Saffon-Tam-Can I believe.

02:10.740 --> 02:15.500
At this time I met him sometime somewhere in the West at a minute.

02:15.500 --> 02:22.740
I would ask you whether or not fire dogs over 19 or 20th and indeed all your see-a-case

02:22.740 --> 02:27.740
you hear first meetings are in the early meetings between you and Mr. Adams.

02:27.740 --> 02:31.740
He told me what his duty is worth.

02:31.740 --> 02:35.740
This has been a sign to him by the secretary of the arts.

02:35.740 --> 02:39.740
I don't think he told me Mr. Colman told me what Adams had told me.

02:39.740 --> 02:44.740
What does Mr. Colman tell you that Mr. Adams has told him?

02:44.740 --> 02:51.740
In a sense the most Adams was to be the contact man between the Committee on the Tanias.

02:51.740 --> 02:58.740
Was there ever anything you said to me about whether or not it was one of the specifics

02:58.740 --> 03:05.740
of Mr. Adams' assignment to some of my great people in the Department of Committee

03:05.740 --> 03:08.740
and get you away from Fort Monmouth?

03:08.740 --> 03:13.740
Not originally as we went along with Mr. Colman.

03:13.740 --> 03:18.740
The recount was to me very much conversation that he had with Mr. Adams.

03:18.740 --> 03:23.740
I think I can put Mr. Colman for a bit on this.

03:23.740 --> 03:27.740
This was a good job for him.

03:27.740 --> 03:36.740
We could make him look good if we would paper off these hearings and just some other investigations.

03:36.740 --> 03:38.740
Tell me about it.

03:38.740 --> 03:44.740
What happened on the 20th of October, Senator, when you did arrive at Momma?

03:44.740 --> 03:50.740
Secretary Steven's and I went through the installation of the documents there.

03:50.740 --> 03:56.740
Congressmen often swapped, I guess, up with the announcement.

03:56.740 --> 04:01.740
And Senator, I want to note specifically what happened on that date with respect to this proposed

04:01.740 --> 04:04.740
request release.

04:04.740 --> 04:09.740
Well, when we walked in the effort on the part of these respect to Mr. Adams

04:09.740 --> 04:13.740
to get you the quick forward moment that we needed for the Army.

04:13.740 --> 04:15.740
Yes, but we got to do that.

04:15.740 --> 04:24.740
One week in the end of the year, I found a fact of roughly expressed a full-time file

04:24.740 --> 04:29.740
inside the table and we understand it has been made me rough.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.740
Yes, it has been made me rough.

04:31.740 --> 04:35.740
John suggested we hand him out the press at the end of the...

04:35.740 --> 04:38.740
Did you think John had been gone out of it?

04:38.740 --> 04:49.740
I told him that I would attempt to pay everything complimentary I could.

04:50.740 --> 04:56.740
I would read over the press release and there were some things here about Steven's time

04:56.740 --> 05:03.740
to a good job at the time that I was glad to say those things, but I couldn't

05:03.740 --> 05:11.740
say we were calling off the press conference, but only once though that I would look silly

05:11.740 --> 05:14.740
and I would look very silly.

05:14.740 --> 05:23.740
I would hand out a million-graph release prepared by the military.

05:23.740 --> 05:34.740
Before lunch, I was going into what my hands had done came in also.

05:34.740 --> 05:37.740
I think Roy was there as I was told.

05:37.740 --> 05:44.740
He urged me to issue the press release, I told him I just couldn't do it, and I suggest

05:44.740 --> 05:50.740
it to him that they be destroyed because just some of them got on the hands of the press.

05:50.740 --> 05:57.740
It became known that I had given to the release as the office of the fight for monthly

05:58.740 --> 06:00.740
for the press representative.

06:00.740 --> 06:05.740
Not during the lunch, but when they were not allowed in the five-week days to

06:05.740 --> 06:07.740
regard it all again.

06:07.740 --> 06:11.740
What did the press say to the press release?

06:11.740 --> 06:16.740
Did you recall his words?

06:16.740 --> 06:23.740
No, I couldn't recall his words except for the...

06:23.740 --> 06:28.740
What extent was he insistent, Senator?

06:28.740 --> 06:33.740
Mr. Donna, you can have failed when you're being such a thing.

06:33.740 --> 06:36.740
He was... he tried to be convincing.

06:36.740 --> 06:44.740
He told him he thought that the hearings had served their purpose, that they would proceed

06:44.740 --> 06:49.740
now, that Washington had to learn it to be given orders.

06:49.740 --> 06:54.740
He mentioned also that prior to our investigation demanding officers

06:54.740 --> 07:01.740
should not suspend individuals to fight for communism, that has been changed, that they could

07:01.740 --> 07:09.740
now, and suggest that if we not fall off the hearings, at least we take a 60 or 90-day

07:09.740 --> 07:14.740
vacation, I forget that, he said, and let them draw about it.

07:14.740 --> 07:21.740
There was nothing vicious at all, and it was just the attempt to convince the

07:21.740 --> 07:27.740
hearings to not be convinced.

07:27.740 --> 07:35.740
Between October 20th and November 13th, the day of the second day is really...

07:35.740 --> 07:40.740
Were there any of them start conversations, some of them are that you know about,

07:40.740 --> 07:47.740
the year of your own knowledge, or those other conversations with members of the staff.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.740
But with him and us today, it's the end of the day.

07:49.740 --> 07:55.740
October 20th is Port Mama, November 13th is the date of the actual date of the 60th

07:55.740 --> 07:58.740
practically.

07:58.740 --> 08:00.740
The age of 723 days.

08:00.740 --> 08:04.740
Yes, there was a meeting on November 6th.

08:04.740 --> 08:08.740
That's the meeting at the Pentagon, as we understand.

08:08.740 --> 08:16.740
That's the only thing that I can think of now, and on November 13th, there was the...

08:16.740 --> 08:20.740
November 6th, Senator, now I believe we fully explored the events to that occasion.

08:20.740 --> 08:21.740
Have we not?

08:21.740 --> 08:22.740
I think we have.

08:22.740 --> 08:28.740
This time you say that a suggestion has made me both disagree with Mr. Adams.

08:28.740 --> 08:33.740
That's some investigation being made of the Navy and the Air Force.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.740
Senator, before we leave now, I think...

08:35.740 --> 08:38.740
I'm perhaps just telling you this, Mr. Jenkins.

08:38.740 --> 08:42.740
People, I think you explain the monitor's phone calls.

08:42.740 --> 08:51.740
I told the secretary that we would not call off any investigation where we knew communists were in existence.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.740
I told him we were keeping fully informed of Mr. Adams, giving him coffee to the front desk.

08:56.740 --> 09:00.740
I did tell him that, by telling that we were of that time,

09:00.740 --> 09:06.740
conducting a very intense investigation of communists in the defense plants

09:06.740 --> 09:10.740
that we can better that of great importance.

09:10.740 --> 09:20.740
I told him that I could be no objection if he thought it would take the spotlight off him and off the Army

09:20.740 --> 09:27.740
that we would hold the hearings concurrently because we were all put to hold hearings on defense plants anyway.

09:28.740 --> 09:33.740
And that seems to me to have his approval, he thought that by...

09:33.740 --> 09:38.740
And I think somebody mentioned that the Navy was really, really good.

09:38.740 --> 09:41.740
The Secretary, the Secretary, Adam, were both, both, both, my gatherer.

09:41.740 --> 09:45.740
What does this investigation have to do with you when you made that to get to you?

09:45.740 --> 09:46.740
Or that case?

09:46.740 --> 09:53.740
I couldn't recall the exact words, but they seem to feel that next to calling off the hearings

09:53.740 --> 09:55.740
that would help to take the spotlight off them.

09:55.740 --> 10:00.740
One of them, I think it was Mr. Adams who mentioned that the Navy,

10:00.740 --> 10:05.740
he thought was responsible for security in some of the defense plants that were going into.

10:05.740 --> 10:16.740
At that time, Mr. Cohen asked Mr. Cohen to give a complete rundown of the propos hearings the evidence we had.

10:16.740 --> 10:22.740
He did that again after Matt Ritzway, Mr. Chuitt.

10:22.740 --> 10:29.740
And General Bush, and General Mudgeck, General Mudgeck, he went to the room.

10:29.740 --> 10:33.740
Roy again gave a rundown of what we had.

10:33.740 --> 10:37.740
And I may say, Mr. Duncan Dutt, I mean, no question about this.

10:37.740 --> 10:42.740
I emphasize very, very clearly to Mr. Adams and Mr. Stevenson,

10:42.740 --> 10:48.740
that it would be a waste of time for them to ask us to call off any hearing of communist.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.740
I told him and I recall my language.

10:51.740 --> 11:02.740
I said that I campaigned against members of the Office of Party because I felt they fight for things during proper and their party.

11:02.740 --> 11:07.740
And I said, that is an effect what you're asking me to do now, and I just can't do it.

11:07.740 --> 11:10.740
I won't do it, but the waste of time is a scuttle.

11:10.740 --> 11:13.740
I wasn't in much discussion after that.

11:13.740 --> 11:22.740
Was that statement you have just related meetings, applicants, the basic questions that you write to the persons in different countries during the Army?

11:22.740 --> 11:24.740
Are you in the Navy or are you calling?

11:24.740 --> 11:27.740
They didn't suggest I'd wrap it from Brussels and it's a conflant.

11:27.740 --> 11:36.740
I informed them about that hearing and told them that the hearing was wrong, that the goal,

11:36.740 --> 11:44.740
and that it would not, in any way, damage either hearing if we held the hearing concurrently,

11:44.740 --> 11:58.740
and that might take the spotlight off Steven's and the Army, and they indicated that as long as they could not just be hearing of the coming of the Army called off,

11:58.740 --> 12:03.740
that was out of fact, and that's indicated by the monitored phone call.

12:03.740 --> 12:11.740
You'll notice the next morning when I called Mr. Steven's, but were you satisfied with the arrangement we worked out just for the five or somethings out of fact?

12:11.740 --> 12:18.740
As soon as you say that, a bad meeting is suggest he was made, as he rises in Navy and the Air Force.

12:18.740 --> 12:19.740
Is that right?

12:19.740 --> 12:20.740
That is correct.

12:20.740 --> 12:27.740
Did you recall either you are a member of your staff stating that you had no evidence of communists or subverses?

12:27.740 --> 12:34.740
In either of those two parties of the military, Mr. Corn made that statement.

12:34.740 --> 12:43.740
In consequence of Mr. Corn's statement, that they had no evidence of communists or subverses in the Navy or Air Force,

12:43.740 --> 12:47.740
what has anything to do with the six-day Army Saddam State?

12:47.740 --> 12:56.740
Again, don't expect me to remember the exact language, but something to the effect that if there was infiltration in the Army,

12:56.740 --> 13:07.740
there certainly was in the other branches, and I think Adam said to you there was a lot of search in the Navy also.

13:07.740 --> 13:11.740
You recall whether or not you were a very tall.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.740
I am not sure about this.

13:14.740 --> 13:22.740
I recall, I think he said something about giving Roy information about certain naval instruments.

13:22.740 --> 13:27.740
I didn't recall definitely the statement that if there was infiltration in the Army,

13:27.740 --> 13:31.740
in the other branches, and I think there was much search there as in the Army,

13:31.740 --> 13:34.740
we could not come to the Federal Army.

13:35.740 --> 13:42.740
As I say, Roy told them that we had nothing but a justified investigation

13:42.740 --> 13:49.740
besides the long, weary, mon-many investigators to get an investigation of the point of public hearing.

13:49.740 --> 13:56.740
I said to her, I excuse this fine to tell the members of this testimony about a certain press release

13:56.740 --> 13:59.740
teaching for the security of the Army on November 13th.

13:59.740 --> 14:05.740
It was not a press release, it was a press conference.

14:05.740 --> 14:11.740
In that conference, while I came to looking for a blame,

14:11.740 --> 14:18.740
the interpretation was that he said that there was no espionage at Fort Mamma.

14:18.740 --> 14:24.740
When in Wade, did you first learn of that type of ability, said no espionage at Fort Mamma?

14:24.740 --> 14:33.740
I believe it is a New York, I picked up one of the New York papers.

14:33.740 --> 14:45.740
What happened is the result of that first conference, in which he immediately spoke to such days saying that there was no current espionage at Fort Mamma.

14:45.740 --> 14:51.740
I think he said there was no espionage, no espionage at Fort Mamma.

14:51.740 --> 14:55.740
My chief counsel told me that he thinks I was not in New York,

14:55.740 --> 15:00.740
that I was up some way from New England for the Boston.

15:00.740 --> 15:03.740
But we're not doing a speech of a man.

15:03.740 --> 15:04.740
Very well.

15:04.740 --> 15:07.740
Of a banger's man, I'd like to say.

15:07.740 --> 15:14.740
Now as we understand the cemetery, the issue, so that's the holding of that press conference,

15:14.740 --> 15:17.740
I started a change of events in motion.

15:17.740 --> 15:22.740
That might be relevant to the issues of this controversy.

15:22.740 --> 15:25.740
And I want you to tell what occurred.

15:25.740 --> 15:28.740
I wouldn't say that's the thing that he's saying of his death.

15:28.740 --> 15:33.740
But half of Mr. Dillon's been moved to New York.

15:33.740 --> 15:43.740
He told me that he had been holding his press conference under at least a 265 press of brass.

15:43.740 --> 15:48.740
He said that if you read the entire transcript of the press conference,

15:48.740 --> 15:57.740
all the press of the mantras, that it was not the computer to pack upon the committee.

15:57.740 --> 16:04.740
But he said that certain press members were picked out of context,

16:04.740 --> 16:10.740
and he felt an unfair picture of the conference was created.

16:11.740 --> 16:13.740
He said that the...

16:13.740 --> 16:15.740
And I can recall he's lying with him.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.740
He said that of course, when they asked me for their number,

16:18.740 --> 16:22.740
if that's been our report, the month, if I said yes,

16:22.740 --> 16:28.740
so the next person was me, well, why don't you have the Attorney General's prosecutor?

16:28.740 --> 16:31.740
He said, I know what the situation is up there.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.740
I know what the danger situation is up there.

16:33.740 --> 16:37.740
I haven't following it.

16:38.740 --> 16:43.740
We went over to the merchant's father, I believe, and had run.

16:43.740 --> 16:57.740
After that Mr. Dillon made a statement of the press in substance that was what he meant to play was that the Army had developed no evidence of...

16:57.740 --> 17:01.740
And I think you had the words, that's been odd.

17:01.740 --> 17:07.740
I think for the committee, on what or not, it hasn't developed.

17:07.740 --> 17:11.740
Is that the November 17th, lunch in New York Senator?

17:11.740 --> 17:17.740
That was the November 17th, yes.

17:17.740 --> 17:21.740
Well, it did the Secretary's case, certainly to some extent,

17:21.740 --> 17:27.740
the context of the two press releases or conferences.

17:27.740 --> 17:35.740
Well, Mr. Duncan's story was saying, I think the Secretary tried to face the impeachment both times.

17:35.740 --> 17:38.740
He's even minding what the Secretary of the Army is.

17:38.740 --> 17:56.740
A new man, not used to watching the press for a fun, not used to watching the politics, not aware of the fact, I think, that certain for a fun would try and needle him into a safe, un-precipiting truth.

17:56.740 --> 18:04.740
As a fight between the Secretary of the Army and the MacriZay Committee, because up to that point we're having perfect cooperation.

18:04.740 --> 18:06.740
I don't think it was the case of him.

18:06.740 --> 18:11.740
Changing what he meant to play, the stories of the period were different yet.

18:11.740 --> 18:16.740
And up to that time, was the relation between you and the Secretary of the Army and the Sad and the Spethans?

18:16.740 --> 18:18.740
Very pleasant.

18:18.740 --> 18:23.740
Where did you go from New York on November 17th?

18:23.740 --> 18:25.740
Fort Cornwall.

18:25.740 --> 18:29.740
Fort Cornwall. Fort Six. Fort Six. Fort Six.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.740
I bleed by flame.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.740
By flame.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.740
Who was in that party?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.740
Senator?

18:37.740 --> 18:42.740
Let's see, there was the Secretary. There was Mr. Adam, I believe.

18:42.740 --> 18:47.740
There was Mr. Cohn. Mr. Charles.

18:47.740 --> 18:51.740
I was alone.

18:51.740 --> 18:54.740
I was in the court doing Juliana.

18:54.740 --> 18:57.740
I was alone.

18:57.740 --> 18:59.740
Mr. Cohn, what time was it?

18:59.740 --> 19:03.740
The demo was not long.

19:03.740 --> 19:06.740
I think that's all.

19:06.740 --> 19:12.740
Did you recall whether or not the shine was the air for you when that plane landed?

19:13.740 --> 19:15.740
He was.

19:15.740 --> 19:22.740
As soon as you tell the members of this touchamiri what you know about a photograph being taken on that occasion,

19:22.740 --> 19:25.740
in which photograph?

19:25.740 --> 19:29.740
The specter, the shine?

19:29.740 --> 19:32.740
I believe they Colonel Bradley.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.740
Am I right about that?

19:34.740 --> 19:35.740
Yes.

19:35.740 --> 19:36.740
Perhaps the Maria.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.740
What do you know about that photograph?

19:38.740 --> 19:42.740
Certainly. I do think it was such a photograph taken.

19:42.740 --> 19:48.740
The thing that impressed me was that the landing officer held a post-well in photograph to be taken.

19:48.740 --> 19:50.740
And who was the commanding officer?

19:50.740 --> 19:52.740
I don't think so.

19:52.740 --> 19:57.740
I asked who was pulling the coast of the country to the commanding officer.

19:57.740 --> 20:01.740
Bradley, I believe, was the commanding officer of the area but wasn't Bradley a helicopter.

20:01.740 --> 20:07.740
They shine of course, because they're in a private, in the Army and the State of the Fort Decks.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.740
I didn't mean inducted on the third day of November.

20:09.740 --> 20:11.740
Let me give you the back on this Saturday afternoon.

20:11.740 --> 20:16.740
I've got a couple of foot along these panes and the Colonel wasn't an only foot.

20:22.740 --> 20:26.740
All right, now in any event as I say, I was sort of impressed.

20:26.740 --> 20:35.740
Not impressed, I was immune to find the Colonel holding a private foot that isn't the way we did things in the Marine Corps.

20:37.740 --> 20:42.740
The Secretary was in a hurry.

20:42.740 --> 20:48.740
There were photographers there and the Secretary said James is going over here.

20:48.740 --> 20:52.740
I'm not sure what they called Bradley overall, so we're not aware what Bradley was standing there.

20:52.740 --> 20:57.740
And the picture was taken.

20:57.740 --> 21:00.740
And the picture was taken. I believe there are a number of pictures taken.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.740
They pulled for a number of pictures.

21:02.740 --> 21:09.740
And the Secretary was kind enough to let us have these planes come back to Washington.

21:09.740 --> 21:11.740
Or go to New York next.

21:11.740 --> 21:16.740
I think we're going to Boston. We're hearing next morning and he's okay.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.740
More planes like to watch.

21:19.740 --> 21:22.740
Did you see this photograph taken from it?

21:22.740 --> 21:28.740
Yeah. You say the Secretary of the Army said today, shine.

21:28.740 --> 21:30.740
Today, it's come over here.

21:30.740 --> 21:32.740
It's something that affects you the day from over here.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.740
The day that I want a picture or a camear day or something like that.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.740
And exactly the photograph was taken.

21:37.740 --> 21:40.740
Yeah, the way they pulled it was beside the point.

21:40.740 --> 21:44.740
And the pictures were taken. There were a number of them taken.

21:44.740 --> 21:46.740
Where there are a number of other people there.

21:46.740 --> 21:51.740
And it's you besides the members of your party who had flown down in that plane.

21:52.740 --> 22:02.740
General Ryan was there. There were over half a dozen or a dozen enlisted men.

22:02.740 --> 22:05.740
There was another Colonel.

22:05.740 --> 22:10.740
I think there were several officers. There was a captain who my met.

22:10.740 --> 22:14.740
They made a little press on me. I know.

22:14.740 --> 22:17.740
I met a number of officers at the time.

22:17.740 --> 22:22.740
You know why this 60-case single day shine out on them.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.740
They have been affected a bit.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.740
They have come over here.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.740
Yes. How are they taking you to that photograph?

22:28.740 --> 22:31.740
I want the photograph to be taken.

22:31.740 --> 22:33.740
Oh, no. What's up?

22:33.740 --> 22:36.740
I think the Secretary of the Good Manatured in the Vagoon.

22:36.740 --> 22:39.740
And perhaps only they have still good. I don't know.

22:39.740 --> 22:41.740
To put an event for a pilot, you know,

22:41.740 --> 22:45.740
you've got to be taken between the commanding officer of the entire area

22:45.740 --> 22:48.740
on the structure of the army.

22:48.740 --> 22:52.740
And I know they have considered to push me down.

22:52.740 --> 22:57.740
That is their Wendy G. Hoe, your first open gerry.

22:57.740 --> 22:59.740
On the...

22:59.740 --> 23:03.740
How communist is the Burthings of Fort Mapa?

23:03.740 --> 23:06.740
Again, I've got to consult my notes. You got the exact date.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.740
Does November...

23:07.740 --> 23:09.740
I see whether or not it's November 24th.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.740
November...

23:11.740 --> 23:13.740
November 24th, right.

23:13.740 --> 23:16.740
Where were those things, Hale?

23:16.740 --> 23:20.740
Uh, uh, man, I make it clear, uh, Mr. Duncan,

23:20.740 --> 23:26.740
that we held hearings on the signal for the point of number 24

23:26.740 --> 23:29.740
and Fort Monmouth is merely a part of the thing.

23:29.740 --> 23:31.740
They were.

23:31.740 --> 23:35.740
But did you have an open gerry on November 24th?

23:35.740 --> 23:40.740
On November 24th, we had an open hearing on Fort Monmouth.

23:40.740 --> 23:42.740
Where was that Hale?

23:42.740 --> 23:44.740
That was Hale in New York City.

23:44.740 --> 23:47.740
You look all whether or not Mr. Adams was present

23:47.740 --> 23:51.740
at that open gerry.

23:51.740 --> 23:53.740
I am reasonably certain he was.

23:53.740 --> 23:57.740
He called whether or not the security of the army was present.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.740
No, the secretary was not present at that time.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.740
I think Mr. Adams came in the afternoon,

24:02.740 --> 24:04.740
general Washington, as I recall, was present.

24:04.740 --> 24:06.740
Then there I want you to fill,

24:06.740 --> 24:08.740
remember, the Committee of Weller or Not, Mr. Adams,

24:08.740 --> 24:11.740
on that date, and at that place,

24:11.740 --> 24:16.740
I did accommodations with you with respect to General Loppon.

24:16.740 --> 24:18.740
And any plans, particularly,

24:18.740 --> 24:24.740
that the secretary of the army had made with you with respect to General Loppon.

24:24.740 --> 24:28.740
So we took my date straight again when you do the hold hearings every day

24:28.740 --> 24:32.740
and it's right to me that they would happen on November 24th in New York.

24:32.740 --> 24:35.740
Is that the date of the law?

24:41.740 --> 24:46.740
What did you want?

24:46.740 --> 24:49.740
Man, it's a fact that you and Loppon first had a time.

24:49.740 --> 24:50.740
That would be confirmed.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.740
While the second is going on, I'm up to turn to our studio to cut the call.

24:53.740 --> 24:54.740
Loppon, that's the time.

24:54.740 --> 25:00.740
This was the meeting about a week after Loppon, that's the time.

25:00.740 --> 25:02.740
Oh, yeah.

25:02.740 --> 25:04.740
Loppon, that's why I'm not sober now.

25:04.740 --> 25:10.740
I'm just trying to get my date straight here, Mr. Jenkins.

25:10.740 --> 25:18.740
This is a date to my council tell us when we wrote the Green Wild custom on either the custom

25:18.740 --> 25:22.740
and the taken down of the federal kind of entry at Louisburg.

25:22.740 --> 25:25.740
I know that I'm on that date.

25:25.740 --> 25:38.740
Mr. Adams discussed in considerable detail the possibility of relieving General Loppon.

25:38.740 --> 25:41.740
Now, I said as a matter of fact, he's a member of the committee,

25:41.740 --> 25:45.740
regard that as a very important event.

25:45.740 --> 25:51.740
And I'm going to ask him in surprise, you possibly can, to relate in detail.

25:51.740 --> 25:58.740
What does that conversation was, and particularly what Mr. Adams said about the relieving of General Loppon?

25:58.740 --> 26:02.740
And why such a plan had been formulated?

26:02.740 --> 26:06.740
Mr. Adams told me there were thinking of relieving him.

26:06.740 --> 26:13.740
The reason he gave was not for the extra operative of the committee, he didn't give us that reason.

26:13.740 --> 26:24.740
He told us that Mr. Loppon had told some of the officers, I don't think he was set up a staff meeting that most of the

26:24.740 --> 26:29.740
communists that were digging out came from certain universities.

26:29.740 --> 26:33.740
I pointed out to Mr. Adams, I thought that was rather funny,

26:33.740 --> 26:43.740
that he didn't relieve an awful service because he pointed out the shoe background of communists.

26:43.740 --> 26:46.740
But what did you think?

26:46.740 --> 26:50.740
I got to know that I told him that they were leaving him because he was cooperating with us.

26:50.740 --> 26:53.740
Because he was cooperating with you at the least.

26:53.740 --> 26:55.740
That's right. What was Mr. Adams' reply at all?

26:55.740 --> 26:59.740
I want the full conversation to the conversation to get it, we can possibly get it.

26:59.740 --> 27:02.740
He didn't either. He said that I'm nothing to do with it.

27:02.740 --> 27:06.740
He's got the first time that he's been a Mr. Adams, that there was a script.

27:06.740 --> 27:08.740
General Loppon with you?

27:08.740 --> 27:13.740
I used to find relieving him of his command was concerned.

27:13.740 --> 27:17.740
I believe on me.

27:21.740 --> 27:26.740
I think that was the first time...

27:27.740 --> 27:30.740
Yes, my name is Mr. President, that was the first time.

27:30.740 --> 27:34.740
What do you think you said on the occasion of particularly the Inspector General Loppon's tenure?

27:34.740 --> 27:37.740
That was about all of the...

27:37.740 --> 27:44.740
One or no huts to use my reaction to be if Loppon were removed since a different post.

27:45.740 --> 27:52.740
Do you know why they were asking you what your reaction would be if General Loppon were removed from his post?

27:53.740 --> 28:02.740
I think they knew me very strongly that there should not be any reprisal taken against any witnesses who testified before our committee.

28:02.740 --> 28:06.740
What had been General Loppon's attitude up to that time?

28:06.740 --> 28:13.740
And subsequent I have to with respect to cooperating with your committee in the bigot of subverting our coming years in the Army.

28:14.740 --> 28:20.740
Originally, I think the first script, the investigators made support from onward.

28:20.740 --> 28:26.740
He refused to give them very much information.

28:26.740 --> 28:31.740
Then Secretary Steven's call, General Loppon, why?

28:31.740 --> 28:34.740
On unordered apparently.

28:34.740 --> 28:49.740
When General or Secretary Steven's call, and that time onwards, Loppon's cooperation was full from complete 100%.

28:49.740 --> 28:57.740
Senator, you say that's about all as far as you can recall with Mr. Adam, said on 24th of November.

28:57.740 --> 29:08.740
Unless you weather in not on the 25th of November, Mr. Adam calls you long distance from Washington with respect to General Loppon.

29:08.740 --> 29:11.740
I don't think he told me long distance.

29:11.740 --> 29:15.740
I believe Mr. Adam was in New York at that time.

29:15.740 --> 29:22.740
He called me, again, don't time me down to date, but I think it was the 25th.

29:22.740 --> 29:25.740
He called, regard to Loppon.

29:25.740 --> 29:28.740
The conversation was essentially the same.

29:28.740 --> 29:31.740
What did he say in that telephone call, Senator?

29:31.740 --> 29:37.740
Well, again, just about what he said the day before, that they felt they had to remove Loppon.

29:37.740 --> 29:44.740
That it was affecting the morale he said because Loppon had made these statements about becoming,

29:44.740 --> 29:54.740
outcoming from certain universities, and wanting to know what I would do, if they did not have to break law.

29:54.740 --> 30:02.740
Well, certainly he certainly had nothing to do with a promotion or demotion of Senator Loppon.

30:02.740 --> 30:07.740
Now personally, I think that he didn't get a promotion because he worked with the committee.

30:07.740 --> 30:10.740
Did he, in fact, fail to get a promotion?

30:10.740 --> 30:12.740
That's right.

30:12.740 --> 30:23.740
Did you see the senator that certain repiles who were being taken against the general on account of his cooperation with your committee without trust?

30:23.740 --> 30:26.740
Did you talk to Mr. Adam?

30:26.740 --> 30:27.740
I did.

30:27.740 --> 30:33.740
Did you ever talk to the secretary on this subject that we're now disprepping?

30:33.740 --> 30:39.740
I talked to the secretary about this.

30:40.740 --> 30:45.740
Over in the Carol arms, at one time I don't recall the day.

30:45.740 --> 30:54.740
I've been here for a fortestified and it has, here to for, been put in the records that General Loppon was not promoted,

30:54.740 --> 30:57.740
and not given a permanent rank.

30:57.740 --> 31:00.740
That's right, he was passed over.

31:00.740 --> 31:10.740
And failing to get a permanent rank as we understand it, an officer, failed in the army some two three years later,

31:10.740 --> 31:13.740
then those ones who have given a permanent rank.
