00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Senator Jackson, I'm sure that's one of the basic issues that the committee is going

00:07.440 --> 00:08.440
to have to decide.

00:08.440 --> 00:14.000
In my opinion, special and popular pressures were definitely used as a plus-the-five at

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
length.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Well, then your opinion is that statement to our staff.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Which would you probably re-declose?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Thank you.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
This is from the US News and World Report.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
A statement by Roy Paul continually issued of March 1954.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
This year, this is the poll.

00:34.000 --> 00:45.000
No improper inflow was ever exerted by me on anyone else on behalf of Sean.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
The next poll.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Next question.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
Mr. Paul is fully on me to tell.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
On March 14th, I was sitting in an answer to Mr. Larry C. Back and I called.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
As I said, Mr. C. Back, we did not ask for special treatment for him.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
And the poll.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Is that statement true or false?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Next question.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
He went on to say, Mr. Cone again.

01:21.000 --> 01:37.000
Mr. Cone went on to say, and I told throughout the pattern, throughout the pattern,

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
what we wanted and everybody wanted and I wanted what was coming to him.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Nothing more and nothing less.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
And I do not believe that I or anybody else on the committee use any kind of pressure to

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
get the Army to bring Mr. Paul.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
End of quote, this is from me to press.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Is that statement in your opinion true or false?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Would you mind reading it again, Senator?

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
The first pick that could be the quote referred to in the previous.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
He went on to say, This was from me to press and I now quote.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
Throughout the pattern, was, We wanted and everybody wanted and I wanted

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
what was coming to him.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Nothing more and nothing less.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
And I do not believe that I or anybody else on the committee use any kind of pressure to

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
get the Army to bring Mr. Paul.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
That was referring to the previous quote of thought.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Let me go back and it may be helpful.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
Do you answer this question in reference to a quotation by Mr. Coln on me to press and

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
respond to a question on the bill.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
See that I said, I quote, as I said Mr. Steve, we did not ask for special treatment for him.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
And the quote, then he went on to say Mr. Coln went on to say throughout the pattern,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
was we wanted and everybody wanted and I wanted what was coming to him.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Nothing more and nothing less.

03:07.000 --> 03:16.000
And I do not believe that I or anybody else on the committee use any kind of pressure to get the Army to bring Mr. Paul.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Is that statement in your opinion true or false?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
That's kind of unusual language there.

03:24.000 --> 03:36.000
And while I is the direct persuading post in response to our question, what's my Mr. Steve back to Mr. Coln on the program entitled

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Meet the Press March 14 of this year?

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
So if I understand it, if it had just to whether or not any pressure used so far as shyness and

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
ferns and my answer, yes, it was much better used.

03:56.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, Mr. Secretary, it is alleged in the memorandum from Frank Karr to setting the matriety dated two long

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
forward. And this was released to the press.

04:10.000 --> 04:21.000
That and I told Mr. Steven stated that he meant two long forward.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Did you find that?

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I mean, I'm sure every time.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
And the power.

04:32.000 --> 04:55.000
Mr. Secretary, I've been justified that you were the virus of having the hearing discontinued at 12 months and that the Army would investigate and make periodic reports with the media.

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
Now, I wonder if you would tell the committee just how the Army worked structured.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
You and the Army have investigated the social approaches that might be in the Army.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
Is that done by your Dean Chum sections?

05:18.000 --> 05:28.000
One of the agencies within the Army that was the act of the Nazi-TV counterintelligence call of our G2 or intelligence division.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Now, do you have a Larry board?

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Well, one of the key streets of Larry Boe.

05:40.000 --> 05:54.000
Now, the reason I'm asking these questions, the fact that I have been concerned over the great delay that has taken place in the pyat I'm thinking now of the major 12 case.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.000
In the Army, before the Army took in the act, and I'm wondering if you can tell the committee what the plan is.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
But I'm in debt.

06:05.000 --> 06:12.000
For the Army, you will need a security work done beyond the.

06:12.000 --> 06:23.000
Well, I think that I stated yesterday that in a case of suspension, that the commanding officer of the installation of the Army,

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
can recommend that suspension and give these reasons.

06:30.000 --> 06:40.000
That is considered then by the Army headquarters of the area in which he's located.

06:41.000 --> 06:51.000
And then, having been, I'm going through the Army of the area of headquarters.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
It would then come through the screening board in Washington to a screening board of the Department of Army.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Do you have a board of office groups?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
No.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
The board of the civilians.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
No, it is.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm involved by my, he is a sometimes a part of military personnel, but usually civilians.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
And then the board is a board here, the final state.

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
Well, that's being board of the tournament, whether or not the person is supposed to be suspended.

07:30.000 --> 07:44.000
And then, if it is so determined as to resolve the process which I've just outlined, then that person will be suspended from the installation of the field, whether it may be for a moment or otherwise.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
And the next thing is that charges must be prepared within 30 days.

07:52.000 --> 08:04.000
And after that, the person of that case can ask for a hearing which is held in the Army area in which the installation is located.

08:04.000 --> 08:21.000
In the case of an Army person suspended, that hearing board would be split out of maybe and therefore personnel from the same general area that is from the first Army area in New York.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
But not Army person, not Army person now.

08:26.000 --> 08:41.000
Before I was, what could be either a military or civilian personnel, although I think that the collectivities, the two out of the three must be civilians.

08:41.000 --> 08:56.000
Mr. Secretary, if you think that I was major, well, and I had a man and my command, because I had evidence that this person was a member of the Communist Party.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
Now, a common would have taken for a reason to get rid of that man on the mile.

09:03.000 --> 09:16.000
I think it would be possible to do it in a matter of hours if it was just bad case that you outlined, standard of product, although that would not be a normal, of course, prevent.

09:16.000 --> 09:29.000
Well, assuming the case was with many of you who had certain thank you all, evidence would be believed to be true.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
If you are not, there might be evidence that wouldn't pull up and pull.

09:33.000 --> 09:44.000
But evidence would simply be true and probably be how long would it take to bring it, what he would do with the cut of the years, how long would he.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
I would like to have the report of the mine to be the last person on the farm.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm trying to force the process of my duty to my family.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You do have the report of the mine?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm not.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Please, can you stand aside?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
I want the press tonight.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I want the press tonight.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
How long would it take?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Well, I think you're man and all.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
You could give that a man and worry either with different kinds of evidence.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
That's a few of them.

10:13.000 --> 10:23.000
Well, of course, part of the pilot that would depend on a particular case and the evidence that was available, if it was a clean cut case,

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
there's suddenly a show about, there's always one.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
The command there is used to the installation, shouldn't be out of town.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
The first time he had reported, and the first time he had reported, and the first time he had reported,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm sure the whole time, he had a report of the real bad case.

10:41.000 --> 10:49.000
But if this was a case in which we didn't know, we had some derogatory information perhaps in the mail.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
A certain amount of investigation would be required in order to determine what, if any substance there was, to the allegations.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
No charge on investigations, you have to.

11:03.000 --> 11:18.000
But you have, anyway, by which a command welcome contact, your office directly, either you was Secretary of Army or one of the civilians staff members of your office.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
And of course, I have a situation in mind, which is not good.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
Now can, can, can actually be taking a lot of going through the entirety of the command?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
It could be, and then emergency, please, let me tell you.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
You have, you have anyone on your staff who was charged with actually a responsibility?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Well, it's just in two percent.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Two is charged with that responsibility.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
I mean, it's the biggest.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
No, that's not supposed to.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
That's military.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
So, don't you believe that some may change that the two-poil crisis?

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Yes, that would excel I think the great.

11:59.000 --> 12:12.000
If the two commanders could contact the Secretary of Office directly and have somebody in their office, we're talking, for moving quickly on cases of this time.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, I think we have the mechanism in the machinery, some of the power and all of these things will become, as they come out.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Now, I, I personally wasn't thinking of it enough as they are.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
I have what might be the problem of an assistant secretary of the Army for intelligence or security.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I wouldn't think that was necessary.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
I think that we can, I can work with that through the chief of staff, through the military intelligence and innovation.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
How did chief of staff, which is the chief of G2 relations?

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
Well, that's not even why I thought that should have to be difficult.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I don't know what to say.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
That's your timing.

12:55.000 --> 13:07.000
The Secretary, the history of January 13th, 14th of the first Army report, the lead secretary, Mr. Colman, who was the heir to the Army,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
and he was roughly Army.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Now, you can see that Stephen was schooled as Secretary of the Army.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
My first question is, did Mr. Adams tell you of this incident at that time?

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Yes, sir.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
What will Mr. Shine do to you?

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
And is pre-industrial training in New York, the November 4th, the November 10th?

13:34.000 --> 13:46.000
I would say that was that he was available for many purposes, so in that particular week's plan, and of course I don't know exactly what he did.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
Do you know that the other case is in this type of special arrangement doing a pre-industrial training period?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
No, sir.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I don't.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
Did you see, although I will tell you this, Senator Thomson?

14:01.000 --> 14:14.000
I don't know my own own personal knowledge because I've never come in contact with a case, but I think there are instances of where, in the danger of what's from the victimized to the military,

14:14.000 --> 14:25.000
although a person might have responsible to his family or a business, that there are cases where they have to in some adjustments during that pre-industrial training period.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
But if you didn't know of the durainment of Mr. Secretary, do you know who made them?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I know that, but I knew about him.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Did you make them?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes, sir.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
I had a fantastic day, I told you instruction for them to be made.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
What were those durainments?

14:44.000 --> 14:54.000
Well, they were arrangements for us, but whenever Shine was in touch, he was to be a time to be first-timing,

14:54.000 --> 15:07.000
and then he was to be put in the arms of the army, and he was to be put in the arms of the army, and he was to be signed off for two weeks during the pre-industrial training period,

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
in order to be affordable for a committee member, and I gave instructions for those who were ranked.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
Did he have to work for an inferiority or an inferiority?

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
I know he must have before, the first role, whether he was before or before, or whether or not I don't actually know.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I'd find out for him.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
Did you provide us the details of that arrangement that the military directed the officer?

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
Now in Secretary, did you see the first army were before the decision?

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
The first time, for a four-year one is today in March.

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
The original report, the chronology of events, is your part, sir.

15:51.000 --> 15:59.000
The allegations that the four are chiefly against Mr. Colm, the relatively minor mention of Senator McCartney.

15:59.000 --> 16:08.000
Did you ever feel that the perpetrator herein was the contract center of the party, and state-fooling that Mr. Colm's been acting in favor of him,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
and that some actions could be taken by him or his committee?

16:12.000 --> 16:19.000
I asked that question particularly after reading the letter, Senator McCartney sent you a December 20th.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
Well, of course the fact is that Senator McCartney, who is brought these things up on a case of himself,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
is the fact that he's brought to us two days.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
You mean after the letter was written?

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
Yes, on a brief one occasion, I asked the letter with Britain.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
Now, Mr. Colm, it was really an employee of one of many bank committees.

16:47.000 --> 16:55.000
Wouldn't it have been better by personal contract to file a remedy to the situation rather than issue the report that is

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
got in the place now and it was really responsible for these hearings?

17:01.000 --> 17:11.000
Well, I think a situation just developed better to find from that work to upon acts,

17:11.000 --> 17:24.000
because the interest that was generated by the about sign being an inductee that worked with him.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
The fact that he was away from the post on a number of occasions,

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
special tasks that became a matter of common knowledge and public knowledge.

17:37.000 --> 17:45.000
So the interest generally is in a blood to the inquiry we had from the Congress, members of the Congress,

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
and we will require to answer some specific questions and we do it.

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
What were the arrangements that Mr. Scharn had as a candidate?

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
The arrangements that I can't get to was, but Scharn was to be made available.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
It was going to be open.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
She was not in a blood case, but was taken under granted.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
The last take it off by time.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
It's just that she happened to be a reporter, we got the answers to send him a file.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
The girl on the time will be declared out and he will be back in the way.

18:28.000 --> 18:40.000
I think the situation is well, it's going to be fine.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
Scharn was worked to a trial right, the target was anxious to be generalized by a trial,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
being an inductee at 4.2.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
The fact that he was away from the post on a number of occasions,

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
was the target trial, it became a matter of common knowledge and public knowledge.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Scharn was up to generalize it.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Somewhat in the last two to the one to the least, we had some habits, some of the habits.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
And we will require to answer some specific questions and we do it.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
Time to time it.

19:16.000 --> 19:26.000
Well, I think I asked a question before about what were the arrangements roughly that are made with respect to the private China campaign.

19:27.000 --> 19:36.000
The arrangement was that five of the times, which are made available for committee business,

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
providing it did not interfere with his training.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
It was a regional goal, that that work, whatever it might be, could be accomplished over a week.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
The subsequent lay was indicated that it could not be, and Scharn was therefore away from the post

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
after hours at times during the week.

20:00.000 --> 20:07.000
With whom did the army make the arrangements, and who in the army made it for the army?

20:08.000 --> 20:19.000
I talked with General Ryan, the commanding general of Fort Wicks, about his situation, and left it in his hands.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
Who was left with you from the legislative side of the government about it?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Who was left with me?

20:27.000 --> 20:35.000
Yes, but we had to think about some papers, or non-incuries from senators and congressmen.

20:35.000 --> 20:46.000
So who was it that was in the committee, or any committee who had, that these federal arrangements be made for Mr. Scharn, the king of the country?

20:46.000 --> 20:59.000
Well, in the luncheon of November 6th, the point with my age, the McCarthy was there, and the column was there, and the car was there.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
They were having trouble in getting their committee with Fort Wicks.

21:04.000 --> 21:18.000
The column and that was Scharn about to go into the army, that's an interesting language, because they've been in three days with that column.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
But they will have to have some of that time to get this thing cleaned up.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Now arrangements were made for the weekend.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
Who made the arrangements, who helped the army that the arrangements be made for Miguel Lovic Knight?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Who did it and went?

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
That's what, that is how I recall Hunter Fountain was made up for you.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
That was done at the luncheon of November 6th, because I recall it.

21:43.000 --> 21:52.000
At the luncheon of November 6th, just snow away to all the principals involved, made the request for the night to go as weekend, that's right.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
You're starting again?

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
I'd like to find my agent who placed my memory on it, but that's my personal recollection.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
Do you know what is sent to the McCarthy, do you have any arrangements to camp this?

22:05.000 --> 22:13.000
Yes, so I'm sorry there, sir, but if I recall it, there's even mention in one of his memorandum.

22:13.000 --> 22:28.000
Now with the Secretary, you feel that private time is being treated differently than other private, and was receiving special treatment.

22:28.000 --> 22:36.000
You also had a letter from Senator McCarthy on December 22nd, asking that he not be given special treatment.

22:36.000 --> 22:44.000
Because you already take it up with the sentiment for the between December 22nd and the issuance of the report.

22:44.000 --> 22:51.000
Yes, the only occasion I remember Senator Sonny Kim was on the...

22:51.000 --> 23:03.000
That was the time I saw him on the 14th of January, and what time he brought up the question of son-in-lawing the time of New York City.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
And I reminded him of the letter of December 22nd, on that occasion.

23:10.000 --> 23:23.000
Now Senator Jack Matthews, you had suggested that the testimony go up to the airport of the Navy, you deny that.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
It's been alleged that Mr. Adams made that suggestion.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
Did he do it to your presence? No.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
It's been alleged that the Army was floated at a meeting in October outside the courthouse and the police were.

23:41.000 --> 23:49.000
Senator McCarthy told Mr. Adams that Mr. Shine was in the right place, only in having his picture taken.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Mr. Adams, the fourth attention of the use, he did.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
Now that's time, I'll leave it at that time.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
It's been alleged that the first Army report was in Secretary.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
In the entries of the 13th and 14th of January, Mr. Collins stated to Mr. Adams,

24:09.000 --> 24:19.000
that he would record the Army, and caused Mr. Stevens to be fooled in Secretary of the Army,

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
that Mr. Adams, the fourth attention of the use, is certainly murdered.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
What did you know about it?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
What about those out there?

24:29.000 --> 24:37.000
I can put you to the spot of 10,000,000 of my personal service, and run the Department of the Army,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
which is a very large job of the Secretary.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I have everything to do.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I have a question.

24:44.000 --> 24:52.000
Now, Mr. Secretary, very young and important to me, from my existing board, is the expected time of the use of the Navy as well,

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
and the rest of the statement to Mr. Raid and the General by the Council of the Department.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
The 30th, 29th claim.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
The final claim is as follows and I quote,

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
on or about February 16, 1954, and on several other occasions,

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
Mr. Karin, a person supporting to act as a representative of Senator McCarthy, indicated

25:17.000 --> 25:24.000
that the investigations of the Army then contemplated by this responsibility would either be terminated or be conducted

25:24.000 --> 25:33.000
along reasonable lines if the Army would exceed the Senate and the Republicans and Mr. Koen's request for a special assignment for prior jobs and polls.

25:33.000 --> 25:45.000
Now, I'm sure you have a high rate of audience, expect for congressional committees, and that is wondering if you really believe that the public will accept this claim,

25:46.000 --> 26:04.000
which involves a serious indictment to the effect that this subcommittee might be influenced in any manner in making its investigations or the infiltration of common indomitable or that it's worth the either-retired or exciolated.

26:04.000 --> 26:14.000
You go to really believe in this conclusion or the 29th claim submitted by your special counsel.

26:16.000 --> 26:26.000
Well, I, Senator Dorset, on that one, that will possibly testify to Mr. Adams.

26:26.000 --> 26:40.000
If you see this day and this 29th claim, you go to Mr. Karin, the person supporting you act as a representative of Karin, why didn't you name that person, didn't you ensure you would vote?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
What's the matter with you?

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
Mr. Adams, will you name him?

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
You don't know who he works.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I'm in the court.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
You are me, am I? Can I put for you a... put for Naimin?

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
I'm telling you, you are the analogy, you need to be responsible for that, it's not first time knowledge.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
You can...

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
I have the counsel, Mr. Adams, you can determine whether it be someone waiting from Mr. Adams, is on the stand.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
I have to turn it to the floor where the question is whether it's possible to explain.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
My information is that that was Mr. Sarkalsky.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Sarkalsky.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
I have the new state of common, that's George the Colton.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
That's...

27:50.000 --> 28:09.000
Do you think you are... or your counsel, the one responsible for the preparation of this state in case, or a stone or accept it as over here as representing the collective, the significance of the settlement?

28:09.000 --> 28:32.000
I have the privilege of comparing with Mr. Walts because he and Mr. Sarkalsky are prepared to go here and in my life, before my performance.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
Hello, sir. Hello.

28:49.000 --> 28:59.000
While Secretary of the Army Stevens is referring to Mr. Walts, we pause ten seconds for station identification.

29:02.000 --> 29:19.000
You are tuned to the New York City Zone station, WNYC.

29:20.000 --> 29:30.000
You are now in the morning.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
He is the witness to question the witness to see who the patient is.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
We have a close to coach, but I have no time to work on it.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
But I have the question right here.

29:50.000 --> 29:58.000
The lecture, Mr. Walts, was not an authorized representative of this subcommittee.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
That's the bar of honor.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
Well, don't you think Mr. Secretary, that's...

30:04.000 --> 30:14.000
There are more cooperative means of getting cooperation between the Department of the Army and the important subcommittee like this,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
and thus getting subcommittee representatives from the United States.

30:18.000 --> 30:28.000
Instead of making a challenge, which certainly will not be approved, such as by the public,

30:28.000 --> 30:37.000
to the extent that the committee's entire pattern of investigation could be influenced so easily,

30:37.000 --> 30:48.000
and the ability for the primary objective, well, kind of the worst part, I do the best I could in the line of cooperation with this committee.

30:48.000 --> 30:57.000
And it's that that was my whole philosophy, starting soon as I took out my development, and I pursued it for the best of my ability.

30:57.000 --> 31:09.000
So, when you give families a stack of this year, 29th, that's what you certainly recognize as quite a serious indictment of this subcommittee plus five.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Mr. Walts, you're there 10 minutes to go to the committee.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
I have only two questions that I take Mr. Stevens.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Would you go on that to have a nap?

31:28.000 --> 31:39.000
Mr. Stevens, if you ever ask to have an airplane, why would you remind us to get a flight of shining with space?

31:39.000 --> 31:45.000
For the purpose of your ability, why would you have that hold?

31:45.000 --> 31:54.000
I did not. On the occasion of the day with the function of the office, you expect to listen to the attention we have to,

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
sometimes on your Twitter or now, I have a time when it's time to listen to it.

32:00.000 --> 32:10.000
Did you already say that you were disappointed, but you did not tell me you are a home job plan to have your picture taken with you?

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
I certainly have no recollection of any such things.
