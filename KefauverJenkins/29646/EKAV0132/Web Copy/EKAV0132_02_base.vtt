WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
The type of care that the island should have in picture taken of you and I will try it.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Along?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Yeah.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Let's go.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
There we go.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Send it back.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Yes, sir.

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
Mr. Secretary, before you and I ask you a question regarding your testimony yesterday,

00:25.000 --> 00:35.000
I asked you whether or not yesterday you did not testify as you wanted to have the hearing until you came to the right of the fourth month of the event.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
Just use this from dust in your mind as whether you are so stated.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
Have you refreshed your recollection and you now tell us that yesterday you did testify that you wanted to hear me the fourth month of the event.

00:49.000 --> 01:00.000
Well, I spend a much more time here than I have to testify to yesterday.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Not much you wanted today but what you wanted yesterday.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
But I have a much better testimony.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
The first and the second you mentioned you had not.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
No, but you had not.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
No, but yesterday that you wanted to hear me the fourth month of the event.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I would have looked it up from the state, sir.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
You don't remember that now.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
I think that I said that nothing about the suspension of hearing but not the investigation.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
I think that the Army should have an opportunity to take over the investigation and make progress reports to you.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Well, this is a very simple question.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
You remember you were so good about events that occurred six months ago.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
It seems you should be able to remember what occurred yesterday.

01:38.000 --> 01:53.000
My question is simply that yesterday did you know Mr. Jackson, if you recall, that you did try to get the hearings of the fourth month of the spend of the suspension of the radio installation.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I looked up to testimony and say, don't you remember some now?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I cannot remember everything that I said.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Well, do you remember that?

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
If I said a moment ago, I think that I did say something about the fact that you could testify the radio yesterday.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
I thought the fire was just today with the truth.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Sure, as far as I know, sorry.

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
Now, if you know the day, whether or not you want to be hearing the fourth month of the spend, I wanted them to spend it.

02:20.000 --> 02:34.000
Or that the Army could carry out the hearings themselves and make progress reports to your committee and stop the panic that was being created in the mind of the public about what's on a basis that was not justified by the fact.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
How did you finally succeed, Mr. Secretary, in getting the hearings from spend?

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
How did the final success day, the Army's final result today will work to be that ugly as it is.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
How did you finally succeed?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I worked for spend it as far as I know.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
How did you get the hearings going on?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Are they still going on?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
You know about that, I know.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
You know about it.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
No, no, no, no.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
You know the hearing.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
You know the hearing.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Where's the spend it?

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
The day you were summoned, filed your charges against Mr. Cullen.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Mr. Trey, must help you know that, don't you?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'll stop you, boy.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, I'm not being called at all.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't think that has anything to do with it.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I think you will have enough insuffendance since you filed your charges.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, now that's the way you got some suspended.

03:26.000 --> 03:36.000
Well, if you were trying to suggest that, I'm trying to suggest that I'm personally responsible for suspension of the hearings, then I'd thank you absolutely incorrect.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, now you want them suspended.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Would you be ashamed and personally responsible for having them suspended?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Not that.

03:42.000 --> 03:52.000
I wouldn't be ashamed of having them suspended at all, as long as the Army could take it up and carry it along and report to your committee and resume with you at any time that you want it.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
All right, now let's get back to the question.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
The answer to you has to find that you wanted the hearings to spend.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
I think we were both agreeing in the amount of the hearings that was suspended.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
From today that you've made public your charges against my chief counsel, my chief and staff, myself.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
There's no question about how I say that.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I've nothing to do with it.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Well, how did it end to spend?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I say, well, nothing to do with it.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
How did it end to spend?

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
You know, in here, well, I said it was suspended then by an action of the committee who had taken up other business.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
It's pretty good.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Many things are out there, I think, that they were letting.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Well, they didn't know by the committee.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
Do you think the filing of the charges against my chief counsel, my chief and staff, myself, that anything to do with the suspension of the hearing?

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
I think it's part of your talk and about what my mother was supposed to spend a vital long time ago.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
I was talking about the all the hearings and the communist influence of the enemy and so there's no question about their being.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
The party members was supposed to spend a long time ago.

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
They dated for you and filed your charges against my chief counsel, my chief and staff and me.

05:02.000 --> 05:13.000
The day before that, you know, Robert didn't know that we asked for the production of six military personnel.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
We had long communist records.

05:17.000 --> 05:33.000
We asked you that day also for the production of information on those who were responsible for the promotion, the honorable discharge and the favorable state-side duty for the First Amendment communists.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
You know that as long as Mr. Secretary, the day before your file of charges, the government came in and told us there was suspended long time ago.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, I think if anything has been suspended, it must have been by accident.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Now, this committee, I don't have any right to act with it, committee.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Mr. Speaker.

05:51.000 --> 06:08.000
Do you want to tell us, to the end, that you feel that the filing of your charges have nothing to do with the suspension of our hearing on how he was in full faith in the military?

06:09.000 --> 06:19.000
I don't think that the Army's man served to sonnet of Potter's Lure can stop the work of the Congress of the United States. I certainly hope it can.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
You don't answer my question, would you?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Would you answer the question?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
May I have the porter for you to question me?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Please don't remember.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Please don't remember.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Time out for porter over the question.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I don't know if it's worth it.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I don't know if it's worth it.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Do you want to tell us, to the end, that's it?

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, but you feel you want to file a quick file of charges that you feel safe from the bad news?

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
I don't know if it's just so safe to tell us where it is.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
I'll spare my men, spare my men.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I'm going to answer the chair or you answer the question.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Well, I think you'll be what you will to answer.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
I'll make a quick answer that I gave, but you think that's not a problem?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Time out.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
The file I leave the same question you had previously and the answer is that the secretary gave.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
What are you doing in this term, my man?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I want to point out that the answer is not responsible, my man.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm going to ask the chair to order the secretary to answer the question.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
I'll give you the question and the answer.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Question, Mr. Davis, do you want to file us to very early?

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Like, to claim that file is charged, that's not good.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
The suspension of our hearing is on top of the step-to-function.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
In the military, I don't think that the audience passes the sound of the letter.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
It's about the words of the father, so it's about the terms of our hearing.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
When you answer the question, not like that, it's an answer.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I'm going to ask the chair if you order the secretary to answer.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
My question is very simple.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm going to give you the secretary back in time now.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
At least day-day question and then get an answer.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I'm going to start with a real quick answer.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
First, we will do you feel,

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
that the filing of the charges against my chief counsel,

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
my chief staff, and against me, had anything at all to do.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
We're holding out for suspending the hearings on how much do you feel,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
in your department.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
Hearing is what's happening going on up until the day you file those charges.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
That's a simple question, but I'll be sure to be able to answer.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I turn it on the carpet.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
I repeat, I just do not believe that our answer to Senator Potter's letter

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
that stops the word for the Congress of the United States,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
or it's a committee, so I just don't believe that.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
The other way you answer is that you don't think that the filing of the charges

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
and anything you're holding at the work of the committee.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
I don't think that's part answered of the letter of Senator Potter,

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
and I'll let this possible for staff of the work of us to be able to do the Congress.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
That's the other one on this here.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
You refer, you bring Senator Potter,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
what are you going to do, a little more on it?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
All right, you bring Senator Potter into this constantly.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
You would think that Senator Potter is instigated this.

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
Will you tell us now whether or not Senator Potter's letter was not to resolve?

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Constantly leave the stories from the Pentagon,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
the effect that the highway forks, the prior to that,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
you personally, Mr. Secretary, and Mr. Adam,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
contact a number of senators, told them you had such a report,

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
and that also you, the Mr. Adam, had told me,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
throughout that I've indicated, let's put it back.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
So Mr. Wells, please.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I think the Secretary is intelligent enough to listen to this,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
without your whispering easier.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I agree.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'll leave the position, I'll get through with my question.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Did you have any more remarks to me, sir?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I'll leave the position, I'll get through with my question.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
May the remarks I'd like to answer it.

10:19.000 --> 10:26.000
Mr. Report, if you'd be the last part of my question, Mr. Stevenson, please.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Do the last two words, I can explain the question.

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
Mr. Adam, I also agree with Mr. Adam, forks, I'll leave.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Right, I'll give you a suggestion, that's the best way for you.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
There's no words.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Our hearings were followed up, using your words of suspended,

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
that there would be issue of the report, attacking my chief counsel,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
a report which he claimed would be unwrapping to the committee.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You knew all that, didn't you?

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm sorry that I am not as worried as you give me quite a fort on my part.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I think that that is such a long placement with a question on the end of it.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I'll have a lot of a read.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Well, let's break it up, Mr. President.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
We have a short time.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I have a question.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Mr. Secretary, do you think the rest of the committee let me read this?

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
Mr. Chairman, I think maybe the Secretary's objection as well,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
taken up with a very long question.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
I think it should be broken up so we can take a piece of this.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
Now, before Mr. Robert wrote you an answer to this report,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
is it correct that the papers carrying stories of the effect of your report

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
were not available to you at all?

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
And Mr. Robert actually only wrote you,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
and certainly, you would have known that your report was going to make you make public.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
He thought of the member of this committee.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
He should have the consideration of receiving a copy of that report

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
and that Mr. Robert did not originally.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
He recrushed for any report about my chief counsel, Mr. Carth.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I thought I'd not have sent out a part of the original idea of the letter.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Oh, no, you understand the question, Bob.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
Well, then you asked whether a son of the potter in effect didn't you ask whether or not he wrote the letter

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
under his own power because he's asked to.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I know what the original idea could be pointing at the potter.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Can we take time off now, Mr. Chairman?

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Time off, Mr. President.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Uh, question.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
For Mr. Robert wrote you a last report,

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
is it correct that the papers carry stories of the effect of your report

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
was available in your office, but the father actually thought of wrote you and told you

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
that as long as the report was done to be like public,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
he thought of the cover of this committee.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
He should have the consideration of receiving a copy of the report,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
and if the father did not originally write to you,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
it was wrong to report.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
So I'm not paying that for the rest of the talk.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
First of all, uh, Senator Potter didn't write me as far as I know.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
He wrote the secretary of the family.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And I don't have the diary called his letter, which I've seen.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
It was any reference to that, so any report I think he has given questions.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
So the effect of, uh, had any supplemental treatment,

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
then extended his David Chien, and if so, who was responsible?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Mr. Chairman, please.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Mr. Chairman, please.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Mr. Chairman, please.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Mr. Chairman, please.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm your elected committee chairman, Mr. Potter.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
And the party has a board.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
And if you like the map in the middle of the Moselaw,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
it's not a unit in the play.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Mr. Potter, if I was trying to clear out the record,

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
and I'm just thinking on fair use and make it clear that you were the moving force

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
in the original issue of the report,

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
because we don't know if this report has been leaked to Newspaper and their possession.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And the fire we got, the fire was not just a mechanism,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
it was a deal of those technical practice,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
it was a question of how it could be used to get a deal.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
And the hearing is just a bit easier than I would have been to deal with any minor work

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
or lose its load to the parts of the point where I need to be.

14:16.000 --> 14:23.000
My point of order is, in order to verify, uh, uh, this is the President's statement,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
my letter to Secretary of Defense Charles Wilkins,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
was taped upon report that I had,

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
and I think that I had just guessed it, or lasted.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
A more open secret that exists on the hill,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
that it was part that it had been,

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
and that the fighting to that report has been public from the point.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Now, I tell you, as a member of the committee,

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
that the committee should have the benefit of the report,

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
so the week would take whatever action we need nothing to do.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
And the essence of my writing the letter to Secretary of Defense Wilkins,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
and I would say you lie the report now.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Thank you for that very kind of statement,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
and to share to you the presence of the audience,

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
and to your name has been standing around in this project now, kind of a question.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
I mean, I say that I think the Summary of Modern Elections is particularly proper.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
The one that should have been written,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I just want to make it clear here that from the Secretary of Defense talks about,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
an answer in regards to Mr. Potter's letter,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
that you are not giving us the facts,

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
you know the Secretary of Defense was out and available long before that function.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
What was this?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Did you know I'm a part behind you?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I'm not afraid of the lie that I've stated anything here.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
There's not the facts to follow, I know.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
All right, the most phenomenally specific question.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Did you not, Bob?

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
Did you not personally tell senators that you had available a report?

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
On my chief counsel, before Senator Potter wrote you that letter,

16:06.000 --> 16:13.000
I visited the members of your committee on a democratic in connection with the channels with their case.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
And that's what I talked to the members of your committee about.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
You've heard my question. The question was, did you not tell?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Remember and put it out.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I'm going to give you a minute.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
One, sir.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
And again, the yesterday, and we'll go out and do it.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
So really again, the counsel has no question.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
The chair, again now, is my two.

16:38.000 --> 16:50.000
We've been with the Secretary a point which I think is a tremendous importance that the members of this committee are going to face through the full responsibility

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
as we interrogate other witnesses and there's me, Professor Jamman,

16:54.000 --> 17:01.000
Mr. Ismael Carp, about their fight in this country.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
Collecting my longness, I try to bring the interrogation up to date, please Mr. Steven.

17:07.000 --> 17:19.000
I'm trying to break down and segregate with the guidance of each of the individuals who have now been charged his fight in these cases.

17:19.000 --> 17:27.000
In these kinds of activities which you elect, if the chair understands it correctly as of now,

17:27.000 --> 17:35.000
you speak that you have no specific charge of the dual-private nature of your own personal knowledge against Mr. Carp.

17:35.000 --> 17:43.000
So in a respectful, reoccurable, second meeting, knowing respect for this country, Mr. Steven,

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
if you have other, if you have charge, you can make a gift to Mr. Carp.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
We're hopefully without a doubt you can speak with you as it was, and if I think you should make a note,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I will give you that number maybe if you hold the term out.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
You're making a note.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
Well, Senator, all of a discussion in so far as I'm concerned,

18:03.000 --> 18:10.000
this bacon-priced, in regards to the matter of Mr. Carp, has been related to the meeting of October 2nd,

18:10.000 --> 18:17.000
and that date you will find run through and through his record, because that's what we've been talking about.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Very well, I, as I said, for you, we'll go to that.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
There will be plenty of evidence in respect for Mr. Carp, with the happening from October 2nd.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
That night, after all the evidence of evidence that you're in, then I will feel that that would be withdrawn.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
Well, I will take them up then, date by date to check me some years to you.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
Your disclaimer, and then your child begins Mr. Carp, and now that you've taken into your experiences

18:46.000 --> 18:55.000
about over seconds, that will, by disclaimer, was with respect to the October 2nd date, best of all.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
Now, I find in your statements of specifications of the mentions of Mr. Carp,

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
and since you now indicate that you do have charges to make against you,

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
and I will know that you are easy to be done already, or the patient-man activation is a guilty forgiveness,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
and I simply want to fight.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
I shall hope that there are other points in your specifications, where you make a statement.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I ask the council to be worthy to check.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
We have the attention of the council.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
I ask you to check, I'm doing this very clearly, I've been on this from the new Gary Carp,

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
your special vacation before you leave.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
I'm sure that I mentioned every time that Mr. Carp has been mentioned on the dispute.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
The next one that I think I see is one of the more important things.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Your special vacation number eight, Mr. Stevens.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
On the route of October 6, 1950, Senator McCarty, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Carp,

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
sought to induce and persuade Secretary Thieu and Mr. Adams, and would not consider Mr. Adams now,

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
sought to persuade Secretary Thieu, committee to serve, to arrange for the assignment to pass a child in the road,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
to study and be whatever.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
If any, you'll feel time is decreasing, you'll know the point.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
Textals, I'm not repeating, by the kid Mr. Carp, you know that you know that he's your gunner.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
So Mr. Carp is a part of the group, and was very talk about the thing now.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
I don't, if I can't sit here and tell you precisely whatever you want to say,

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
and if you may have particular eyes to reform a post on that,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
but Mr. Carp is a part of that, meaning, not part of that.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
I mean, he told Mr. Carp, a new ally, and the discommittedly served him,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
and this engage is his counsel, because he didn't talk about activities.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Well, perhaps, I'll just take him a chair, I'll just tell him more about taking Mr. B. there.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Perhaps, I'll make the chairman, I'm a federal pilot.

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
I will turn to the memo I own from Mike Carp to Senator McCarty,

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
stated the final nine, but Senator Jackson referred to a pilot, though.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
That would not be hoping for him, but to be more like his helpful to this exposure,

21:04.000 --> 21:12.000
but he quoted from that memo, and I'm not going to put the amount of opinion about it, not show it.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
So if you need any evidence of why I cannot, I would draw my car from biggest pursuiting,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
and so all the evidence to them, I'll just go to one vent.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
All right, you now will take it.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Including the impact of activities Mr. Carp was the fact that he made a decision,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
and he remembered that, and he went to jail in New York, and he was under arrest.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
I don't know what this is, but true copy or not, but for all that, we all have a pilot tuning earlier,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
for the sake of being here, you can tell the challenges, and we'll accept this, too.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
All right, I was the fact that November 6th, the spot on that rotation, did he do it with Jim Carp?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Did he do anything?

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
Senator, I would like to ask the writer, if I may, to think that one over in the same way

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
that I thought over the October 2nd meeting, certain years ago, I'd like to do that.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
You're light of all that, and you may respond.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
If you're more and more and more undiluted to that question, now you have the same writer's connection

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
to the next question, is the very very special, his specification of the test,

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
on November 11, 1953, Mr. Carp, I beg your pardon, Mr. Joe, the General Ryan,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
you couldn't be frightened by that.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Yes.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
November 16 brings you in, Mr. Carp, specification number 12.

22:36.000 --> 22:46.000
On November 16, 1953, Mr. Carp, we knew the test, that I decided in paragraph 11 about,

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
this time directing Jim the Secretary's team, after that left charge, it was to Carp,

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Mr. Jim, by the conclusion, that I was about to arrive that tomorrow.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Thank you.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Mr. Counsel, either others, yes.

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
November 17, specification number 13, the chair has the floor of the wind of rain.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I just couldn't hear that, my offense, I'm sorry.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
He said he would carry the particular air within the morning.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Secretary, good for you, sir.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Yes.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Specification number 13.

23:18.000 --> 23:26.000
On November 17, 1953, Senator McCarthy, Mr. Carp, made known the Secretary's team,

23:26.000 --> 23:34.000
the importance attached by them to price of signs, military equipment, and thereby, by anyone doing a difference.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
Infants indicated that their plans for continuing full investigation of the military installation

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
and for the monsoon of New Jersey were related to the importance attached by them to price of signs, military equipment.

23:46.000 --> 23:55.000
I'm not a decision to Mr. Carp, directly from by individual and by infants, that you consider to be a proper kind of pilot though.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
In the same way, just by all of these special laws.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Mr. Mayor, may I have a question?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
All right, very important one of the words.

24:06.000 --> 24:17.000
You're first meeting, I think, very able to question the Secretary about events, which he must have told us,

24:17.000 --> 24:24.000
information regarding the government has been given to Council before they made these special charges in Spine Car.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
I just personally wouldn't.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
I was already misremembering, was made to charge.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Certainly in the hour until I can't tell you the night.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
I'll go back and talk to those with Council and decide what I remember the more morning.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I just don't think we can get any more information about that.

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm sure he is that we can get somewhere by cross-examination, because the Secretary's team will be subjected to cross-examination,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
and we challenge the one particularized in the money.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Mr. Chair, may I ask for a minute?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
May I ask?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
May I ask?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Will that be shared by the air from this witness?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
For very not as a tonight, he has no recognition of any events.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
I would say I have no recollection, but I'd like to thank it over and have a chance to request by amendment,

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
because I've come about earlier with the number of questions that I've already been asked, and the amount of trust upon I've done,

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
if that's the best time of mine, where you have to sit down and evaluate the concentrate on a given point.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
That's what I'd like to do on this.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Mr. Chair, would you turn it out?

25:27.000 --> 25:38.000
Mr. Chair, one move for the last may I make the observation of this time that the questions suggested by Senator McCarthy to use the air

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
to this time may be asked by Senator McCarthy, where is Paul Olieck in a few minutes?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Yes, I don't even know.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I've been asked the other questions, I'm trying to follow lines in the Washington River.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Then there's only a constant health ten minutes, only a few seconds.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
Mr. Chair, may I ask that the vote of Dr. Derella and the one who will hand that being in the vote,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
and I don't want them to vote.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
I don't want them to vote for Chair on that, so I will not have an opportunity to interrogate Mr. Stevens tonight.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
I feel the way that the Chair has done, what time is it now for?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
They're not being brought for.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I'm here at five minutes.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm here at five minutes.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
I'm here at nine minutes.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
I'm here at five minutes.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
The Chair has done it.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
That's all right.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
I'll continue that.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
The Chair has done it.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I'll keep on your life.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
I'll explain to you from this witness.

26:22.000 --> 26:28.000
When we look back, he says, now he has no right to actually be seriously charged in doing what makes him a perfect guy.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
He's been working for the Senate for the Senate.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
Whether or not he has a right to actually ask them, they may be working for a while, they're arrested.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
If not, clearly any questions come from him.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Mr. Chair, may I ask that you please begin?

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
The question raised by the Senate's rhetoric is clearly argued by the Senate,

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
and goes to the links of the testimony of the Secretary Kay,

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
and not to the question of Mr. Smith's ability.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It's a matter of argument.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
I'm here.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I do not thank you for the public.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
My Lord.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Chair, I will remove the microphone of work.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
You and the other just to find and find out where he's on, then.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And I believe the gentleman that is calling.

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
Just to tell you why, if any specific charges were being made against Mr. Carter,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
but if he seems as a result, he's on personal arms.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
In just as Mr. Carter has seen that we must have before it, something specific.

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
It's very difficult to deal with the general opinion that does not work in condemning anybody,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
and I'm sure that Mr. Smith is in the first place to say,

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
if he has nothing specific to all, he does not allow it to be done in the general office.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
That's certain of Clark.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
And I shall put our entire order to the time to make the reflections of you next.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I would like to say one other thing.

27:47.000 --> 27:54.000
I have tried my best to get from you, a detailed Secretary of the M. Plata Condoms.

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
Both of those Sergeant McClubney that you were at, and Mr. Cohn, as you were about that,

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
broken down in both issues, incendiary into two parts.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
The one, the pilot that took place from the standpoint of each of them,

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
tried to be an induction of private time, and certainly the pilot took place out.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
I think he said that you would like to have an opportunity to replace your one-way on that,

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
as President was given the chairman of our request that you do that during the night,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and come prepared in the morning.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
You present us some answers to some of the general opinion, and you will.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Is that available?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I'm trying very hard to do that. That's what the chairman is.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
You know now he's got to do what I was trying to do with him.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
Yes sir, and we can have people in one way, his specific charge,

28:39.000 --> 28:46.000
as you make against each other's responsibility, involved on the other side of the country.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I'm not sending the guy to the final party.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I'm sending chairman to the executive.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
A pilot of our staff is trying to have a little call full in two or three minutes,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
and I assume that we're going to adjourn within that time,

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
and as much as it's about 4.30, we'll be all ready to adjourn,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
and if all on, he's ranking the colleague that will keep it in balance,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
and that we'd be set up to that time.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
The year before, I was at a certain time, and the chairman of those federal heavy words about pilot meetings.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
I was chairman of the state connection I do hold,

29:21.000 --> 29:29.000
that the Army will have a statement of explanation available tomorrow with reference

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
to my request on Fourth Moments.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
If that's possible, it's an odd act going to be unreasonable,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
but I do think it's from material to this matter.

29:39.000 --> 29:47.000
Before the committee, that it would be in the interest of the committee getting the facts

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
to have that information available tomorrow with all of our,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
we'll have it's front of the Jackson.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
There will allow us any other statements that the secretary should be supplying

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
to members of the committee so that we'll try to get through with him as we can tomorrow.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Check now, Senator Metzon.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
Check today, if you don't have enough work to do tonight,

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
I wish you a gift for me.

30:14.000 --> 30:22.000
And for the committee, the total number of man hours that have been consumed in this effort,

30:22.000 --> 30:29.000
as you all age, for that rental treatment for Mr. Sean.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
I'm serious. I'm serious.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm serious about too.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I'll see you later.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Make any up for me to approach you else.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Sure likes to see people look after you and stay serious.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
And I think that's what we're trying to do.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
That's been great. Thank you.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
We'll reach out until 10.30 tomorrow morning.
