WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we started out this series of television programs

00:08.720 --> 00:16.200
early in January with the majority leader Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana as I guess.

00:16.200 --> 00:21.000
Talk about the program that he expected or the Congress expected to enact during this

00:21.000 --> 00:24.400
first session of the 87th Congress.

00:24.400 --> 00:30.560
Now we wind up our program on this occasion because in a few days the Congress will

00:30.560 --> 00:38.200
have recessed while the rest of this session with another distinguished leader of the Congress,

00:38.200 --> 00:41.360
the whip of the United States Senate.

00:41.360 --> 00:47.760
He is my friend and the very able legislator who has had a great part in the enactment

00:47.760 --> 00:53.600
of the legislation that we have accomplished during this term, Senator Hewbrett Humphrey

00:53.600 --> 00:54.600
of Minnesota.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.840
Hewbrett has certainly has a pleasure to have you on the program with us.

00:57.840 --> 01:03.840
Well, Estus, it's a joy to be on a program with you and it's a greater joy and it's a

01:03.840 --> 01:07.560
rare privilege to serve with you in the United States Senate.

01:07.560 --> 01:13.120
And before you get a chance to say one more word about me or about this program, I want

01:13.120 --> 01:20.080
your friends to know and your constituents of the splendid work, the outstanding work that

01:20.080 --> 01:24.040
you have accomplished and undertaken here in the Congress of the United States.

01:24.040 --> 01:28.800
I wish to say to your people that I've never known a man with greater integrity and greater

01:28.800 --> 01:33.040
courage in the legislative chamber and I want to compliment you.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.040
Well, here we go.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.040
That's very generous.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.040
I didn't expect that.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.240
If I had known you, you know, let me say all these things that I had you down here every

01:38.240 --> 01:39.240
time I had a program.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.440
But I thank you very much and I think that everyone who is watching and hearing this program

01:45.440 --> 01:51.120
will know that Senator Humphrey has been the most active man on the United, on the floor

01:51.120 --> 01:57.520
of the Senate during this session as he always is and that the many, many legislative accomplishments

01:57.520 --> 02:01.040
of this session are in a great measure due to him.

02:01.040 --> 02:06.160
I don't think anybody sponsored more legislation or fought it through more successfully.

02:06.160 --> 02:11.560
Now, Hubert, first I'm not explaining what the whip of the Senate is.

02:11.560 --> 02:16.720
We have a majority leader who has Senator Mansfield and the next in command is the whip of

02:16.720 --> 02:17.720
the Senate.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
He has a big whip.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.640
He fights for the program.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.400
He gets the members present.

02:22.400 --> 02:28.720
He tries to push the bail through committees to get them in shape so that they can be acted

02:28.720 --> 02:30.880
upon intelligently and fully debate.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.880
How do you like being the whip of the Senate?

02:32.880 --> 02:35.840
Hubert, do you want to tell us more about responsibilities?

02:35.840 --> 02:36.840
Well, I like it.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.400
I like it very much, Estes.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.040
It takes a lot of time.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.040
It does.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.240
It takes a great deal of time, but has brought me into closer contact with my colleagues in

02:44.240 --> 02:45.240
the Senate.

02:45.240 --> 02:49.000
And I think I've gone to have a greater appreciation of their problems.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.880
Besides that, it's a real pleasure to work with Senator Mansfield, a majority leader who

02:53.880 --> 03:03.560
in his quiet and yet understanding and sincere manner is performing a great, or fulfilling a

03:03.560 --> 03:05.840
great job as the majority leader.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.600
And his record as a leader I think is excellent.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.200
It's been kind of a pleasure to work with you.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.760
He's a wonderful man.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.600
Well, first let's talk about some of the domestic accomplishments.

03:17.600 --> 03:26.400
Hubert, I think since the World War II has been the busiest session of Congress that I've

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
ever been in.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.400
Yes.

03:28.400 --> 03:32.160
We've certainly been very, very busy day and night in committees.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.680
Let's talk about the domestic scene.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.880
What were some of the accomplishments on the domestic program?

03:37.880 --> 03:42.520
Well, Senator Kefaw, for the very first thing one ought to say about the Senate is that

03:42.520 --> 03:47.440
we have to undertake the confirmation of all of the presidential nominations for these

03:47.440 --> 03:51.840
many jobs in the government, these high, these positions of high responsibility.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.760
In the beginning, this took a great deal of our time because each person appointed goes

03:55.760 --> 04:00.680
through the process of hearings and testimony and then recommendation by the Committee and

04:00.680 --> 04:02.360
action by the Senate.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.640
That within itself is a major accomplishment.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.040
And then we have to ratify all the treaties.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.640
Ratify the treaties, yes.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.320
I would say that our record was really very good.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.600
We have unfinished business, but we have two sessions of the Congress.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.320
Let's just take a look, for example, one of the first acts of this administration when

04:19.320 --> 04:21.760
it found a recession on its hands.

04:21.760 --> 04:22.760
It's in the...

04:22.760 --> 04:24.120
Harry inherited that recession.

04:24.120 --> 04:29.040
Was to act quickly in the field of temporary unemployment compensation.

04:29.040 --> 04:33.600
The expansion of aid to dependent children of the unemployed.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.480
Now, this went right directly to people.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.880
The president ordered the wider distribution of our surplus food.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.360
It was his first action.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.520
First action, yes, sir.

04:42.520 --> 04:47.320
And then the food stamp plan in certain areas of the United States was put into effect.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.320
And then there are estus.

04:48.320 --> 04:52.760
You may recall the minimum wage law which increased minimum wages to a dollar and a quarter

04:52.760 --> 04:57.200
and extended the coverage to three million six hundred thousand more persons.

04:57.200 --> 05:01.400
This was the greatest improvement in the minimum wage law since its original passage under

05:01.400 --> 05:03.000
Franklin Roosevelt.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.120
And we had the area redevelopment program.

05:05.120 --> 05:09.920
That's a very important program here in the Hubert and it offers an awful lot of hope

05:09.920 --> 05:15.360
to people in many areas of Tennessee because we have depressed areas both in the rural

05:15.360 --> 05:20.680
and in other sections of Tennessee, particularly as a result of the depression and the coal

05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
man in the area.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.680
Yes.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.600
Tell us briefly what the area redevelopment bill does.

05:25.600 --> 05:32.440
Well, the area redevelopment bill provides loans for industries and local communities to

05:32.440 --> 05:40.160
provide new industries and new job opportunities to improve local communities for new industries.

05:40.160 --> 05:47.120
It also provides grants of money to local governments or when a local government is attempting

05:47.120 --> 05:52.920
to build a new factory site or to expand its community facilities.

05:52.920 --> 05:59.400
What the area redevelopment means is a kind of a domestic aid program for our own

05:59.400 --> 06:02.200
and needy areas in our own underdeveloped areas.

06:02.200 --> 06:07.320
Now we have an area like this in Northeastern Minnesota in the iron range country.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.320
You visited that Estus and you have many friends there.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.720
Just as you have these problems in the coal mining section.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.360
It provides for the retraining of workers.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.360
Yes, right.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
And the relocation of workers.

06:18.360 --> 06:22.720
And it is, I say, for facilities, for plant equipment for the improvement of jobs.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
What's the point of some other things?

06:23.720 --> 06:28.960
How about social security and how is airport development?

06:28.960 --> 06:32.520
Yes, we expanded our social security program.

06:32.520 --> 06:37.760
We increased the payments on an average of about 10%.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.280
We took care of the highway program by...

06:40.280 --> 06:44.280
And social security men can now draw social security when they reach 62.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.280
Page 62.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.640
And there were a number of improvements in that social security program.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.040
We're going to, we brought up to date the highway program.

06:53.040 --> 06:56.840
You may remember, under the previous administration, they sort of stretched it out.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.600
Well, we brought it back on to schedule.

06:58.640 --> 07:03.760
We advanced more money to the states for their highway construction program to get people

07:03.760 --> 07:06.480
to work and to take care of the highway needs.

07:06.480 --> 07:12.640
The Airport Act was passed, which will help all of the states in localities with airport

07:12.640 --> 07:13.640
development.

07:13.640 --> 07:17.240
And we have, we have an awful lot of towns and cities that want the airport development

07:17.240 --> 07:18.240
too.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.560
And then you recall, we passed the, what we call the Water Pollution Control Act.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.720
Congressman Blotnik, go any of your good friends.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.480
My state was the author in the house and I had the privilege of sponsoring it here in

07:28.480 --> 07:29.480
the Senate.

07:29.480 --> 07:36.560
This provides a aid to 5,000 communities for their sewage disposal facilities.

07:36.560 --> 07:42.000
To prevent the pollution of lakes and streams and to really protect the public health.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
Then besides that Senator Keefeoffer, there was a tremendous program in the field of health.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.400
Your good friend, Lister Hill.

07:49.400 --> 07:54.520
Senator Hill is chairman of that committee on health legislation brought to the Senate.

07:54.520 --> 08:00.000
The greatest program for the National Institutes of Health in our fight against cancer and

08:00.000 --> 08:03.920
against the diseases of the nervous system and against heart disease.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.240
The greatest program we've ever had.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.000
We also have the Community Health Facilities Act.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.720
It will provide nursing home care and facilities for our elderly, new hospital construction.

08:15.720 --> 08:20.160
This is without a doubt the largest and the most singularly important act relating to

08:20.160 --> 08:22.680
hospital facilities that we've ever passed.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.680
The housing bill.

08:23.680 --> 08:28.400
The housing bill too, which I'm not whole lot in the way of housing, building housing

08:28.400 --> 08:30.920
and giving people employment as well.

08:30.920 --> 08:35.800
Then here with another thing, I thought I was very much interested in the wilderness

08:35.800 --> 08:42.000
bill to try to preserve some of the natural beautiful places that we have in tech in that

08:42.000 --> 08:43.600
past during this session.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.600
Yes, that was that.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.400
There's been one big year fight, you know.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.520
It's going a long, long fight and you've taken a leading part in it.

08:50.520 --> 08:55.600
I suppose one of the disappointments was that we didn't get full federal aid for education

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
in this session.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.480
What did we get in the way of education, you know?

08:59.480 --> 09:03.600
Well we received a two year extension of the National Defense Education Act, which has

09:03.600 --> 09:06.480
been a very successful act, you know.

09:06.480 --> 09:11.840
And then we received a two year extension of what we call public law 815 and 874.

09:11.840 --> 09:16.480
These are laws that relate to helping the school districts and the localities where there's

09:16.480 --> 09:18.080
a great deal of federal activity.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
Now you have some of that now.

09:19.080 --> 09:23.560
10 and see Oak Ridge and Clarksville and Snellahoma many places in Tennessee.

09:23.560 --> 09:28.120
And you know that under those two laws, 815 and 874 are a center to keep offer almost

09:28.120 --> 09:31.680
$2 billion of federal aid has been distributed since 1950.

09:31.680 --> 09:36.760
And then we will be back next term, next session also trying to get some other five.

09:36.760 --> 09:41.280
The president has told us that he's going to press again for a general school program

09:41.280 --> 09:45.680
in higher education and an elementary and secondary education in the next session.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.040
We're not giving up any more than, by the way, on our medical care, on our own.

09:49.040 --> 09:53.520
On our hospital care program for the elderly, that's going to be one of the prime items.

09:53.520 --> 09:58.120
And the second session, the 87th Congress, starting next January, we're going to put hospital

09:58.120 --> 10:02.840
protection for our citizens, age 65, who are under social security.

10:02.840 --> 10:08.400
We're going to put it within the social security program so that people will not have to undertake

10:08.400 --> 10:14.160
a means test and go around asking and begging for something, but it'll be theirs by right.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.600
Yes, and it's not going to be in such fashion that anybody needs fear of socializing medicine.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.600
It's all that relates only to prepayment of hospital care.

10:21.600 --> 10:26.600
Now we have a few minutes left to talk about our international affairs.

10:26.600 --> 10:31.840
And you have taken a very leading part, and not only as whip of the Senate, but also as a senior member

10:31.840 --> 10:35.320
of the Foreign Relations Committee.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.080
Just a list and explain what we've done.

10:38.080 --> 10:43.080
The first thing we had, of course, was in connection with Berlin and stepping up our defense

10:43.080 --> 10:44.080
effort.

10:44.080 --> 10:48.160
Yes, Senator, you've been very active in that yourself as a member of the Armed Services Committee.

10:48.720 --> 10:53.600
You know that we had to add some six billion dollars of new appropriations to bring up

10:53.600 --> 10:55.680
to date our defense structure.

10:55.680 --> 11:00.080
We found ourselves within adequate forces for the kind of a world in which we live.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.320
And this has been done.

11:01.320 --> 11:07.400
We've had a space program, a fantastic space program, of over a billion and a half dollars.

11:07.400 --> 11:12.760
And this had all been lagging, been permitted to sort of be at a half pace where we've stepped

11:12.760 --> 11:13.760
it up.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.960
We're not going to let the Russians occupy outer space.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.400
This doesn't belong to them.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.960
We're catching up and catching up rapidly.

11:20.960 --> 11:26.200
The foreign aid program is not only a new program, but it's a new administration being completely

11:26.200 --> 11:30.840
reorganized from Washington, D.C., right out to the country level itself.

11:30.840 --> 11:35.120
And the president has insisted upon a new and an effective organization.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.400
We don't want this waste in the program.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.120
We want every dollar that we put into foreign aid to produce some results.

11:41.120 --> 11:47.360
And as you know, most of it today is on the basis of loans, repayable in dollars.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.080
And I think this makes a much more sensible program.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.080
Then we have the piece.

11:51.080 --> 11:57.560
And the emphasis has been put on technical assistance to the economic aid and the military.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.560
That is correct.

11:58.560 --> 12:03.040
That is what we call the human resources and the material resources of the country.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.040
I mentioned the Peace Corps.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.400
I want to say a word about the Peace Corps.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.200
Another time I talk with people interested in international affairs, they explain the

12:12.200 --> 12:18.440
necessity of some method of people to people, getting to know one another and to help technicians

12:18.440 --> 12:23.280
helping people in other nations, particularly the newly developed nations.

12:23.280 --> 12:27.960
Well, this is something that really catches their captures the imagination.

12:27.960 --> 12:33.760
The senator who took the lead and putting forth and getting enacted the Peace Corps is

12:33.760 --> 12:35.560
Senator Humphrey.

12:35.560 --> 12:39.800
And I think it is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has passed this

12:39.800 --> 12:40.800
Congress.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.800
Now you tell us something.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.280
Well, that is a wonderful introduction.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.960
I will just say very quickly what we are doing is calling upon the young people of our

12:47.960 --> 12:55.200
country, trained, experienced, healthy, filled with vitality and idealism and determination

12:55.200 --> 13:03.120
and qualified to help other people help themselves, to help them in education and health, in construction

13:03.120 --> 13:06.720
and road building, in improvement of the land and agriculture.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.160
And I will tell you when you export American youth for the purposes of peace and for the

13:11.160 --> 13:16.000
purposes of building, you help make a better world and you improve the prospects for

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
world peace.
