WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
The ship is at judgment now, and all of this labor will have gone to naught because

00:06.500 --> 00:11.500
you may get submitted before you have an opportunity to consult fully with the various

00:11.500 --> 00:12.500
entities involved.

00:12.500 --> 00:17.180
However, having said that, it's spectacularly insist on being heard as part of the carol

00:17.180 --> 00:20.900
that's Carol and it's on the right point.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.500
I believe that it's important that the town of Macquarie give its position, that Mr.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.500
Welk gives its position, and that anybody gives their position, because there's another

00:28.500 --> 00:30.500
person here, and that's public opinion.

00:30.500 --> 00:35.000
As the weather these hearings should be limited to a few people, or whether the time that

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
people can be asked questions should be limited, and we should hear all the principles involved.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
And after being on the stand for 13 days, the secretary, or Senator Macquarie, or anybody

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
else involved in these hearings wants to make a statement prior to this motion being submitted

00:48.000 --> 00:52.200
for final passing tomorrow, I respectfully state Mr. Chairman that I think they should have

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
that right at this time.

00:54.200 --> 00:59.200
Chair has said and proposed to begin the discussion tomorrow morning by giving all principles and

00:59.200 --> 01:04.700
the council an opportunity after having Macquarie judgments formed on the basis of studying

01:04.700 --> 01:07.700
the various proposals to arrive at its conclusion.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.700
Well, I would say my chair is in the suspension of the Army.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.700
For example, I say, I say, help form my authority.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.900
He will do that for the road to call, and he has said further that it, and he has the

01:16.900 --> 01:21.700
principles now insist on discussing these determinations without having had an opportunity

01:22.700 --> 01:23.700
to consider them carefully.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.700
Of course, he will grab them the courtesy of the floor, and if he grants it to one, he will

01:26.700 --> 01:27.700
grab it to all.

01:27.700 --> 01:33.700
He simply buys and the interest is trying to arrive at some kind of conclusion to suggest that

01:33.700 --> 01:38.700
before any of the decisions, he numbs the creative decision on this, they have at least an

01:38.700 --> 01:42.700
opportunity to read the direction proposed with reference, and to see the Macquarie and

01:42.700 --> 01:43.700
propose looking right.

01:43.700 --> 01:47.700
And instead of that, still there are people who want to be heard from outside the committee,

01:47.700 --> 01:49.700
and the justice here, of course, he will give.

01:50.700 --> 01:55.700
I would like to be heard about my secretary, who is a very big replacement, but I want

01:55.700 --> 01:58.700
the position of the Army to be unmissed to be cleared.

01:58.700 --> 02:03.700
Mr. Welk made that position clear this morning, and I will read from it this afternoon.

02:03.700 --> 02:08.700
I've classified on it, Sam, before, and I'm out of the fire again.

02:08.700 --> 02:14.700
But I think every witness who has a fight for the Americans just be brought here and just

02:14.700 --> 02:17.700
have to find and to get all the facts on this day.

02:17.700 --> 02:23.700
Now this committee, under the, this here is a hearing, it was your own decision.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.700
You made the rules.

02:24.700 --> 02:29.700
One of the rules that said me, I certainly had to do with the fact that they were going

02:29.700 --> 02:30.700
to be public here.

02:30.700 --> 02:37.700
And if you later said that they would be televised, I see no reason to change the rules

02:37.700 --> 02:43.700
at this time, unless there is a mean bandwidth, some real expediting of the hearing's

02:43.700 --> 02:44.700
that I was carrying on.

02:44.700 --> 02:50.700
And I just like speaking 40 on it, to say that we have a period here in the best of fights

02:50.700 --> 02:54.700
to fight at all the facts in front of this committee, and we are satisfied to continue that

02:54.700 --> 02:57.700
process no matter how long it takes.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.700
And if the other principle is now going to be heard, it's not going to proceed with the

03:01.700 --> 03:02.700
interrogation of the...

03:02.700 --> 03:07.700
I was made in the fight when I came on to adjust them, perhaps if we had a rule, because

03:07.700 --> 03:10.700
we know more of the speeches about exiledering the hearing, and that might exiled

03:10.700 --> 03:11.700
them more than anything else.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.700
There is rapidly approaching the point where he can concur with that observation, but

03:16.700 --> 03:19.700
most does bring eternal in the human draft.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.700
Now, we will begin in the morning and with a consideration of motion which maybe made or

03:24.700 --> 03:28.700
not made, as they are made, who will consider them, and the general subject of expediting

03:28.700 --> 03:29.700
their hearing.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.700
The very position remains unchanged.

03:31.700 --> 03:34.700
He thinks he's having should be expedited.

03:34.700 --> 03:38.700
He thinks that the world has some tremendous challenges confronting it, and so does our

03:38.700 --> 03:39.700
country.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.700
Now, we see the leaves, both the sunnets, and the feet of the reperson in the arms.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.700
It might better be the voting ever, too.

03:44.700 --> 03:51.700
He believes, however, that no system for foreshortening the hearing, could be superimposed upon

03:51.700 --> 03:57.700
the distance, so long as the entities involved claim that by so doing, if it be unfair or unjust

03:57.700 --> 03:58.700
to them.

03:58.700 --> 04:02.700
So unless we can have a meeting of minds, I presume, we will have a long continuation of

04:02.700 --> 04:03.700
that.

04:03.700 --> 04:07.700
I think that as the conclusion of our meeting this morning, Mr. Stone, you had five minutes

04:07.700 --> 04:08.700
ago.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.700
I'll start with you that much.

04:09.700 --> 04:14.700
Mr. Stevens, are you excited?

04:14.700 --> 04:23.700
Mr. Stevens, we discussed with you, did we not, the necessity of tracking into the

04:23.700 --> 04:27.700
an accomplished information in Army intelligence?

04:27.700 --> 04:28.700
That's right.

04:29.700 --> 04:35.700
So before you issue the charges on Mr. Stone and Mr. Stone and my self, we have just

04:35.700 --> 04:41.700
had the fact that it might be extremely important for us to do it, if you would not do

04:41.700 --> 04:46.700
it that is, to win the questions, come in the central question, Army intelligence.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.700
Well, that's under constant study, Senator.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.700
Did you hear my question, Mr. Secretary?

04:51.700 --> 04:53.700
The question is, did I discuss with you?

04:54.700 --> 04:59.700
Well, I conclude in a set of days, of our committee investigating some of this intellectual

04:59.700 --> 05:05.700
trace of Army intelligence, if you yourself, your subordinates did not do that job.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.700
I did not recall that.

05:07.700 --> 05:11.700
So have you, of course, have a great interest in any coming of this intellectual trace of

05:11.700 --> 05:13.700
Army intelligence like you know, I certainly have.

05:13.700 --> 05:20.700
Are you aware, Mr. Secretary, of their report issued, under the termmanship of Mr.

05:20.700 --> 05:27.700
Stone and Mr. Stone, are you aware that the question regarding the coming of this intellectual

05:27.700 --> 05:28.700
trace of Army intelligence?

05:28.700 --> 05:30.700
I don't think that I am out of it.

05:30.700 --> 05:35.700
Do you think Mr. Secretary that having done an offer, how long you have done an offer

05:35.700 --> 05:38.700
now, since February 4, 1952?

05:38.700 --> 05:39.700
That's the heavyweight.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.700
About a year and a half.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.700
About a year and a quarter.

05:43.700 --> 05:50.700
Do you think it's rather unusual that you have never learned this report by the House Committee

05:50.700 --> 05:53.700
in regard to coming of intellectual trace?

05:53.700 --> 05:56.700
That's what it is, I just don't think it's clear.

05:56.700 --> 06:02.700
The report is not a label, a report on Army intelligence, a label that could be in the

06:02.700 --> 06:03.700
floor of the massacre.

06:03.700 --> 06:08.700
In this report, like one of the first in this column, I think it's a very important

06:08.700 --> 06:09.700
report of the massacre.

06:09.700 --> 06:15.700
In this report, like one of the first in this column, this is a very, very important

06:15.700 --> 06:16.700
report of the massacre.

06:16.700 --> 06:20.700
Perhaps the share with the derelicts is known they have the other matters that they might

06:20.700 --> 06:22.700
have done with the case of the audience.

06:22.700 --> 06:23.700
The audience may not.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.700
Mr. Mayor, I have the committee.

06:24.700 --> 06:33.700
There will be no audible manifestations of the approval of any kind of the type.

06:33.700 --> 06:40.700
And that the opportunities have a standing rule that will likely escort from the rules

06:40.700 --> 06:43.700
anybody, anything it and violating the conditions under which you think.

06:43.700 --> 06:47.700
I will not ask the officers to be dexter people who end up with the hearings at that time,

06:47.700 --> 06:50.700
because the share did not succeed in that warning at the beginning of the meeting.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.700
It has now been repeated.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.700
I will ask the officers to be in court this purpose.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.700
I'm going to go back and make a decision.

06:55.700 --> 06:59.700
Mr. Tutton, we've got a file that will remember the people who are in the audience.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.700
39 of the persons who were very orderly, they realized that they were the guests at the committee.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.700
They thought the center was the guests.

07:04.700 --> 07:09.700
When I asked you about coming to Central face of the Army, I heard a loud gustle on the back

07:09.700 --> 07:11.700
of the room trying to come and back there, I think this is fun.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.700
Do you think there's anything funny about coming to Central face of the government?

07:14.700 --> 07:15.700
No, sir.

07:15.700 --> 07:16.700
I'm sorry.

07:16.700 --> 07:17.700
I'm sure you would.

07:17.700 --> 07:22.700
Now, Mr. Secretary, introduce someone, A. Tutton, you never heard of this report,

07:22.700 --> 07:24.700
put out under the permit ship.

07:24.700 --> 07:31.700
A permit from Madden, which makes recommendations insofar as coming to Central face of the

07:31.700 --> 07:33.700
concerned, coming to the Institute as Army Intelligence.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.700
One of the far out.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.700
They say that this was determined.

07:36.700 --> 07:46.700
Mr. Secretary, 1962, the exact date, December 22, 1932, has been several months before you took over.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.700
I'm not familiar with that, but more.

07:49.700 --> 07:54.700
You know, if anyone in your department has gone into the matter, suggest that Mr. Porton.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.700
I do not know that of my own first hand now, but I'd be to make sure they have.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.700
Can I just read you some of the reports?

08:00.700 --> 08:05.700
I read this new inspection with the conversation you and I have had in regards to investigation

08:05.700 --> 08:06.700
of the two.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.700
More amazing to this committee.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.700
In testimony, I read it to the page 8.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.700
More amazing to this committee.

08:12.700 --> 08:17.700
A testimony of three high-ranking American Army officers who were stationed in Army Intelligence

08:17.700 --> 08:22.700
during General Bussard's command of this agency that I believe was 1944 and 1945,

08:22.700 --> 08:25.700
testifying an executive section all three agreed.

08:25.700 --> 08:31.700
There was a pool of both Soviet civilian employees and some military and Army intelligence

08:31.700 --> 08:36.700
who found explanations for almost everything that the Soviet Union did.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.700
These same witnesses told a tremendous effort, they're directed by this group,

08:40.700 --> 08:43.700
to suppress as I come and I still get reports.

08:43.700 --> 08:48.700
The committee likewise heard testimony that stopped ranking Army officers who were too

08:48.700 --> 08:52.700
critical of the Soviets, were by far the Army intelligence.

08:52.700 --> 08:57.700
Have you ever made any attempt to see whether or not those individuals are still there,

08:57.700 --> 08:59.700
or whether they had been removed?

08:59.700 --> 09:02.700
But that's the duty day in 1944 and 1945.

09:02.700 --> 09:03.700
That's not in my part.

09:03.700 --> 09:09.700
I think this report was issued in 1910, but what's heard is it's referring to General Bussard's command?

09:09.700 --> 09:14.700
As I recall, General Bussard was in command of this agency to in 1944 and 1945 on any mistake

09:14.700 --> 09:20.700
and you can ask one of your age back there about your due to the command of your life.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.700
When it turned with the secretary, I'm not blaming you for what General Bussard did.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.700
You were not here, but I'm asking you whether or not.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.700
No, a lot of us are not here.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.700
That's not my fault.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.700
I'm asking you whether or not.

09:30.700 --> 09:35.700
If you were to practice the Court of the late 1952, about two months before you took over,

09:35.700 --> 09:43.700
for the use, instituted any proceeding, any theft, either after this report or after my conversation with you,

09:43.700 --> 09:48.700
to find out who the three Army officers were to follow them and to get their testimony,

09:48.700 --> 09:52.700
and then find removed those coming of the Thursday were still there.

09:52.700 --> 09:53.700
Did you do anything at all?

09:53.700 --> 09:55.700
I talked to the secretary.

09:55.700 --> 09:56.700
My secretary said,

09:57.700 --> 10:01.700
What do you think I inquire, as I directed you off in 1944 and 1945,

10:01.700 --> 10:06.700
embodied in a report years later in two, but before the secretary took over,

10:06.700 --> 10:11.700
how can it be material, whether on in 1944 or 1945, in the theory?

10:11.700 --> 10:13.700
But the panel don't look at what's left of the theory.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.700
Yes, the secretary decided to file the care of the law,

10:17.700 --> 10:22.700
and the objection that if the question goes to the point of whether or not the officer is the legend,

10:22.700 --> 10:25.700
to have been charged towards communism in 1944 and 1945,

10:25.700 --> 10:30.700
I was there now, and whether the secretary has determined to find out whether or not they are there now,

10:30.700 --> 10:31.700
it would be a certain question.

10:31.700 --> 10:35.700
However, the time was expired, so he will have to rephrase it, and he don't have.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.700
And if you think it.

10:36.700 --> 10:41.700
While the rounds are going around, let's return to our studios to cut the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.700
This is ABC Television Network.

10:44.700 --> 10:53.700
National World's Vice-Rocke America, on ambassadors,

10:53.700 --> 10:58.700
Basement, Metropolitan, the sling now is the next, and here's the big-sized farm cell.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.700
A famous national member of Family Sudan, factory delivery, George, for only $1,560.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.700
That's your next dealers now.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.700
Modern hospitality calls for licensed customers.

11:08.700 --> 11:12.700
All the property got a cotton location that George has to be present without selling.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.700
September, I think it was in 1945.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.700
No further questions.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.700
Any objections?

11:18.700 --> 11:19.700
We'll proceed.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.700
Thank you, sir.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.700
Mr. Corona, thank you.

11:22.700 --> 11:27.700
Mr. Secretary, the manager of timing and ask the secretary about his army experience now, Senator McCarty.

11:27.700 --> 11:31.700
I have a few of the fewer and not-immemium intelligence in 1944 and 1945.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.700
The factory might not be responsible for going on today.

11:34.700 --> 11:38.700
I would suggest that Senator timing can listen a bit more closely and follow the expressments.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.700
Senator Brees, those are Marching Your-Your-Your-Question, the Wednesday-Mount-Anne-Law.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.700
Senator Brees, if you-

11:45.700 --> 11:49.700
Mr. Brees, I'm sure Brees, Senator McCarty, you should not comment on the question adopted by the members of the committee.

11:49.700 --> 11:52.700
The committee that's eliminated the advisory authority for the Secretary.

11:52.700 --> 11:58.700
Mr. Secretary, you understand that we're not talking about what you might have done in 1944 and 1945.

11:58.700 --> 12:03.700
We're just talking about what you might have done after you became Secretary of the Army.

12:03.700 --> 12:04.700
You understand that, huh?

12:04.700 --> 12:05.700
Yes, sir?

12:05.700 --> 12:10.700
I'm sure that you and I will agree that here's where our communists in highest positions in Army intelligence.

12:10.700 --> 12:15.700
In 1944 and 1945, but they just wouldn't pull up their camp.

12:15.700 --> 12:19.700
Another own free will steal away and leave that very important position.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.700
We'd agree on that with them.

12:21.700 --> 12:27.700
Well, yes, sir, but in 1944 and 1945, we had allies in Williams, the former state.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.700
So, yes.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.700
And that's certainly not the justification for having an in-man-forty-five.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.700
I think it was wrong when I'm asking this person.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.700
You agree with me, I assume?

12:36.700 --> 12:41.700
That if this report is correct that there were communists and info-fettas, they too.

12:41.700 --> 12:49.700
And when he positions in 45, that the odds are that they are still there and that someone has removed them,

12:49.700 --> 12:55.700
my question was to the point of further enough, since you have taken over, but you took any steps to remove them.

12:55.700 --> 12:58.700
I say the odds are that they are definitely not there.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.700
The odds are what you're based on, Mr. Secretary.

13:01.700 --> 13:08.700
Well, I just think that the continuing process going on in V2 all the time of investigation and research,

13:08.700 --> 13:16.700
and I think if there were communists in there, I don't know if I would have to be proved on that one.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.700
If they were, I would not worry much that they were there now.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.700
Well, now, General Parkford is ahead of V2.

13:22.700 --> 13:26.700
I assume it's very much with the responsibility of removing communists.

13:26.700 --> 13:29.700
Any head of V2, whether it's Parkford, you're Boeing or anyone else would be.

13:29.700 --> 13:35.700
Let's take the archipelago. General Parkford, while he was in, while he's head of V2 on the U.S. Man,

13:35.700 --> 13:38.700
have the responsibility of removing communists. That's right.

13:38.700 --> 13:39.700
Go ahead.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.700
And did you remove him?

13:41.700 --> 13:44.700
Because you found that he was completely incumptured.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.700
I did not.

13:45.700 --> 13:51.700
Did you tell me Mr. Secretary that you didn't have enough to call in before the committee?

13:51.700 --> 13:54.700
That you incumptured and removed him because you felt he was incumptured?

13:54.700 --> 13:58.700
Did you know that if you were, we'd cover all this and say the touch of the money.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.700
I'll sign it on the car, but I'll be glad that they were just against the money.

14:01.700 --> 14:02.700
We'll cover it quickly.

14:02.700 --> 14:03.700
We covered it all before.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.700
I'll send you to the committee to fix it.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.700
I'm right here at the tech phase.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.700
That has been covered thoroughly before.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.700
Apparently, it's been worn threat by him.

14:12.700 --> 14:16.700
And I object to any further questioning in respect to General Parkford.

14:16.700 --> 14:17.700
It's competency-oriented.

14:17.700 --> 14:18.700
Mr. Chairman.

14:18.700 --> 14:19.700
The inspection has been covered.

14:19.700 --> 14:20.700
Mr. Chairman.

14:20.700 --> 14:21.700
I think they cannot see the seat.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.700
Have you asked those questions before?

14:22.700 --> 14:24.700
Mr. Chairman, there is nothing worn but there.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.700
We're talking about coming and joining our army in telecom.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.700
If we can waste time with teachers here for hours this morning,

14:31.700 --> 14:34.700
and always ask him in about how all the different centers are available,

14:34.700 --> 14:35.700
except I'm hearing them.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.700
Then I can have two minutes, I think.

14:37.700 --> 14:41.700
You ask the Secretary about the removal of a man who will be now poiled,

14:41.700 --> 14:42.700
and I remove the coming.

14:42.700 --> 14:48.700
The Secretary has told me that he feels the coming of the removal.

14:48.700 --> 14:52.700
And I want to question him as much as I can in the vigil as a removal.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.700
What's that in the vigil?

14:53.700 --> 14:55.700
We're in charge of removing him.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.700
Are you suggesting that General Parkford was a communist?

14:57.700 --> 14:59.700
I'm not suggesting him that.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.700
Well, I want to know about that.

15:01.700 --> 15:02.700
But you don't answer my question?

15:02.700 --> 15:03.700
Oh, Chairman.

15:03.700 --> 15:04.700
I'll tell you.

15:04.700 --> 15:08.700
Actually, I say again that on yesterday in life, life weep.

15:08.700 --> 15:14.700
Secretary was examined very closely with respect to the qualifications of General Parkford.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.700
I highly agree with Secretary on that,

15:16.700 --> 15:18.700
and I think it is the men that say,

15:18.700 --> 15:22.700
wait for just a minute's time to repeat those questions with respect to General Parkford.

15:22.700 --> 15:26.700
And I suggest the center of democracy be required to place on to some new subjects.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.700
Mr. Secretary, do you have an office there,

15:29.700 --> 15:34.700
and any security risk to fund this from G2?

15:34.700 --> 15:36.700
I'll have to check it up, Senator.

15:36.700 --> 15:37.700
Let the back for you.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.700
So do you know of any of this time?

15:39.700 --> 15:40.700
I don't care how much my head knows.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.700
It was this time you're not aware of a single security risk.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.700
It was the vendor from G2.

15:45.700 --> 15:51.700
Senator McLeod, I can't carry all the facts about every part of this great army fed all over the world in my head.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.700
There's just thousands of things that I don't know if it's appropriate to do with this.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.700
I have a very collective memory that was going to come to you.

15:58.700 --> 16:05.700
Now, from phase 14, the report states the United States Congress

16:05.700 --> 16:12.700
to investigate the wartime and postwar operations of Army intelligence and the counterintelligence agency.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.700
It was pointed out to our committee in executive seconds.

16:15.700 --> 16:20.700
It's quite a number of employees in G2 who were suspected of communist or left-wing sensibilities.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.700
Or it transferred to CIA.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.700
Yes, the CIA.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.700
Did anyone ever bring this to your attention?

16:28.700 --> 16:31.700
I thought I was not familiar with the report on them as far as they put the first time.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.700
Mr. Secretary, isn't my call to report to your attention?

16:34.700 --> 16:35.700
I'll read you the next investigation.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.700
I do not recall any buts.

16:37.700 --> 16:41.700
Do you recall that I ever, just just with you the necessity of your chasing after the war?

16:41.700 --> 16:43.700
Of your chasing action, D2?

16:43.700 --> 16:44.700
Just with fresh your recollection.

16:44.700 --> 16:48.700
Did I tell you that if we started checking the D2?

16:48.700 --> 16:51.700
That'd be the usual hassle of our corporate security information.

16:51.700 --> 16:52.700
What does not?

16:52.700 --> 16:54.700
And I saw the security partner.

16:54.700 --> 16:55.700
I thought you were around that time.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.700
I thought you were just trying to find some of the do-that.

16:57.700 --> 16:58.700
Don't you recall that?

16:58.700 --> 17:00.700
I do not.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.700
And any, any adventures?

17:05.700 --> 17:06.700
Let me answer this.

17:06.700 --> 17:10.700
The other day you thought that you had asked the FBI

17:10.700 --> 17:12.700
to make the investigation the fourth month.

17:12.700 --> 17:13.700
No.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.700
Am I right from this?

17:14.700 --> 17:16.700
That is not the usual function of the FBI.

17:16.700 --> 17:21.700
That the unit should do that with the Army intelligence.

17:23.700 --> 17:27.700
If I'm curious to know what the ginsengence of confidence in your own intelligence agency,

17:27.700 --> 17:29.700
or how you have bypassed Army intelligence,

17:29.700 --> 17:31.700
and ask the FBI to do it.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.700
May I say I think it is a good idea to ask the FBI to do it?

17:33.700 --> 17:35.700
If you would have called their recommendation.

17:35.700 --> 17:36.700
Mr. Chairman?

17:36.700 --> 17:37.700
Yes, question of the security.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.700
I think it's a good idea to ask, Mr. Secretary.

17:39.700 --> 17:45.700
Did you or not say the other day that you had asked the FBI to investigate the fourth month?

17:45.700 --> 17:46.700
I did.

17:46.700 --> 17:47.700
You did.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.700
That's it.

17:48.700 --> 17:49.700
You part?

17:49.700 --> 17:51.700
The Secretary of State Department of Justice.

17:51.700 --> 17:55.700
Well, did the question go that the University will not conclude the Secretary of State what the question was.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.700
Was there one water we were able to do?

18:00.700 --> 18:01.700
No.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.700
Council asked a clarifying question with Alan TOA.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.700
I thought perhaps the Secretary would not carry these lines in this meeting.

18:06.700 --> 18:07.700
I think that's right.

18:07.700 --> 18:08.700
I'll be right back.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.700
In any event, let me ask you this.

18:14.700 --> 18:18.700
The other day, you said that you had asked the FBI to make the investigation at Fort Monmouth.

18:18.700 --> 18:22.700
Now, am I correct in this that that is not the usual function of the FBI?

18:22.700 --> 18:25.700
That the unit which should do that would be the Army Intelligence.

18:25.700 --> 18:30.700
I'm curious to know whether you didn't have confidence in your own intelligence agency,

18:30.700 --> 18:34.700
or why you might ask Army Intelligence and ask the FBI to do it.

18:34.700 --> 18:39.700
I think it is a good idea to ask the FBI to do it if you follow the recommendation.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.700
That's a long and complicated question with the staff.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.700
I thought I answered the best I can.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.700
We certainly did not buy cash for Army Intelligence.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.700
They were in its volume completely at all times.

18:49.700 --> 18:53.700
We have a very close working arrangement with the FBI as I pointed out before.

18:53.700 --> 18:59.700
We have a full-time representative, so you know, see two intelligence divisions of the FBI.

18:59.700 --> 19:03.700
And we utilize their facilities and they utilize ours.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.700
They are close working relationships.

19:05.700 --> 19:10.700
And when we invited the FBI on a tentative April 1953,

19:10.700 --> 19:12.700
to make this investigation,

19:12.700 --> 19:14.700
to not bypassing our own people's hall,

19:14.700 --> 19:19.700
it was simply supplementing and making sure that the proper kind of a job was done so far as we were able to do it.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.700
You didn't follow me.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.700
Mr. Steven, you said you didn't recall.

19:24.700 --> 19:29.700
You're right, it's just me, the Susan, the Deputy of the Investigations Army Intelligence.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.700
At the same point, the Attorney General,

19:32.700 --> 19:34.700
I know that there has been a communist in the suspect,

19:34.700 --> 19:36.700
and you sent out a refresher like a lecture.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.700
Did I know on September 28th last year,

19:39.700 --> 19:42.700
give you the name of the major,

19:42.700 --> 19:48.700
tell you that he could give you great detailed information about current communist in the suspect?

19:48.700 --> 19:53.700
Did you not then, and I might suggest, follow that measure,

19:53.700 --> 19:58.700
did you not spend about two hours with him discussing communist in the suspect?

19:58.700 --> 20:03.700
How many of the intel patients of Army intelligence?

20:03.700 --> 20:09.700
Not that, not that, I mean, intelligence and more than that intel patient, and anywhere it is not.

20:09.700 --> 20:15.700
You recall the major's name, and I'm not asking for the name now, but you recall the name?

20:15.700 --> 20:17.700
No, but I'm sure I could look it up.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.700
I will pass the back to you.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.700
I was just a phone call.

20:21.700 --> 20:25.700
That's, that's not the major public wants to share it for orders.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.700
It's up to refresher like a lecture.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.700
When you put that in your pocket, I turned up with the secretary.

20:30.700 --> 20:31.700
Okay.

20:31.700 --> 20:37.700
Now that you see that, do you remember that I, after discussing communist infiltration in the Army intelligence,

20:37.700 --> 20:40.700
I suggest that you, that you see that particular major?

20:40.700 --> 20:43.700
I remember you were suggesting that the prosecutor followed.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.700
Yes, I don't remember all the other words you used about that.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.700
Right, and you did, you did the senior.

20:48.700 --> 20:49.700
I did.

20:49.700 --> 20:50.700
And you spent about two hours with me?

20:50.700 --> 20:51.700
No, not that long.

20:51.700 --> 20:52.700
How long?

20:53.700 --> 20:56.700
Well, I should thank you, just as I guess.

20:56.700 --> 20:59.700
I could remember, I think about maybe 40 minutes, something like that.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.700
40 minutes.

21:00.700 --> 21:05.700
And now your number is refreshed, so you recall.

21:05.700 --> 21:10.700
That I gave you his name during the course of a conversation with we's hands.

21:10.700 --> 21:18.700
In regard to communist infiltration of Army intelligence, at the time I suggested that you conduct the investigation.

21:19.700 --> 21:20.700
And really about that, Bert?

21:20.700 --> 21:22.700
And I told you we couldn't investigate everything.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.700
I did not recall that.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.700
Well, here's my old Mr. Secretary.

21:27.700 --> 21:39.700
Now, why I asked you to talk to Mr. Dutton about this, because you thought that he had some information on matters that it was a good thing for me to know about.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.700
And did you think he had information for you?

21:43.700 --> 21:49.700
Well, I just like to say this, but I was not particularly impressed with it.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.700
He did the investigation.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.700
Current time in the infiltration.

21:53.700 --> 21:54.700
In the Army intelligence.

21:54.700 --> 21:55.700
Not intelligence.

21:55.700 --> 21:56.700
I spoke of that.

21:56.700 --> 21:57.700
It's not inclusive.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.700
But I mean, I should discuss that.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.700
One night he discussed that as well as other things.

22:01.700 --> 22:02.700
Many other things.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.700
And he gave you name.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.700
And even, isn't he?

22:07.700 --> 22:09.700
He mentioned very often.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.700
As I say, I was my evaluation of the information.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.700
It was not too.

22:15.700 --> 22:16.700
I did.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.700
It was inaccurate, my evaluation.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.700
But I didn't evaluate it too highly.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.700
Let's forget how you learned it.

22:21.700 --> 22:32.700
Did this major give you the name of individuals who we considered communists who were at that particular day, the 20th, 1953?

22:32.700 --> 22:36.700
In Army intelligence having access to our intelligence reports.

22:36.700 --> 22:37.700
I don't recall that he did.

22:37.700 --> 22:38.700
No.

22:38.700 --> 22:43.700
Well, now, do you think it might be a good idea to be telling back to him and get the information?

22:43.700 --> 22:47.700
But I said I did not evaluate the information too highly, kind of, partly.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.700
I've got other sources of information and I think it's an endless of periods.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.700
Which I rather rely on.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.700
Did you ever turn the...

22:56.700 --> 22:58.700
Did you make a number on them?

22:58.700 --> 23:00.700
What the major has told you?

23:00.700 --> 23:03.700
I think I may have scratched the note or two.

23:03.700 --> 23:11.700
Well, you make very lengthy memorandum about the time they've signed the private I'm just wondering if you made any memorandum about this major gave you the name.

23:11.700 --> 23:12.700
Oh, oh.

23:12.700 --> 23:15.700
The time you had to tell us just a little on a scratch that I taught my class.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.700
You won't have a good name.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.700
The time is...

23:18.700 --> 23:19.700
The time is expired.

23:19.700 --> 23:20.700
Uh, the defense?

23:20.700 --> 23:21.700
I have no question.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.700
The defense is in the service to my lesson.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.700
The defense is out.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.700
I'll take a little time here.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.700
I think you'll let me wasn't there.

23:31.700 --> 23:34.700
But, uh, I'm the most sensitive about the...

23:34.700 --> 23:40.700
Though I've just decided to take a great deal of time and making speeches about expediting the hearing.

23:40.700 --> 23:44.700
I have some figures here that I'd like to read into the record of this time.

23:44.700 --> 23:47.700
At the hearing Thursday morning, May 6th.

23:47.700 --> 23:50.700
There were 18,800 plus words.

23:50.700 --> 23:55.700
The Denim McCarthy and his counsel took 6,200 or 33 percent.

23:55.700 --> 23:59.700
All the others who taught,

23:59.700 --> 24:02.700
from 11 as an average, including the counsel,

24:02.700 --> 24:05.700
who had not limited, as you know, by time,

24:05.700 --> 24:08.700
as all the time he wants to establish the facts.

24:08.700 --> 24:13.700
They took 12,640 or 67 percent.

24:13.700 --> 24:17.700
The hearing the afternoon of May 6th.

24:17.700 --> 24:26.700
35 percent of the words that were at that hearing were uttered by Denim McCarthy or his counsel.

24:27.700 --> 24:31.700
And on Friday, May 7th, the last hearing before today.

24:31.700 --> 24:35.700
Out of 15,377 words,

24:35.700 --> 24:42.700
7,403 or 48 percent were uttered by Denim McCarthy and his counsel.

24:42.700 --> 24:46.700
All the others, including the counsel for the committee,

24:46.700 --> 24:49.700
some 11,

24:49.700 --> 24:55.700
buttered, 30,790,6, and so forth, or 60 percent.

24:55.700 --> 25:00.700
Now, I do not raise these figures in a further contention.

25:00.700 --> 25:07.700
Mr. Gammon, but I think it's fair to say that the senators on this committee have had very little to do,

25:07.700 --> 25:12.700
with the length of the testimony with respect to Secretary Stephen.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.700
That's all I have to say.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.700
Any defenders in my right have any questions?

25:16.700 --> 25:17.700
Injection?

25:17.700 --> 25:18.700
Go well.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.700
In the metrics.

25:20.700 --> 25:24.700
Mr. Secretary, under his family's command,

25:24.700 --> 25:27.700
is the chairman's counting words.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.700
That's his privilege if he wants to.

25:29.700 --> 25:34.700
Let me ask you this, regardless of the number of words that were uttered,

25:34.700 --> 25:42.700
I assume you would agree with me that we still haven't been able to guess from you the names,

25:42.700 --> 25:49.700
those, the names of those who gave special duty to the final promotion,

25:49.700 --> 25:54.700
honorable discharges to a communist major.

25:54.700 --> 25:55.700
Objection?

25:55.700 --> 25:57.700
Oh, it's like the question.

25:57.700 --> 25:59.700
Objection is the same.

25:59.700 --> 26:02.700
Both these objections are the same, then I would like to...

26:02.700 --> 26:04.700
I had withdrawn the questions that the chairman wants to have been.

26:04.700 --> 26:06.700
The Jackson of the President has withdrawn.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.700
I would like to ask you this, Mr. Chair.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.700
Chair has gone, you have withdrawn the question.

26:10.700 --> 26:11.700
The same as others, and I cheated.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.700
I did not know you.

26:12.700 --> 26:17.700
Mr. Secretary, you understand the person, Mr. Siaming and the Council's words.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.700
This is important.

26:19.700 --> 26:23.700
The apparently accounted for me, I said, my name is Siaming and you've counted words,

26:23.700 --> 26:24.700
not this is important.

26:24.700 --> 26:29.700
You also counted the words of Mr. Stevens' answer and I described those immediately.

26:29.700 --> 26:32.700
Great old son of the party, that you bring that point out,

26:32.700 --> 26:35.700
since the Jackson pointed it out, in the fact that all of that,

26:35.700 --> 26:38.700
the all the words of the 52 percent,

26:38.700 --> 26:41.700
as it gains the 48 percent to your side,

26:41.700 --> 26:44.700
as they hurry and try to include the words of the Secretary of the Army,

26:44.700 --> 26:46.700
and everybody else do that, anything.
