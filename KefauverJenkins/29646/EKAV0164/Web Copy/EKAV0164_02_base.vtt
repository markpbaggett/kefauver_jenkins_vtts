WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Entipment.

00:07.440 --> 00:17.400
And.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.600
I think we just met the

00:21.600 --> 00:26.360
Mr. Steven's words by a refuse to get.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.380
Mr.

00:27.380 --> 00:28.980
I think quite well.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.240
The Senate can understand.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.240
At the point of order.

00:31.240 --> 00:36.200
The just for clarification, the percentages I gave included

00:36.200 --> 00:38.680
everything that was sent by Secretary Steven,

00:38.680 --> 00:40.880
and everybody else is tested by the air.

00:40.880 --> 00:41.880
Oh, right.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.520
I only brought this up, Mr. Cameron.

00:44.520 --> 00:48.200
Because I wanted the Senate to consider that I thought

00:48.200 --> 00:51.940
his charge that the senators had delayed the hearing

00:51.940 --> 00:53.240
brutal little unfair.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.080
All right, all right.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.280
Mr. Secretary.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.800
I'm not doing that to you on that point.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.280
If I can, it's just like a 30.

00:59.280 --> 01:02.120
So, just let it go.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.320
Mr. Secretary.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.760
Mr. Secretary Earl Broder testified.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.600
And this was this was long before you were

01:21.600 --> 01:24.200
selected early on.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.000
So that you obviously could not be responsible for the

01:27.000 --> 01:30.800
conditions with existence of that plan.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.840
Let's make that very clear.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.040
But I'm asking you these questions because you and I know

01:35.040 --> 01:38.960
if the communists get to meet this, do you agree with me?

01:38.960 --> 01:42.320
But if the members of the communist and the terrorists

01:42.320 --> 01:45.440
get any way to keep a position in the military,

01:45.440 --> 01:47.840
that would be one of their ideal births

01:47.840 --> 01:50.120
as far as the communists are concerned.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.640
Hi, I'm Grace.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.760
I feel that when we find a certain number there in one

01:55.760 --> 02:00.120
year, unless there is proof that they have been removed,

02:00.120 --> 02:03.120
we can assume that they didn't resign two or three or four

02:03.120 --> 02:03.640
years later.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.600
But except to get a one point.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.920
I'm not clear about that question, that, Senator.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.240
I don't believe there are any of those kind of folks there.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.000
All right, well, let's move into this question.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.400
You're the secretary of the Army.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.760
You have indicated a number of times

02:17.760 --> 02:20.120
that you're interested in removing time.

02:20.120 --> 02:20.640
Correct.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.480
And you know I've had a sizable number of discussions about

02:23.480 --> 02:25.880
that most women are in a completely pleasant vein,

02:25.880 --> 02:27.680
is that right?

02:27.680 --> 02:29.920
I wouldn't say sizable number, no.

02:29.920 --> 02:30.760
Down.

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
And we have time anyway.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.920
That's it.

02:32.920 --> 02:38.000
Now, do you agree with me that if you find communists

02:38.000 --> 02:41.040
in the military as of a certain date,

02:41.040 --> 02:44.240
that if they fare a function that they are still there,

02:44.240 --> 02:48.640
unless it can be shown that they have been removed,

02:48.640 --> 02:50.960
is that a fare function of secretary?

02:50.960 --> 02:51.960
That they're still there?

02:51.960 --> 02:53.440
No, it's not a fare assumption.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.840
I don't believe they are there.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.920
In other words, you think it's an a fare assumption

02:56.920 --> 03:00.200
to say they resign or less, even with no proof

03:00.200 --> 03:01.640
that they have been portably removed?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.320
Well, any number of things that have happened,

03:06.320 --> 03:07.520
not the least of which is, they've

03:07.520 --> 03:10.480
sort of been transferred to some other department,

03:10.480 --> 03:12.480
department or non-centred authority.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.880
Well, we do have the committee statements.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.320
Some of them were referred to CIA.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.880
You wouldn't consider that non-centred, would you?

03:20.880 --> 03:21.720
Delta.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.280
I just said that very sensitive.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.040
Right.

03:24.040 --> 03:28.120
Now, Mr. Secretary, here is the testimony of Mr. Browder.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.120
And I take this from a report.

03:31.120 --> 03:37.000
David, let's see, just a minute.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.640
Does that mean I'm a communist founder?

03:40.640 --> 03:41.960
That's awfully funny, isn't it?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.840
It's like a theory.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.640
What's terribly funny?

03:46.640 --> 03:48.320
Here's the guest to be pleased in order.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.080
I am asking you, Mr. Secretary,

03:54.080 --> 03:57.280
not about any communist activities in your part.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.760
I know of them.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.840
I just very much.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.480
They'll accept to the members.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.400
I just like very much.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.320
But we are talking about, we're talking about your attempt

04:11.320 --> 04:14.080
to call off the hearings, which

04:14.080 --> 04:18.500
was exposing communist in your plan,

04:18.500 --> 04:23.280
fine-toons and given a kill here, the fine-toons

04:23.280 --> 04:27.800
protect and cover up those who are responsible for keeping

04:27.800 --> 04:30.400
individual funds in those jobs.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.800
There's no claim by anyone you know of that you were a communist,

04:34.800 --> 04:38.280
a symbolizer.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.160
I know, but when it was a very clear view at all times,

04:41.160 --> 04:43.560
and I felt that you were anti-communist,

04:43.560 --> 04:46.120
I've also been very clear to you.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.720
So I thought that you were very naively and unintelligently

04:49.720 --> 04:50.560
anti-communist.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.240
You know that, Mr. Secretary.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.840
Now let's get back to the question.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.240
Mr. Browder testified.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.240
Yes.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.440
If the senator from which constant is about

05:04.440 --> 05:07.760
to read the testimony of one or about it,

05:07.760 --> 05:09.720
I must respectfully object to you,

05:09.720 --> 05:12.440
the most competent, all-no-possible theory

05:12.440 --> 05:17.120
in the determination of these issues.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.320
Mr. Mayor, can you please just

05:20.320 --> 05:21.560
that senator McGregor.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.400
Please.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.880
That the testimony of Earl Barrett

05:23.880 --> 05:26.520
is just the competent testimony before senator

05:26.520 --> 05:27.600
Hill commits.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.320
Would the chairman like to hear the chairman

05:30.320 --> 05:32.560
like to send a text?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.960
Would the chairman like to hear from me on the point of order?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.440
Point on the objection of Mr. Johnson's rise.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.960
The chairman would make the chairman like to.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.200
The chairman would make the chairman.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.640
And I think I know what I'm doing.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.360
I have been chairman of this committee.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.440
While we dug out a sizable number of formulas.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.960
I've been a lawyer, I've been a judge,

05:52.960 --> 05:55.080
and I'm not asking you to trust in thy words.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.600
And I would suggest that the chairman would just

05:57.600 --> 06:01.440
take the time, which he would do if he were in a court

06:01.440 --> 06:04.600
of law, to hear me before he rules.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.080
We can save a lot of time.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.000
Mr. Chairman, the reason I am asking,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.480
rather like the reason I am reading,

06:11.480 --> 06:14.800
some lines from brother's testimony,

06:14.800 --> 06:19.280
is so that I may ask the secretary a question.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.480
Neither would the gentleman of the chair,

06:21.480 --> 06:23.840
known for the question is competent or not,

06:23.840 --> 06:25.920
until I'm asked it.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.280
You may ask it simply why to point out

06:28.280 --> 06:31.040
that nobody around this table, including yourself,

06:31.040 --> 06:33.280
and why I'm sure he has any credence

06:33.280 --> 06:35.200
to the testimony of our own boss.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.240
Mr. Chairman, I have a father to that.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.040
Do not think it's proper to read any excerpt.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.600
Any part of the testimony of one or a abouter.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.720
As I understand it, that's about what the secretary

06:48.720 --> 06:50.520
is about to do.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.840
Now, if you can show it why you're doing it, Senator.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.240
What your theory is.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.960
And in what respect is competent,

07:00.960 --> 07:03.760
I certainly reserve the rights to reverse my advice

07:03.760 --> 07:05.240
to the camera.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.880
Just the very evil counsel.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.640
I don't say that particularly I think you

07:10.640 --> 07:13.200
is one more day woman, which is just for the job.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.440
If he was just waiting looking to my question,

07:16.440 --> 07:18.800
then if he thinks it's not competent,

07:18.800 --> 07:22.160
he can object in a certain rule on us.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.360
I hope that I may now get down to ask the question.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.840
Retreat.

07:27.840 --> 07:33.600
Mr. Secretary, in 1945, those reports

07:33.600 --> 07:37.120
by the Committee on Military Affairs

07:37.120 --> 07:39.760
holding the testimony of Mr. Browder,

07:39.760 --> 07:43.800
and page two, my quote, they are actually

07:43.800 --> 07:47.920
at some 13,000 communists in the armed forces.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.560
Of course, there are communist holding

07:49.560 --> 07:52.560
commissions in the United States Army.

07:52.560 --> 07:57.720
Now let me ask you that if your report

07:57.720 --> 08:01.920
from your intelligence agency,

08:01.920 --> 08:05.840
do not show that the 13,000 were removed,

08:05.840 --> 08:08.720
can we safely assume that some of them

08:08.720 --> 08:10.320
are still there as of today?

08:10.320 --> 08:16.160
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Counsel, Senator McBrady

08:16.160 --> 08:20.160
is making the point that because Earl Browder

08:20.160 --> 08:23.720
testified in 1944 or five that there

08:23.720 --> 08:26.320
were 13,000 communists in the Army,

08:26.320 --> 08:29.320
including the officers.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.600
That is a true statement of facts.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.160
I say this Committee cannot accept it as true.

08:36.160 --> 08:39.840
Neither does the secretary of the Army

08:39.840 --> 08:42.760
have any rights to assume that it is true.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.480
Neither is he bound by any conclusion

08:45.480 --> 08:47.400
that it is true because Earl Browder

08:47.400 --> 08:50.320
has not set it under oath or any other way.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.600
And I do not think it is this proper line

08:52.600 --> 08:54.280
of close examination of the suspect

08:54.280 --> 08:56.840
A and I renew my objection.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.480
Cheryl, at the same point of order

08:58.480 --> 09:01.880
on the ground as the testimony of Earl Browder,

09:01.880 --> 09:05.320
is not considered as factual by the members of this committee.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.960
And I'm sure that that goes also

09:06.960 --> 09:10.800
for the secretary of the Senate of Wisconsin.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.200
Mr. Secretary.

09:13.160 --> 09:18.360
Are you aware of a, in the end, this is before you were

09:18.360 --> 09:19.960
in office, my asses, this is a failure

09:19.960 --> 09:21.920
with another person.

09:21.920 --> 09:27.560
Are you aware of the facts on February 22, 1945?

09:27.560 --> 09:31.000
The award department's made public the information

09:31.000 --> 09:33.880
that it had inaugurated a new policy

09:33.880 --> 09:37.960
by removing the ban on communists.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.520
Are you aware of that order?

09:39.520 --> 09:42.880
No, I do not recall it.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.160
But I may possibly see this down there.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.120
It's not a lot of papers over there.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.400
That's one in 1945, is that?

09:50.400 --> 09:51.800
Yeah. 1945.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.880
February 22, 1945.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.880
And what is the subject?

09:55.880 --> 09:59.280
The award department's made public the information

09:59.280 --> 10:01.240
that it had inaugurated a new policy

10:01.240 --> 10:05.040
by removing the ban on communists.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.320
Well, all I can to testify that communists

10:08.320 --> 10:10.360
have no place in the Army now.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.440
I know what it was in 1945.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.760
You were not aware of that order?

10:15.760 --> 10:19.840
I don't recall specifically about the order.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.800
I think I may have heard some talk about it

10:21.800 --> 10:23.200
that none of it is true.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.120
But what I've been interested in since then

10:25.120 --> 10:27.320
is in an office with the Guests' people out

10:27.320 --> 10:28.800
of the world.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.080
We wonder if you've seen it, to produce a letter with you

10:31.080 --> 10:33.320
wrote to me.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.880
When I wrote to you in regard to this particular order,

10:35.880 --> 10:39.000
you wrote back and referred to it as an order

10:39.000 --> 10:42.800
banning people because of political belief.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.440
Could you have a lot of produce now?

10:46.440 --> 10:48.680
Could we have a day seven here?

10:48.680 --> 10:49.840
I don't know the minute.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.440
But then you don't give us one, too.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.880
Well, let me ask the secretary.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.680
Mr. Secretary, you're at the call.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.040
And somebody was threatening to tell us

10:56.040 --> 10:57.920
you must have a some New York file.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.520
Mr. Secretary.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.600
What file is there?

11:00.600 --> 11:02.000
I don't have it here.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.800
We will get it, I assure you.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.560
Look up, me, I do this.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.520
New recall, I've written me in regard

11:08.520 --> 11:10.040
to this specific order.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.520
Let's look back at that.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.920
Mr. Secretary, did I discuss with you a number of times

11:14.920 --> 11:18.560
the fact that it appeared not to be your fault,

11:18.560 --> 11:20.400
that there was so much infiltration

11:20.400 --> 11:22.640
when you took over office.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.560
And I pointed out this order of 1945.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.680
And we agreed that that was the time

11:28.680 --> 11:31.720
the door was opened up to come you know.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.480
Allowed, they were allowed to keep positions.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.920
And we agreed that it was an unwise order.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.920
And you agreed with me that that would present a problem

11:39.920 --> 11:42.920
for the next 10, 15, 20 years.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.720
Because no matter how diligent you were,

11:45.720 --> 11:48.040
you could not get some of the specific cover if one.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.560
Don't you recall that conversation?

11:49.560 --> 11:50.600
I certainly don't.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.240
Well, you were told the letter you wrote to me

11:52.240 --> 11:53.760
with your secretary.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.840
I remember all having written you a letter, yes.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.400
And the interaction, the interaction with the terrorist case.

11:58.400 --> 11:58.960
Oh, not good luck.

11:58.960 --> 12:03.360
And in my opinion, you referred to this using language

12:03.360 --> 12:05.000
and I stated publicly that last time,

12:05.000 --> 12:06.960
which I thought was not yours.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.920
You're referring to this opening of the door

12:08.920 --> 12:10.280
as the communist.

12:10.280 --> 12:14.080
You referred to it as a removal of the ban against people

12:14.080 --> 12:16.560
because of political belief.

12:16.560 --> 12:21.280
You recall that I, some day, recollects another 100.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.840
Now, Mr. Secretary, let me add to this question.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.280
I think in turn, it's your self-infinance.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.920
Very concise.

12:29.920 --> 12:34.120
You don't think that the communist conspiracy

12:34.120 --> 12:36.160
is nothing but a political belief.

12:36.160 --> 12:40.440
And that language in the letter was not yours, was it?

12:40.440 --> 12:42.360
Well, most of the language in the letter was mine.

12:42.360 --> 12:42.960
I know that.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.040
I don't know what the specific thing you were talking about.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.200
Was it wasn't?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.320
Well, I may have said it didn't sound like it.

12:48.320 --> 12:53.560
I worked with Mr. Adams on getting up the letter to you.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.080
The date of the letter was February 16th,

12:55.080 --> 12:59.720
and so we get to the end of the film.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.080
But I'd also like to, by my side,

13:02.080 --> 13:03.440
while you're looking at that paper,

13:03.440 --> 13:07.200
saying, a moment ago, you said something about indicating

13:07.200 --> 13:09.600
of awful lot of infiltration into the army

13:09.600 --> 13:14.080
at the time that I came into office, I do not accept that.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.680
And I'd like to say right here, now, that this is a great

13:16.680 --> 13:18.880
army, and it's not full of time in it,

13:18.880 --> 13:21.160
and we don't travel.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.480
And I think a very unfair question

13:23.480 --> 13:24.920
is being created.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.440
Again, in the minds of the American people,

13:27.440 --> 13:30.000
who have respected this matter of what you call

13:30.000 --> 13:33.840
communist infiltration in the army, and I object to it.

13:33.840 --> 13:39.280
When this time is getting fired, Mr. Jenkins, any questions?

13:39.280 --> 13:42.160
Before the rounds go again, let us return to our studios

13:42.160 --> 13:44.680
across the country to permit our stations to identify

13:44.680 --> 13:46.120
themselves.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.360
This is the ABC television network.

13:48.360 --> 13:56.400
An important message from Senator Smatters

13:56.400 --> 13:57.760
about the Miami stories.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.480
This picture ably shows what a few courageous citizens

14:01.480 --> 14:06.240
on his palitations and tough alert police agencies can do

14:06.240 --> 14:10.840
to rid their cities of gang-rans in joints.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.720
See the Miami stories, starting Friday,

14:12.720 --> 14:14.400
the Panama Theater Times Square.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.360
Same as T.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.360
Today's romance.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.360
On the return to the mayor of the Ruggles,

14:23.360 --> 14:25.600
starring Charles Ruggles today at Sixth Fund to the

14:25.600 --> 14:28.360
10.07 W.A.B.C. TV News.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.360
Not to make me any attack upon the army,

14:30.360 --> 14:33.480
it's on those who are belongs to the communists and

14:33.480 --> 14:36.360
spirits, who had instilled by the end of the army.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.360
And it's not, I'm sure you'll agree with your name.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.360
I'm just like a circular, the only one you're interested in

14:40.360 --> 14:41.360
getting these people out.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.360
No.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.360
Doesn't it not mean any of those workers like an aunt?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.360
Do you agree with me?

14:47.360 --> 14:52.360
That is a purpose to the army, the service of the nation,

14:52.360 --> 14:57.360
to expose and dig out out of the military communists.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.360
You've used me in that?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.360
We want all the help we can get from any source,

15:02.360 --> 15:04.360
to get rid of any communists.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.360
No question about that.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.360
And you agree it's not an attack upon the army?

15:07.360 --> 15:10.360
To expose and put them in the majors?

15:10.360 --> 15:13.360
I say that with the publicity that came out

15:14.360 --> 15:16.360
from your statements at the time of the Port Monmouth

15:16.360 --> 15:19.360
hearings was utterly unfair to the army,

15:19.360 --> 15:22.360
utterly unfair to the army.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.360
I might agree with you that some of the publicity,

15:26.360 --> 15:30.360
from day to day, it'd be unfair to various people,

15:30.360 --> 15:32.360
but so what happens as of today,

15:32.360 --> 15:36.360
I don't edit the New York Post, the Washington Post,

15:36.360 --> 15:39.360
the Pine Magazine, the Life Magazine, any of those seats.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.360
I have no control of what they say.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.360
No control over it.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.360
Over there, headlight.

15:48.360 --> 15:54.360
Now, do we agree with the Secretary?

15:54.360 --> 15:57.360
Let's fight that.

15:57.360 --> 16:03.360
Now, getting back to your letter of February 1, 1964,

16:03.360 --> 16:07.360
I beg your pardon, my letter of February 1,

16:07.360 --> 16:10.360
you answered in February 16.

16:11.360 --> 16:17.360
We're talking about the previous order of the military,

16:17.360 --> 16:20.360
which we had discussed before,

16:20.360 --> 16:24.360
to allow the commissioning of Kamina.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.360
And you say, and I quote from your letter,

16:26.360 --> 16:28.360
and your telegram is spoke of a warded department order

16:28.360 --> 16:31.360
of 30 December, 1944,

16:31.360 --> 16:34.360
prohibiting discrimination against the military personnel

16:34.360 --> 16:39.360
because of political belief.

16:39.360 --> 16:44.360
Now, do you consider communism,

16:44.360 --> 16:48.360
the communist conspiracy of political belief?

16:48.360 --> 16:50.360
My answer to this was the Secretary,

16:50.360 --> 16:53.360
because I had been, I was disturbed by this,

16:53.360 --> 16:55.360
because this is the jargon we hear,

16:55.360 --> 16:57.360
not from good Americans like you,

16:57.360 --> 17:01.360
but from the communist who appeared before our committee.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.360
They all refer to communism as a political belief.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.360
That's why I say this, can't be your language,

17:05.360 --> 17:06.360
and I'd like to know who it is.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.360
I'd like to just read on.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.360
I've been investigated to files on that matter,

17:10.360 --> 17:12.360
and I'm asking to say that the directive in question

17:12.360 --> 17:15.360
was rescinded on 4 March 1946,

17:15.360 --> 17:18.360
during the tenure of the late Robert III Patterson,

17:18.360 --> 17:19.360
as Secretary of War.

17:19.360 --> 17:20.360
That's correct.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.360
We discussed that in detail, didn't we?

17:22.360 --> 17:26.360
We discussed that the door was open for a while, didn't we?

17:26.360 --> 17:29.360
50 seconds or just refresh your recollection.

17:29.360 --> 17:35.360
And just final question, didn't you and I discuss in detail

17:35.360 --> 17:40.360
the fact that you were difficult in 1953

17:40.360 --> 17:45.360
was the result to a great extent of the softness

17:45.360 --> 17:48.360
toward communism and this order,

17:48.360 --> 17:51.360
the 1944 plus another order of the Secretary,

17:51.360 --> 17:55.360
the order providing for the destruction of the files,

17:55.360 --> 18:01.360
the files and all of those who were accused of communist activity.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.360
We discussed that in detail, didn't we?

18:03.360 --> 18:05.360
I don't recall that we discussed in detail.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.360
I think there was some mention of it.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.360
I know that you said,

18:08.360 --> 18:10.360
if you've got this letter of February 16th

18:10.360 --> 18:13.360
that you didn't think I'd written a letter.

18:13.360 --> 18:18.360
Now, did you ever check to determine whether or not

18:18.360 --> 18:23.360
these people who are responsible for the not-see people,

18:23.360 --> 18:28.360
who are responsible for the order to destroy the files

18:28.360 --> 18:29.360
and the tenures,

18:29.360 --> 18:32.360
whether or not they are still in the Pentagon?

18:32.360 --> 18:40.360
I say we have constant studies going on on this day.

18:40.360 --> 18:44.360
And I just don't believe that any of those kind of people

18:44.360 --> 18:48.360
there, but all right, we're just interested in you

18:48.360 --> 18:50.360
as you are and get rid of it.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.360
You think I'll wait until you go back ten years?

18:53.360 --> 18:57.360
That's getting back quite a way before the hearing first.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.360
For me to have to try to testify on what went on then.

19:00.360 --> 19:04.360
You think the last time you knew was major for us?

19:04.360 --> 19:07.360
If we left, no more than we knew.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.360
I didn't say that, but I'll say the dog's on cue.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.360
Well now, will your agree with me the one time you knew

19:13.360 --> 19:18.360
in a heat spot could result in the death of this nation?

19:18.360 --> 19:21.360
You mean a heat spot like major for us?

19:21.360 --> 19:24.360
No.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.360
Now, you want to be calling in cover, it's all right

19:27.360 --> 19:30.360
and I ask you a simple question.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.360
You agree that one in the heat spot,

19:33.360 --> 19:35.360
you know, read our laboratory,

19:35.360 --> 19:37.360
the internal communications,

19:37.360 --> 19:40.360
that one in the heat spot having access to the top secret

19:40.360 --> 19:44.360
to this nation could result in the death of this nation.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.360
Can we both agree on that?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.360
There could be such a spot where it would be very serious.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.360
I certainly agree with that 100%.

19:50.360 --> 19:54.360
Now, you don't mean to try to tell us now that you honestly think

19:54.360 --> 19:59.360
that Perez was the last communist in the military?

19:59.360 --> 20:01.360
I didn't say that.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.360
In other words, we can both assume there is still some human

20:03.360 --> 20:04.360
in the military, can't we?

20:04.360 --> 20:06.360
I think we've got to the strong one and see if the length of this play out

20:06.360 --> 20:09.360
is what exactly what we're doing.

20:09.360 --> 20:14.360
And you regard it as your regular regulations during our investigation

20:14.360 --> 20:19.360
to try and weed out any other communist in the military, didn't you?

20:19.360 --> 20:22.360
We've revised and read, we've revised regulations several times

20:22.360 --> 20:23.360
since our then office.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.360
I started on that and my very first day in office,

20:26.360 --> 20:28.360
February 4, 1953.

20:28.360 --> 20:34.360
Mr. Secretary, did you ever discuss with me the personnel

20:34.360 --> 20:39.360
research and procedure division of the Army?

20:39.360 --> 20:41.360
Let's look at the complete title.

20:41.360 --> 20:48.360
The personnel, research, and procedures division of the Army's plan

20:48.360 --> 20:50.360
and the money just to refresh your recollections

20:50.360 --> 20:53.360
and what I'm talking about.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.360
I assume this is not security information.

20:55.360 --> 21:00.360
They're task, research, Army mobilization.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
Let me just pass this to you.

21:01.360 --> 21:07.360
This might be claimed by some to be security information

21:07.360 --> 21:12.360
about describing the function of this division.

21:20.360 --> 21:28.360
Well, the Secretary is Mr. Chairman.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.360
Mr. Chairman, while the Secretary is looking at this,

21:31.360 --> 21:38.360
I wonder if the chair could ask for a copy of the statements

21:38.360 --> 21:43.360
made by General Mark Spar, a few days ago, in regards to

21:43.360 --> 21:45.360
coming to think of a price.

21:45.360 --> 21:51.360
I'm inclined to think that that should be available to the committee.

21:51.360 --> 21:54.360
I may tell you a tremendous respect for General Mark

21:54.360 --> 21:59.360
and I've heard so many rumors about the statement I'd like to know.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.360
That deal with the subject matter of the inquiry

22:02.360 --> 22:04.360
may be sharing fire, I'm not familiar with the statement.

22:04.360 --> 22:10.360
Yes, it deals with communism so price-money under fire.

22:10.360 --> 22:14.360
I haven't seen the statement I've heard to at least a dozen rumors

22:14.360 --> 22:16.360
here, a couple of people have passed by on how many get to Mark Park.

22:16.360 --> 22:20.360
The statement has made a couple days ago in regards to some of the information.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.360
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.360
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.360
The Secretary, whether he has a statement on fire,

22:24.360 --> 22:27.360
whether he's predicted it, I don't know whether he has it or not.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.360
What about what about the Secretary?

22:29.360 --> 22:33.360
The Sunday was entirely whether he had a statement made by General Mark Spar,

22:33.360 --> 22:37.360
on the subject of communist infiltration and the VR.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.360
Well, a few days ago, no, he's retired.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.360
I wouldn't have any item for my statement.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.360
You don't have a statement.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.360
I probably get it.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.360
I wonder if you would do that, Mr. Secretary.

22:46.360 --> 22:52.360
I don't recognize Senator the title on this.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.360
Mr. President, this is my statement.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.360
I just don't recognize that title.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.360
Mr. President, this is my statement.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.360
Is there anything in there that's security issues?

23:03.360 --> 23:06.360
Is there anything that's not security issues?

23:06.360 --> 23:07.360
In that flip?

23:07.360 --> 23:08.360
Yes.

23:09.360 --> 23:14.360
It describes the work of a...

23:14.360 --> 23:19.360
of the first male research and procedures of vision of the Army.

23:19.360 --> 23:26.360
So that means the security information to read the function of that particular division.

23:26.360 --> 23:41.360
Well, I don't know, frankly, Senator, about that step I would like to,

23:41.360 --> 23:47.360
far as we can, resolve all these matters in favor of getting the facts out on the table.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.360
So, I just want to go ahead and read it about yourself.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.360
Mr. President, you're so good to me, Will.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.360
Senator, may I inquire the date of that for you?

23:55.360 --> 23:58.360
But the date of that document from which you're now reading.

23:58.360 --> 24:04.360
Well, this is merely my own description of the function of a certain division in the military.

24:04.360 --> 24:11.360
Well, may I inquire just what you expect to establish to establish with your...

24:11.360 --> 24:19.360
...genrements about their individuals in that all-important section as of this particular moment.

24:19.360 --> 24:24.360
As the four clock on the 10th day of May, 1954,

24:24.360 --> 24:32.360
those such communist connections and backgrounds of their dangers for the security of this nation, extremely dangerous.

24:32.360 --> 24:38.360
And, Mr. Stevens' office has been negligent in examining these cases.

24:38.360 --> 24:45.360
And that information has been brought to his attention to the best of my knowledge.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.360
I think that all goes to the moat of the...

24:48.360 --> 24:53.360
...initioing the smear against Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cairn, myself, under the call of hearings all.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.360
Because this is something that would have been exposed sooner or later.

24:56.360 --> 25:03.360
I'd like to ask the secretary a few questions on this.

25:03.360 --> 25:07.360
I think the purpose will be very clear of the process.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.360
Well, may I make an observation?

25:11.360 --> 25:13.360
I'll point out in just a minute.

25:13.360 --> 25:24.360
When I've inquired with you, I think, if I understand I've been listening patiently all afternoon on this to find out just what the theory was,

25:24.360 --> 25:38.360
I'd say that certainly, Senator McCarthy has a right under his charges to attempt to prove that Secretary Stevens tried to stop investigation of communist in the army.

25:38.360 --> 25:47.360
Now, if that is the purpose, it seems to me it's been ordered, but if it isn't, then, of course, we're going on and on.

25:47.360 --> 25:51.360
And I suggested the other day, on Thursday, we started in one personnel case.

25:51.360 --> 25:56.360
That was to be the last one, and we've been on. I don't know how many cents, and that's all we've been on.

25:56.360 --> 26:00.360
If Chairman may ask, I think I'll have what the interjection has said.

26:01.360 --> 26:09.360
As I get it, there is an effort now on the part of Senator McCarthy's strategy to face as there are common myths in the army. Is that right, Senator?

26:09.360 --> 26:21.360
No, no, not in this particular hearing, Mr. Seconds, but I think it is important to show at this time the number of times we call attention,

26:22.360 --> 26:34.360
the attention of those in charge to danger situations, the number of times they ignored us, and the fact that they knew that if we were not hands-pung in our investigation,

26:34.360 --> 26:46.360
if the investigation were not stopped, that derelicts of duty would be brought to the attention of the public, and that is the motive for issuing the smear which will effectively stop our investigation.

26:46.360 --> 27:00.360
Although it was a dose of the question of motive behind the issues of the smear on a tone time, but you mean you are attempting to show that you have called attention of this witness, the spectacular Steven?

27:00.360 --> 27:09.360
The fact that there are common myths in the army, and that he's done nothing about it, are not doing it rapidly enough, is that the idea of Senator?

27:10.360 --> 27:29.360
You are all almost frightened, last, almost frightened, that was taken, it brought to the attention all this witness are his subordinates who normally should report to him, and that the information even if not brought to his attention should have been known by him and his subordinates.

27:30.360 --> 27:43.360
In other words, Mr. Chairman, the purpose is to show the derelicts, the fact that they knew that this would be brought to the attention of the public, if they were not successful in calling off the hearings.

27:43.360 --> 27:54.360
If the question of motive may I say I've only got, if I can get answers, I've only got about two or three questions on this, and I intend to turn them out over to Mr. Cohn for some questions on other matters.

27:55.360 --> 28:05.360
Well, you don't claim Senator now that the spectacular Steven's was responsible, and there was no objection may be your examination of it, while it wasn't perhaps it was derelicts or my duties.

28:05.360 --> 28:21.360
You do not claim that he is responsible for a war directive eight or ten years ago, putting a ban on people getting in the army because of political affiliation.

28:22.360 --> 28:31.360
Political affiliation? Yes. Political belief was not used that term. Well, that's the term that we use political belief. No, that is not the term used in the order.

28:31.360 --> 28:39.360
Communists' connection with Mr. Steven's is utter reference to political belief. The order refers to communism.

28:40.360 --> 28:59.360
Now they just the answer counsel's question. I have made it very clear to Mr. Steven. Not only here, but in our conversations with him, the number of times that I have never obviously couldn't blame him for an order that opened the gate to Communists and vital amendments eight or nine years ago.

28:59.360 --> 29:09.360
I have discussed that with him over because that is a key to his problem today. And that is one of the reasons why he must be extremely vigilant getting him out.

29:09.360 --> 29:17.360
But I'm not referring now to a war directive, Mr. Chairman. I'm referring to a matter entirely different.

29:18.360 --> 29:31.360
I understand that your last question is directed to the secretary to determine whether in his opinion there would be any violation of security for you to read the description of the responsibility that you hold in your paper.

29:31.360 --> 29:37.360
That's right. That's what I'm holding your hand. Now, if you look at that, Mr. Steven's action, anyone will answer that question.

29:37.360 --> 29:42.360
Yes, I said go ahead and read it. It's not a little like that. Very well. You may repeat.

29:42.360 --> 29:58.360
This is going to be a no document from any file except my own description of my information of the function of this particular department. The department's personnel research and procedures evasion of the Army. You've heard of that activation.

29:58.360 --> 30:06.360
I do not recognize that. That's the fact that I try to about the vision. Would you ask your age to be such a division? I have already done so.

30:06.360 --> 30:12.360
And they know no decisions. That's correct. Well, not worried if I get wrong in this. I don't know.

30:12.360 --> 30:32.360
Well, let me ask you then. Would you give us the name of the department, which conducts research, makes plan for Army mobilization, setting quotas for men available, plans that you're used by the chiefs of staff and preparing total war plans?

30:32.360 --> 30:36.360
What is the name of that division? If that is not security information.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.360
Yes, sir.

30:39.360 --> 30:44.360
Yes, sir. I like security information. I like to make that comment.

30:44.360 --> 30:50.360
The secretary told me really. The secretary says it is, but I will accept it as being so. I thought he said it was not.

30:50.360 --> 30:59.360
I said to go ahead and read the papers, but now I'm the first of information that Senator McCarley wants. You'll give me that, I'll take it back to all of the office.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.360
I don't know. What is he talking about? I don't know.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.360
Don't you know now? No.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.360
So, you couldn't answer the question what division does with no, sir?

31:08.360 --> 31:11.360
Send his family's part.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.360
Nice, Mr. Chairman. And he send his to my left?

31:14.360 --> 31:17.360
Yes, sir. Send his to the...
