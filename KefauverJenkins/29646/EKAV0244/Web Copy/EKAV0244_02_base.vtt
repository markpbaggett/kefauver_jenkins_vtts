WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
You think so, yes or no?

00:01.600 --> 00:03.560
I saw as an ordinary course.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.160
Can you tell me if you still hear the answer?

00:05.160 --> 00:06.000
Yes or no.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.600
Did you think he was making all of these assignments?

00:08.600 --> 00:10.800
Whoever answer will he be?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.320
Mr. Wells, Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.520
Mr. Smith, Mr. Chairman,

00:13.520 --> 00:14.120
he was yourï¿½.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.320
I think he's the answer, yes.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.200
And I know none of them can make an assignment.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.640
I can't possibly answer, yes or no.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.400
I said this way, Senator Mutt.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.840
I knew that Mr. Adams was not in the ordinary course

00:23.840 --> 00:26.400
of business, making overseas assignments

00:26.400 --> 00:28.000
a solid number one.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.840
Number two, I knew that in the case

00:29.840 --> 00:32.760
I was trying to find Mr. Adams had made a point

00:32.760 --> 00:35.240
of telling us that what was or what not

00:35.240 --> 00:36.880
going to happen to Shine was going to defend

00:36.880 --> 00:38.760
on how Mr. Adams felt about it.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.640
Well, then did you say he was deciding

00:40.640 --> 00:42.320
what to shine, what overseas or not?

00:42.320 --> 00:43.720
I thought that he could have some information,

00:43.720 --> 00:46.160
so that I just could have some information.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.680
Now, if you tell us you thought was a nasty statement,

00:49.680 --> 00:50.440
is that right?

00:50.440 --> 00:52.440
Well, I thought, yes, I thought you did.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.920
And if it's not, is that right?

00:53.920 --> 00:54.920
Here's what I thought about it.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.200
Well, I thought once again, Mr. Cole,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.520
did you think it was a nasty, didn't you?

00:59.520 --> 01:01.520
I know with words and entries, Mr. Cole,

01:01.520 --> 01:02.800
did you think it might have a right?

01:02.800 --> 01:08.360
He said it was an occasion when Mr. Adams got nasty.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.040
Mr. Wells called me, said it's a very close

01:10.040 --> 01:12.720
but it's just my reaction to this statement was,

01:12.720 --> 01:14.160
that's what I think I told him.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.840
I didn't hear what a shine went overseas

01:15.840 --> 01:17.320
or didn't go overseas.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.480
I did not like the idea of Mr. Adams

01:19.480 --> 01:22.600
linking that up with an activation that Mr. Todd and I

01:22.600 --> 01:25.040
were not cooperating with him and telling him investigation.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.600
Well, it didn't make any difference to you.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.640
Did it, whether shine went overseas or not?

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
Not the slightest one.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.200
And the suggestion that he might go overseas wasn't a nasty one?

01:33.200 --> 01:35.240
First, it wasn't a 91.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.560
Any suggestion that his assignment was going to be effective

01:38.560 --> 01:42.240
because Mr. Adams didn't write the way, Mr. Todd and I

01:42.240 --> 01:43.880
were not stopping the investigations

01:43.880 --> 01:45.920
and they were they fully unpleasant suggestions.

01:45.920 --> 01:46.640
And then that.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.200
My question is simple.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.880
Was the idea that shine micro overseas?

01:50.880 --> 01:52.840
Did it that strike you?

01:52.840 --> 01:53.960
Strike that question out.

01:53.960 --> 01:59.000
When Adams said to you, shine may go overseas.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.120
Was that a nasty thing to say?

02:02.120 --> 02:04.400
Are standing by yourself, no?

02:04.400 --> 02:06.800
But standing in the context you thought it was.

02:06.800 --> 02:07.560
Is that right?

02:07.560 --> 02:08.720
Yes, sir, I did.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.200
And I did not ensure this is one of the charts that

02:11.200 --> 02:12.760
exchanged it.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.320
This you ever had with Adams on this point, yes?

02:15.320 --> 02:16.320
No, you're quite wrong.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.960
If any of them it was a chart exchange.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.880
No, I don't think it was a particularly chart exchange.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.200
You remember Mr. Coln that you made a memorandum

02:22.200 --> 02:25.280
of that conversation, do you not?

02:25.280 --> 02:25.960
Is it a memorandum?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.040
I did make a guess.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.400
Well, you did, didn't you?

02:28.400 --> 02:29.960
I mean, does you make a commitment?

02:29.960 --> 02:30.720
I did, yes.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.800
Right.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.840
I don't know where you.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.920
I don't think I made a memorandum of the conversation.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.920
Well, I think you did, I'll come to that.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.680
I think I did.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.640
Now, where are you when you talk to it?

02:39.640 --> 02:40.800
I think what I did, Mr. Weld.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.040
Now, I can bring you where you talk to me.

02:43.040 --> 02:43.520
Yes.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.680
Where were you?

02:44.680 --> 02:47.840
Several places.

02:47.840 --> 02:48.880
Well, where are you in no one?

02:48.880 --> 02:49.640
Oh, one.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.640
Part of the time, sir.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.080
Is that for the Nazi's to guess who was me?

02:53.080 --> 02:53.800
No, I did.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.720
But you don't know.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.480
No, I think it's hard.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.400
We wanted Senator McCocci's office while any of this went on.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.360
No, sir, we were not.

03:00.360 --> 03:00.880
We were in.

03:00.880 --> 03:01.920
Now, when the time came, when?

03:01.920 --> 03:02.640
101.

03:02.640 --> 03:07.200
Then, is that equivalent?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.000
That's not quite.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.520
Then we went down to the basement capitol in the center.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.480
I think that's where we went.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.760
We had lunch.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.720
Then we came back up into the office.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.480
And that's what all of us, 101.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.480
Yes.

03:19.480 --> 03:25.120
By the way, 101, I think, it's me first floor, is that right?

03:25.120 --> 03:26.000
In this building?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yes.

03:27.000 --> 03:27.840
What's your mind?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.600
The little complicated, because it's a...

03:29.600 --> 03:30.400
I know.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.080
I think it is for a tent.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.560
In any event, the video office is on 101.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.800
Is that right?

03:36.800 --> 03:37.960
I have 101.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.360
That is one of the community office.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.360
It's a three or four.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.920
Well, and the senator's office is what number?

03:43.920 --> 03:49.440
428, and that sounds to me as if it's up three flights.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.440
You wrote the 1, 2, 3, 4, all these flights.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.440
That's right.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.080
Now, when you got ready to make a memorandum of the conversation,

03:58.080 --> 04:01.400
that you had had with Mr. Adams, you had up those three flights

04:01.400 --> 04:04.280
before you made it, is that right?

04:04.280 --> 04:05.280
No.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.600
Well, you want to do dictate your memorandum.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.680
Very good, go ahead, miss.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.040
Where was she?

04:10.040 --> 04:10.880
Outside of the perimeter.

04:10.880 --> 04:11.960
Part of the fence.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.960
Right, up on the floor.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.480
So, am I quite clear?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.360
When you got ready to dictate a memorandum

04:17.360 --> 04:19.160
and respect for this conversation,

04:19.200 --> 04:21.680
you went up to her.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.760
No, go ahead and go through her office to dictate a memorandum.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.080
Or I'd stand here, press, and I'd not go up there

04:26.080 --> 04:27.760
when I got ready to dictate a memorandum.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.400
Well, I don't think so much that you went up there for that purpose.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.720
Have you now looked at your memorandum of January 4th?

04:32.720 --> 04:33.240
No, I haven't.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.200
Where am I going now?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.200
Right.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.800
Now, it's got three power glass passengers, Mr. Collins.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.640
Yes.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.120
The first power glass says in substance that Adams is in the office,

04:47.120 --> 04:50.920
and you've been discussing the loyalty board matters, that right?

04:50.920 --> 04:51.520
No, he says it.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.360
Well, now wait a moment.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.840
I just want to know the study's matter.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.960
What one study is, he's been in the office, is that right?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.520
That means 101.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.840
And then he talked about the Army hearings and the loyalty board,

05:01.840 --> 05:03.520
and that he was going to read this, that.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.880
Because if we keep on with the hearings on the Army,

05:05.880 --> 05:08.000
and particularly if we fall in over the world,

05:08.000 --> 05:09.720
it's important to say it's kind of this.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.960
You will fight us in every way this way.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.360
I'll just ask if it represents that,

05:12.360 --> 05:14.520
when I short miss someone.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.360
Get along.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.080
Well, if you were discussing,

05:17.080 --> 05:19.760
the Army hearings and the loyalty board weren't you?

05:19.760 --> 05:22.720
And you dealt with that in the first paragraph.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.640
Now, in the second paragraph, you have something

05:24.640 --> 05:28.120
to say about a man named Hasden, who was once on a board,

05:28.120 --> 05:31.960
and somebody else that was on the board prior to that.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.520
Is that right?

05:33.520 --> 05:34.680
What's that?

05:34.680 --> 05:38.720
And then lastly, you have five lines in which you say

05:38.720 --> 05:40.920
that Adams talked about a law partnership.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.880
That's right, he did.

05:41.880 --> 05:45.320
Well, now, if you're calling, we don't find,

05:45.320 --> 05:47.920
the eight or well-known word expired.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.040
I suggest you to first and then to question the...

05:50.040 --> 05:52.440
I think I better start it when I come again.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.240
Good day, sir.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.840
Hey, the sentence of that seven or four,

05:55.840 --> 05:57.160
the next question can be asked.

05:57.160 --> 05:57.840
That's the send-off.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.680
The first one, you now have the memorandum

06:01.680 --> 06:04.360
that I requested yesterday relating to the other

06:04.360 --> 06:05.360
that's the subject.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.200
I said, you now have the memorandum

06:07.200 --> 06:09.840
that I requested yesterday, the two furnished relating

06:09.840 --> 06:12.080
to the initiation of the investigation

06:12.080 --> 06:15.240
of the army no idea at all.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.000
No, fair enough.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.200
Can we have that five after one?

06:20.200 --> 06:21.520
Fair enough, can we go on to about five?

06:21.520 --> 06:23.680
Do you want that five after one?

06:23.680 --> 06:26.840
Well, we better reorganize our files in the community room.

06:26.840 --> 06:33.320
I thought that every week not to go to get the memorandum

06:33.320 --> 06:36.400
that set off the investigation of the army.

06:36.400 --> 06:40.160
So the investigation of the army is not set off by the man.

06:40.160 --> 06:46.600
Will you make a memorandum note of the interviews

06:46.600 --> 06:48.400
and information that you do?

06:48.400 --> 06:51.960
At least I'm asking, there's only on the basis of the fact

06:51.960 --> 06:54.800
that you told me that there was supposed to be

06:54.800 --> 06:56.160
some memorandum evidence.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.440
No, I recall the first interview I had with this

06:59.440 --> 07:03.200
is about information, kind of, this information, the army.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.240
I know who I thought to.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.240
I know roughly when I thought to them, I know where I thought to them.

07:07.240 --> 07:12.520
I recall I did not make note for memorandum of those books.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.960
We do have the first memorandum.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.800
You have that.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.040
There's a two and a quarter page thing.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.840
Just what else there has been writing, I don't know.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.840
Well, I really, if you're calling, I'm really

07:28.840 --> 07:31.120
making the reflection out based on what I understood you

07:31.120 --> 07:31.920
was on the front page.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.760
And I thought it was going to be front page yesterday.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.680
And that's why I'm renewing the read.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.600
But you say now that you're in your judgment,

07:38.600 --> 07:40.480
all of the memorandum has been introduced.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.680
Namely, the cross letter.

07:41.680 --> 07:46.040
I met two and a quarter page FBI document,

07:46.040 --> 07:48.960
which is not introduced, but was attempted

07:48.960 --> 07:50.680
to be presented to the committee.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.280
So that, I don't know.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.920
I don't know if it's like there.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.520
Well, if you know, I've been happy,

07:57.520 --> 07:59.920
and I may want to ask some questions

07:59.920 --> 08:01.840
if I can see the memorandum, I don't want to do

08:01.840 --> 08:03.200
the reflection to be recalled.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.400
I don't have any.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.720
I'm not very clear on just what my writing mean.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.120
I know as far as the initiation

08:08.120 --> 08:11.280
of the only investigation is concerned.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.680
We saw a number of witnesses

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
that we interviewed and number.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.200
We did get some materials.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.800
Well, that's what I'm talking about.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.040
I understood you had interviews from people.

08:20.040 --> 08:20.560
That's right.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.400
I heard that.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.480
You personally, and that Mr. Stein

08:23.480 --> 08:25.960
has interviewed someone I don't recall

08:25.960 --> 08:27.520
was a preliminary cop.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.040
He interviewed someone else.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.360
I can take a, I, on the people I interviewed,

08:32.360 --> 08:33.880
I can tell you this, and that I

08:33.880 --> 08:36.040
did not make memoranda.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.080
I did not take, I dictate memoranda

08:38.080 --> 08:38.760
the interviews.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.920
I continue the rough time because I

08:40.920 --> 08:43.240
check back with the people who I interviewed,

08:43.240 --> 08:44.720
and they've given me their recollection

08:44.720 --> 08:46.360
is to when we had gotten together

08:46.360 --> 08:49.120
for the first time, that time, in the demonstration.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.240
In the end, I did not dictate memoranda

08:52.240 --> 08:52.960
about interviews.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.240
What can you have someone check the file

08:55.240 --> 08:59.640
and find out if any memoranda available on this stuff,

08:59.640 --> 09:02.800
which relates to the original initiation

09:02.800 --> 09:05.600
of the charges or investigation into the army,

09:05.600 --> 09:11.200
on up to the time you started the hearing test.

09:11.200 --> 09:11.800
Board Mama.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.000
Oh, yes, I'm sure on that.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.120
I wouldn't make much point of it, except that it is very

09:16.120 --> 09:19.440
important and to the fact that the statement

09:19.440 --> 09:22.880
has been made that the investigation of the army started

09:22.880 --> 09:27.880
early in 53, from February to March, April and May.

09:27.880 --> 09:32.640
On the other hand, the inference of the name

09:33.160 --> 09:38.440
of the allegation of the has been made that the charges

09:38.440 --> 09:41.160
against the army did not investigate the army,

09:41.160 --> 09:42.960
did not get underway until Mr. Shine

09:42.960 --> 09:44.840
has been turned off for a commission.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.720
That's unsuitable.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.800
Well, I say I'm trying to get the record straight.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.680
All right, so you're in the entity of problems

09:50.680 --> 09:51.200
right here.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.320
First of all, you have the cross memorandum.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.760
If you want, we'll have Mr. Krauss

09:54.760 --> 09:57.280
come in before the committee is specified in the road

09:57.280 --> 09:58.560
that he submitted the memorandum

09:58.560 --> 10:01.600
to Shine back in March, long before the commission

10:01.680 --> 10:02.820
continued to sign a road.

10:02.820 --> 10:04.840
You have my testimony under all that I thought

10:04.840 --> 10:06.640
the witness is my immediate interpretation

10:06.640 --> 10:07.900
of the army in February.

10:07.900 --> 10:08.840
There's one of those witnesses.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.960
I think that he went to come in here

10:09.960 --> 10:12.340
and testified that he thought the inseparate.

10:12.340 --> 10:15.000
There is no doubt, the one the investigation begins.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.400
If they are, I'm greatly concerned about the point

10:18.400 --> 10:23.400
he says this FBI document relating to 35 names

10:25.940 --> 10:29.080
who are supposed to be alleged to be subverted

10:29.080 --> 10:30.960
or mon moose was presented in April

10:30.960 --> 10:34.560
and nothing happened up until in September.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.440
And I don't know if anything has come before

10:36.440 --> 10:38.160
the committee that's any more serious

10:38.160 --> 10:40.560
than what was contained in that document.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.600
Now, I'm in a resident.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.760
What was done to follow it up because no one,

10:44.760 --> 10:47.320
at least on my hard side, wherever it flies

10:47.320 --> 10:48.720
of this investigation behind,

10:48.720 --> 10:50.720
while we were on the subcommittee.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.240
Well, kind of the reasons for that was this.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.320
We had a number of preliminary investigations on the way

10:55.320 --> 10:57.800
and each time we had one under the rules of the committee,

10:57.800 --> 11:00.000
they would be under the direction of the chairman himself

11:00.000 --> 11:01.920
and not the other members of the committee.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.280
Therefore, each time there was a preliminary investigation,

11:05.280 --> 11:06.560
we would not go running around

11:06.560 --> 11:08.520
so all the committee members involved in about it.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.840
We would get the material and just the bell up

11:10.840 --> 11:13.000
and until at such a point that it was ready

11:13.000 --> 11:14.280
for executive session hearings

11:14.280 --> 11:15.640
and then the chairman would convene the meeting

11:15.640 --> 11:18.360
of the committee and put the matters to the committee.

11:18.360 --> 11:21.760
What more does the need to do on these 35 names

11:21.760 --> 11:26.760
in fact that you have the information from the industry

11:27.240 --> 11:29.160
for, I mean, what more needs to be done?

11:29.160 --> 11:30.400
We need a different section.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.240
There was a commentary of number one we had to check out

11:32.240 --> 11:35.200
and number two, there was a question of other investigations

11:35.200 --> 11:36.200
which had priority.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.960
For instance, where we were in the middle

11:37.960 --> 11:40.520
of public hearings on the Blake of America investigation.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.520
No, that ended in March.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.200
No, sir, I'm sorry, sir.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.040
Are you sure?

11:45.040 --> 11:45.880
I'm private.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.760
It was more serious.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.200
What hearings were held at a lunch bill

11:50.200 --> 11:52.280
or hearings were held in nature?

11:52.280 --> 11:53.480
On the voice program?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.960
On the information program, yet that?

11:55.960 --> 11:58.200
I'm positive about it.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.480
On the information program?

11:59.480 --> 12:01.000
Yes. When you went to Europe and Asia?

12:01.000 --> 12:01.640
That's right, yes.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.520
We came back there with hearing.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.240
Well, that was in May.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.080
There was an investigation of each letter.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.560
I don't know, just one to hear you for a held.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.440
I think it was sometimes during that period of time.

12:13.440 --> 12:17.280
Well, what actual steps were taken after you received

12:17.280 --> 12:19.760
the 2035 names in the document?

12:19.760 --> 12:26.280
What steps did you take to follow up on in 35 names

12:26.280 --> 12:28.160
with the related people of Fort Maun?

12:28.160 --> 12:30.160
The first thing I personally did with this there,

12:30.160 --> 12:31.320
is I recall it.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.600
The name Aaron Coleman rang a bell, and I went back,

12:33.600 --> 12:37.840
and I got the records of the Rosenberg trial.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.120
I know that I heard the name.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.680
I know it had to get in the Rosenberg case in some way.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.800
I was not sure if it did yet.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.400
So I remember that I got all of my head

12:45.400 --> 12:47.000
all the time to stop me getting it.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.120
I got all of the copy of the trial record

12:49.120 --> 12:50.680
in the Rosenberg case.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.920
I got to touch them on it, and I found a place

12:53.920 --> 12:55.760
where there was reference to Aaron Coleman

12:55.760 --> 12:57.640
by the happen that was referenced by

12:57.640 --> 12:58.840
Julius Rosenberg himself.

12:58.840 --> 13:03.520
Well, named Coleman as one of his Fort Maun with friends.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.880
I then went over, and I remember I read the Green

13:05.880 --> 13:08.360
Glass testimony, and some other things.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.600
That was one of the first steps to die.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.560
We also checked with other people

13:13.560 --> 13:16.440
that we thought might have information on this situation.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.280
We obtained, we heard another congressional committee

13:18.280 --> 13:19.840
that's done some work on this.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.640
We obtained from that committee some files and documents.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.080
The first committee was that.

13:26.080 --> 13:26.960
I think there was a house committee on

13:26.960 --> 13:27.720
un-American activities.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.920
What was it you could do there?

13:28.920 --> 13:30.600
I felt all the effect I'd probably get.

13:30.600 --> 13:34.600
So why would you want to go to the House of American Activities

13:34.600 --> 13:38.080
Committee when you've got the epitome of information

13:38.080 --> 13:40.400
and the form of an FBI report?

13:40.400 --> 13:42.440
I mean, what would you be going to find over there

13:42.440 --> 13:44.480
that was the superior to the information

13:44.480 --> 13:46.400
that you had the other questions, the period.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.560
The question of getting a complete picture.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.960
So we knew where we was going in this.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.720
I was too emphasize in the previous interrogation

13:52.720 --> 13:54.800
that after these came and had all, which meant,

13:54.800 --> 13:56.200
right now?

13:56.200 --> 14:00.400
Well, I'm talking about this two and a quarter of the documents.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.800
Well, it's an emphasized and an actuality

14:02.800 --> 14:05.240
in terms of you or by Senator McCarthy,

14:05.240 --> 14:07.880
that the importance of this document

14:07.880 --> 14:09.800
to not be overlooked because of the fact

14:09.800 --> 14:11.280
that it had all and I believe something

14:11.280 --> 14:14.000
helped with indicated, F.D. Nod, right?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.960
I mean, that's all that's brought out here in public.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.480
This wasn't back to show it.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.960
Well, I understand.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.640
You had that in March.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.120
For the life of me, I can't understand.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.760
I thought I'd gotten all of that up with March there.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.760
I think we can decide on the end of the spring

14:26.760 --> 14:27.600
sometime.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.040
Well, I think he testified around maybe March or April.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.000
I don't think that's right.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.160
I'm in for Stevens, and only been in office a couple of months.

14:36.160 --> 14:39.480
It wasn't the logical and the sensible things to do.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.600
Say, look, Mr. Fakisserie, maybe you haven't seen this

14:42.600 --> 14:43.280
in for months.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.000
Here's 35 names.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.240
Can't we work together and find out immediately?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.040
What this is all about?

14:49.040 --> 14:52.720
And if these people are questionable characters,

14:52.720 --> 14:56.240
let's say if you can't suspend them right now.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.880
Wouldn't that be the reasonable thing to do?

14:57.880 --> 14:58.280
No, sorry.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.240
I don't think it's fit of been done that way then.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.440
Well, but Mr. Stevens, it only been an office two months,

15:03.440 --> 15:06.040
and he couldn't possibly have gone through the file with G2,

15:06.040 --> 15:08.200
where this report was located.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.720
Not that about it, but the man who came in and gave

15:10.720 --> 15:12.080
send him the property, the information,

15:12.080 --> 15:15.320
as I understand it, said that the people over there

15:15.320 --> 15:18.160
who had to stay in these things knew all about it.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.840
That they had known about it for some period of time.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.520
And that they had not done anything about it.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.720
And apparently, one thing is doing about it.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.400
And it seemed like a little bit, uh,

15:27.400 --> 15:29.280
didn't seem much point in outgoing.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.120
Well, now, as long as that's going back to that.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.280
Mr. Cohn, isn't that all the more reason

15:34.280 --> 15:36.840
why you then ought to go to the top man,

15:36.840 --> 15:38.640
the secretary of the Army?

15:38.640 --> 15:41.040
Based on the fact that these people down below you knew

15:41.040 --> 15:42.280
what you were doing about it.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.480
Not that it was the chairman judgment at that time,

15:44.480 --> 15:46.640
that what we ought to do is develop

15:46.640 --> 15:48.360
as we were from middle adherents on other things,

15:48.360 --> 15:50.840
but to develop the case, that as much information

15:50.840 --> 15:52.680
as we possibly could build it up,

15:52.680 --> 15:55.680
and then give it a priority order for adherence

15:55.680 --> 15:57.920
by this committee and trying to out it.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.720
We'll be in possibility.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.520
And we bet that we did.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.920
And what that is?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.560
And it's not meant to be.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.000
Senator McCarty?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Thank you.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Welcome.

16:09.000 --> 16:09.920
Yes.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.040
We just, uh, we just, uh,

16:13.040 --> 16:18.240
said that the students with Adam's FOIA informed

16:18.240 --> 16:21.680
during all the stages of the hearings,

16:21.680 --> 16:25.160
to even, uh, uh, invite them to attend

16:25.160 --> 16:26.920
all executive sessions, but, right?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.000
Not that about you.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.960
And, uh, it's another example of the type of cooperation

16:33.960 --> 16:37.280
we gave if you brought all the Adam's FOIA,

16:37.280 --> 16:44.440
about the first case, um, in 1953,

16:44.440 --> 16:45.840
that's right.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.840
Yes, that's right.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
It's called, even other than finally,

16:48.840 --> 16:52.680
when the election was taken, uh, we called here,

16:52.680 --> 16:54.200
that right?

16:54.200 --> 16:57.560
And that has been the method of operation

16:57.560 --> 17:00.400
with the military during all the times

17:00.400 --> 17:02.840
that we worked with them up until, uh,

17:02.840 --> 17:06.320
we found that they were, uh, deliberately trying

17:06.320 --> 17:09.160
to, uh, call off the hearing.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.160
Yes.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.560
No further questions?

17:11.560 --> 17:12.920
Do you want to get them in?

17:12.920 --> 17:14.640
Let's call.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.960
I was asked to do a couple of questions,

17:16.960 --> 17:19.600
a seven or that, and a seven.

17:19.600 --> 17:20.800
The five-year-old said,

17:20.800 --> 17:23.360
that's a four-year-old in the office.

17:23.360 --> 17:29.360
In my story, it was in 1953, is that right?

17:29.360 --> 17:30.480
It's what Dr. McCarty said.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.400
This FBI document.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.080
Uh, yes, there was a thing of 1950.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.280
Did you hear the word I applied to it?

17:37.280 --> 17:39.120
I wasn't sure I am a certain person.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.160
You want to hear it?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.560
I mean, sir, you want to hear it?

17:41.560 --> 17:42.560
That's your option as well.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.520
Per-long line.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.240
Not mine.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.360
Per-long.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.560
You got it in maceration, is that right?

17:47.560 --> 17:48.920
I don't know whether the document was

17:48.920 --> 17:50.280
per-longed or whether it wasn't.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.920
I know the three of that and some other things

17:51.920 --> 17:53.200
are 35, some persons.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.040
I understand that.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.760
Who are out of court moments and who are in there

17:55.760 --> 17:56.560
before we came along?

17:56.560 --> 18:01.000
You had a new secretary of the Army over there, didn't you?

18:01.000 --> 18:01.680
That's a...

18:01.680 --> 18:06.760
I'm just document, long-added, and here's being secretary.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.680
Oh, yes, I'm still up for years.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.480
And when you saw it, you must have thought

18:10.480 --> 18:14.160
it was a frightening document, is that right?

18:14.160 --> 18:15.800
I thought it was a certain situation.

18:15.800 --> 18:16.480
Yes, sir.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.920
And one involving a situation where time is of the essence.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.600
Is that right?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.120
Right.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.640
Any situation, sure.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.320
That's right, isn't it?

18:25.320 --> 18:31.320
And you had a brand new secretary of the Army, didn't you?

18:31.320 --> 18:33.920
He would be there four weeks in office or say eight weeks

18:33.920 --> 18:36.960
in office or something like that, is that right?

18:36.960 --> 18:37.960
Yes, sir.

18:37.960 --> 18:44.240
Now with this, I see information in your hands.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.520
If you could hail a taxi cab, you could get boxed

18:48.520 --> 18:52.520
evens on the job of all these communists within whatever time

18:52.520 --> 18:56.160
it takes to drive from here to the Pentagon, is that right?

18:56.160 --> 18:58.280
No, sir.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.120
That's not right.

18:59.120 --> 18:59.960
Nothing.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.760
Well, at least you could have gone over.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.560
Do you think you were with a guy hearing

19:03.560 --> 19:06.400
if you'd gone over in the first door of the Pentagon

19:06.400 --> 19:09.160
and yelled out loud to some receptionist?

19:09.160 --> 19:12.560
We got a lot of hot soap on communists in the Army.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.680
Don't you think that would have taken you right to gracious

19:17.680 --> 19:19.400
evens?

19:19.400 --> 19:22.040
If I was to say, if you'd gone over to the Pentagon

19:22.040 --> 19:25.040
and got inside the door and yelled at the first receptionist,

19:25.040 --> 19:28.760
you saw we got some hot soap on hot communists in the Army.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.480
You don't think you would have landed at the top?

19:31.480 --> 19:33.920
That is not the way I do it.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.480
Well, the thing not be the way you do things,

19:35.480 --> 19:37.400
but you were comfortable with it, because it was good.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
Yes, sir.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.360
And the senator was the senator.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.240
And a very good one, sir.

19:41.240 --> 19:41.840
Yes, sir.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.080
And had you any slightest doubt that you could have got

19:45.080 --> 19:49.400
boxed evens here, the moment you got hold of that document?

19:49.400 --> 19:49.920
Perfect.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.600
Perfect.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.080
You know you could have done so.

19:52.080 --> 19:52.600
I know.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.840
It's beautiful and then right.

19:53.840 --> 19:57.080
And you tell us now that you are

19:57.080 --> 19:58.720
the think what's here in another case.

19:58.720 --> 19:59.880
Is that right?

19:59.880 --> 20:00.880
Yes, sir.

20:00.880 --> 20:05.160
And although you will have this, though, and a spray

20:05.160 --> 20:08.960
and amphithecus, new secretary of the Army,

20:08.960 --> 20:13.120
legible by the expenditure of one pack of caps there,

20:13.120 --> 20:15.000
you will never let hearing during box

20:15.000 --> 20:17.040
if you had it in box, did you?

20:17.040 --> 20:18.160
Is that right?

20:18.160 --> 20:18.680
Sir, sir.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.720
You never let hearing in box.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.440
No, I am fine.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.200
What?

20:22.200 --> 20:22.720
I never let.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.320
All right.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.400
Did you?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.720
Well, before I go.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.720
Tell me, please.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.720
I'm trying to say.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.720
All right, please.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.720
No, I didn't.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.720
All may.

20:31.720 --> 20:32.720
So I never.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.720
I'm not going to hear.

20:33.720 --> 20:34.720
Or you.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.720
The answer is never.

20:35.720 --> 20:36.720
Right.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.720
Do I do not take a minute?

20:37.720 --> 20:38.720
Or do I?

20:38.720 --> 20:39.720
No.

20:39.720 --> 20:40.720
No, I'm not.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
I will keep it going.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.720
I will.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.360
I'm not all kind of things that is really dramatic

20:45.360 --> 20:48.160
and see how these commoners turn.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.000
They'll fill on this document when they put a bottle

20:51.000 --> 20:54.040
to the account of Bob's season 20 minutes.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.600
And they let month after month go by without

20:56.600 --> 20:59.600
going to the head and say, pick them up.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.600
Thank you.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.600
Stand in the month.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.600
I'm in Chicago.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.600
I have 30 bags for my other mask.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.600
Stand in the month.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
May I answer that?

21:07.600 --> 21:08.600
I have that.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.600
I have only said who did say, pick them up.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
And you did.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
Did you?

21:13.600 --> 21:16.600
Well, if you said it a few days ago, if you wanted to be fair.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.440
If you do want to be fair, sir, if you will, let me collect

21:19.440 --> 21:22.600
what is a rony of compression which you're trying to convey here.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600
Well, I'm not trying to convey to you person

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
if you actually test sickle season.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.600
If you want to understand that, don't you?

21:28.600 --> 21:30.600
I think I understand what you're trying to say.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.600
And I'm actually trying to convey to you person

21:32.600 --> 21:33.600
that you said not safe.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
Pick them up, Steven.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
Now is that right?

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
But if you...

21:36.600 --> 21:37.600
You're not right.
