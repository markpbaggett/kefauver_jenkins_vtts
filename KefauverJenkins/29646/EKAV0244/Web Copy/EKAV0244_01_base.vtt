WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I know it's not public indictment.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Now we were talking about General Law.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.400
And I think that you testified that General Law

00:16.400 --> 00:19.000
and testimony on the night of October 14th,

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
you considered with being with critical of Secretary C.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
I said to her that he, maybe I should not characterize

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
the General Law and said that,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
if you would try and convey what he knew about the situation.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
It was only when Senator McCarthy and the committee

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
came on their scene that he had any success

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
until he was something about it, that's what he said.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Well now, as a matter of fact, General Law

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
in making the reference that he better not talk to you

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
was really saying himself the time bomb

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
by security regulations and therefore I can't tell you

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
some of these things.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Now what he said.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Law, he said what he said.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
He said what he said, sir, you're asking me to read his mind about that.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And I think that's the question which only General Law

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
can answer.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Well you and I know, sir, that when you read a transcript

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
in Coldheart's print, it doesn't always read the way it was said.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
And I have the transcript here and I wasn't there.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So I have to interrogate you.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
It's the weather now that it isn't the fact that General Law

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
really meant to convey this odd as far as you know

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
that he was bound by security regulations

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
and through all of the questions.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I can only give you an opinion on that.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Well you were there, I'd like your opinions there.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
My opinion was that that was not what he meant.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Thank you.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Well now that was on our cell with the 14, right?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yes.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
And I believe that one of the memorandums that has been submitted

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
to the president and have been run into evidence here

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
is that you and the senators thought that Secretary Steven

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
was intent about this testimony.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I think I use the right word, don't I?

02:02.000 --> 02:14.000
You might probably be right, sir.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, I'm with you, December 17th.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
December 17th.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
The references to the fact that the secretary was in defense

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
about the testimony, right?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yes.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Now as the matter of factness is called,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
the first time, and you so satisfied, I believe,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
that the question of removing General Law was brought

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
to your attention or the senators was on November the 24th.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
That's the first time that they were actual plans to remolding yesterday.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
But I know of.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
But you know of?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yes.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
The first time that you were attention at that time.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yes.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Now between October the 14th and November the 24th,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
it is a fact that it's not that General Law's own way

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
is speaking about certain large universities in the country.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I do know, sir.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I'd rather get the...

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Certainly, you may consider it.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Look at anything you'd like.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
I know that he has some vast confidence

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
with people of a sport environment

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
in which he discussed the investigation.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
And that includes the University of America,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
you went to, and the one I went to, didn't it?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Yes, sir.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I think it did.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
What was the date of that?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I don't know where you went.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Now I think it's obvious, all right?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
You had to come.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I went to come here.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Both findings.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm sure that fine institutions there, I would go.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, we don't have to ask.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
I would say that if they had a little prompt or action

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
in taking out some communist professions,

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I would be much happier about it.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, let's not argue.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Your friend James Stein went to Harmon's too.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I'm sure he was there.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Well, let's not argue.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Well, when did this occur?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
These speeches?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Uh, would you give me about a minute to look at something here

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
and then I'll try to answer your questions.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
All right.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I'll give you time to step anyway.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
No, you're having a nut up.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, they are looking for some of their material.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Let's return to it.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh, sir.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
How much time do I have?

04:22.000 --> 04:33.000
You have a five-well minute.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
That's about all of it.

05:08.000 --> 05:17.000
I can help you in any way, Mr. Thomas.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I'll be with you, sir.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Mr. St. Clair still has five minutes of question time

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
of former Mr. Cohen.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Mr. Cohen is now looking through some material every day.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Is that good for him by me?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yes.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm fine.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm back in again.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
That's no, no, no, no, no.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I don't know the date.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Whatever you say.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I'll take the date.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Whatever you say.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Well, let's go, yeah, I have a phone set of documents that will help.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
What's the date of it?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Middle, middle, middle, middle, middle.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I'll be very fairly.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
It wasn't until after that the announcement of those speeches came along.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
That you heard anything about, and you've done a lot.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Isn't that so?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm not sure.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm not sure.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
That's right.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
You're right.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I was talking about it.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
And if the Secretary was particularly incensed about the testimony

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
and I told him the 14th to the extent that he was going to release the general for that,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
he's pretty slow to anger, isn't he, Mr. Cohen?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
No, I wouldn't say so, sir.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Well, I'll talk about the 14th of November, the 24th is about 40 days, isn't it?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
A lot happened during those 40 days, sir.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
That's right.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
A lot happened.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Then one of the things that I did was I was going to say to the Secretary

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
for 40 days, sir.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
That's right.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
A lot happened.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Then one of the things that happened were certain speeches were made about strict university.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Other things that happened there were the general for that, sir.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I'll show you once and...

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I'll give you every chance as you and I will just say anything you want.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
But I must say that you asked my question first.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Well, I'm trying to answer that.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
You said a lot of things, sir.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
And I'm trying to tell you what happened.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I didn't ask you what happened.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Well, may I tell you what happened?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
After I'm through, sir, you can do anything you want.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
But as I'm concerned, but I assume the chairman is still running the committee.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Well, I'm not disputing that in any way.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I have no idea.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I'd like to give you a full answer to your question if you want to try.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I'll do what.

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm simply asking you if it isn't true that one of the things that happened was certain speeches were made about certain large universities.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
No, there it's not.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
That's not one of the things that happened.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
The speeches were not about large universities.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
In part at least?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I wouldn't even say in part.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
You would not say the position that you did not allow to never mention any of any universities in this speech.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I would say he did mention them.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
He did mention them in a very complementary way.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I don't think he mentioned them in the derogatory way, sir.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
No.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I do not.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, to embarrass they teach communism is not very complementary.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I don't believe he said that, sir.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
But anyway, with after those speeches, the few first heard of any plans to relieve it.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
That's right.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Funnologically, yes.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Funnologically, yes.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
And you heard no plans of no plans to relieve them before those speeches.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
This is not right.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I heard no definite plans to relieve them.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I heard plans about other things.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
All right, but I'm talking about plans to relieve them.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Is that right?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Yes.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And if your testimony, that's the six, I'm sorry.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Did you want to make an answer?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Yes, I'm trying to tell you this is dangerous.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
But a lot of things happened.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
A lot of action was taken against General Lott during those 40 days.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Hey, sir.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yes, sir.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It's still remaining true.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
Does it not, Mr. Cohn, that you heard of no plans to relieve General Lott and to ask

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
the certain speeches remain?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yes, sir.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
And if you heard of no plans to relieve them before those speeches remain?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yes, sir.

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
Do you still say that General Lott and was to be relieved because of his cooperation with your committee?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I don't have the slightest touch on my mind with that.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
All right.

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
Even though the testimony that you've pinned that on occurred more than 40 days before you first heard that he was going to be relieved.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I don't think it's only on that testimony.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I think that I'm...

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Well, I'm having on that testimony.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
No, sir.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I think that's...

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, the memorandum says that this senator was supposed to see secretary was incensed about it.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm pinning that report.

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm pinning that on what John Adams told me, told him to McRothi, told Frank Sauer and I'm badly told other people.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
Yes, but since memorandum December 17th simply says that apparently they were particularly...

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
particularly reminded him incensed about Lott and statement in executive section that it was impossible to get necessary cooperation

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
or to clean up until our committee hearings come in.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
All right?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yes, sir.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Now, who ever wrote that memorandum had in mind to say that he was not a secretary.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Who ever wrote that memorandum?

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
No, whoever wrote that memorandum had in mind to that's what he was pinning it on, isn't that right?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
One of the things very...

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
The only thing he meant.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
The only thing he said was that...

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
That's the testimony.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
That's my testimony.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
That's the testimony.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
That means there are other things I can tell you what they were.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Okay.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Carol had seven mishomes.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Seven mishomes.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Seven mishomes.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Seven mishomes.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
I think Carol and I have many cousins there, I'm still over.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
With the colonel believing that we've committed a Friday to the Camptilmer.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
And I certainly committee will not be able to continue with one of the responsible lapses.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
The lapis and I will...

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
This vest and pulp that's finally a long one.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Very nice.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
I took the thumbs over here after the Mr. Fees and the animals.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
The ants, the persons that have to do with the issues.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
So we can get rid of some of the witnesses who perform at the Camptilmer's lead Friday.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
I think we've had a great way at the time with all of them giving up our ten minutes.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
But if you may have covered the issues, you have not been doing that.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It's too out.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I'm going to put this in practice.

11:29.000 --> 11:41.000
I mean, this occasion of November 24th and 25th Mr. Colton,

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
when you say Mr. Adams talked to you about relieving the general law.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Mr. Carpethan.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm sure you guys have some of the questions.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
And you sure of that?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Yes, I am.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm meeting with you.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I'm meeting with you.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Now I'm talking about an entirely different subject.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
Perhaps not earth-cattering and some that have already been thought about.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I think some of them are important.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
Do you recall the occasion of October 21st, which you testified that Mr. Adams asked you to get some tickets to a fight?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yes, sir.

12:37.000 --> 12:45.000
You said that on that occasion, Mr. Adams, Mr. Carpethan, you answered the fight.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
That was a fourth first.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Who was that?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Who was the fourth first?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I don't know his name.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
You were the friend of Mr. Carpethan.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
Now, that person remained with you almost throughout the entire evening, didn't he?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
No, sir.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Mr. Adams, Mr. Carpethan, I came up from Washington together and I'm playing a fourth person.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
It was not there.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
We went to my house, but then it was a fourth person.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
It was not there.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
We spent some time there.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
If it didn't, he was not there.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
The very fault that we called left the tickets for him.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
At Mr. Adams Hotel on the way to the fight, and he joined up with the fight sometimes.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
And we may redo the balance speech later.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
I'm inclined to think that he did not there.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I'm not sure about that.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, now, incidentally, you said that, probably, you paid for those tickets.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yes, I did.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Did you tell Mr. Adams who paid for them?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yes, I did.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
On that occasion?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Sure, I did.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Well, then the question of paying for the tickets came up on that occasion.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
No, no.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, then why did they have a house?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
There was no ESC to get to ticket.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
What did you tell him who paid for them on that occasion?

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
There was some discussion before I got the tickets.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I have the tickets we're going to be gotten.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
He asked if I could get them free.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
He had something else.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
What if you asked him the first question?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I think I told him I didn't think I could.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
All right.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
And what did I get the tickets?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
All right.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Now, I take it, if you say that he was your guest on that occasion.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So you don't want to raise any YouTube on it.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
All right?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
About his nice things to the check out.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
None of them.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
All right.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Now did he also ask you to get a hotel room for him that evening?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
He had asked me to get a hotel room for him.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
So I'm not sure whether it's that evening.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I think it's probably what.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
If I was to get to you that it was, would you agree with me?

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Well, I was two or three times the ESC to get a hotel room for him.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
What's up?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
The set we might have been one of the occasions.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
When did he ask you that?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
About the hotel room?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Yes.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Although it's too early to attend.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
No, I'm not told it's 21st.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I don't really know.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Was it before you went to New York?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I imagine.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
So I don't remember.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
And did you make a reservation for him?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
The ESC is going to get it under my control.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Did he ask you anything about things?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Were you paying for that room, right?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I mean, did he ask you to pay for that?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
There was a discussion.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And I'm not sure this is the occasion Mr. Pink.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Well, sorry, well, it might have been in probably what.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Mr. Adams would say it's the first time he was in New York

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
at the World War, I believe.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And he found that it was rather expensive.

15:14.000 --> 15:24.000
He then asked me if they'd signed to not get a rate at some other place.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So they within the hotel business.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I agree with him.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
The World War probably was expensive.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
I told the day, I don't know what I thought today.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
First of all, I thought today's office about it.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
And it occurred to me that they made a reservation for him at the great hotel.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
It also occurred to me on that that Mr. Adams said

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
if there were to be a discount or something like that,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
he did not want the bill sent to Dave Shine.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
He would rather have a sense of me, and that he would pay me for it.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
I then recall that after he stayed at the hotel, he told me,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
and I gave all the instructions today, secretary,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
yes, I stayed at the hotel.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Mr. Adams told me that when he went to pay the bill,

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
they were not giving him a discount with blanks high price.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
And he said, pay them right then and there.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
And the bulk of the price has been too high.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And that he had taken care of it himself right then and there.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
And it had been no discount.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
And that's...

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Well, in many events, you left instructions that the hotel

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
to have the bill sent to you.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
No, I didn't.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
That's an indirect.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
No, it's very cool.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
I thought Dave Shine's office told him to get a gun out of the hotel.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
And then Adam, say, hotel room, see if they could get a discount

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
or whatever you're for in the hotel business.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
For that's a happy bill sent to me, not to Dave Shine.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
And that Mr. Adams would say me for it.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
That didn't happen, though, because he paid the bill himself.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And he said they didn't give him any discount.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I never checked it, see whether they had given him one or not.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I don't know.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
The instructions, the hotel is these, where the bill is sent to you.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
That would be right.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
And that when I don't know...

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
When Mr. Adams checked out, he paid it directly to the job.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
That's what he told me.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Well, you have no doubt about it.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
No, not at all.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
Now, on the theater tickets, you testify that you were very happy

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
to get these four Mr. Adams in his two ends, all right?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
And you said you sent him a bill for it.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Well, I tell you.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
This moment, and you said you sent him a bill.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah, he was going to pay me for it.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
No, not any doubt.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
You never did send him a bill, did you?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
No, I didn't.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Is there any reason why you didn't let the cons?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yes, there is.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Was the reason you had to deal with private charge?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
No, not at all.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
None?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
No, absolutely not.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Well, then what is the reason you never sent him a bill?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
The reason is, before I sent him a bill, I had to go to my office and get the bill,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
and track it down, and have no idea about why I didn't have something to send.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
I had not done that up to the time he paid me for it.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I had no matter of two months.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
That's my very little bit, though.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Did you have any intention of overtending him that bill?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I had every intention to send you a bill.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Did you take me two months to send a bill?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Oh, it usually takes me five collect money to someone I get tickets for,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
or I would say it might take me four to six months.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's going to depend on my...

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
You can't take her to the finance.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Well, I don't know about that.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.000
First of all, I got to go to my office for those times I did so not answer the tickets before,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
because they'll come every month for every two months or whatever the arrangement is.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
I then got to get the bill, and they'll up at my office, they'll mark out what it is,

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
what it's for, and when I get around to that, I'll pull with the belt of the person for whom I got the tickets.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
And I better say here, sir, that I don't make a specialty of getting tickets,

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
because since it came up, I've gotten wired from people asking me to get some theater and world-fairy tickets.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
That's all for the board.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
You have to lift the wealth of the business.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Now, Mr. Will.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
This time left on this side.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
That time is going first.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
I think I ought to help you send off the possible requests that you have on a national,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
qualified audience for theater tickets.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
And I'll help warn everybody now. Please don't do it.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Thank you, sir.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
Now, Mr. Cohn, the new turn to volume 24 of the record here.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Page 4, not all record here.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Page 4398.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I don't have that...

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Mr. Julianna, we'll find it for you.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Yes, Mr. Julianna.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
You go right ahead to the first time.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Why are you looking for it, Mr. Julianna?

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
Would you get to page 2606, which we may or may not need?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Now, where is the scope for a...

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
The first is 4398.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
4398.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
From volume 24.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I'm always the next one.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Well, we may need page 2606.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm not so sure we will, but you're going to have to correct a date on the...

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
In connection with 4398, if volume 24 is correct.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah, I see a mistaken date, right?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Well, I can't.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Well, you've got a very quick find, Mr. Cohn.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
The date that appears there is October 14th, I reckon, should be...

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
January 14th.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You're right, that's in the safe in the trenches.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
It should be January 14th.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, that's not the case in the record, or it's...

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
...by two mistakes in these transcripts for the speed of the...

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
...but they come out, the record is going and outstanding just.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
They do indeed, and I've noticed it, because I've seen a lot of transcripts.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
That is the only date that I have seen wrong in the transcript,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
and it could be...

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
It could even be that you stated it wrong by mistake for all you and I know now.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Is that not right?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Good evening, sir.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
In any event, we do know that the date should be January 14th.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Yes, sir, that's the date.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Now, calling your attention to your testimony,

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
would you run your ride down the page 4398 and turn it over at...

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
...read at the top of page 4399?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Yes, sir.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I'll do that.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
I'm particularly interested in the first two lines at the top of 4399.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
What was being discussed, Mr. Cohn, on that occasion?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
A lot of things, sir.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
Well, what was being discussed particularly with virtue on the page 2, which I call your attention?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
About the overseas...

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
...for what, gentlemen?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
About what, sir?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
For what, man?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Cohn.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Overseas for chines.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
That was being discussed.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
There's no doubt about that, is it?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
No, there's no doubt.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
And it's that...

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
...when you say the things, it's quite a fortifying that you're out.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Well, you wait to tell me that.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, he had a nice...

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
He said so too.

21:50.000 --> 21:59.000
And on page 4399, he not only brought it up, but as I understand your testimony, he brought it up pretty nasty like, is that right?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
He...

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Okay, that's what he gets his question for, yes.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Is that right, sir?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Yes, sir.

22:05.000 --> 22:14.000
And I suppose that was a critical a conversation with Mr. Adams in respect of his chines, if he would ever have with the chines.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
You mean, the chines?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I wouldn't say that.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I agree.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Carol, Pat, and his mother.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And is it my right?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
And in the county?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Mr. Welk.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I wanted to report to you.

22:28.000 --> 22:39.000
So in the county of Cohn, Mr. Feng Slery was referring to speeches made by General Lawton, and I don't have the newspaper account.

22:40.000 --> 22:48.000
And finally, I told one of the speeches that he was talking to the staff in regards to security.

22:48.000 --> 22:57.000
And that this is a reflected meeting and somebody that knows and gives them to be trapped.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
That's right.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Yes, that's right.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
That's right, that's right.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
And so when we got my idea of what's...

23:04.000 --> 23:14.000
And he said, he said, the story to remarks for General Lawton were taken down by one of the scientists from the laboratories within the lecture and made available.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Often, the intensity was expected other persons would tend to the same lecture.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Another lecture delivered to the liver of the general.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And he was in the county what he said.

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
So he gave unqualified support to Senator Matrache and his methods and apt him effect.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Do you order any subversive son of the university before Matrache?

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
Or they end up a signal call of the form of housing?

23:39.000 --> 23:47.000
At the same time, the general praised the laboratory personnel and then tried to be important to their work.

23:47.000 --> 23:54.000
He also reported the praise Senator William Gerner and his committee for rooting us throughout.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
He then said that Matrache had done a good job at the signal call here in New York.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
And I added that he sat in and was impressed by Matrache's fairness and credit rates to all the witnesses that were reported.

24:06.000 --> 24:18.000
General Lawton allegedly said the army investigations and handling of army security cases was hampered by regulation until Matrache 4th Stephen was detained.

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
Then they go and rule for the finally cut about the school.

24:30.000 --> 24:41.000
General Lawton reported that the committee talks with the D.I.s and the laboratories indicated that those D.I.s had gotten a trouble in the army with some certain universities.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
The director is clear that Mr. St. Pair was talking about the speeches.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
Actually, he was referring to staff.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
The talk was to be staff, the people who worked at the laboratory closed meetings.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Yes, I believe they were.

25:01.000 --> 25:22.000
Have you seen the memorandum which indicated that Mr. Stephen was asked with the lawful explanation of why he would praise Matrache and why he would blame certain colleges for the communists they might have turned out?

25:23.000 --> 25:35.000
I did not read the memorandum in detail. I did get a glance at the inspection in which General Lawton had to explain what he said about the congressional committee investigating communists and doing a good job.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Yes, sir.

25:36.000 --> 25:48.000
And, but make the least a section I believe was nine in which he had to explain to Mr. Stephen what he meant by saying that Senator McCarthy had been responsible for getting out of communists think along those lines.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
It's a term that's very cold and I remember you mean I'd be expecting this.

25:52.000 --> 26:03.000
So, there it goes. Mr. Stephen's or Mr. Adam's or Mr. Wells were ordered by the sheriff to produce that memorandum.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
These are the same questions as the young over the course.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
If I am expecting that, I wonder if the memorandum has been produced.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
If I am not expecting that, I wonder if I could be able to produce that now.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
The sheriff is advised on the difficulty that we have the memorandum in the case of the death.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
Is that a nut? I assume that's not flat, but I think that I wonder if I could see that.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Mr. Ferb?

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Of course, it does not have any many movement. You won't get it. I make it available for you.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Thank you.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
Mr. Wells, we have time now.

26:39.000 --> 26:50.000
Now, Mr. Corn, referring to the two lines that I have read to you about conversation about time going overseas.

26:50.000 --> 27:01.000
You characterized the conversation as follows. Mr. Adams threw that in right then at this point, I think, as an example of how he could get that.

27:02.000 --> 27:12.000
Now, Mr. Corn, will you be good enough to send your attention on the conversation as you know our witness should and tell us his substance.

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
As soon as you can call it back to your memory, what Adams said to you and what you said to him.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
Sorry, what's that transcript again? I'll get it right here.

27:32.000 --> 27:44.000
You want to answer everything that I mentioned? I want in simple English what we said by on that date in substance.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
I'm Mr. Adams to you and by you, Mr. Adams, about date time.

27:50.000 --> 28:00.000
About date time? Right. Just that part. Sure. Very close, sir. That's why it follows a statement by Mr. Adams, the part that he didn't think he was cooperating with him.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
The investigation was going on and on. The loyalty board members were coming in.

28:05.000 --> 28:13.000
Mr. Corn, you don't need to tell me about that part. You had a discussion about calling loyalty board members. Didn't you? Not only that, sir. We had a discussion.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
So, didn't you just have that? It's kind of a conversation about loyalty board. That was discussed.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
And they're very bitter or certainly a some sweet disagreement about whether they could or couldn't be called.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
They were just disagreements about it, sir. Right.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
Now putting that behind you just move forward since they're talking about date time, if you will.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
Yes, sir. And in giving you that book, I have to put it in context because it'll be later to something.

28:34.000 --> 28:46.000
You know what the context is because you've been discussing loyalty board. Not just tell us what was said about time and what was said by him about time and what was said about you, as I have said in simple every day.

28:46.000 --> 28:54.000
Yes, sir. The context was not just loyalty board. It was a general area of the fort learning investigation.

28:54.000 --> 29:02.000
Why we were not stopping it. Why the loyalty board was coming in and Mr. Adams said he did not think that we were cooperating with him.

29:02.000 --> 29:13.000
He then came out and thought some steps that how it would be like if he had been trying to oversee it.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
He could be unfulfilled of two things along those lines.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
Not along those lines just tell us what he said. I can't tell you it's exactly what it's like.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
You know, I know Mr. Cohen, you and I are lawyers. We know what a whipson has to do.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
All he has to do is to recall the substance of what it says.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
That's what I do.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
I think you have said he said how would he like it if he said shine overseas?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
I'm giving the fuck to him.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
Is that right? That the fuck to squad. He was going to do something about changing.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
No, not just what he said. I don't know what he was going to do. I just want to know what he said.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I can't give you the flow.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Did he say in substance? How would you like it if he had seen it?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
That's my bad, his way of words.

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
If I have to explain the great question of Mr. Welk here, but I think he should.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
Not repeatedly interrupt the whipson.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
He doesn't like the answer. He bought the sentence that's not the question.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
I think it's what he's buying the sentence in the trial.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
Mr. Stevens has an extremely short event.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
And he should be entitled to make the answer that he wants to make.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
I met Cuyd Blancmore just before.

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
Would you just try to use the English language and tell us in substance?

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
I have to add a fit to you that you heard about sending Cyan over to.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Just tell us to us at long last.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
How would you like it if that's the way he'd be?

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
If the world, I'm sorry, sir. You said once before, you wanted to be fit.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
You say that long last. It is not a long last.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
I told this conversation to Mr. Jenkins for the first time he ever asked me.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Why?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
He did long last in this house.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Now let's get up fast. Please. Tell us.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
I said it to you twice today. I'll tell you the third time.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
The first thing that Cuyd Blancmore said was that Mr. Adams had been talking to us about failure and colloquialism

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
getting a month of investigation in the world before it's called war.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
We had a discussion about that and he came out what he said in substance was.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
Well, how would you people like it if I arranged to have Cyan sent overseas?

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I think the uncooperative schools think along those lines.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
That's the way that Cyan Blancmore said he came about.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
How would you like it?
