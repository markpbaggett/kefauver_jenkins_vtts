WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
That's me on the morning of the 11th January, two days later.

00:08.840 --> 00:13.920
That's a telephone conversation took place on a Saturday afternoon, and he reported to

00:13.920 --> 00:15.320
me on a Monday morning.

00:15.320 --> 00:23.560
General, do you have any idea to the number of telephone calls made by the committee's

00:23.560 --> 00:24.560
office?

00:24.560 --> 00:35.040
Two, four-sixth in behalf of the pilot's time for a tattoo for a call.

00:35.040 --> 00:40.000
There are an exceptionally large number of telephone calls.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Very, very large.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.680
I don't know the exact number, but the company commander has indicated to me that it averaged

00:48.680 --> 00:52.000
between one and two a day all the time.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.840
Now, there was one point that I might make clear.

00:55.840 --> 01:06.360
The telephone call coming to my headquarter, that were seized by neither me or my staff,

01:06.360 --> 01:10.400
amounted to a total of 29.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.640
It became the year I had three telephone calls.

01:15.640 --> 01:22.280
My team of staff had one telephone call, and my aide had 25.

01:22.280 --> 01:27.280
We have recorded.

01:27.280 --> 01:35.640
Will these calls all received by you or your staff or during the day, or what?

01:35.640 --> 01:38.880
20 am at night?

01:38.880 --> 01:41.560
I don't recall any telephone calls coming to me.

01:41.560 --> 01:45.400
The ones that I received were in my office in the daytime.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.400
I think.

01:46.400 --> 01:55.400
Now, on the calls that you received from the staff members, there were all flight calls.

01:55.400 --> 02:02.400
I mean, there were many suggestions that you should do this or you shouldn't do this.

02:02.400 --> 02:12.480
But they called the diabetes with Mr. Mavinia, who was very polite and friendly.

02:12.480 --> 02:22.480
He was the one who was the only one who communicated with you.

02:22.480 --> 02:28.480
He is the only one on the staff who might have had any telephone calls coming.

02:28.480 --> 02:34.440
Now, after December 9th, I believe you have testified that the evening's matches were

02:34.440 --> 02:35.440
stopped.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.440
How many evening's matches did the father sign receive?

02:40.440 --> 02:46.440
The father sign had four evening's matches to work on committee business.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.640
First, the third, fourth, and the seventh.

02:49.640 --> 02:54.640
They were telephone calls received in each instance that he was required to leave a goal

02:54.640 --> 02:57.640
to strengthen on the yaw.

02:57.640 --> 03:04.440
On the third and the third and the seventh, they were evening's matches.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.440
Either to the pastor's midnight.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.440
Or to the other evening's matches.

03:10.440 --> 03:17.440
On the fourth, the request was for an all-night pass to remain out until regular.

03:17.440 --> 03:23.440
That was on the Friday night and he was authorized to be absent until the following morning,

03:23.440 --> 03:25.440
which is 5.50.

03:25.440 --> 03:31.440
The other evening's pass that he received was on the 17th of November when Senator McCarthy came

03:31.440 --> 03:37.440
to the wire-air force state in order to confer with the father sign.

03:37.440 --> 03:44.440
And then, of course, the other pass that he granted was on Thanksgiving Day, which the

03:44.440 --> 03:49.440
court was an evening pass, a night before Thanksgiving, which is a requested by the committee

03:49.440 --> 03:53.440
for the express purpose of spending Thanksgiving Day working on committee business.

03:53.440 --> 04:00.440
As I recall, you stated that prior to December 9th, we had passed the six-hour with father

04:00.440 --> 04:06.440
night, yes, whom I'd included a weekend pass, which made six-hour to seven.

04:06.440 --> 04:12.440
But when the pastors were given just for the evening, he did go off the post.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.440
He didn't do any committee work on the post.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.440
Yes, there were 11 visits by members of the staff.

04:18.440 --> 04:22.440
At the time, I talked to five of Cheyenne on the eighth.

04:22.440 --> 04:27.440
I explained to him that I wanted to cooperate in every way to help out.

04:27.440 --> 04:31.440
And I asked him at that time whether his business was in Phoenix.

04:31.440 --> 04:37.440
Then, about a month since I talked to Mr. Cole and I dealt the impression that this was a

04:37.440 --> 04:43.440
limited proposal and this unfinished business was in Phoenix sometimes.

04:43.440 --> 04:47.440
And he said, no, I have more to do now than I've ever had.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.440
He said, this private charm, things are coming up all the time.

04:52.440 --> 04:57.440
So I said that I would be very happy to provide facilities on the post.

04:57.440 --> 05:02.440
If any members of the staff die at the comments and so are the committee business,

05:02.440 --> 05:06.440
I'd make available a conference room and do anything we could to help.

05:06.440 --> 05:17.440
So there were 11 visits by members of the staff to visit private Cheyenne for the purpose of conducting committee business.

05:17.440 --> 05:25.440
I might differentiate that there was a federal and actual visit by members of the staff to perform committee business.

05:25.440 --> 05:32.440
Mr. Cole came down on the afternoon of the 19th to pick him up when he got a pass.

05:32.440 --> 05:39.440
He came down again the day before Thanksgiving to pick him up to take him on pass.

05:39.440 --> 05:46.440
And Mr. Cole arrived twice, a member of the staff, once on November 11th.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.440
And the other also on the 17th.

05:49.440 --> 05:59.440
Now I presume that they conferred, but I wanted to differentiate between the specific visits for the purpose of conferring the evenings.

05:59.440 --> 06:07.440
And these business partners to call on the six private Cheyenne up and the business partners to call on the 11th and 17th.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.440
General, they make use of the conference room that you suggested.

06:11.440 --> 06:16.440
They made use of the conference room one time.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.440
One time, yes.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.440
But other than that, no use was made of it.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.440
Not that I know of.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.440
That's all.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.440
And the father, he left 10 minutes.

06:28.440 --> 06:36.440
The 4th Senator Potter, as I was saying, we have this opportunity, but we're trying to ask the years of the vaccination to allow our station to identify them.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.440
So this is ABT, television network.

06:39.440 --> 06:44.440
But I have not, as yet, taken final action on the report.

06:44.440 --> 06:51.440
What is the nature of what I do as well? Is that information you've evaluated?

06:51.440 --> 06:56.440
The IG report is a report which is made for the commander.

06:56.440 --> 07:05.440
In other words, there were certain allegations of irregularities on my post, which I called upon my IG, to find out about,

07:05.440 --> 07:14.440
the report to me in order to let me decide what action needed to be taken, if any.

07:14.440 --> 07:20.440
It's my private confidential investigator.

07:20.440 --> 07:27.440
Could I ask this, General Ryan, because the report takes an issue of reporting results of an interview.

07:27.440 --> 07:37.440
And then does the IG endeavor to evaluate the report, or is it much like a wall file from an FBI report, for example?

07:37.440 --> 07:45.440
The expected general submit conclusions and recommendations.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.440
Yes.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.440
And I make my own decisions.

07:49.440 --> 07:55.440
General, who was the expected general conducted the investigation?

07:55.440 --> 07:56.440
Colonel Polgatins.

07:56.440 --> 08:01.440
The day on your tab, he's on my tab. Yes, he's my expected general.

08:01.440 --> 08:06.440
And you stated that the complete investigation has now been concluded.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.440
No, sir.

08:07.440 --> 08:11.440
All testimony is then and is in the hands of the committee.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.440
Is that investigation going on, or is it the president's own?

08:15.440 --> 08:21.440
No, sir. The investigation is far at the expected general has been able to proceed and then completed.

08:21.440 --> 08:27.440
But I have not as yet taken final action.

08:27.440 --> 08:36.440
General Ryan, from your testimony, you stated that the father's gurn did not receive the preferential treatment report.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.440
Is that correct?

08:39.440 --> 08:46.440
I think, Senator, that depends upon the definition of preferential treatment.

08:46.440 --> 08:53.440
And my definition of preferential treatment is that a man has the red carpet rolled off on.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.440
It's made easy for him.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.440
He's cobbled. He's shown favor.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.440
And in that respect, I should say no.

09:02.440 --> 09:09.440
The planning private churn passes to work on a committee business with preferential treatment.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.440
He certainly got preferential treatment.

09:12.440 --> 09:18.440
And the, the only use of the number of passes that Robert Chyne received is far fewer concerns.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.440
Did not have too much preferential treatment.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.440
I did not look upon that as preference.

09:24.440 --> 09:31.440
And if Robert Chyne, does Robert Chyne receive the entire training course that any other training would receive?

09:31.440 --> 09:35.440
Yes sir. His passage did not interfere with his training.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.440
He completed the prescribed course.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.440
And as I said, he was rated superior by his company committee.

09:40.440 --> 09:46.440
Well, Robert Chyne was assigned to your command.

09:46.440 --> 09:56.440
As you would need words from the secretary or the secretary's office that Robert Chyne was soon be your job.

09:56.440 --> 10:03.440
The first time that I heard about private chyne was on November 3rd when the secretary visited for six.

10:03.440 --> 10:08.440
I don't remember ever having heard about private chyne before that.

10:08.440 --> 10:14.440
And the secretary in presenting the problem to me was very objective.

10:14.440 --> 10:18.440
He stated the fact that he wanted to cooperate with the committee.

10:19.440 --> 10:25.440
And he instructed you that Robert Chyne had just non-finished business with the committee.

10:25.440 --> 10:30.440
And it wouldn't have surfaced as taking time off and time to take care of that.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.440
What, is that correct?

10:31.440 --> 10:37.440
The indicators of the committee had requested that private chyne be made available during its off-suedish period,

10:37.440 --> 10:41.440
at certain times, in order to complete certain committee work.

10:41.440 --> 10:47.440
And that he wanted to cooperate with the committee and that he felt that the only time the private chyne could be made available to the committee,

10:47.440 --> 10:50.440
would be on weekend.

10:50.440 --> 10:57.440
But he indicated that that was up to me that provided a satisfactory to you.

10:57.440 --> 11:09.440
You think responsibility for honoring the request of the members of the committee staff for the number of passes that the private chyne would be?

11:09.440 --> 11:10.440
Yes sir.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
I have no further questions.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
Mr. Simonton.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.440
General Lyon, when did you join the Army?

11:21.440 --> 11:25.440
I joined the Army May 12, 1917.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.440
May 12, 1917? Yes, how did you join it?

11:28.440 --> 11:35.440
I entered the training camp at Spotsburg and I was commissioned to second the Second August 15, 1917.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.440
What range of the service? Infantry.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.440
What was your experience at World War I?

11:41.440 --> 11:46.440
What was the enshrances of the two-liter of the 49th infantry?

11:46.440 --> 11:49.440
What was your experience at World War II?

11:49.440 --> 11:55.440
World War II? I was on General Bradley's path in 12th Army Group, Q5.

11:55.440 --> 11:59.440
You've been in the Army a long time, haven't you? Yes sir.

11:59.440 --> 12:03.440
What do you think of the United States Army?

12:04.440 --> 12:08.440
The other thing we have the best to cook down in the world.

12:08.440 --> 12:13.440
We have the best trained Army that this country has ever had.

12:13.440 --> 12:19.440
And I think that this Army is well-led.

12:19.440 --> 12:24.440
We have in the field, at the present time, two of the finest two armies.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.440
This is never a representative United States.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.440
The eight armies in Korea and the seven-domy in Europe.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.440
This first class is the battalion.

12:34.440 --> 12:43.440
And as far as the United States Army is concerned, we feel that we are ready for anything.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.440
My colleagues have asked most of the questions that I want to ask.

12:47.440 --> 12:56.440
But I just like to confirm, in my opinion, everything that you said about our Army.

12:56.440 --> 13:05.440
About eight years ago, I heard Mr. Churchill say that the most amazing thing in World War II was the fact that within the short 30 years,

13:05.440 --> 13:14.440
the hard call of the American regular army could develop into the greatest fighting force that the world has ever known.

13:14.440 --> 13:18.440
You're a member of that hard call.

13:18.440 --> 13:25.440
I think it's a great thing for the millions of people in this country to have watched that I have.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.440
You are the meaner when you've been on this thing.

13:29.440 --> 13:39.440
I believe there are millions of Americans, mothers and fathers who will be proud to have a man like you training their sons.

13:39.440 --> 13:52.440
When you leave the Army, and I hope that's a long time from now, in my opinion, you will take the respect of the people of this country as the result of your testimony in the past two days.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.440
Thank you, Senator.

13:55.440 --> 14:00.440
And all of a sudden, is that a draw of Mr. Delight?

14:00.440 --> 14:11.440
On the one hand, the training course, the training that this country, 15 weeks.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.440
Father Tyron is going to be free.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.440
They will be free.

14:17.440 --> 14:27.440
Then, Father Tyron is brought up to camp Gordon Georgia to attend the full-of-machines school to take military elite for the winter of the two years,

14:27.440 --> 14:31.440
and the other professionals in father Tyron.

14:31.440 --> 14:37.440
Most of their watch, Father Tyron, was handled the same as any other trainee that we received.

14:37.440 --> 14:48.440
Our classification assignment in the United States Army is the finest system that the human mind has been able to advise as far as the military mind is concerned.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.440
I find out that the training ground is very good.

14:51.440 --> 14:57.440
It was a non-unpreceived, or a part of this, to part of the training training.

14:57.440 --> 15:05.440
It happened there for eight weeks there, and it takes you training, and one could be trained further for some specialized training and other information.

15:05.440 --> 15:11.440
Yes, I'll be very glad to send you a lot of time with China and happen to get down to the camp Gordon, Senator.

15:11.440 --> 15:23.440
Why wasn't particularly interrupted except I wanted to know what the normal procedure was, and I'm sorry, but the training usually spent eight weeks there, and it's very hard to do the qualifications for specialized service.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.440
They were then trying to do it.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.440
Yes, that was the normal procedure.

15:28.440 --> 15:33.440
Private China had the special qualifications, and he was transferred to camp Gordon.

15:33.440 --> 15:40.440
And he was reported to the Department of the Army, not by name. The Department of the Army didn't know who Private China was.

15:40.440 --> 15:51.440
He was reported as an MOLF 1446. That's the military occupation, especially. They didn't know the Private China, the Private Brown, and who he was.

15:51.440 --> 15:56.440
Private Chinese, do you work for the people? For six.

15:56.440 --> 16:06.440
This is about 60, about 60 percent. Come back for advancements and for training, the other 40 goes to various specialist schools. That's all.

16:06.440 --> 16:15.440
Mr. Welk, Mr. St. John's class. Go straight to Mr. Welk.

16:16.440 --> 16:22.440
Mr. Demo-Ront.

16:22.440 --> 16:29.440
That makes me feel too, because when I first came into the Army in 1917, they called Lieutenant Lipster.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.440
He won the little thing back there again.

16:34.440 --> 16:42.440
The third guy in the memorandum is the T.

16:42.440 --> 16:52.440
That was the occasion you called Mr. Adam to a pass that was requested by Blue Mitchell-Libinia, is that correct?

16:52.440 --> 16:58.440
Yes, sir. That pass was requested, was it not for committee business?

16:59.440 --> 17:00.440
Yes, sir.

17:00.440 --> 17:07.440
That was at a time when Private China was scheduled for a free cycle training.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.440
Yes, sir.

17:08.440 --> 17:18.440
And I believe you said to Private as you called Mr. Adam to about that, and that as a result of that call, you requested the grant plan.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.440
Yes, sir.

17:19.440 --> 17:27.440
Now on December 8th, you had Private China before you, with reference to these weeknight passes, is that right?

17:28.440 --> 17:29.440
Yes, sir.

17:29.440 --> 17:40.440
And on that occasion, I believe you testified that he informed you that he hadn't been off any of his work, there's new things were coming up all the time.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.440
Yes, sir.

17:41.440 --> 17:53.440
With reference to your action on that day, General, in canceling the weeknight passes, did you call Mr. Adam for a medication?

17:53.440 --> 18:02.440
I called Mr. Adam and told him that I expected to cancel these weeknight passes.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.440
And did you tell us, General, what Mr. Adam's reply was?

18:05.440 --> 18:10.440
Mr. Adam replied that if I thought that was the proper thing to do, it was all right.

18:10.440 --> 18:15.440
Did Mr. Adam even refer about to the secretary, or did he have to that right on the table?

18:15.440 --> 18:16.440
Yes, sir.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.440
Right over the phone.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.440
And you've never seen any countermeasure in the battle.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.440
No, sir.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.440
Now, you know what General, right?

18:27.440 --> 18:35.440
Well, I just told him to shut his eyes off, and he told Lieutenant Brown to announce that he's here.

18:35.440 --> 18:47.440
I don't know, my own knowledge, the only thing that I can repeat is thought, is what Lieutenant Brown's, before it to me, said that the army had renamed.

18:47.440 --> 18:51.440
And as far as I was concerned, I didn't rename on anything.

18:51.440 --> 18:57.440
Did you, sir, prepare for round at 14 in what Mr. Cohen talked to the army, have you made someone?

18:57.440 --> 18:59.440
No, sir, he didn't.

18:59.440 --> 19:07.440
Did you get the exciting act with the call that being dropped in order, and he was extremely upset?

19:07.440 --> 19:12.440
I got the impression that Mr. Cohen was extremely upset.

19:12.440 --> 19:18.440
This telephone conversation fit place between my age, with a young lieutenant, and Mr. Cohen.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.440
It didn't come for me direct.

19:20.440 --> 19:24.440
My age didn't report it to me for two days.

19:24.440 --> 19:30.440
So, that under those circumstances, I didn't really take it from me.

19:30.440 --> 19:36.440
I thought that Mr. Cohen was upset, that he got excited.

19:36.440 --> 19:41.440
Probably said a lot of things, that he shouldn't have said.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.440
But I didn't, he didn't fight me, any.

19:45.440 --> 19:50.440
I make an alteration of your age, and you think he's right, with Mr. Cohen as well, then?

19:50.440 --> 19:52.440
Don't you, don't make it up.

20:01.440 --> 20:09.440
Now, general, new things, and I think, certainly, that these patterns did not interfere with the call of training.

20:10.440 --> 20:15.440
That's the company commander reported to me here.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.440
And he was gratifying that situation.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.440
My poor confidence in the company commander report, yes.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.440
Will you be getting the property of the carrier?

20:24.440 --> 20:25.440
Yes, sir.

20:25.440 --> 20:31.440
Can you tell us, for what kind of a target is that, reading the carrier's cover?

20:31.440 --> 20:32.440
Yes, sir.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.440
What is the greatest carrier of all types of stuff?

20:36.440 --> 20:38.440
That's his efficiency rating.

20:38.440 --> 20:43.440
He left the company, the company commander had to give him two ratings, efficiency rating and a carrier rating.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.440
And the efficiency rating is superior.

20:46.440 --> 20:56.440
That's the general overall rating, with regard to the way he applied himself to his training, and the result that we're obtained in his training.

20:56.440 --> 21:00.440
You know what, these ratings are better for a carrier, is that right?

21:00.440 --> 21:01.440
Yes, sir.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.440
That way, I'm 100% satisfied.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.440
Carried to go.

21:05.440 --> 21:09.440
A man's character in the Army is very important.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.440
And that's one of the most important things that a company commander does.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.440
It's one of his most important duties.

21:16.440 --> 21:23.440
Looking back upon my service with a company commander, I thought hard and fast, whenever I gave a man his character.

21:23.440 --> 21:30.440
And private shine was given character fair by Lieutenant Miller in whom I have complete confidence.

21:30.440 --> 21:37.440
And I don't think that Lieutenant Miller, who is now Captain Miller, gave this rating lightly.

21:37.440 --> 21:42.440
I'm sure that he thought about it for a long time, as he would before he gives any man the fair character.

21:42.440 --> 21:50.440
And Lieutenant Miller will testify here, and I'm sure that he will be able to tell you why he gave him a fair character.

21:50.440 --> 21:57.440
When a man is in the Army and you're the company commander, you see him all day every day, and he gets to know that man.

21:57.440 --> 22:05.440
And he has thousands of things that are involved, and that you've taken the consideration before you put that character down.

22:05.440 --> 22:10.440
Ten points, anything particular, I think would be a mistake.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.440
I don't mean to pinpoint anything general.

22:13.440 --> 22:21.440
I just would ask you this question, you as the commanding general of the sports have every confidence in the capabilities of your captain.

22:21.440 --> 22:28.440
Now Captain Miller, and with backup his decision as to the character rating, you know, yes sir.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.440
Now I want to ask you more questions, General.

22:31.440 --> 22:38.440
In the evening, the sports, sometimes there's a little bit of informal training going on, is there not?

22:38.440 --> 22:39.440
Yes sir.

22:39.440 --> 22:44.440
I think I heard the word GI parties are held from time to time.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.440
Can you tell us what is meant by that?

22:47.440 --> 22:52.440
The GI party is a barrack cleanup party.

22:52.440 --> 22:56.440
A barrack performed one of the supervision of the Fertone Stun.

22:56.440 --> 23:02.440
Each company is divided into four Fertunes, about 65 men in each Fertone.

23:02.440 --> 23:11.440
Each Fertone has a barrack by itself, and on Thursday night, usually, the Fertone Stun Sergeant is all the men in the barracks together, and they clean the barracks.

23:11.440 --> 23:20.440
They stop the floor and walk the windows, drop the walls down, clean the latrines, and put the barracks in first-class shape.

23:20.440 --> 23:27.440
And there's another informal training that goes on in the evenings and the other evenings during the week sometimes.

23:27.440 --> 23:32.440
So there's other informal training such as weapons cleaning.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.440
And that is done on a regimental roster.

23:34.440 --> 23:49.440
The company's at various times has ordered to send certain men to the weapons cleaning, the house, in order that the crew serves weapons, may be cleaned by a team of men.

23:49.440 --> 23:59.440
Well in general, I thought that you don't have to have to throw a range of these men on idols, have to fire a flock of knives, they have things to do to them.

23:59.440 --> 24:09.440
So to the movies, they watch television, they listen to the radio, they write letters on, we have five service clubs that are going every night with statues.

24:09.440 --> 24:18.440
On the other hand, many times, they have official duties to perform in preparing their equipment and themselves for duties on the following day.

24:19.440 --> 24:26.440
But as good soldier, after a little while, he gets himself ready for the following day in rather fast fashion.

24:26.440 --> 24:31.440
That doesn't take him long to clean his life and get his equipment laid out and get himself cleaned up.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.440
And he's off to the movies so far.

24:34.440 --> 24:42.440
Now, according to the fire and shine, had a path on it, night this day with the guy party, he wouldn't be partaking in the festivities, wouldn't he?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.440
No, that he would not.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.440
Thank you.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
Good job.

24:49.440 --> 24:52.440
You can go to Mr. Tim Clark.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.440
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.440
I'm a faculty of Mr. Collins.

24:57.440 --> 25:05.440
I don't know why on a first-flight to compliment you, you're one of the key witnesses who have been able to answer questions about getting wrong,

25:06.440 --> 25:09.440
the rambling statues.

25:09.440 --> 25:23.440
I may say I think that your excellent record and career fighting communists, perhaps gives you a better picture of the importance of fighting the bone and many people have.

25:23.440 --> 25:36.440
I would like to personally thank you for having made Mr. Shine available over weekends, you know, not in planning to do committee work.

25:36.440 --> 25:52.440
Mr. Shine has been working for a long time, personally on the Portland, with radar laboratories, for some 33 security risks, all the common backgrounds, rich souls, finally been removed from that work.

25:53.440 --> 26:14.440
I assume that you would agree with me in your experience in career and in the Army, that one of the extreme targets of any nation which wanted to destroy us would be to try to infiltrate or not care, no touch the mother's face.

26:15.440 --> 26:30.440
Yes, sir, I believe that they would try to infiltrate the military as well as the press and the educational institution.

26:30.440 --> 26:43.440
Now, just one other person, I may say that I have been trying to point out over and over again that our difficulty has not been with the uniform men like yourself.

26:43.440 --> 26:51.440
The principal difficulty has been with these civilians in the Pentagon, men who have no record of service like you have.

26:51.440 --> 26:59.440
I think if we were dealing with you instead of some of the civilians we have been dealing with, we would not be engaged in such a today.

27:00.440 --> 27:07.440
Let me just ask this question, I'm sure that you wouldn't object to a committee of the Congress.

27:07.440 --> 27:19.440
Taking out a huge trace of all rotten apples in the barrel, even though I think we'd all agree that 99, perhaps 9% percent of the military are good on a soil America.

27:19.440 --> 27:23.440
But when they are rotten apples, they should be dug out to the real life of them.

27:23.440 --> 27:28.440
I believe that rotten apples should be dug out whether they are in the military or out of the military.

27:28.440 --> 27:40.440
Now, Mr. Terwin, I want to request to make a decision to reveal the fact that Mr. Sinclair has gone into the tractor writing of Mr. Sine,

27:40.440 --> 27:51.440
if he can say that you are in turn of Mr. Sine, we should ask General Howard to appear in the news stories, or the attack of General Howard at the end of Mr. Sine's training at Camp Gordon,

27:51.440 --> 27:59.440
so that he was an outstanding soldier and a fan point of character, efficiency and almost everything else.

27:59.440 --> 28:10.440
So I'd like to request a little bit of a talk of Mr. Sinclair, General, you did not compile the charts that you've never told us today.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.440
That's the first time I ever saw that shot.

28:12.440 --> 28:27.440
I would not question you, Lord, please, now I can do have an aftertaste of ground, and I'd like to know if I can demonstrate what I consider the most dishonest, little foamy job of chartmaking that I have ever seen.

28:27.440 --> 28:36.440
Now, I have to ask you some questions because I'm family and question him some simple things about you.

28:42.440 --> 28:47.440
I think we've got the key.

28:47.440 --> 29:01.440
So, basically, we have to gather to say that Mr. Sine has the number of black marks on it, and we have the start of the average soldier with more black marks on it.

29:01.440 --> 29:05.440
So, if you think this is the part I'm showing our food, you just move and we get food, I'd like to know how.

29:05.440 --> 29:11.440
Senator, you make your voice and you can't hear anything because the microphone can't follow you as much.

29:11.440 --> 29:25.440
I would like to ask Mr. Sine to know how important the point of your hard work is when I get to find out who prepared it and have them put in a little.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.440
You hear that?

29:27.440 --> 29:42.440
Mr. Sine, now a little, I'm sure that they heard of my family with their son yet their last law for being in doctor, point-trotter-in-dot-me.

29:42.440 --> 29:51.440
I didn't know they were picking all these for my men to get a black mark for being in doctor, so that way, let's go back to that guest room.

29:52.440 --> 30:05.440
Now, now we go on further, we found out on the 23rd, Mr. Sine's basic training started, that is, we're doing a lot of stuff for the next class.

30:05.440 --> 30:11.440
And what was already written, he could be cut apart because he's basic training staff, right?

30:11.440 --> 30:15.440
And while coming out from the class to the main corridor, let's look at him.

30:15.440 --> 30:27.440
So, I see the man who's going up the man who's going up the stairs, we're going to the phone calls, we've got lots of all to the pretty start of our phone calls.

30:28.440 --> 30:37.440
Those are the average trainee, also get one call, they make one call, some trainees get one call, yes.

30:37.440 --> 30:44.440
So, they should be some extra here for the average trainee, and there's nothing, this one is the wrong one about a trainee getting a phone call, is there?

30:44.440 --> 30:45.440
No, it's the same.

30:45.440 --> 30:50.440
Nothing you've got there, but a man in the army, calling his girlfriend, is there?

30:50.440 --> 30:56.440
No, it's just, but that's what a few extra people are going to give themselves, so there may be a few other pilots.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.440
Also have girlfriends, and they call them.

30:59.440 --> 31:13.440
Also, down to the 20th of the main, the 20th of the main, is just to show him just a black mark, because he was on passion till 11 or 5pm.

31:13.440 --> 31:22.440
We find the order that the average trainee needs is what get a black mark, even though he's on training until midnight.

31:22.440 --> 31:34.440
I've been in my room, you'll appear to me that when you give a pilot a black mark, we're getting back at the normal lines, then the average trainee you'll say,

31:34.440 --> 31:37.440
go for midnight to get a white mark, right?

31:37.440 --> 31:39.440
No question about his face?

31:39.440 --> 31:40.440
No problem, they go.

31:40.440 --> 31:50.440
I'm in a situation where I'm in a position that I know you have nothing to do with the cooperation this track, the only reason I'm talking you on it.

31:52.440 --> 31:55.440
Thank you.
