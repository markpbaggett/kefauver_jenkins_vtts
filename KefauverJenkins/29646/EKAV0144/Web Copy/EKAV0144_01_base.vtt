WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
My laboratory make us four, two with the kernel in and two with the kernel up.

00:09.000 --> 00:17.000
For the same reason, San Erdo is just to have extra copies available, I assume I have for no other reason that I know.

00:17.000 --> 00:26.000
But was there some uncertainty in your mind at that time, and was there the subcommittee wanted the group of three or the group of two,

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
or I was wondering why you asked him to make two of each. There was no uncertainty at all in my mind.

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
I was under instructions to get the picture of the two individuals in it, and no one had given me instructions to make any number of copies.

00:45.000 --> 00:58.000
So much now for getting the picture. Do you also assume the responsibility for yourself of determining which of the four pictures which have come back to you as in large photo sets,

00:58.000 --> 01:10.000
or subsequently delivered to Council Jenkins in the newspaper. I do, sir. Did you do that on your own or after consultation with other members of the staff as to which of the four should be delivered?

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
I did that on my mind. I was at the one last parameter, sir. And active your own responsible. Yes, sir.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
With any intention to deceive or under the impression that that was the significant part of the picture, without any malicious intention whatsoever, senator.

01:27.000 --> 01:37.000
Was there any intention to deceive, but, however, was a malicious or an anonymous staff, something to tell?

01:38.000 --> 01:57.000
Do you also take the full responsibility for withholding from Council, Mr. Jenkins, in acknowledge your information, that this picture, Mr. Shine and Secretary Stephen's was taken from a group picture?

01:58.000 --> 02:10.000
I do, sir, in a moment. Then the Council at the time he presented the picture that is now exhibit number one.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
Mr. Shine and Secretary Stephen had no knowledge that it came from a group picture, did he?

02:19.000 --> 02:34.000
I, to my knowledge, he did not. You did not equate him with that fact. No, sir. You take the responsibility now for failing to inform him so that he might have been guided according to you.

02:35.000 --> 02:46.000
Do you have an idea, yes, sir? So, Senator Jackson, all in one question, Mr. Juliana. Why did you deliver two things to a different photograph?

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
Why did you deliver a blow-up of the key to one of the photographs, one containing three characters, one containing two?

02:54.000 --> 03:11.000
The only reason I did not, Senator, was because in discussing this picture with Mr. Colm and Mr. Jenkins at the original meeting, there was never any mention of another party.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
And I have always, I was under the continual instruction to punish a picture of Secretary Stephen's and then private Shine.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
No more questions.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
No, no questions. Senator Jackson, no questions. Senator Putter, I have no questions.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Senator Vannington? Senator Durkins, I have no questions.

03:40.000 --> 03:53.000
Mr. Juliana, you have just told us that you were a continuous instruction to find a picture of Stephen's and Shine.

03:53.000 --> 04:04.000
Is that right, sir? That's right, yes, sir. For how long have you been over those continuous instructions?

04:04.000 --> 04:20.000
I believe the first meeting was one night last week, whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday, I don't know.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
And again, when I told Mr. Colm in the corpus room here that the picture had arrived, yes, sir.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
There are the only times I believe that I've got any instructions concerning the picture.

04:33.000 --> 04:48.000
So, then over a period of a week or more, you will under what you will call continuous instruction to produce a picture of Secretary Stephen's and Shine.

04:48.000 --> 05:01.000
No, Mr. Wilson was over a period of two or three days or three days, and like a great hired man in the end, you produce, didn't you?

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Yes, sir. Now in answer to some questions, strike that out.

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
You will ask some questions by Senator McConnor, about the big picture which is the given two.

05:14.000 --> 05:25.000
Do you not wish to suggest to this committee or to the country that a man named Welsh, perhaps exhibit two do you, no, sir?

05:25.000 --> 05:36.000
You don't pour any more, but think it's possible that Welsh credit exhibit two do you, or it's possible that you don't believe that the author.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Thank you for that.

05:40.000 --> 05:56.000
Mr. Cullinanna, isn't that the central truth that no war of the original Shine that you was needed in the first instance?

05:56.000 --> 06:05.000
I don't borrow the question, but I'll let you put it to you this way. We've been able to get a lot of our ride in the cork room with the various things that were brought down from New York.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Seven questions.

06:08.000 --> 06:18.000
Yes? Well, I think I think the, I just assume that the only reason was thrown up was that it would be exhibited easier.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Easier?

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
Well, then the only thing to do was to bring in the oldest step of the original picture with three people in the cast.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Isn't that right?

06:30.000 --> 06:39.000
I think that's right. You were asked for something different from the things that Hong Kong Shine's wall.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I never knew what Hong Kong Shine's wall was.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
You did so what Hong Kong Shine's wall was never handed to you, sir.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
I did not know what Hong Kong Shine's wall is.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Did you think this came from a picture?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Where did you think this picture that I hold with my hand was from?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It was a picture of three came from.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I had no idea where it came from.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
This is the last picture in the present picture.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
You can get it from my front, from my front.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Go to the entrance.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Turn off the light and just put your hands on it and just put your hands on it.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I think this picture was a little...

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
What did you think this came from?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
The camera goes to my front.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
If I am, I think you might do this first round.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
Yes, I can say, I can say, Mr. Stadler, that a picture is a close relative of a fairy.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Now I foresee, sir, if I am like you.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I think you might do a 30-minute picture.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Now it's all empty.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
That's the duty, Anna.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
My question to you now is, when we come right down to this office room,

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
we can do very well with the exhibit three which I hold in my hand, Kathleen.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
I think it was the fight, but I also think that even your blown up pictures

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
is much larger and is still much nicer than the handle,

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
and with the better for the television cameras and for the audience.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, Mr. Stadler, when you do be the courtesy,

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
I remembering that I have by produced what I thought was the original picture

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
to be effective, needed to produce it on the scale of exhibit one,

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
which I now hold in my hand.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
You follow me, sir?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
No, I don't understand.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, perhaps it's a little of a cure.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
It might be.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Now another thing.

09:00.000 --> 09:11.000
You just told Senator Munn that you had no malicious intent when you had it in these.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
What I can now call the smaller picture is that, right?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
That is correct, sir.

09:17.000 --> 09:26.000
Are you intensely sorry that you did it?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Do the fact that it is...

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't care, do the fact that it has wasted so much time, I am sorry.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Only, sir?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Yes, sir.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Your conscience then doesn't bother you to this moment.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Is that right?

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
I did nothing wrong in my conscience and they do not bother.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Don't you think a term, typically, on the fortunate situation was created

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
when Mr. Steven sat in this chair and was confronted with your doctor's picture?

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
I respect the secretary of the Army as I do any other cabinet member of this country.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
And I wouldn't want to do anything so harm him.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Thank you, sir.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
Were you in this room when he was cross-examined by Mr. Jenkins in respect to that picture?

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
I believe I was part of the time, I believe I was.

10:18.000 --> 10:28.000
Did you hear the question asked him as to whether or not...

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
I have returned out of page 434 of the record, where Mr. Jenkins said to him,

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
well, I did not say demand, but what was your picture after David Shine was drafted,

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
ever taken with you alone at your suggestion anywhere?

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
Were you in the room when that question was asked, the secretary of the Navy as the Army of the Fats by my side?

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
I cannot testify that I was in the room at that time, I may have been.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
And did you fail to catch that word alone?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I did, yes, the failed to test the word alone.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Now I turned to Mr. Cohn's testimony.

11:13.000 --> 11:21.000
And I observed that on page 633 he testifies, and as a matter of fact,

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
I did not even catch the word alone, put in there by Mr. Jenkins.

11:28.000 --> 11:38.000
It's unfortunate that neither of you two men who held the key to this puzzle heard that word alone, isn't it?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
If you so, term it unfortunate, it might fail.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I don't term it unfortunate.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
You don't care?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I sure do care.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, then it was unfortunate that the two men who held the key to this small part,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
as I claim it was, failed to hear that word alone.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
The youth claim I was involved in a fraud, Mr. Welch,

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
I claim that there was at least a small fraud or L-fade terrible unfortunate for state.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
I resent the implication and I have testified that I took the responsibility.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
All right. Now as to the hearing of the word alone,

12:17.000 --> 12:24.000
have you observed that Mr. Cohn is perhaps slightly hard of hearing as he is slightly near-sighted?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Mr. Chairman, if I am right,

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
the answer to the question of our number alone must be set up for this session.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
If you also have come to find the little information good,

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
if he's looking for a last-minute audience to come talk about any physical defects of my chief counsel,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
it's so indecency, so dishonest.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I'm not talking about any physical defects,

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
but also well-spinning, I do not understand this.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Let's just tell him to be issues with your wealth.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
Each Minister, Mr. Chairman, may I point out these minutes we've wasted years.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
It's wasting a vast amount of manpower, very important manpower,

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
I think the manpower of age centers, and they have a very serious deficit.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
We cannot only say that I, as Councilmember Cohn,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
that is the point of order I would like to remind you,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
that each one of the committee will amend the audience

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
that the chairman of the conventional committee does not have the authority

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
to the judge has in court.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
All he can do is to enforce the rules that the committee has.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
The rules provide that counsel for each side may have ten minutes in which to interrogate the witness,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
and as long as the questions are relevant,

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
and the chair you, regardless of whether they're repetitious enough to chair

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
just enough for you, he has the power to stop counsel or to interrogate some hasten questions.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Mr. Chairman, we ask your questions, the spring permission.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
And the chair, I think the chair may be completely correctly,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
so that's power, but what do you do, and when the rules are,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
you get ten minutes to ask questions,

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
if Council uses the ten minutes to clown and keep his arm with the simply spam.

14:13.000 --> 14:23.000
I would like to hear from you, that the chair, since we have the power to tell the counsel at any time has been spiked,

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
we have repeated on the basis that these questions are to be asked by Council and by Senator.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And the chair has no power over either Senator to counsel,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
I can tell them that questions they can and cannot ask,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
as long as they are here to be relevant or mature.

14:40.000 --> 14:48.000
And if the chair, Mr. Chairman, I am confident that Mr. Jenkins knows the difference between questioning and clowning.

14:48.000 --> 14:56.000
And if Mr. Jenkins appears to be clowning, I wish him to get upon the, as he freely may and should.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Is my ten minutes up, I observed, by my clock it is.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Do you have a minute left?

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Is your hearing good?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Excellent.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
Had you heard that word alone in Mr. Jenkins' questions,

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
would you have spoken to the Defense of Secretary Steven?

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
You were asking the hypothetical, which I am indeed.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
If you and I have, yes sir, you will ever, and quick to spring to his defense, wouldn't you possibly?

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
From which it follows that you know an injustice was done, don't you?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
No, I was not.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
Well, were you going to spring to his defense in case were no injustice was done?

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I didn't get that, Mr. Well.

15:45.000 --> 15:54.000
Were you going to spring to his defense under circumstances where no injustice was being done?

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
I still don't follow that, maybe the governor's question is too.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
My question is first and too far.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
If you had heard the word alone in Mr. Jenkins' question,

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
would you have said you would have been quick to spring to Secretary Steven's defense in the law?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I did not say that, sir.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
What did I may have?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I may have.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
You would have liked to, wouldn't you?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I may have.

16:22.000 --> 16:36.000
And if you were going to spring to his defense, it would have been because you thought a very unfortunate situation was created by what you did to that picture, possibly so.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
The time has expired, Senator McCarthy.

16:39.000 --> 17:02.000
Mr. Well, I would normally have some trouble with that, but I've been waiting here patiently all day to get Secretary Steven's back on the stand, so I thought we were going to trouble him at this time.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
Turn to the clock to return to Mr. Jenkins' house.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I have no further questions.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Mr. Well, I have no further questions.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Chair has none.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Mr. Well, I have no further questions.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
I have no further questions.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Send directions.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
No questions.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Send directions.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Just one question.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
Mr. Serene, normally do the full of studying for the committee for making arrangements.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I don't think so, Mr. Serene.

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
How did it happen that Mr. Serene was called upon to throw a panel of food in it?

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
I thought that, then, with his experience here on the hill, which is a lot longer than mine.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Why do you mean the Serene?

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
He keeps working in the building here a lot longer than I could.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
The panel I'm telling the full of studying.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
What's the expert like the full of studying as well as anyone on the staff?

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
That was the reason why you turned it over to him.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yes, sir.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
The full of studies.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
That's right.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Just the mechanical life that's taking it down and the carrying out your instructions.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Yes, sir.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Nothing else.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
So, Senator Potter?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Senator Simonton?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I have no further questions.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Any further comments?

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Mr. Chairman, the council's turn ahead.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
You've got to go out and help with the amendment.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yes, sir.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
Well, did you turn to Mr. Serene for assistance on the picture because you can fit it in,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
particularly, a desk in dealing with pictures?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
No, sir.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
No, one thing further only.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
After the Army statement of events was published,

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
was some sort of a loyalty flag circulated in your office?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Mr. Chairman, I can tell you I have to do well.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Mr. President?

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
I do not consider that your main to the particular point of inquiry.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
Unless Mr. Well, you could show that it does reflect on the inquiry relating to the

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
pictures.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
I must advise the committee that it is not a property.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
There is, Mr. Jenkins, to you and me, the familiar ground of credibility of a weapon.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Credibility of a weapon?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Right.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
Is the question directed to the credibility of that smile that I thought there was.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
It's very simple.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I was like, will you repeat the question, Mr. Welles?

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
At about the time, the Army...

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
I remember the question, Mr. Welles.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Is the question whether or not this witness circulated...

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Or signs...

19:52.000 --> 19:59.000
Mr. Welles, I failed to see where that would reflect on the credibility of the witness frankly.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
But I ask Mr. Jenkins that you find out if there was such an alarm you could see it sometimes.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I will explore that.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Thank you, sir.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I think that's all from the Army.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Mr. MacArthur?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Uh, Jim...

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
Mr. Jackson brought down serene, may I have a draw some of it?

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
Uh, as it's correct that the only function down here was to follow your instructions.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Uh, and act as a messenger.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
You told him to connect to the property to move down a better place.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
Uh, the duty of him to take the picture down.

20:39.000 --> 20:48.000
So, the enlargement of the unhappicture made to also have an enlargement of the portion of the picture...

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
In which included only Secretary Steven and Sean.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
Yes, sir. I might as well just don't follow mine's instructions implicitly.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
And serene had nothing whatsoever to do with making any decisions about what type of an enlargement therapy.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
He did not search my knowledge.

21:07.000 --> 21:19.000
In other words, uh, Sergeant Arthur, he was merely a messenger boy for you carrying the specter to the enlargement room and bringing him back to you.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
I don't like to be very clean as a messenger, but actually that's what he wants.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
I know he is not a messenger, it's a messenger, but I mean, in this particular incident.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Yes, sir, that's correct.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
And he did not suspect the views in any shape or form.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Which picture should be submitted to Mr. Jenkins?

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
He didn't know which one to do with Mr. Jenkins.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
He did not say you're correct.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Thank you.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Any further questions?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Nothing further.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Any of these senators at my left?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Any further questions?

21:52.000 --> 22:05.000
I must have said my circumstances are not wrong to delay this, but in view of the fact that some questions are the vastest of our thoughts during the large picture before you are, I think it's significant number three.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
Do you mean to imply that it has been doctored in any way?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
No, I do not mean to imply that.

22:13.000 --> 22:22.000
I just occurred to me that that picture there may, I do not know, represent the film in its entirety.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Do you know whether it does or not?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Thank you.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
7.12 May I speak for your information?

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
Why are we on the subject of these photographs?

22:34.000 --> 22:42.000
And I do hope that this in the interest of extra-dating this matter, we have about the extort that subject.

22:42.000 --> 22:53.000
The original of these Stevens Adams exhibit will be introduced as a Saturday man presently.

22:53.000 --> 23:05.000
To clarify any question about whether or not any alteration was made of it, I think that will certainly complete the exploration directive at these photographs.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
As it turns into my right, I have any further questions?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Any to my left?

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
That's the right, I have any further questions?

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
ABC radio is bringing you on the scene coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings in Washington.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
This is ABC radio network.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
You are tuned to the Voice of New York City, WNYC.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Twenty-five.

23:47.600 --> 23:54.700

Friends of the Army,

23:56.880 --> 23:57.300

Commander,

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
General Report Lilし,

23:59.720 --> 24:00.180
inder,

24:00.180 --> 24:02.180
stock Nelson,

24:02.520 --> 24:03.340

24:04.500 --> 24:05.680
Punch sides,

24:06.180 --> 24:06.860
Street hurts,

24:06.860 --> 24:08.400
You listed in the question, sir.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.400
I heard your question.

24:09.400 --> 24:13.400
Your instruction came in March from the recall.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.560
You are right, and you rule hold this.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.060
Yes, sir.

24:18.060 --> 24:19.240
Madam President,

24:19.240 --> 24:20.240
no question.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.500
In that affection, the chair is ready to dismiss the security out.

24:27.260 --> 24:30.240
And we'll ask Associate Council Mr. Mayor,

24:31.100 --> 24:32.740
as the call that I put,

24:32.740 --> 24:34.260
the mayor will take over.

24:35.060 --> 24:36.560
General Intelligence,

24:36.560 --> 24:39.760
the next witness will be Mr. Don Serene.

24:40.260 --> 24:41.760
Mr. Secretary,

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
Mr. Secretary,

24:42.760 --> 24:43.760
Mr. General General.

24:45.260 --> 24:46.840
I'd like to ask your question,

24:46.840 --> 24:47.840
we, uh,

24:49.140 --> 24:50.840
maybe it's in the ground rules,

24:50.840 --> 24:53.440
but if you don't see back on,

24:54.340 --> 24:56.340
in regard to the photographs,

24:57.140 --> 24:58.940
I'm talking about for,

25:01.180 --> 25:02.180
for a day,

25:02.180 --> 25:04.180
I'll do the fact that you develop,

25:05.180 --> 25:10.700
I can single a reason to keep Mr. Stevens off the plane,

25:10.700 --> 25:15.000
further than anyone's mind about me.

25:16.460 --> 25:18.680
pulling water.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.440
The Brish敢 day shines gold.

25:22.200 --> 25:26.040
these included that they shine just asизins and...

25:26.880 --> 25:28.940
some curl standing to the fans.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.880
There will be another picture with eight forceman swing on us.

25:33.600 --> 25:39.060
That was the junior game with your generals.

25:39.060 --> 25:42.220
They picture only a shine and a feeling.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.660
That was the Jenkins as well.

25:46.380 --> 25:51.060
An knowledge of a third man having been on it or a fourth man having been on it.

25:53.160 --> 25:58.000
At this time, Mr. Chairman, I asked if we were found to the usual order

25:58.000 --> 26:00.400
and I called the chair to send some to the...

26:01.360 --> 26:03.680
the room number two, Doctor.

26:05.680 --> 26:10.880
And I just provide that once their witness is on the stand,

26:12.080 --> 26:17.680
British Council have unlimited time to question him and then you all run up to the side to sign.

26:18.800 --> 26:22.880
Ten months and a half over until that witness to testimony has been configured.

26:23.600 --> 26:29.440
As the chair knows, I came back here from up in Arizona

26:29.440 --> 26:34.320
and I was doctoring a virus infection with stroke.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.560
But I, a day with the committee, we agreed on these rules.

26:39.040 --> 26:44.560
As the chair knows, he called me the following day and read the rules to me.

26:45.360 --> 26:53.200
As the chair knows, I said that if we were firmly agreed that these ground rules would be followed,

26:54.240 --> 26:58.800
that I would temporarily set off the committee and appoint someone to take my place.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.960
I can see the rules on Mr. Chairman's point of point.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.680
As the first time in 30 minutes period,

27:05.680 --> 27:11.120
100 different ways of making the earliest statement to the effect that he has appointed

27:11.120 --> 27:14.720
someone to take these place on this second committee,

27:14.720 --> 27:17.920
is that correct or an incorrect statement, Mr. Chairman?

27:18.640 --> 27:19.920
Could I go to the chair?

27:19.920 --> 27:20.720
I'll say it.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.400
Could I finish my sentence on Mr. Chairman?

27:22.400 --> 27:23.440
No, I'll start with that.

27:23.440 --> 27:23.920
I'll finish that.

27:23.920 --> 27:24.800
I'll turn to you.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.800
Could I finish my sentence on another option?

27:27.760 --> 27:30.000
You have an interrupt, and the question is,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.400
perhaps the chair you would like to answer in the future,

27:32.400 --> 27:33.200
in First Minister.

27:33.200 --> 27:38.400
As the chair we called, the manor and the wicks and the boyguards that came to remember this,

27:38.400 --> 27:41.600
committee was informed that he was to proceed to the election,

27:41.600 --> 27:43.600
people will become stronger at this point.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.600
The difference being, in your case, was a temporary selection.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.600
You were nominated by the Senric Eurofund with council,

27:51.600 --> 27:55.200
and you were concerned by the Fourth Committee,

27:55.200 --> 27:58.000
and the committee members of the Senric committee in that way.

27:58.000 --> 27:58.800
Yes.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.600
Give me a minute.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.600
And you were asked to say this, so there's no...

28:01.600 --> 28:03.600
I might have made it.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.600
All but you have done.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.800
All but you're there, good to go.

28:06.800 --> 28:11.040
May I say I have to assume this understanding of the part of the Senate of the Fourth

28:11.040 --> 28:12.800
Act, there was a question of otherwise,

28:12.800 --> 28:16.400
that the point here, nominated so much to me,

28:16.400 --> 28:19.600
some of the Fourth Act, some of the Fourth Butler,

28:19.600 --> 28:21.600
some of the Fourth Butler,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.600
was not feeling well that day.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.800
I now wish he had been feeling well.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.600
I...

28:30.800 --> 28:34.800
Because of the temporary disavailment of some of their Butler,

28:34.800 --> 28:37.600
and for that reason alone,

28:37.600 --> 28:41.200
I nominated the Senric to Worshirt.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.400
Mr. Chairman, may I finish now?

28:44.400 --> 28:45.200
Please.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.400
Does the terrible return...

28:46.400 --> 28:48.000
You're getting a bite of bite, actually.

28:48.000 --> 28:48.400
Yes, sir.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.400
I think a very important point of work.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.600
I'm trying to withdraw that.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.600
I'm a chair called, me.

28:53.600 --> 28:58.000
The chair, either personally or in Secretary,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.600
I don't call, which are relevant to me.

29:01.600 --> 29:05.600
The rules, proposed.

29:05.600 --> 29:10.800
As I turn around, I just say this to the chair in Secretary Warn,

29:10.800 --> 29:13.600
asking the chair to call me in the Fourth Committee,

29:13.600 --> 29:16.400
so that these rooms might be adopted,

29:16.400 --> 29:18.000
so that the nomination move,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.200
the Senate of the Worshirt might be confirmed.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.000
There's a chair, a long recall,

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
even though neither one of us are monitoring that kind of recession,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
there's a chair, as I'll recall.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
If there is a stretch,

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
the state and respect that I was stepping off,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
the certainly fully,

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
because I had green food with the ground rules,

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
and if there were any changing in the ground rules during the proceeding,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
the violence just upon,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
resuming my clothes upon the self-commit.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
Now, the chair and all that happened to be chairman of the...

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
The court were already also...

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
I'm not certainly right to such.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I'm really certainly right,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
but we are greater fun.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I...

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
is the chair

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
in this upon allowing the citizens

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
to work on an investment for citizens

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
as they need to rest.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
But also, when I was raised,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
messing with your own way,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
putting the testimony,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
she's all under the judge,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
and nothing paddling through the picture.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I will...

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Mr. Chairman,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
do everything I can

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
to resume my position

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
on the self-commit date

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
which I retired,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
which I retired

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
with the understanding of these ground rules before.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
Mr. Chairman, the only statement.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
That's the thing.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
Mr. McCrady, we have reached a decision with reference to Mr. Saringin,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
and it will outdeep the necessity of any further discussion

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
about it. I'm sure.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Chairman.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Mr. McCrady, I'd like to be your answer to this statement.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
I do know that we will send a demo of the court

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
with respect to his interpretation of the rules or not.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
I am just about as anxious as he is.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And get on with this hearing,

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
and you get the secretary back on the stand.

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
If Mr. Jenkins are those who think that Mr. Saringin is a witness

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
that should be heard in this controversy,
