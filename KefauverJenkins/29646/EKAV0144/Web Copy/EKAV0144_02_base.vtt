WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
So it's been moved that we proceed to recall the Secretary of the Army.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.400
Mr. Chairman and I now deal with that assurance, but we do have another witness who is in

00:14.400 --> 00:19.000
a sharp witness that we desire to put on before the Secretary of the Army.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
The Secretary of the Army, I'm sure, has decided to chair the state of actual negative

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
within the room and the man that took it.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Well, after no time that's all I think he's been subpoenaed and is appeared there.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
We desire to call Mr. Ryan, so as the next one is Mr. McIntyre.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
So I have ordered Mr. Kevin.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
So as the next one is the next one is Mr. Kevin.

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
Mr. Chairman and I are going to run the stand from the council and from you sir, that before

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
he's hearing the relevant, Mr. Serena is to be called before this committee in these hearings.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
That's sure to be of any.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Yes sir, you have that assurance.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I thank you.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Mr. Chairman, I have one present for you.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Chair, over those of our previous members, please, please, Mr. President, you know, make an

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
out of our own little...

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Very brief, but...

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
We have our own little business.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Mr. Chairman, I agree with Senator Doe no more.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I will have a moment, call Sergeant Manchester.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
That's what Manchester is the next one.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
All right.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
All right.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
All right.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I have some...

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I'll come right here.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Shorten the thing.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I'll miss the man, Jessica, please.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
The man's up in here.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Sergeant Manchester.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Sergeant Manchester.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Sergeant Manchester.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Well, the Sergeant is coming forward, Mr. Chairman.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Well, the Sergeant is coming forward, man.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
We'll invite you.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
Sergeant Manchester has been called into the committee room and is now taking his seat at the witness table.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Not in the field of public sessions.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
And I would like to discuss matters having the...

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
The...

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
A compact...

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Between certain members of the committee...

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
And witnesses, and they were involved in some cases, I think, that's generally expected.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
The question is very early.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Probably the moment, Mr. Chairman.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
The news target, Manchester.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
He's got his phone, please.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
He's found his brother's testimony about the case of food, the whole food, and nothing but the food to help the guys.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I'll say Sergeant.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Sergeant Manchester, what is your full name, please?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
David Richard Manchester, sir.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
A rite is yours.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm a rite with the Army.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I'm a spass sergeant in the Army.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Where are you, Sergeant?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm not in the Army, sir. I'm in the Air Force.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Where were you on the remember 17th, 1953, when certain photographs were made?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Oh, that was a black airport station.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
That was a black airport station.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
A black airport station.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
A black airport station.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Did you direct the making of certain photographs on that occasion?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I did sir.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
I hint you, Sergeant, a photograph.

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
And I will identify it as being a photograph of the sector of the Army, Mr. Stevens,

03:32.000 --> 03:42.000
and Mr. Shine, Colonel Bradley, and a fourth man, who might do not know.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
And I will ask you to examine that photograph and see whether or not you directed the taking of it on November 17th.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
A lot of Jackson, the photograph of the enemy, is a tribute number four in the chair of the photograph.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Here's a gun in the cellar, and you may proceed, Sergeant.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes, sir, this is the photograph that was taken out again.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
If you know, can you identify the fourth man?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Yes, I can, sir.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Who is he?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
He is Mr. Carl.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Mr. Carl, yes, sir.

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
Now, I will ask you to examine a photograph introduced for the Army, being a large one exhibit number three places.

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
I am speaking whether or not that in your opinion is the same photograph, the one you had asked examining.

04:40.000 --> 04:52.000
I am interviewing Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams, and the first photograph I have in the event of obtaining a picture of four men.

04:52.000 --> 05:00.000
We have a division or a mission of the fourth man.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Thank you.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Let me have that just one more time.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Are they not the photographs you have now looked at?

05:09.000 --> 05:29.000
Introduce my Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams, and showing three men and the sleeve of a fourth man, in general and in the same photograph, as the one you had first handed you and showing a photograph of four men, the fourth man being his car.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
It looks the same, sir.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, is there not in your opinion the same?

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
My opinion is, if you direct the safety of that photograph, I did circumstances of the photographer.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Staff Sergeant Lancer.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
The unit where he is, he's in Japan right now.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
In Japan, yes sir.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
That was my understanding, you know, whether or not he has been directed to return at my request.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I do not know.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Do not know.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
No sir.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Point of order, Mr. Point of order, come for all of you.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
We can show that we have directed the street for the required.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
What is the number that's right?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We just have a three unit of the two.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Two, three, two, one.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
The number two, sir.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
The proof of the number three.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes sir, that number two.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
The one that's right is the three that's one that's in it and the evidence can be listed in number six.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
In the number four, that's the way I'm referring.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Being the first one I presented to the witness.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Right, right.

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
Sergeant, did you know who, if they are the same photographs made from the same frame?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Did he either cut out the fourth man?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Yes sir, what did that, I did circumstances.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
You did that, yes sir.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Why did you do that?

06:54.000 --> 07:06.000
Well, the main reason, sir, was so that the photographs that I did have made would be centered on the three individuals who, in my mind, were the main characters of the pictures.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
You did not consider Mr. Carl, main character of the picture.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
No, I didn't, that's very difficult.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I thought that if they did you want to direct you to the map.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
No sir.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
You did it entirely on your own, I did sir.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I took a room with you to deliver that photograph.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
I didn't deliver to anybody, sir, I sent one photograph to a private shine.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I want your photograph at his requester.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
Is that the photograph I am now in June, and I will ask you to please write this case.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm being exhibit number...

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
The room is the same as the game it is, as it is number three.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Is that the one you sent to private shine?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
This isn't the exact one, it's the copy of the one.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
But I mean the copy, yes sir.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
It is, it is the copy.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
And the room that you sent is a copy of.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
All, the room is number six, being the first photograph I have in June, when you took the room with me, sir.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I didn't send this to anybody, sir.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
The unit, well then how do you know how the system is in this area, the position of it is in the position of it is in the map of the room.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Yes, I will just follow this.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Number six.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Yes, I couldn't say how they came into this position, sir.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I do not know.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
My question is, the unit how they came into this position of the photograph, by the exhibit showing through me,

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
and with Levi, he has now developed Mr. Carr.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh no sir, you do not know sir.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
And on your own, we should leave you put out the fourth man, regarding you as an important,

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
or whether the irregardement is unimportant, it's just that he was in an unfavorable position for the good future.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Sergeant, I can use those negatives.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
How many photographs were taken there, that is, that is, that is, that is, there are eight photographs taken that day.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
All two directions, all in my directions.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
I think perhaps you have better fowls than negatives.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I'll slow this photographs.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I'll have them.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I'll have them in the bottom, super caution, if these are the negatives.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
And now I have to do stamina in the space where they're not they are, and if so, battle them.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
And that is my examination in chief and on our face, the witness.

10:03.000 --> 10:22.000
We've passed ten seconds for station identification.

10:23.000 --> 10:32.000
WNYC, New York City's own station.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
They were supposed to bend the exploit and, according to our base portal lab, they were destroyed.

10:43.000 --> 10:54.000
I imagine they were destroyed at the order of the, of one of the moh, who was in charge of the base portal lab, the Maguire Force Base.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Final of the data's destroyed.

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
Due to the fact that there was two things for printing, sir, that they were under exposure or something,

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
there was some defect and the negatives, so therefore they weren't of any value to us.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And then were they destroyed?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
No, not all of those. They were destroyed. No, they were the 18, sir.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I couldn't stay there.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
Best of you now, if you would like to go out of the day after the picture we take to the best of my knowledge, yes sir.

11:19.000 --> 11:30.000
If you do the blowout of the big picture of us, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sir.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Do you know who this?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I do not, sir.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
But if I'm reaching out to you, I, not, sir, I don't know.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
You know nothing about the base portal lab knowledge, you never know the truth if I missed you out.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I do not, sir.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Send him with me.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
No questions.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Send your words.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
No questions.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Send your words.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
No questions.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Better find out.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I have no questions.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I have a time in here, no questions.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I have no questions.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Mr. Robb.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
No questions.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Send him a prayer.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Mr. Boone, just one of the questions.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Mr. Boone, please.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Mr. Boone, please.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Mr. President, please.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I have something I missed.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
You say that there are eight pictures taken on that day.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yes, there are, sir.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Are the negative or positive in the world eight of those pictures?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
No, we don't, sir.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Is there any record who was in the world that keeps you from taking pictures?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
No, sir.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
How many pictures do you have a record?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Three, sir.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Do we have thousands of those three pictures here?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
No, we have the negatives of them, sir.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
But no positive, not the negative.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Well, I wouldn't know, sir.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
But, yeah, I like the pictures.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Yes, there they have them from me.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
They have them from me, and I think there's the positive.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
They're less different.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
But I was just one week ago.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I looked at those right there, so it's a bit of a change.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Now, after you know,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I'll prove,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
a positive picture, a negative picture from the slide,

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
what takes.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
No, I couldn't say this.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
You cannot say.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
No, sir, you don't have a word on that.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Any of those five pictures were a secretary of defense,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
and I've chained along.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
No, sir.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
You cannot talk.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
I cannot say this.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
I, I, I, will say this is my recognition as the UNI-1 picture.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
Well, that's why you prove a secretary of defense, and I've brought a chained to that.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
And, kind of, adding within that picture, you know, it's your fault.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And you've promised before I'm out of the picture, because I did.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
As Mr. Al-Sacute, you were having doubted the picture.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
You gave them the hadn't made that activation to capture.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
But it was certainly nothing delivered, and all.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
When you send private chained the picture as an official photograph,

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
there was no evil intent, or no divine annual fault,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
and having come to the part of the picture for a quiet act, no, sir.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
I believe you say you wanted to censor it on when you, the people you regard as the three central figures,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
and you're trying to see if it's private chained, or not brought to that, right?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I see.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
And, you say you did not make the flaw of this picture?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I did not, sir.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
And I have seen you not know the problem of the car or the flaw of the picture.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I do not know.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
You don't know if it's that.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
No, sir.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
You know that, have you heard from Mr. Al-Sacute, or I did not make the car or that picture?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I think you've been told that the world's presented it as a committee.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
I have not.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I see.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I have no further questions.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Anybody else?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
At the table?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Any questions you want to ask?

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
To ask Mr. Demetardi, no question, you're dismissed, sir.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Thank you, sir.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Chairman, I'm just glad you're confident, because many,

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
I would admit it counts along the speech that this witness was disposed of,

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
and, certainly, to both part of the same rules with respect to the proceeding of this incident,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
I now desire to follow back the secretary of the Army and his esteem,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
and say, you know, I have no further questions.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Hey, how are you?

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
Mr. Chairman, I find on the table what I take to be the film,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
that the last witness has arrived.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
All right, Mr. Watt, I'm going to make up the answer.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
So, for the seventh consecutive day,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Secretary of the Army Stevens is back on the witness's hand.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Let's go to the chairman's center in March.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Where's the patient, Mr. Stevens, at this time, will pass.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Send over now.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Mr. Chairman, I do not want to ask any questions of the secretary.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
What are those then to inquire?

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
If he has had time yet to compile a data that I requested regarding the number of man hours

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
that have been involved in this controversy, not yet the following.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
No further questions.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Thank you, there are no questions, Mr. Chairman.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Senator Chatton?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
No questions.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And the problem, I have no questions.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
And the time, no questions.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
And the question, hopefully, is still up, no questions.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Senator Chatton, you have Mr. Colony, Mr. Carthon.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
Yes, ma'am, the number of persons is the chairman.

16:29.000 --> 16:36.000
Mr. Chairman, you may recall you and I had one step late,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
the Pentagon some time ago.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
That's right.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I was there during the rotation, right?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
That's right.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
And I've moved here to cover this before, but see if I'm frightened of this.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
The group persons increased after the luncheon, that's right.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
That's right.

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
Who will have luncheon number one with you?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Yes, sir.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
I far, far, far, I've found John Adams and I.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
So, after lunch, we've overweir joined by three other people that drink that type in who are living.

17:24.000 --> 17:36.000
General Rich Wai, Chief of Staff, General Trudeau, Chief of Intelligence, the Army, Chief of Staff, and General Muget, Chief of Information.

17:36.000 --> 17:45.000
And the brought home did we draw before the Riverland, the other two men, do you mean?

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Well, I think we probably got lunch about 12, 30.

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
I had to get a visit, a visit to a club to a club and nothing to say, General Trudeau came in about there.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
We've been meeting there at all, and basically finally meeting.

18:01.000 --> 18:14.000
And we spent practically all the time and then we went on to start bringing the investigation of coming into a situation in the North-Hare East to Washington.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't know if those working military officers have become twice that's correct.

18:18.000 --> 18:27.000
All for the rest of the final, not only of working military, instructions for all 40 times plans, that's right.

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
And that's where you will allow a happy, well you've all got the right stuff.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
These investigations were being conducted and you said it is all for you.

18:37.000 --> 18:45.000
We should go to the first company investigation, you're suspending little work for you, and let you pay for it.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
Also, that's not correct. I was disturbed by the type of work that was being held, not by the investigation.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Did you object to the type of hearing that's right?

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
And from the, from those that hearing did you not write?

18:59.000 --> 19:07.000
I didn't like the type of publicity that was emanating from the executive hearing that you were holding with regard to Courtman.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Did I explain to you about trying to match?

19:10.000 --> 19:24.000
Through the wounds we have to do, or to open the door, or any when the new care returns to the gang, and you are the story of the away from the meetings that you've been using at work to put.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
You run by certain majorities in regard to what occurred at various meetings.

19:30.000 --> 19:42.000
That felt that I had no choice but to talk to the press after each meeting, which was a kind of any of your personnel.

19:43.000 --> 20:05.000
Do those in the presence of Mr. Adams, give them a resume and plot a period without giving them the names of three witnesses, and that, yes, I did not accurately state the fact that Mr. Adams was the right to correct me, but the reason for this was to try to keep the records straight otherwise.

20:05.000 --> 20:20.000
We have a few favorite individuals. I think I mentioned the name to the outfraughts and the persons at all who had yet to story from Pentagon and Leak, but I'll explain to you what the matter is.

20:20.000 --> 20:32.000
I'd like to call all of that, or did you object at that time to the, to my briefing, the press after the executive session?

20:33.000 --> 20:47.000
No, I didn't object to your briefing, the press, and it is, but the thing that I did object to was the first office, the way you placed them, through the way you placed them, and there was always your judgment.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Yes, sir.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
This was after coming in a meeting.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
I will see that for many times, but I will not have any time and I'll go without any time.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I will give you the whole of that number.

20:59.000 --> 21:06.000
But right now, if I can go up to the time you're there, I'll just meet again, and again, I'll be working with one I think.

21:07.000 --> 21:27.000
I'm going to move now, but at that time, you object would do this, and I agree, the press, for you to tell me that I didn't give the press the accurate story, the gentleman in the room, true story, to try and tell them what you objected to.

21:27.000 --> 21:35.000
I was directed to the family over the head of the army and the unfair publicity that was going out in regards to these areas.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
You've no heard of a family move with net, it's going to go rather rough.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
For I think that the net, who will be the next morning at the family move with net?

21:45.000 --> 21:51.000
For I think the, the one time the total is morning is a pretty good, a picture of a lot of talks about here.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
It's been a few years since I've been up to your time.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
All right, we're just going to move on and then we're going to get up until the race and we're going to meet up with the Pentagon.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
The Army, you and the people coming into the Army don't you well?

22:07.000 --> 22:21.000
Now I mean the security that the nut impact that life evaluated, it's almost public, an army army, well, there was time that's been ours in a substantial way,

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
that's both my luck and that was not an important for the fact that it's far as I was in the new.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
The military is responsible for the weapons, the weapons, the weapons, the strength of that.

22:31.000 --> 22:43.000
You know what, the suspension from 33 minutes was all because later either it's back down the truck moves and we're across the social issue of China.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
That's not in Europe, isn't it? That's the stage for possible espionage.

22:50.000 --> 22:59.000
I don't have the detail of the charges that the four-man McCarthy will predict that, as the rest of the rescue will produce the tail information.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
You say there was no healthy energy for one.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
Now we need to spend on 43 people because of their conscious background for conscious dimensions.

23:14.000 --> 23:21.000
You were suspecting them, prefer the frame ray, give away the secret into which.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
If you tell me we would not do that, there'd be no reason to suspect.

23:25.000 --> 23:33.000
I don't believe that they were from the communist or communist background. That's in check each one of these cases before I was possibly described for that statement.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
So you know the news point, you're in a much different location.

23:37.000 --> 23:47.000
I know in general, but I don't know in detail. And we were looking for security risks. Now there are a lot of things besides the things you're talking about and can constitute a security risk.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
Right now, in front of a security risk, you're talking about a man who may get away to nation's safety.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
Possibly only at one intention, five days to talk ever, something at that moment on.

23:57.000 --> 24:10.000
But many men who just talk about a security risk or a one of their risks, you're talking about a man who may either, prefer the great one or the one in purposefully, give away the nation's safety.

24:10.000 --> 24:17.000
To talk about somebody that just wants to be darn sure that it's safe to have on-time to work.

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
Before this one is at the end of the year, together, fine.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Well, now, the American will do away a station.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
I'm your wireless, and you have to know that, because now you thought about that, I said nothing correct.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Well, I'm a journalist, I can't get enough. That's right.

24:38.000 --> 24:45.000
Now, just give a man, give some of your from this room for a year of the Army.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Give me some number, I'll tell you first.

24:49.000 --> 24:56.000
St. Louis, please come back from the field. That's what you're going to do with my wife, from the young Vinodian.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Give me a word from the young, I'll tell you my word, they are fine.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
So, they can't stop. Don't you know?

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
I like that, the people are asking, counsel about that, you knew.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
I'd rather ask this today, because I, uh, I didn't tell them.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
The suggestion just been unspoiled, he can't just, you may have died, you wouldn't have taken it.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I recall this thing we have in here.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
The secretary of the very same question as to what has been our deal.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
The senator has a right to pursue its mother at the so desire.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Don't know, you don't know who to deal with.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
And I got involved with a few, just to be safe from several times this year, there was no FB not just for one.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
And for all I had to know, I didn't know what FB not did.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
I'm not dispeakable, there was no, uh, S.D. Amarja, at the time of that function that I knew about.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
But something that's not, there hasn't been some spread.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
You know, we're going to go with it.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Because of the problems with backgrounds or connections, that's not right.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
Uh, I wouldn't say I can't agree on the wife, but I'm looking them up, senator, there were suspension,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
both of which as you know, it took place in the month of our color time, some in November.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
But one of the data for you, you remember?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Yes, November 6th.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
Here's your call, about the name of the secretary.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
But that's where it is, just in my eyes.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
That I told you to this.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Uh, even though I personally like you.

26:23.000 --> 26:29.000
So I couldn't possibly go off a hearing to this, I didn't have to go to the same time for activity.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
Which I couldn't then, can hand again.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm a part of some of the members of the Office of Political Practice.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
You remember that?

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
I don't remember that exact language, but I remember some general follow-up on that line, I think, senator.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
One of those rough, rough way I told you this is what I, which is like a great.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And I'm still ready.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
I could wouldn't go off the investigation because I thought it was a big, small friend of mine, for her to do it.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
I remember some general talk along that line, senator.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Senator, Senator, Senator, time to expire.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Now, let's come.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
No further questions, Mr. Chairman.

27:12.000 --> 27:26.000
Now, if you set the chair, I'd like to ask you, uh, two questions about an event.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
The relationship, not much of this channel area, the journalist is one particularly important.

27:31.000 --> 27:38.000
That has come to the attention of the chairman over the questions that passed 48 hours.

27:38.000 --> 27:50.000
It deals with, uh, the unique conversation and publication of what I think now may have been called two unsomistically,

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
as a memorable understanding to recall, I'm sure, that event.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
That's it.

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
Uh, the report has come to me that it has been stated, and I'm sure not for you that I want you to be clear.

28:04.000 --> 28:12.000
It has been stated that, uh, senator's father, senator's daughter, and son of his mom,

28:12.000 --> 28:23.000
will deal with some times in practice in inviting you to the senate protest and come now by using the language to be called a chicken woman,

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
and send a dirty result that I'd like to ask you if you'd like to talk to your mother.

28:28.000 --> 28:37.000
And if you recall, when I tell her to meet you one day from my office, about the possibility of having that woman,

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
yes, I don't worry about her, I know you're calling.

28:40.000 --> 28:48.000
If you recall, as in general, the general of my conversation with you over the telephone was to be a bet,

28:48.000 --> 28:59.000
that since a public hearing had gone astable, since the government, he came into us to argue or do it as a public hearing,

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
since you can speak in some relations with your father, how to make you like those,

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
follow the purposes for the public hearing, at the will that is in my life,

29:10.000 --> 29:22.000
now that I'm not scared of the public opinion, your skewed, but a public senator's daughter, and I, together with none of my clients,

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
might be for once to see how well the hearing was just a human, and what would it be done?

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
Yes, I know, I don't remember all about you just said, Mr. Chairman, but substantially, that was the idea.

29:34.000 --> 29:42.000
I think you're welcome, Paul, I think you should be specific, that we will have Dr. MacArthur, that's at once,

29:42.000 --> 29:50.000
please, just sir, I'd like to thank you very much for your support for me, that somebody that's finished up the act,

29:50.000 --> 29:56.000
and that's time to do the discussion, that you do not know that Dr. MacArthur doesn't do it that much,

29:56.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm sure that I do that a little bit more, and I'm sure that I've signed the other facts that you get to my office,

30:04.000 --> 30:10.000
throughout the work of the President, and I forget that to it, that is correct, thank you, Mr. Donald.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
What was the date of that lunch and the last second thing, the 24th of February,

30:16.000 --> 30:24.000
that was the part of the lunch and was the Donald Grats were not invited,

30:24.000 --> 30:34.000
that were not present, you don't blame him for what occurred, no sir, thank you,

30:34.000 --> 30:46.000
Senator, Senator Jack, no questions, Senator Scott, no questions, Senator Ben, no questions,

30:46.000 --> 30:54.000
Senator Whitwick, no questions, Senator McArthur, no questions, Mr. Coleman,

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
Mr. Coleman, thank you, Mr. Coleman, to get to act as something we were talking about yesterday,

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
did you on November 24th, then John Adams in New York, spoke to me and sent him a coffee,

31:06.000 --> 31:14.000
and Ed, whether or not, Senator McArthur would agree not to make a public issue,

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
and that's a general law of this command at 4th one.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
November 24th, wasn't that the date that your public hearing started on 4th moment, that's the exact date?

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
I know, I think I know, John Adams testified to us, but I think he went up there for that hearing, that's my record.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Mr. Sir, maybe to understand my question to you was, I made,

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
did Mr. Adams continue your carrying a message from you, to Senator McArthur,

31:44.000 --> 31:50.000
asking an assurance from Senator McArthur, that he would not make a public issue,

31:50.000 --> 31:58.000
and charge reprise for cooperation, if you were to repeat general law of this command,

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
and you don't want it on that date for the next day.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
As I have talked about, frankly, on what the chair says you call,

32:08.000 --> 32:16.000
I had under consideration the question of the Manning General at 4th one.

32:16.000 --> 32:26.000
I, again, say I dislike very much to go into the personal situation of a final professional soldier.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
I have a question about some statements that were reported to me,

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
and I also as I testified yesterday morning,

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
I wanted to be sure that all of our commanding officers, including General Lawton,

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
use the maximum possible judgment with respect to any suspension that may,

32:48.000 --> 32:56.000
for the end of the rule of work on justice and injustice on an innocent person.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Jakes, may I say you, please,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
please, be aware of my act?
