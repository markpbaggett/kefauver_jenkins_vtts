00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
Do you believe what might as a secretary select the board?

00:03.500 --> 00:06.500
Do you have an idea for the trustee?

00:06.500 --> 00:07.500
No, you're not.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.000
And if we consider him unqualified or unqualified,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
so soon he'll be the one who's right to be sure.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.500
The sooning the facts to be true, exactly as he was saying that

00:14.500 --> 00:16.500
I, personally, would not trust the individual,

00:16.500 --> 00:19.000
the unborn, for what you can put him unqualified.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
I would consider that I wouldn't select him,

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
and I wouldn't qualify him.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
I would think there was enough of a confirmation of his case.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.500
And if you had a true act,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
then you know what I would say about the trustee.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
The facts are he allowed his home to be used for fundraising.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
To go out and use for a technical service.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
It's certainly funny for my trustee.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It doesn't work for the trustee.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I can buy books to be raising money for a fund.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
I will trust him.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
He has to pay the fee.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
The idea is using the technical service.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.500
I only have to use the question Mr. Adams.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.500
If you'll be quiet, my trustee,

00:52.500 --> 00:55.000
then it's been used for ever anyone.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.000
Okay, Mr. Adams,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
the sitting with the hypothetical question is assuming

01:00.000 --> 01:03.500
that this man allowed his home to be used

01:03.500 --> 01:07.500
for a long party sporting the testimony

01:07.500 --> 01:10.000
for the purpose of raising funds for an organization

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
which had been previously listed

01:13.000 --> 01:15.500
as a front floor and doing the work of the Communist Party

01:15.500 --> 01:20.500
at the assume that the person who to the party

01:20.500 --> 01:22.500
was known to him

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
was the only company to simplify it.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.500
Would you say about additional funds?

01:27.500 --> 01:31.000
Good, particularly this qualifying set on the board.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I'd say it would be serious

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
and would be another fact that he would be considered.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Well, you think of a disqualifying.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.500
The William K. would disqualify him with he

01:37.500 --> 01:38.500
in the fact that he was a fact-worthy.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.500
And if the chairman of the right-hand commission

01:40.500 --> 01:42.000
was not a short and a little thing,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
you are not meant to ask the commission.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I have no further questions.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Mr. Chair, amen.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Mr. McAllen, that's one question.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.500
I understand you would say that this Mr. X

01:53.500 --> 01:57.000
sometimes last October or November

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
had his security clearance removed

02:00.000 --> 02:02.500
the security clearance was listed in a file

02:02.500 --> 02:04.500
or the first week of November.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.500
You call it listed.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.500
Well, I say listed.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.500
It was remodeled.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.500
It's one of the standards.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.500
And then when was it restored or left back down?

02:11.500 --> 02:12.500
In about a month.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.500
After the examination of the individual's background.

02:15.500 --> 02:19.000
After the proper authorities.

02:19.500 --> 02:23.500
Considered the evidence against it.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.000
He was restored to security clearance.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.500
That's my understanding.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.000
Well, you say you're unfairly.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.500
Now, you test find some knowledge.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.500
Yes, I have.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.000
How if I don't give you an answer to this question?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I don't want it.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.500
I don't want you to.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.000
But I don't want that record left.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Well, I'll just give you the same.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.500
Well, I go, you was restored.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.000
You don't know.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.500
I don't want that test removed.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.500
I don't want to define that.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.500
You want restored.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.500
All right, you want restored.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.500
Whim.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.500
About a month after a security clearance was suspended.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.000
He was suspended for about a month.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
From about the first of November to April about the first of December, 1953.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Thank you.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
That's all I want.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
One question is shared.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
It's rather than what does the full security clearance entitled him to see?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
By way of documents.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.500
Well, full security clearance here day rather inaccurate.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.000
The sketch of the term is Mr. Cohn.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
That's right.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.700
And that is determined to be used in the transcript.

03:19.700 --> 03:26.000
Any individual who has a security clearance is entitled to see documents of that classification.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.300
If he has a top secret clearance or a secret clearance, he can see about a document of that

03:31.300 --> 03:37.500
classification provided he has a need to see them to do his work.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.000
And if he doesn't have a need to see them to do his work, the fact that he has a clearance

03:41.000 --> 03:42.500
that's not entitled to.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.500
So listen to the duel with whatever his claim was entitled within the scope of his work to see documents of that classification.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
If he has no clearance, he could see.

03:51.500 --> 04:00.500
If he has a top financial and top secret clearance, he could see restricted confidential secret or top secret when it was necessary in the picture of this work.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.500
Do you know as a matter of knowledge whether he has top secret clearance?

04:03.500 --> 04:05.500
But my recollection that he has top secret clearance.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.500
That's all.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.500
Is that all part of that?

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500
I have done it to my right.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.500
Any time again.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.500
It's about all part of that.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.500
It's about all part of that.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.500
Can I look at it and see if you can?

04:18.500 --> 04:22.500
Just one request of the chair, I think you can go on with one or two questions.

04:22.500 --> 04:27.500
Mr. Chairman, do the question when you're taking this before this committee.

04:27.500 --> 04:35.500
I wonder if it will be not a good idea that we would either have someone in my staff or someone in the committee staff.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.500
Take out the parts that are pertinent to Mr. Exxoncase.

04:40.500 --> 04:45.500
So then that's Mr. Welch, Mr. Adam.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.500
We can be sure that we have the impact pictured.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.500
And I don't know how that made a part of the record deleting the names.

04:52.500 --> 04:57.500
I think it's rather important to make one typical case to show the types of individuals who were...

04:58.500 --> 05:01.500
The Army had been supplied with a transcript of the entire...

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
I haven't asked a bottle of transcript for my father's transcript.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.500
It's not in material...

05:07.500 --> 05:09.500
I think I was here.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
I think there's a function in the church that night.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.500
Well, who's in the...

05:13.500 --> 05:16.500
Well, whatever documentation you want to inspire about, I'll let you say it.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.500
Then we'll offer that for both of records.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.500
Remain.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.500
For the public name, it's a list.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
For the name of the priest.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.500
For the name of the priest.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.500
We've had a available public record of Adam and Day or something.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.500
And because of the code...

05:26.500 --> 05:30.500
I have a picture of the posters that made a collection.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.500
And people on my side thought that I'd be out there.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.500
That it would be available to us.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
Internationally, if you could just...

05:38.500 --> 05:40.500
...it would be a certain age or two.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
So you hear it as well as the collection.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.500
If you're calling to anybody for the print of the stamp, I'd point it over to you.

05:45.500 --> 05:52.500
I'm sure the committee reserves the right to check all the liations and compare the full records.

05:52.500 --> 05:56.500
This is a document of the committees I understand.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
It is.

05:57.500 --> 06:01.500
So we would have access to it if you're teaching the rules.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.500
No question about that, sir.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.500
We can't know what an understanding is.

06:04.500 --> 06:16.500
I'm sure the chair agrees that any things that'll be deleted from the monitor's conversation by the individual unilateral cooperative attitudes of the various councils will be submitted to the committee by our two of the liations.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.500
Unless they involve security matters, I might say.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.500
I think that's the way they are.

06:23.500 --> 06:27.500
So high in security that they cannot be shown to the committee.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.500
I do not see how they can be shown to the committee council or to other council.

06:31.500 --> 06:45.500
I think anything that is deleted by the agreement of council between the Army and this committee and Senator McCarthy and his staff should be deleted only with the approval of this committee.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.500
Mr. Moore, may I ask?

06:48.500 --> 06:56.500
Mr. Moore, the son of Simon, he raises a very pertinent point, but the chair must confess he doesn't know how to solve this and give solve puzzle.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.500
Exactly.

06:57.500 --> 07:03.500
Unless we give to the Attorney General or somebody's the right to determine if I'm a security clerk.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.500
I'm not sure that's the way I am.

07:04.500 --> 07:10.500
You might not be able to be better in the Secretary's office, but I don't know what I can determine security enough.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.500
I'm going to raise another point of order at the end of the day with Chairman.

07:13.500 --> 07:25.500
In my opinion, if the Attorney General of the United States is interrogated with respect to the matters brought up this afternoon, we should be interrogated in an open hearing and not in an executive hearing.

07:25.500 --> 07:32.500
Well, the chair does not understand the senator from his jury to suggest that on these monitors he's from call.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
So we can tell we get to the Attorney General, I was curious.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.500
I said I would like to make another point of order for the end of the day, Mr. Chairman.

07:38.500 --> 07:43.500
One I'll do with the monitoring comment that you've just had to do with the discussion with respect to Mr. Brownhill.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.500
Mr. Kohn has given the chair some happy information.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.500
I think he said he had just one or two more questions from Mr. Adams and that's correct.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
I'd like to get him started so we can hold him to that.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
Very good.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
I'll let Mr. Kohn.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
I'll never follow the panel.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.500
You have a point of order before you are.

08:00.500 --> 08:08.500
Mr. Jackson was referenced to let the Brownhill's testimony, my understanding of the executive meeting was not that they'd testimony.

08:08.500 --> 08:19.500
But that led to order and a nature and a nature of a conference to ascertain how to proceed with respect to the senator's request from the conference.

08:19.500 --> 08:27.500
I have never considered to take him what I regard as important testimony in exactly hearing.

08:27.500 --> 08:37.500
I said the senator is correct, but yes, we do decide exactly to hear to talk to Mr. Brownhill.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.500
It was brought up this afternoon that that talking would be done in executive hearing.

08:41.500 --> 08:52.500
The help that I thank my colleague from Arkansas, the point I want to make is that if the decision is to bring up these matters with the Attorney General,

08:52.500 --> 08:56.500
that it'd be done in open hearing, after the decision is made and not in executive hearing.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.500
I'm sure all those things can be worked out from the hearing.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.500
Our executive statement will determine whether to ask the Attorney General to come and trust us.

09:04.500 --> 09:12.500
I'll make your phone, I do hope that these other efforts have not changed your plan to be able to include a picture of it and see more questions.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
One more in the comments.

09:14.500 --> 09:21.500
Mr. Brownhill, right at the very end of the point I think we're talking about the relations in regard to Mr. Eck.

09:21.500 --> 09:25.500
I want to make it fair that as far as I know there's no security information of any kind of nature.

09:25.500 --> 09:32.500
I'm merely referring to the relation of names which follows the committee procedure not making public names to just an executive sign.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.500
Mr. Eck, I've understood Mr. Cohen.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.500
Yes.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
Mr. Adams.

09:36.500 --> 09:43.500
As Mr. Eck's been re-stought to the loyalty security screening board, no.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
He is not no longer on that board.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
He is not.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.500
Is that right, sir?

09:47.500 --> 09:48.500
That's right.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.500
Now, I have no further questions from Mr. Adams.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
Then everybody else, have any questions from Mr. Adams?

09:53.500 --> 09:56.500
It's not the chairs about the dismissing and unsliding once again.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.500
You are getting dismissed and unflung, Mr. Adams.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
Thank you, sir.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
Oh, I'm in 435.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.500
425, almost 435. What's the pleasure of the committee?

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
I'll leave.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
I'm going to reach out to the one-running attendee.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.500
All right.

10:18.500 --> 10:25.500
42 sessions and 11 days of testimony have been concluded to this time and the hearing of adjourned until tomorrow.

10:25.500 --> 10:31.500
The Senate's subcommittee on Permanent Investigations meeting in the Senate's caucus room on Capitol Hill,

10:31.500 --> 10:37.500
under dispute between Senator Joseph Scottie and the High Officials of the Army and the Femme Department.

10:37.500 --> 10:42.500
The committee has voted to hold the one session tomorrow by the, and that in the morning.

10:42.500 --> 10:48.500
There has to be no afternoon session tomorrow, according to a decision by the committee with afternoon.
