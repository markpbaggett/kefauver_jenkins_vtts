WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.660
Unless we can show that men, who themselves, had long-term misrequited, were passing upon

00:08.660 --> 00:13.200
the loyalty of other individuals with terminus records.

00:13.200 --> 00:18.640
Unless we can show who were responsible for this, a pop position they hold now, we are

00:18.640 --> 00:21.400
losing a great opportunity, to you, this chairman.

00:21.400 --> 00:28.280
The point is that I am now called upon to make a ruling upon, perhaps in my mind, the

00:28.280 --> 00:31.000
reason it's when it's been presented so far.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.320
I think it's fair to ever remember the committee that Senator McCruth's question is,

00:35.320 --> 00:40.520
and Sally and Papa, that Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adam are the only parties in the Pentagon.

00:40.520 --> 00:46.040
I guess, two judges have been made on this committee, surely will not now, embrace all

00:46.040 --> 00:51.480
of the parties in the Pentagon, which he will be here to live with, and let me admit,

00:51.480 --> 00:57.880
that the proof now shows, I think, unequivocates.

00:57.880 --> 01:06.400
That Mr. X sat on a panel for the last time in February 1953, 15 days after the Secretary

01:06.400 --> 01:13.800
came into office, that the proof is indecutable that he was technically there, I certainly

01:13.800 --> 01:19.520
remember the board, in that he had not been formally notified of his dismissals, and that

01:19.520 --> 01:25.440
he was never reelected to the panel, the experts, and never sat on any keys.

01:25.440 --> 01:34.720
I, February 1953, and did not sit on a keys, had not sit on a keys between that time and

01:34.720 --> 01:36.760
the October 30th period.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.920
I think Mr. Adam's knowledge of that matter has been fully exploited, and as we should now

01:41.920 --> 01:43.920
resume, questioning on some of the matters.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.920
Mr. Jenkins, share your hands.

01:44.920 --> 01:49.060
The day is the first point of my life, I'm responsible, but he cannot sit in the

01:49.060 --> 01:50.060
front.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.060
I'm both front of him.

01:51.060 --> 01:54.280
McCarthy and Mr. Cohn are entitled to ten minutes to interrogate the witness.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.280
They have that right.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.760
Along the day interrogating the notice, they cannot be denied the man who rules the

01:58.760 --> 01:59.760
procedure.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.280
I might say, we don't greatly expect Mr. Jenkins that he would give me the opportunity to

02:03.280 --> 02:04.280
devolve the facts.

02:04.280 --> 02:09.400
I think I can show that his satisfaction, that Mr. X, the past general, free of all the

02:09.400 --> 02:15.180
men, loved men, I think I can show to Mr. Jenkins that Mr. X on the day he was called

02:15.180 --> 02:20.960
on eight or ten months after Mr. Stevens became secretary, still had those security

02:20.960 --> 02:23.160
queerness, still was handling.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.240
That information, very first question, Mr. Cohn, and I think that he was removed.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.760
I think that he rules you have ten minutes, I wish I used him, interrogating the witness,

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
and not the chair.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.760
I, sir.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.760
You interrogate the witness.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.760
I hope you don't feel what I, no.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.840
We're just, we're just, we're just, we're just, you're not the right to have ten minutes

02:39.840 --> 02:40.840
andoti.

02:40.840 --> 02:49.140
Mr. Adam, I now direct your attention to page 1443 and ask you whether or not Mr. X,

02:49.140 --> 02:54.600
at the very time, he appeared before our committee.

02:54.600 --> 03:00.120
And after Mr. Stevens, it's in secretary of the Army for some ten months, still had full

03:00.120 --> 03:03.040
clearance and was working on classified material.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.880
He answered a both questions yet.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.280
He had full clearance at that time.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.800
He was working on classified material.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.800
Yes, Mr. Adam.

03:09.800 --> 03:16.200
And, and you thought about a mine, a doctor, minor information or minor garagatory information.

03:16.200 --> 03:22.120
I will ask you, sir, if you feel that engaging and fundraising activities for organizations

03:22.120 --> 03:27.320
listed by the Attorney General as a versus to the United States, I will ask you, sir,

03:27.320 --> 03:32.720
if you feel that up and knowingly and wrongful, appointing a man, you believe to be a

03:32.720 --> 03:38.160
communist, to a post with a place in prison and close association with government employees,

03:38.160 --> 03:42.760
our minor teachers of the regulatory information.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
Your question is very long.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.880
It's very difficult to answer.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.400
I do not remember that those allegations were made against the individual they may very

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
well have been.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.760
I point out to you, sir, however, that allegations of any sort against an individual may not

03:54.760 --> 03:59.040
be discussed by employees of the executive branch, no step of any participation or any

03:59.040 --> 04:02.720
fact, was reference to an individual having the bill as a lawyer, security may be discussed.

04:02.720 --> 04:07.160
I point out to you further, sir, that the individual security clearance was taken away

04:07.160 --> 04:12.560
from him in November for a re-examination and it was reinstated about one December.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.160
In profile, I know the individual still has clearance.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.160
Yes, sir.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.160
It was taken away after he had been pulled before our committee.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.160
Well, they're not.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.160
That is correct.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.360
And, Mr. Adam, I might say, you use the words minor allegation.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.560
I am not talking about allegation, sir.

04:25.560 --> 04:30.640
I'm talking about admission and that is why we furnish you this testimony some days ago,

04:30.640 --> 04:32.320
so you can look at it.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.640
Because this is a matter you and I just judge frequently.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.640
But I just judge personally with Mr. Steven on a week three occasions.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.640
This is a matter which goes to the heart of his case, sir.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.840
And we think it's one of the most important matters in this procedure.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.840
I want to get questions.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.840
My question to you, sir, was this.

04:48.840 --> 04:49.840
The you consider.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.840
The you consider the fact that a man, for what he's doing, he's not going to be a man.

04:53.840 --> 04:59.840
But a man, for what a member of technical role of a wife, of the loyalty security queen,

04:59.840 --> 05:06.160
or the top court of that crime in the Pentagon, Secretary Scott, and a man who had full security

05:06.160 --> 05:08.360
clearance and was working on secret materials.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.360
You consider.

05:09.360 --> 05:16.680
The fact that that man had engaged in fundraising activities for organizations listed by the

05:16.680 --> 05:20.240
Attorney General as the worker to this country.

05:20.240 --> 05:27.240
And that that man had annoying, employed a son and put him in both property for government

05:27.240 --> 05:28.240
employees.

05:28.240 --> 05:35.240
You consider all two pieces of information minor derogatory information.

05:35.240 --> 05:40.640
Those who keep it in from the other information are not described by you in the way that they

05:40.640 --> 05:41.640
were described as true.

05:41.640 --> 05:47.120
My question to you, sir, is the you consider all two pieces of information minor derogatory

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
information.

05:48.120 --> 05:52.760
Because maybe we have a different definition of what minor derogatory information about

05:52.760 --> 05:55.120
a man's head on the loyalty of government employees.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.120
There is a question, sir.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.120
I know you prefer a yes or a no answer.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.120
I don't believe this question is questionable.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.120
Are you, are there yes or a no answer?

06:03.120 --> 06:06.120
May I make a little more full in explanation?

06:06.120 --> 06:08.120
You may, if you enable the answer, yes or no.

06:08.120 --> 06:15.120
The loyalty information and security information on individuals is collected and presented to

06:15.120 --> 06:18.120
the board which considers the individual.

06:18.120 --> 06:25.040
They make their evaluation and after they make their evaluation, there are proper review

06:25.040 --> 06:27.560
authority which makes the ultimate situation.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.320
I did not make the evaluation on the individual.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.320
I did not make the review of the individual.

06:32.320 --> 06:37.560
Those officials who did have determined that the individual is competent to continue in

06:37.560 --> 06:41.120
human employment and with the classifications, the clearance that he had, that's the only

06:41.120 --> 06:43.120
answer I need you sir.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.120
But, did you promise the right answer?

06:45.120 --> 06:47.120
May I have an answer to my question, sir?

06:47.120 --> 06:53.120
I asked you whether or not you regard those two pieces of concrete information which I

06:53.120 --> 06:55.120
put to you as minor derogatory information.

06:55.120 --> 07:01.120
Mr. Chairman, I point out to the chair again that specific information was referenced to

07:01.120 --> 07:06.120
the loyalty of any individual is not within my preview to discuss under the biggest order.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.120
Mr. Secretary.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.120
Mr. Chairman, may I get an answer to the next one?

07:12.120 --> 07:17.120
Madam Chair and Fire, whether you are quoting from the drawing testimony and admissions by Mr.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
X.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.120
I have a hypothetical question.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.120
Yes sir, Mike.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.120
I have to admit that I am a little more than hypothetical.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.120
And I would say the transcript has been furnished to Mr. Adam so he may refer to it as

07:26.120 --> 07:27.120
I can.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.120
But Mr. Adam is a refer to minor derogatory information.

07:29.120 --> 07:35.120
I am now asking Mr. Adam whether he regard those two facts which I have named as instances

07:35.120 --> 07:37.120
of minor derogatory information.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.120
What way are those facts connected with Mr. Ed?

07:40.120 --> 07:43.120
They are connected with Mr. X because they are not correct.

07:43.120 --> 07:48.120
We have sworn that the mother of Mr. X was involved in those two practice derogatory testimony

07:48.120 --> 07:49.120
sir.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.120
It was a theft interrogatory.

07:50.120 --> 07:54.120
It would be a pertinent question then and suggest that the mother of Mr. Adam and Mr.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.120
Smith.

07:55.120 --> 08:01.120
We fact that somebody may swear something against someone else but not necessarily establish

08:01.120 --> 08:02.120
it as a fact.

08:02.120 --> 08:06.120
Yes sir, he has given the case.

08:06.120 --> 08:15.120
Oh, a fact that this man has here Mr. Ed who has described in the question that it will

08:15.120 --> 08:17.120
be part of us to it.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.120
But just charge it.

08:18.120 --> 08:25.120
So he is on a sworn statement by someone else that might be denied by the party of change.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.120
There is none of itself establish it as a fact.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.120
Now this may be that this man has admitted that.

08:31.120 --> 08:37.120
If this warrant has to only show he has admitted it or any property of you has made a

08:37.120 --> 08:40.120
fine thing, those are the facts, then it is a big problem.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.120
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ed has admitted those things.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.120
Mr. Chair, don't wear it up before I want to ask the same.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.120
Let's find out for sure that Mr. Chair.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.120
Mr. Ed has admitted those things.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.120
Sir, I would not like to characterize the right.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.120
I think his testimony speaks for itself and we will be glad to find Mr. Chair with the

08:55.120 --> 08:59.120
fence, but as we did finish Mr. Adam with the fence, may I have a point out Mr. Chair?

08:59.120 --> 09:02.120
Mr. Chair, I would like to ask Mr. Adam for the fence, no transgressions.

09:02.120 --> 09:06.120
For the president of the clarification, try to get the issue involved in this question

09:06.120 --> 09:09.120
and I'm sure in its proper perspective before the committee may have that.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.120
Mr. Chair, and my good luck goes with it.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
Thank you very much.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.120
I've got a leave.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.120
Thank you.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.120
Mr. Chair, how many of these things are we going into?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.120
Just Mr. Excellency.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.120
I think this is a perfectly pertinent question.

09:20.120 --> 09:28.120
Mr. Adam, did or not Mr. Cohn refer to you our front issue a few days ago reported

09:29.120 --> 09:32.120
that the testimony is only concerning Mr. Ex.

09:32.120 --> 09:36.120
The transcript was furnished to the council, to the Secretary of State.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.120
I did not read it.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.120
I did not read it.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.120
If I am jailed, I cannot expect that I apologize to the committee.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.120
I will ask you this.

09:42.120 --> 09:48.120
State, whether or not you know of any evidence that was introduced against Mr. Ex to the

09:48.120 --> 09:55.120
effect that these solicited funds for an organization can then, by the Justice Department.

09:56.120 --> 10:00.120
I remember Mr. Ex, testimony in New York.

10:00.120 --> 10:05.120
I think the thing that Mr. Cohn is the fact that I said minor, the regulatory, but I think

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
that needs insurance, I think.

10:06.120 --> 10:12.120
So I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to, I'm trying to, Mr. Cohn is that I said minor, the regulatory information.

10:12.120 --> 10:20.120
Perhaps I should have said, the regulatory information which in the final analysis was not sufficient in the opinion of the responsible officials to call the individual's removal.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.120
Yes, the word minor is there, but I'm hopeful of the sentiment that I would draw it.

10:24.120 --> 10:37.120
Yes, Mr. Adams, was there testimony to the effect that Mr. Ex solicited funds for an organization, listed by the Attorney General's Office as being a subversive organization?

10:37.120 --> 10:39.120
Was there such testimony?

10:39.120 --> 10:43.120
Either by Mr. Ex or any other person against him?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.120
Mr. Ex and self was interrogated.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.120
The date was October 30th.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.120
I was present.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.120
The transcript was supplied to the Pentagon shortly thereafter.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.120
Insofar as I can recall, I have never since read it.

10:53.120 --> 10:59.120
I am not competent to answer your question without reading the transcript and for that I have already apologized because I did not read it in the last two days.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.120
I do not remember that testimony.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.120
You did not remember that testimony?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.120
I do not.

11:02.120 --> 11:09.120
Do you remember any testimony that Mr. Ex implored a commonly sorry subversive?

11:09.120 --> 11:16.120
I remember testimony to the effect that Mr. Ex was one of the officials of the Green Belt Cooperative Housing Organization out in Northeast America.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.120
The organization out in Northeast Washington about 10 years ago.

11:19.120 --> 11:26.120
And that while he was an official in the Execitio Mayor or something of that sort, they employed a position to work for him.

11:26.120 --> 11:31.120
And to be efficient with the position was brought in to be the doctor for the community.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.120
And it developed that the position had a subversive background.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.120
That is my recollection of the transcript.

11:36.120 --> 11:41.120
I have an recollection about Mr. Ex solicited funds for such an organization or not.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.120
I do not think he didn't I state to you so that happened last October.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.120
That is a transcript.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.120
But I have a recollection of that.

11:46.120 --> 11:54.120
Now Mr. Adams, the question is this, not what whether Mr. Ex is guilty or not.

11:54.120 --> 12:06.120
But the question as I can see that is this, you stated that there was information concerning Mr. Ex information.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.120
And that embraces what I have asked you.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.120
It does not imply that he is guilty or innocent.

12:12.120 --> 12:16.120
But you stated there was information concerning Mr. Ex.

12:16.120 --> 12:20.120
That there is a testimony or direct testimony or circumstances testimony.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.120
That was of a minor derogatory nature.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.120
I have qualified the words minor.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.120
I have disturbed Mr. Cohn.

12:28.120 --> 12:37.120
I now say not of the position I have qualified to say information which the responsible officials have decided was not of sufficient consequence to call it as removal.

12:38.120 --> 12:51.120
Yes, the information was that he had solicited funds for an organization whose aims were inimical to the good of this government and that he had the broader communist at one time.

12:51.120 --> 12:57.120
Then you now say that the information concerning him, not really guilty or innocent or not.

12:57.120 --> 13:03.120
But the information concerning him was of a derogatory nature leaving out the word minor.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.120
That's correct. The information was of a derogatory nature.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.120
What is a derogatory nature?

13:08.120 --> 13:09.120
That's correct.

13:09.120 --> 13:13.120
That's all that is leaving us certainly on that one point.

13:13.120 --> 13:28.120
Now sir, having agreed that there was information of a derogatory nature, I will ask you, Mr. Adams, I believe you told us that when this man was called before on the third, he had a full security clearance.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
That is correct.

13:30.120 --> 13:41.120
And is it a fact that that security clearance was re-volved on the instructions of Secretary Steven after he's you appointed him with the testimony of that man before our committee?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
That is correct.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.120
That is correct.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.120
Is it further correct?

13:45.120 --> 13:47.120
No, just one moment sir.

13:47.120 --> 13:54.120
I don't think that the security clearance was re-volved because of the individual testimony before the committee.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.120
Not for that reason alone.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.120
I mean there are other reasons as well.

13:58.120 --> 14:05.120
No, this was the first time that the facts of the reference to this individual had directly been brought either to my opinion.

14:05.120 --> 14:09.120
In order to Secretary, I do not have a good recollection that I spoke directly to the Secretary about it.

14:09.120 --> 14:18.120
I think I spoke to the official who is his superior and that official did the revoking of the clearance.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.120
Again, that's a revocation with a name of the Secretary.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.120
But your revocation would have been in the name of the Secretary.

14:24.120 --> 14:28.120
And that revocation was made, and we just told that for all of us in the room, I was very close to you.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.120
We can't hear from you.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.120
Thank you.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.120
Great.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.120
Great, Mr. Comrade.

14:34.120 --> 14:42.120
And that revocation was made after our 12th 30th as a result of your being present during the interrogation of this man.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.120
That is correct.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.120
That is right.

14:44.120 --> 14:53.120
Now, Mr. Adam, did you hear me in Chairman Mr. Carr interrogate this man who I not told the 30th at a full security clearance?

14:53.120 --> 15:03.120
As to whether or not he had consistently voted to clear communists working for the Army and working in the Army signal corps.

15:03.120 --> 15:13.120
My recollection of the interrogation of this individual was that on each occasion when he inquiries the case through him about his participation in the oil.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.120
I am opposed to an objection such as inquiry.

15:17.120 --> 15:24.120
I don't know what the transcript shows that, but I think that when this individual wants to New York, he went separately from me.

15:24.120 --> 15:31.120
But I pointed out to you before he was interrogated, that we have no objection to any interrogation of the individual,

15:31.120 --> 15:40.120
with reference to his own background, that we would consistently suggest to any interrogation of the individual as to any part of the situation he had in any days of the loyalty program.

15:40.120 --> 15:46.120
And that objection would be based upon Army regular information, based on certain different orders, with the benefit.

15:46.120 --> 15:50.120
So I'm sorry, does Council have any questions?

15:50.120 --> 15:51.120
Yes.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
Chair, passes.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
And Mr. McCullen.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.120
Mr. McCullen, Mr. Mayweck.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.120
Mr. Miller.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.120
Mr. Wilk.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.120
Mr. Smith.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.120
Mr. Smith.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.120
Mr. Smith.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.120
No.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.120
No.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.120
Mr. McCullen.

16:02.120 --> 16:09.120
Now, Mr. Adam, did you interpose any objections to Mr. Smith's decision?

16:09.120 --> 16:14.120
So Mr. Ex-Cysically appearing before our committee, I did not.

16:14.120 --> 16:21.120
And the reason I did not is that you pointed out to him that your interrogation at the end of the duel was going to go to his personal background.

16:21.120 --> 16:25.120
So possible, coming in front, activity on your own spot.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.120
That right, sir?

16:26.120 --> 16:33.120
I don't know if you said both to possible, coming in front, activities that you made as clear as to his interrogation, as to his personal background.

16:33.120 --> 16:38.120
Well, when you now agree that I didn't interrogate him about possible, coming in front, activity, what it really is today.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.120
Well, you were agreed that he made some admissions in that regard.

16:42.120 --> 16:52.120
I think the transcripts speak for himself, and as I say, sir, I have not received the transcripts since it was given to us, but that I had a apologize, perhaps I should have.

16:52.120 --> 16:57.120
You have the transcript, and you know what it is, I presume. The best way to bring the bog will be to read the transcripts.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.120
Fine, given the permission of the chair to do that.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.120
I guess if you did read that, I believe in the basis of the question in my case, sir.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.120
I believe that he should substitute the fifth to name.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.120
So the name would be individual.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.120
I agree, sir.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.120
I agree.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.120
You don't want it as close as the matter may.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.120
Mr. Chairman, don't put it in a little while.

17:13.120 --> 17:15.120
I'm sure it'll hear it.

17:15.120 --> 17:18.120
May I, let me go over the subject with you, right?

17:18.120 --> 17:25.120
I'll refer you to the fact that Mr. Chairman said 1454 of the transcripts, the only five are the numbers the same.

17:25.120 --> 17:28.120
1454 is found at number 17.

17:28.120 --> 17:29.120
Number 17.

17:30.120 --> 17:35.120
When you look at the first, the type that I was living,

17:35.120 --> 17:36.120
may I ask?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.120
Yes.

17:37.120 --> 17:47.120
Would you just read to yourself that first tag up and tell us what I know if he had met a rat his home was used for a meeting for a communist front,

17:47.120 --> 17:50.120
the organization with the becoming of the son's body attorney general.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.120
My recollection, sir.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.120
The transcripts.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.120
Just read it.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.120
Those three sentences, I don't think of the whole story.

17:57.120 --> 18:03.120
Well, written here to take you up stated that he had committed to somebody who lived in the Green Dowthousing Project with empty units,

18:03.120 --> 18:09.120
y'all on yard as a picnic to get money for their managed law of the interests, by the way, for the security reasons.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.120
So I can see him.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.120
Just by the name of the name.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.120
And I'll leave you there.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.120
I'll be read and let the committee put his phone in third place for the policy.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
So I'll read it for the...

18:17.120 --> 18:20.120
I think you should read the names of the people.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.120
Otherwise you can read the names.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.120
I think it would be better not to get in the position.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.120
I believe it would be better.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
Yes, yes.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.120
The fans that will read a few lines ahead of where the committee will propose to start.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.120
We will.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.120
If you listen, let's send them a card to check the meeting.

18:31.120 --> 18:34.120
And the listeners will be right reading any of the proper names.

18:34.120 --> 18:38.120
Well, if I think of the best, the start and pace 1453.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.120
Not anybody likes.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.120
So let's start what you do now.

18:41.120 --> 18:46.120
Mr. Cohn, did you know that why the city and the name here,

18:46.120 --> 18:48.120
whether it's communist, or it's communist sympathizers?

18:48.120 --> 18:49.120
The total is from the point of view.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.120
What does the middle of pace 1453?

18:51.120 --> 18:53.120
Mr. H.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.120
Answer's no answer.

18:54.120 --> 18:59.120
In no way, shape, manner, or form, do I ever suspect that he had any specific meaning?

18:59.120 --> 19:00.120
But the other.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.120
Mr. Cohn, when did you last see Mr. Y?

19:03.120 --> 19:07.120
Mr. X replies, I last saw Mr. Y in June of 1961.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.120
Mr. Cohn, had you known him socially?

19:10.120 --> 19:14.120
Mr. X replies, not even as much as I knew Mr. Z.

19:14.120 --> 19:22.120
Mr. Cohn, now, did you yourself ever give a long party for the benefit of Spanish lawyers?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.120
Mr. X, no I did not.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.120
I was living in a distance, this is the distance, this is the distance, this is the distance,

19:27.120 --> 19:28.120
I'm not talking about this.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.120
I was living in a farmhouse instead of right in the town of Greenville,

19:31.120 --> 19:35.120
and I allowed my apprentices to be used by Mrs. B.

19:35.120 --> 19:38.120
To hold for the benefit for Spanish refugees,

19:38.120 --> 19:41.120
she had been a merciless with the Spanish lawyers.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
Mr. Cohn, when was that?

19:42.120 --> 19:45.120
Mr. X, I'm afraid I can't fix today exactly.

19:45.120 --> 19:49.120
I think it was sometime in 1949 or 1950, but I don't know for sure.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.120
Mr. Cohn, did you attend that party?

19:52.120 --> 19:57.120
Mr. X, well I didn't attend as a guest, but I was there since I allowed it to be held on my premises.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.120
Mr. Cohn, under the auspices of water organization,

20:00.120 --> 20:04.120
Mr. X, I did not know what was held under the auspices of any organization,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.120
and still don't know what it was.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.120
She simply said she would like to do something, having been insane,

20:09.120 --> 20:12.120
because she would like to do something for the Spanish refugees,

20:12.120 --> 20:14.120
but by the way, I know what was a personal thing with her.

20:14.120 --> 20:18.120
I have an editorial about it today, it's 1447, so we're going to identify Mr. B.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.120
They used his phone.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.120
It's a little like a C or a C.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.120
You referred to Mrs. B.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.120
Mrs. C.

20:27.120 --> 20:30.120
You have a C, who's home, who we allowed you to use his phone.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.120
I think we should identify Mr. B.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.120
We're about to 1447.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.120
First of all, was...

20:37.120 --> 20:40.120
But back to B, it's pretty well known time in the countryside.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.120
Mr. X, so that's it.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.120
Looking back, I think he was.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.120
Now, I assume there was some statements earlier as to why he now thinks he was,

20:47.120 --> 20:49.120
where he didn't vanish.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.120
No, no, no, no.

20:51.120 --> 20:55.120
Mr. Adam, would you do this?

20:55.120 --> 20:58.120
Would you be on the same here again?

20:58.120 --> 21:01.120
Would you do what you didn't do last week?

21:01.120 --> 21:02.120
Would you read this?

21:02.120 --> 21:04.120
In connection to answer this question.

21:04.120 --> 21:07.120
But they're not the evidence of that show,

21:08.120 --> 21:11.120
but that Dr. B,

21:11.120 --> 21:17.120
well, by no means, that Mr. X knew that he was treating government employees,

21:17.120 --> 21:22.120
handling secret work, that he was asked why he didn't...

21:22.120 --> 21:26.120
Well, he's asked that I'd not have ever made known to any government agency.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.120
But this man was a communist sympathizer,

21:28.120 --> 21:30.120
and he said he did not.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.120
He felt that he's political belief.

21:32.120 --> 21:36.120
And I'm not quoting now the son of the camp on his...

21:37.120 --> 21:41.120
The political belief that we're of no concern to the fact he was a doctor.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.120
Mr. Romano's on the board.

21:44.120 --> 21:48.120
I think I'm 1448, his answer is Mr. Kohn,

21:48.120 --> 21:52.120
ask Mr. X. Now, Mr. X, did you know at that time that Dr. B was a communist?

21:52.120 --> 21:55.120
Mr. X replies I certainly did not.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.120
Well, that's what's left of me, Mr. Kohn.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.120
Let me ask you this.

22:00.120 --> 22:03.120
I think it's important to know

22:03.120 --> 22:06.120
that you consider minor and major.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.120
Well, I don't have a question, but I have a question.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.120
I'm drawing the word minor because it's easy to describe you.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.120
I don't think you can withdraw what your strength is,

22:14.120 --> 22:17.120
or how to record by saying you was pregnant.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.120
Your character is the information against Mr. X,

22:20.120 --> 22:22.120
who's only loyal to the channel.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.120
You're starting who's to handle secret material we should know.

22:25.120 --> 22:28.120
Your character is information against him as minor.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.120
Let me ask you this hypothetical process.

22:30.120 --> 22:35.120
If a man who's on the important loyalty panel,

22:35.120 --> 22:38.120
they tell families they're going to panic on it.

22:38.120 --> 22:43.120
If he knew that a man was a communist simplified,

22:43.120 --> 22:46.120
if he knew he was treating government employees

22:46.120 --> 22:48.120
who were handling secret work,

22:48.120 --> 22:52.120
and if he being on the loyalty board did not notify the FBI

22:52.120 --> 22:54.120
on either government agency,

22:54.120 --> 22:58.120
would you consider that minor or major?

22:58.120 --> 23:01.120
Objection. Objection, Mr. X.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.120
Oh, my God, Mr. Wilson.

23:03.120 --> 23:07.120
The hypothetical question seems to me to embody facts

23:07.120 --> 23:11.120
that are not true, do you, never?

23:11.120 --> 23:13.120
I thought this is a hypothetical question

23:13.120 --> 23:14.120
that everyone based on facts,

23:14.120 --> 23:16.120
so that also there's an unregistered with an atom body,

23:16.120 --> 23:19.120
but minor and major in the first time it's like a burden.

23:19.120 --> 23:24.120
Mr. X, this seems to be a sample of what's going to happen to us

23:24.120 --> 23:27.120
if we pursue these individual cases,

23:27.120 --> 23:29.120
and take the size of them in your group.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.120
You're referring to a fair amount of different interpretations.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.120
You are not thinking of a directives this time

23:33.120 --> 23:35.120
to Mr. X, so why are these?

23:35.120 --> 23:37.120
For a team of mere directives,

23:37.120 --> 23:39.120
and Mr. Adams is an hypothetical form.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.120
In an ethical determined,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.120
what states does he consider

23:42.120 --> 23:44.120
to remain true or minor in the fraction of security?

23:44.120 --> 23:46.120
Well, by many lawyers, when I start saying,

23:46.120 --> 23:49.120
how am I awake that let's go ahead if you want to.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.120
If you've been answering the question, Mr. Adams,

23:51.120 --> 23:52.120
and you want to get back to the subject,

23:52.120 --> 23:53.120
I would like to get back to that.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.120
You're in direct the fraction, please.

23:57.120 --> 24:01.120
They have to be stopped because it knows

24:01.120 --> 24:03.120
that they cannot provide directives.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.120
오� вторant across the region,

24:05.120 --> 24:07.120
carried out a period of panic in September year-on-phase as

24:07.120 --> 24:10.120
Yogur возвits owners but is unable to give

24:10.120 --> 24:20.120
to nearly five hundred percent from 4,000 percent

24:20.120 --> 24:22.120
or imposible.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.120
Alright, ask a question.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.120
Now let me ask you this, my third question.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.120
If a man who was on this important war of the final,

24:30.120 --> 24:32.120
the top family of synagogue, my believers,

24:32.120 --> 24:35.120
if he knew that a man was becoming a self-president,

24:35.120 --> 24:38.120
if he knew he was treating government employees who were having

24:38.120 --> 24:41.120
sheeted the courts, and if he being on the

24:41.120 --> 24:44.120
lawyer's board did not notify us, the I or any other government

24:44.120 --> 24:48.120
agency, did you consider that minor for a major?

24:48.120 --> 24:51.120
The answer is that it gets those backs for truth,

24:52.120 --> 24:54.120
that backs for this measure is different than they do,

24:54.120 --> 24:55.120
I would think it was serious.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.120
You think you've gone qualified to put on that

24:57.120 --> 24:59.120
a fairly good word?

24:59.120 --> 25:01.120
Yes, but I think it's only serious,

25:01.120 --> 25:03.120
qualified by saying, send him a copy one.

25:03.120 --> 25:06.120
I do not select the people for the lawyer of the board,

25:06.120 --> 25:08.120
to who I do not serve as a security.

25:08.120 --> 25:11.120
And I was not here to show who was in any way

25:11.120 --> 25:13.120
in the Chanuk's man was referred to as an individual.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.120
And he was considered in the fact that he was considered

25:16.120 --> 25:20.120
by the responsible boys and by the review organizations.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.120
And whatever action was taken against him was taken by the official

25:23.120 --> 25:25.120
who had letters, found that they'll be assigned to them.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.120
You're asking to consider it from the qualified.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.120
Yes, but I'm not sure if I was right,

25:29.120 --> 25:33.120
but that's what the actual backs are true as stated.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.120
I would consider it serious.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.120
If you consider it from the qualified,

25:37.120 --> 25:39.120
it's going to be a little bit more serious.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.120
Again, I must say, send him a copy.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.120
I do not select and I don't know,

25:46.120 --> 25:49.120
but my decision would be, if I were on the lawyer of the board,

25:49.120 --> 25:51.120
when you study loyally matter,

25:51.120 --> 25:54.120
and when you live with them all the time, you're able.
