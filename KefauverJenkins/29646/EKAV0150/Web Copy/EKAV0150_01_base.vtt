WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
The Secretary of State, Senator Dean of Miami, the

00:03.500 --> 00:06.000
DIA's executive, whether or not you talk about

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Fourth Monkman, I don't know if you'll give up the

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
energy for, anyway.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
That's quite a lot, sir.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Well, there's a lot more to it, so I'll ask him

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
to direct the mile of mine.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
May I ask what is the Secretary of State

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
in the direction, then, so that the Secretary

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
knows to be sure whether it includes one segment

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
to another historic decision?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Where is the headquarter of the Army signal for us?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
What's the Secretary?

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Right here in Washington.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Fourth Monkman was under the jurisdiction of the Army signal for us.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
That's right.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
You are aware of what's in the fire?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
That's telecommunications.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Does the headquarter of the mile not only think

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
for some top think that works?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I thought of you as a Fourth Monkman, but it is the

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
way you went about in advance, Mike.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
But are you aware of the fact that telecommunications

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
does a great deal of classified work for the Army signal

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
for including top think that works?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, time of the fire.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I still say that mile marked, so the record will be

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
for here with direct support.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Monkman, what are you talking about?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I think you're now talking about something else.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Will you mind if we don't talk about the same thing?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
We'll again, the chair will like to inquire

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
from his colleagues, their desires.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
We pause ten seconds now for station identification.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
WABC in New York, be sure to watch these hearings on WABC TV,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Channel 7 this afternoon.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Now back to the McCarthy Army hearings,

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
where Senator Monk, the Chairman of the Subcommittee,

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
has indicated a plus early recess.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Well, it's back to his, not only I suggest him,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
but an actual proposal and a recess of the committee

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
in order that the members of the Subcommittee can attend

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
the draft of the General's Canada,

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
as the Association of Congress this afternoon.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh, Senator, Senator signings on November.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Was very, Senator, do you think we're going to be able to use

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
shorten these hearings by cutting down on the extent

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
of the cross examination?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I do not know.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, what do you think can be done at this point?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And after all of this discussion this morning about what should be done,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I agree with Senator McClellan.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
That before long, the public will know who is buying the lack of hearings

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
and who is buying the expeditum.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I believe actually they already know.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
All right, thank you very much, Senator signings.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
All right, Senator March.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
What are we going to do this afternoon?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
We're going to make any progress?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I don't know.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
What's going on in the Secretary Stevens' to the box?

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
How long much longer do you expect to be on the day?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Senator McClellan, you sent her in the question of the negotiations

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
yesterday that he's be impossible for him to make a prediction

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
until he found out the answer to his question.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
He can't predict the ICANN.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, your procedure will be simply to go around each time.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
The procedure will be followed without any further modifications.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Give him a lengthy, these 10-minute periods to cross exams.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
All right.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I was Senator March.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm sorry to quote the acting chairman of this Senate subcommittee.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
All of these people are moving out of the subcommittee room,

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
or the caucus room in the Senate office building very rapidly.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Going over to the Capitol building

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
and over to the all of the House of Representatives

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
and the South Wing of the Capitol,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
the House Wing of the Capitol for this joint session

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Congress, which is being held in order that the Governor General

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
look Canada, the Honorable, that's Matthew will speak to them.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
The Governor General is a official visitor in Washington.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Today, I've lost these names this year.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Today visiting the President of the United States

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
has been making this speech to the joint session of Congress

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
to the House and Senate this afternoon.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm a call-in.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
May I have been so?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
May not have been so.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I just don't know.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Can you recall, sir?

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Can you recall whether or not Aaron Paul has been confused?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I've bought one.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
It's fight of proof that he has taken 43 left to find

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
including some secret documents,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
run near a proper place in the laboratory,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and that on a rate of its own,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
by security officials, small documents

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
that have been found in a bureau too.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
As I told you, I cannot testify on every one of these 35 patients

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
of these days.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm under presidential restrictions in connection with it,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
for one thing and on the other.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
If you want to go into the 35 patients,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
then I will ask counsel to give me the right

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
to put somebody on this band and can testify

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
out to the defect.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Mr. Secretary, may I say this to you, sir?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
You were asked whether or not,

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
specifically, if there were any communist and court moments.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
As I recall, your question was in your answer

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
within the legate.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
The only reason the committee is permitting this line of interrogation

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
at this time is to just give Ms. Cole an opportunity

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
to prove in fact that there was a communist or work communist

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
at court moments during your regime as Secretary of the Army.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
I want a state to Mr. Cole at this time

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
that the committee has no disposition in my opinion to hear in detail

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
the facts with reference to all of the alleged communists

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
if there were more than Mr. Coleman there

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
and I do suggest to counsel that he not go into too much detail

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
to be as stabbish as go to the point now

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
if possible whether or not Coleman was a communist

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
and then I trust we will pay for him to another enemy.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
So if we want to establish whether there were commoners there,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
should we not undertake to establish it under oath?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I don't know whether Coleman's a communist.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
No one has one that is, he may be.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
But the test is, is this witness no he's a communist?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
If he doesn't, that ends it.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Unless you bring some proof here that he is a communist.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Senator McClillin, in my opinion, sir,

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
respectfully your objections go to the weight of the testimony

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
of the Secretary of the Army rather than the admissibility

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
of his testimony he's made though any may not know.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
But counsel has arrived to a list of information

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
from him to determine whether he does.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
He cannot seem if he knows and if he says he does.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
And he can inquire about it if he doesn't know

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
then who is there here has said that he is a communist.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
I understand that he's leading up to that right right at this time.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Senator McClillin, have you heard the point of work?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I'm not sure if you could call this point of order.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
I want to correct the mistake of the May by a very competent

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
table.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Senator Mark and some of them are respectfully guilty.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
And I know he didn't make the mistake of purposefully.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
He made it only because he was not at the hearing.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
He did not hear the testimony.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
He made the statement that there was no sworn testimony

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
to Coleman.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Was it communist?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
The sound carries him here around there.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
That's the case.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I'd have said no testimony there to this committee.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
To the president of the Ill-Maria's one testimony

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
that he is a communist.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Then I don't see how we, if we go into that here

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
to the American standards of justice, can call him a comment.

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
Mr. Chairman, we have said that there is one testimony

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
before this committee.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
An open session.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
This is the investigating committee from the investigating committee.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
On December 8th, an open session.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
As I have to recall, when the member of the young communist

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
league is surprised to come in this party,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
his son, who was following him, had him there,

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
he would know that.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
And not accusing him of anything wrong from being there,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
just frightening him because he is glad that there was no

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
evidence before this committee.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
This man was a member of the communist party.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
There is sworn testimony that he was a member of the young

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
communist league, which is a branch of the communist party.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
That information was transmitted to Mr. Adam Hoffman.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I inquire this English Senate that he has the witness

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
did not appear in person before your committee

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
and under all demands of charges.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Isn't that true?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
The witness denied a hearing of the government

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
and the military was the communist party meeting

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
with Julian Stolzberg, that was sworn testimony

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
that he was a member of the young communist league.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Well, I know that's the cabinet.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
He could put it in the office.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
I know that's the cabinet that was seized with the issues

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
that have been before this committee.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
I have the water waste time and it's all right.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
But I know when we are sticking to the issues

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
that are here before this committee to be resolved.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
And we're getting pretty far off these.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
We are in Lamellus, chairman.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
So I can't be too much impressed by the country's plan

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
to be convicted of issues for getting far off these.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
I didn't hear the very evil sentence Mark and Saul.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Our deal makes officials the other day.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
We're talking about day and time, boom.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
And we spent two days on a picture.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We're in a very important position now.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
The issue of wonder enough.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
The secretary of the Army knew that there were communists

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
at Fort Monmouth when he stated to this committee

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
under all that there were not.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
And why would he give the category of those who were suspended?

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
He omitted stating that one of the categories

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
included young men who stole six of the straight-up laboratory,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
men who had been named as members of the communist party

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
as part of the Rosenberg Fire Registration.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Mr. Chairman, this is the very last to Saul's investigation.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Now we can argue for two days,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
but whether or not they're showing more to the city,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
whether or not he gave a stake in New York,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I think we can spend 10 minutes,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
10 minutes of the ceremony,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
on this question of communist infiltration

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
in an old important,

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
then old teachers re-arred to this country.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Mr. Chairman, I think that the thing we sent

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
is that the Senator from Mark and Saul

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
did not question Mr. John regarding the state that he has made.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Once those things were visited as I recall

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
from the Senator's side at the table.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
We know it has been really that he may continue

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
to question the Secretary about his knowledge,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
the health and health care.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Mr. Chairman, please.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Senator McCoyley has just made quite a claim

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
that I'd like to be sure to benefit

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
of the committee on all who are listening and interested

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
as to just what the record shows.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I testify this morning with respect

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
to the very thing that has now been talked about two weeks.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
The very far-ass-assumption now is what month

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
and I'd like to specifically ask the chair

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
to have read now the record of what my testimony was

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
to see how it coincides

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
with the statement of the Senator McCoyley at just now.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Mr. Chairman, may they chair his fire

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
whether or not the testimony of this morning

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
is available so that you can meet Mr. Chairman.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I think it's an enormous request.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
The Secretary has made just the question of this morning

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and he has to be repeated.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
And he seems to be some dollar in his mind

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
as to whether or not he has dealt with the issues

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
that have to be discussed.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Mr. Chairman, we'll ask this to be clear

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
to you as we speak to the questions and the efforts

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
of the Chairman's first meeting.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Mr. Chairman, I think to re-read

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
the Secretary's long invasive answers

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
would be the measure through in human species

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
and from the committee.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Secretary, if you must, the question be read

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
and the answer be read and the answer is

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
if you've been further ahead, isn't it?

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
I mean, the layman effort just not far from ours.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Yes.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
The first round.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Okay.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
That's got to read it yourself.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
16, 19, 16, 26.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Right.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Right.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
The Secretary prepares to have some

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
just on the hand, finding it is no such portion

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
of the morning testimony.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Secretary Steven has asked to read that.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Wow.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
The Secretary's looking at the driver's looking through his note.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
The commander's lighting up his cigar

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
and the Secretary of McCarthy has written from his seat

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
and walked over about 10 feet

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
to confirm with some of the advisers and friends

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
who have been grouped behind his station.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
So we say the McCarthy station at the end

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
of the committee table.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
So is this part?

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Well, the Synagogue first searches through

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
is then a type of notes looking for the answer

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
which Secretary Steven's gave a response to a question

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
by the Secretary of McCarthy's during the morning session

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
of this hearing.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
There are several households who are going on

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
around the committee table among attorneys and senators

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
and Secretary Steven's is looking

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
up the shoulder of one of his attorneys trying

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
to find a reference which is also being sought

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
by the Stenocoper and he's all known.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
There's always a difference between around people

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
getting up, giving themselves sort of a seventh

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
and a stretch at this interruption in the proceedings.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
We have this frequently where the chairman

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
upon motion of one of the other of the opposing counsel orders

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
the Stenocoper to go back and we can go very often

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
we aren't able to hear them clearly

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
because there is no microphone in front of

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
the snout for an unless someone as they were thought

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
to reach over and push one in front of them

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
and we do not hear the re-reading of the questions

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
from the notes now, Senator McCarty has moved

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
down the committee table and is talking

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
with Senator John El McCallum with whom we had

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
what you might call a bit of a legal price

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
just to do moments ago.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You have all the listening to these hearings

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
might be interested in you.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I'm sorry, Senator.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Senator Gordon, the chair is going to ask

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
to announce the benefit of the press

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
as a solely of the man's name who's been questioning

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
is Aaron Coleman, his AARLM Coleman,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
COLE E.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Are you ready, Mr. Secretary?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yes, sir.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
You may be.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
He has requested and the answer to them

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
if you wanted to have red energy.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Mr. Jenkins, you shall ask the occasion of the meeting.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
1632.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
Mr. Jenkins, do I understand Mr. Stevens

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
that you have stated that none of these

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
of those 35 suspensions were the communist

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
of Secretary Stevens?

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
So far as I now know, that is the fact,

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Mr. Jenkins, your statement, Secretary Stevens

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
and none of them led to Fifth Amendment that I know of.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Mr. Jenkins, I am not asking about the Fifth Amendment.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Your statement is that none of them

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
was or is the communist as far as you know.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Secretary Stevens, that is right.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Of course, the investigations are going on

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
on these people as you know, Mr. Jenkins.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
We don't yet know the outcome of all of them.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
That's the chairman of the director.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Senator, Senator, I'm quoting a proceed.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
Mr. Secretary, I believe my left question was this, sir.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
Is it a fact that Aaron Coleman

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
during the first six months of your administration

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
continued his fourth month in fight-hobbs

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
the existence of record show that he had previously

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
taken from the radar laboratory for some 43 doctors,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
some of them secrets, and as those documents had been seen,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
when security officers raided his home.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You know that, do you not?

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
I've said this before that I cannot testify on all the details

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
of every one of these cases.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
If you remember this one particular item,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
because the answer to the question is that Mr. Coleman

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
was continues on a restricted non-classified job

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
for nearly a year.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
But, sir, may I remember, it's a legend before the time

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
has come about.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
But the specific question now is whether or not you knew

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
or not not with you, but whether or not this man,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Aaron Coleman, has taken from the plan

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
where he was working 45 classified documents to his home.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
And as they were discovered in a funeral draw,

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
he said, is that a bag or is it not a bag?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Just getting a bag of attention.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
It is a bag, I believe, although...

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And I think that must qualify...

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Yes, he tried to do his rejected side spating,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
but there's a lot of information in connection with that case,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
and in connection with the thing that you just cited

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
that I think should be brought before this committee

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
if you want to go into all that detail.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And I don't feel confident about that,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
but I know all about it.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
And very well now, the direct question is the mask.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
If the direct answer is given, then it's not a matter of time.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It's not valid.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
It's a long-term valid experience.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Oh, well, the AI.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Face.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Chair.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Chair passes.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Senator McClellan?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Yes.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Senator, is it to the right?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I've done it to the left.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Uh, what question?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I'm like that.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Senator Jackson, look, does he believe in it?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
No, no, quite.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm not sure.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I'm just having any questions.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Mr. Secretary, how long have you been in the Army?

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
I've been, how long have I been in the Army?

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
A secretary of the Army since February 4, 1953.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
How many people were in the Army or command?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Approximately, uh, two minutes.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
That's all, Mr. Chairman.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Any other?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Senator, Mr. Wells?

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Uh, Mr. Cohen or Senator McCarthy?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Mr. Cohen or Senator McClellan?

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
Uh, Mr. Steven, we now have a plan in advance that he told us it is a fact that Coleman was

21:47.000 --> 21:55.000
continued on despite evidence that he had taken the 43 documents who is from LaRéa

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
a laboratory through his home.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I'm not satisfied with respect to the document.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
I'll get to somebody who will testify on that if you want.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I just think that he'll be competent.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
He'll be on his job on a unpaid respected non-monetified job.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
From January or February until September, the latter part when he was suspended.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Yes, sir.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And I think the case is now under review.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yes, sir.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
And I think we haven't that he continued amendments to September 28th.

22:22.000 --> 22:28.000
And that he has taken these documents to his home and that brings me to my next question.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
You know the United States Secretary that disdainment, investigate again, and investigation

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
of the Coleman case.

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
The after-same, how, infuels the proof of his association with Roland Berg in the young

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
communists lead, and the fact that he had taken these secret documents from the laboratory,

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
he could have been allowed to continue at full funds until after the committee began his

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
investigation.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
You know that, the United States Secretary.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I don't get no investigation.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
Uh, I don't know that Mr. Cohen is a comment.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
It takes a still under investigation.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Mr. Cohen, if I were in the question, sir, that wasn't the question.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
The question was, do you know that this committee, the McKinley-Cohm-Carrie committee,

23:12.000 --> 23:19.000
was investigating and did investigate as to why Coleman was permitted to stay all the

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
history of taking these documents to his home?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I know that investigation, Mr. Coleman.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Yes, sir.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Mr. Steeving.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
Is it not a fact that your law attempted to impede the investigation of all responsible

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
for the continuation of Coleman in the fact that the evidence left to be taken?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Certainly not as far as I know.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
Mr. Steeving, I'd like to call your attention to the fact that I called for a moment on the

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
phone, on October 2nd when you were in my office.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Yes, sir.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.000
And because you said that you were having difficulty there and I called General Rodden and

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
it's something him to give the committee the very full-etgeful operation.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
That is what reference it's going to, employee working at what line.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
Did you in that same conversation, General Rodden, there were certain things which he should

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
not disclose to the committee?

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
I don't recall, I know that I wanted full-etgeful operation.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
I talked to my wife while you were there and within the limit of presidential direct views,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I wanted them to go to them.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
My question was, sir, if I didn't make it clear, did you in that same phone conversation,

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
General Rodden, there were things which you did not want to disclose to the committee?

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
I might possibly have mentioned files.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Yes, sir.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I might possibly have mentioned files with, sir.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Now, on the very end, anything besides file entry calls that were calling, I think.

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
Now, Mr. Secretary, do you recall a discommittee on this fall and its all-important case?

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
And you to produce, you and Mr. Adams to produce, the personnel file of Aaron Coleman,

24:57.000 --> 25:04.000
before the committee, that is a file which is not covered by any presidential directive or anything else.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I personally don't recall that request.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Mr. D very likely, Mr. Adams was, but I don't.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
Now, Mr. Secretary, do you not recall that when that file was applied,

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
your office represented that it was a true and complete file,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
that we examined it, and we had no recollection of it at all.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
I'm going to try to refresh it, sir. I'm going to try to show all of this to the place right in your presence.

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
Mr. Secretary, do you not recall that that file was printed, that there was a representation to us,

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
that there was a true, complete and full file, but that the fact was that it has been stripped from the file,

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
all evidently showing that Coleman has taken eight feet with doctrine from the laboratory to at all.

25:46.000 --> 25:58.000
I have no discretion recollection, and if the many files we have to operate within the limits of the presidential directive,

25:58.000 --> 26:05.000
which, oh, evidently, it is closure outside of the executive department of information relating to

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
the loyalty to the past president perspective employee.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Mr. Secretary, I am not talking about the loyalty file.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
I am talking about Coleman's personnel file concerning which the presidential directive has been

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
completely in favorable.

26:20.000 --> 26:28.000
I will not ask you, sir, is it not a fact that when that personnel file was submitted to this committee,

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
it has been stripped of all relevant information showing that Coleman,

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
the Associate of Justice Rosenberg, has taken eight feet with doctrine from the Ray R Laboratory.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I have no recollection of that, whatever.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
Mr. Secretary, this is not a part in the presence of Senator McCaw.

26:46.000 --> 26:55.000
State can you, on the morning of October 14, 1953, that you are off in this crucial case,

26:55.000 --> 27:03.000
I have given us a script file when it has represented it has given us a true and complete ILO recollection of any such thing.

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
Mr. Secretary, may I hand you, by the six of the executive session testimony of this testimony,

27:11.000 --> 27:19.000
and direct your attention to the lively indicating that you are present and the page 642 indicating

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
remark may be about the stripping of this call in file and medication.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
Mr. Secretary, do you want to keep this first?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Not tall.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
I have assuming, of course, there is a proper basis for your question, Mr. Colton.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
I represent you, there is a proper basis.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Here is a known what it is.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
Mr. Steeman, did you look at State 642's there? I hope it will be pressure recollect.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
I still contend that with the two-minute people, with the timer responsible for it,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
I can't go everything about every file.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
And both are specified that on these 35 cases, which include Mr. Coleman,

27:59.000 --> 28:06.000
and that the present time, so far as I know, he has not a time in his but he can take his under investigation

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
along with the three-four others.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
And he may develop that he is, but we have to use the good old American,

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
new market of fair play to find out whether or not that's so.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And I do not know at the present time.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Mr. Coleman, is it common?

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Mr. Luis, we're Mr. Steeman.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
We have three-half-sack and fair-sack.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
The matter here with you this time, and they're able us to get along.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
The question is now not directed as to whether or not Coleman was a communist.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
I think we've all been to that question.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
It's early on enough, as much as I intended, for me if I have anything to do with it.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
The question now is this.

28:46.000 --> 28:55.000
Mr. Coleman asked you whether or not you were at the hospital for the personnel foul of David Coleman,

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
to whom the McCarthy Committee seems to attach considerable importance.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Your answer was that you, as I recall,

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
did you bid for an ashamed with a personnel foul on Coleman?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
No, sir, I didn't say that.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
You will think you are not.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I'd have no recollection of it.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I'll be the only one to ask the first.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
I don't think so.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
I remember never having in front of the personnel foul.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That would not be my function, Mr. Jackson.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Do you recall I were having a conversation?

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
This doesn't come out of your time, Mr. Coleman.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Do you recall I was having a conversation with Mr. Coleman?

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
I don't remember any member of the committee with respect to this man, Aaron Coleman.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
I remember I was present when Coleman, I think I was present during Part of Coleman's testimony.

29:39.000 --> 29:47.000
When the hearing, were you present at any executive or open hearing when Coleman's case was investigated together with Crowley to be?

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
That was an executive meeting, as I remember it in New York.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Do you recall me?

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
You do not recall me as for the personnel foul on Coleman's.

29:56.000 --> 30:08.000
I'd all be called in as for it, then his next question was whether or not you represented the embedded personnel foul on Coleman was a complete foul.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
And as I remember you say it, you have no recollection of that, correct?

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
His next question was whether or not in fact that foul has been strict.

30:18.000 --> 30:25.000
And the information regarding Coleman's having taken certain documents.

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
Two years home have been taken from the foul and your answer to that is that you did not remember.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Is that right? I don't know.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
You did not remember that, Mr. Chairman, I think that's the biggest inexperience issue of the term.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
Well, the other member of the term, we have been in the middle of the repression of the regulation.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
And some of these other people have been wanting to repress the regulation.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
I think, Bob, you'd love them before you start talking with me.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
Secretary May, he's down with the document.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
You'll find the order?

31:01.000 --> 31:09.000
I have one order, they need to meet the foul, they need to meet the rules, they need to get as well as the cold deferred to the public health provisions and chairman fouls.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'm very sorry to have to say daily.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
That would be better as I have been used in arms, you and I have been arms for.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
And tell us a little direct secretary, I think he may read it.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
If you may, but I'll follow like you know, that's just my belief again on the bottom of page 642.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
It's a statement by me as read through the secretary.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
It's a statement by me as read through the secretary.
