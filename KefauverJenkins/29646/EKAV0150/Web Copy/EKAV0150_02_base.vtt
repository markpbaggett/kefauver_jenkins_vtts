WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
You may read as much before that as an after-added academy.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
If anybody wants to listen, I suggest that the showman

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
be taken.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
The heat mass on the fighter is the weather as it is.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
It's all as hard-wrecked rad if it is to be read.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm perfectly agreeable. I be glad to see that.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Beginning where we are, I think the bottom of 6.22

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
is that it is the call and then the first one is the secretary.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
For the purpose of identifying this is we understand it is a time-script of the gains.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
I think it is a good idea station of the McCarty-Claire on October 14, 1953.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Is that correct? Yes, sir.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
I think it is a good idea station of the McCarty-Claire on October 14, 1950.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Is this chairman, Mr. Jackson?

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
It's about the needs of this wood, aid the secretary in repression and recollection.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
If you are understanding what I mean to read, Mr. Weller.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, if you have anything that it will tell you, you're repression of the recollection of the next day.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
The President is a reason to have a little recent committee and councilor Mr. Steven

01:50.000 --> 02:01.000
is only in front of the six party to the last day of the executive session of the McCarty-Claire on October 14, 1950.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
Mr. Secretary, we want to call your attention to the fact that if this time we were down in Montenegro.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
And the army made available as it has been as it has been and as have all government agencies.

02:16.000 --> 02:25.000
The personnel fire, Montenegro is not security fire, but the personnel fire is there with the personnel investigation.

02:25.000 --> 02:34.000
We examine the fire of Mr. Coleman and took theé—ª of the smoke and there is a matter of fact some documents were okay,

02:34.000 --> 02:46.000
and we made for a big and copies of them instead of thinking about where this is bringing them back.

02:46.000 --> 03:01.000
Here, they asked us over at the moment that we wouldn't, if we would let them make full of facts and they would have their records complete.

03:01.000 --> 03:13.000
We read today and when the food has been served, we found that the fire has been stripped of some of the most relevant documents.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
It still happens that some of the documents of which we had made verbatim copies were missing.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Mr. Secretary of parliament, Mr. Coleman, how are you all?

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
We wanted to call after your attention.

03:29.000 --> 03:40.000
In the case of the Coleman fire, I have been removed from it all papers indicating the search of his home by the security and intelligence division.

03:41.000 --> 03:52.000
And the fact that he has been suspended in the fact that these documents have been removed by him from the Evan signal laboratory and found his home.

03:52.000 --> 04:03.000
I would say that the fire forehand handled the G2 in the Pentagon and we understand they will put Fort Mama intact.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
On the heavy occasion, did you remove classified documents for the Evan signal court laboratory?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Mr. Coleman, I don't remember.

04:16.000 --> 04:29.000
I think that apparently talking to Coleman, Mr. Secretary, I have read to you now what Mr. Coleman has said this ADU on October 14th.

04:30.000 --> 04:45.000
And I am sure that you get the import of the statement that he made there, that is that at that time, they examined that the personnel fire of Coleman, they took obvious notes from him.

04:45.000 --> 04:58.000
Instead of bringing the original fire with them back to their office, they took full effects that when they examined the full effects, they had to name that the fire has been stripped.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
And that valuable information has been with the whole of the police that did not contain the entire personnel fire.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
Have you understand what Mr. Coleman said to your medication?

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
Yes, I think I do. Right now, this question is whether or not that an evil use to replace your recollection.

05:19.000 --> 05:31.000
Mr. Whether or not Mr. personnel fire of the Evan Coleman has been stripped, when it was sent to him that is when the full effects of the incident is correct, it is correct.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, that's the first time I have heard that read or read myself.

05:35.000 --> 05:48.000
As these to me, it strikes me that the important thing is that the copious notes and profound economies were made up of all of the things that were only in the file that they wanted.

05:49.000 --> 06:01.000
If I heard this read correctly, the information was made available, the notes were made in some of them for by.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
That's my question. That's the high level of this correctness that your abilities have taken.

06:08.000 --> 06:20.000
And the important evidence is that I have tried to convince him the statement to you, loud, Mr. Coleman, lady charged to you in your presence.

06:21.000 --> 06:33.000
That he asked for the personnel file of the Evan Coleman, that it was shown him that he made copious notes for me, that instead of taking the original file, he immediately sent him full effects.

06:33.000 --> 06:45.000
That the full effects did not contain all of the original files and that it had been stripped of valuable pertinent information.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
Now, the unit call is making a statement to you in the executive station, not out of that even before.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
Now sir, I don't recall what I followed him on, I was going to send him a file, I just don't hear it well in the question.

06:58.000 --> 07:11.000
You learned that charge and as many as it was receiving the charge made to you, that involved in your command, Mr. Coleman, on October 14th.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
The unit call is making that I might say it is charging in to you.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
Frankly, I don't think this transfer here is my first time seeing it or heard.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
When has the transfer from which I have raised the not-repressure recollection on that subject?

07:32.000 --> 07:43.000
I just have no recollection of Mr. Jenkins, I'll handling any file at any time in regard to these matters.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
From the quarter quarter.

07:45.000 --> 07:54.000
I think the file is in, if I wonder if the transcript shows any files of the security of the model here,

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
so I was going to say to you that this underpartner, I have heard and reading that transcript,

08:03.000 --> 08:14.000
that the transcript contains no reply made by you whenever to that charge.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
That does not represent your recollection.

08:18.000 --> 08:27.000
I assume that must have been an executive hearing of this committee with somebody on the side, Mr. Coleman.

08:27.000 --> 08:45.000
I presume I was sitting as invited guest in the hearing and that for some reason Mr. Coleman, I've got to himself, Mr. Secretary, even though I was, of course, not on the stand.

08:45.000 --> 08:57.000
I would have no recollection of having said anything about the files, Mr. Coleman, definitely informed me here about them.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
But do you have any recollection you say you have recollection?

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
I say anything about the past, you have any recollection of Mr. Coleman, if you're saying anything about the past, or making that charge next.

09:08.000 --> 09:15.000
That's pretty much the true transcript of the hearing, so it's quite obvious. He said something about file.

09:15.000 --> 09:26.000
But is there just key to your memory? Is there right? I don't have any recollection of having undertaken to do anything and I cannot recall ever having handled it personally.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
I have filed because he just don't have time to do it, go out of this. This was an investigation.

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
I was a particular individual named Aaron Coleman at the time. It being alleged that he was injured, communist, or a subversive.

09:43.000 --> 10:11.000
And in the lack of these charges that you were attempting to force or to stop their investigation of Mama, this sequence, then under discussion, in your presence, this charge was made, including the charge that the file had been stripped of the fact that Coleman had secretly taken from the installation some 40 odd,

10:11.000 --> 10:21.000
twice as far as documents to his home and hidden them there. That being a part of the statement made by Mr. Coleman to you.

10:21.000 --> 10:34.000
And your answer now is that you have an old memory of a suspect, an alien, a sonar, a charred, here, an accusation, whatever it is. That's absolutely true.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
Mr. Coleman, I'm thinking I'll get trying another remainder of how much left it may have to try and keep it.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Six minutes, I'll find that in a while.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
And your students might be thinking, what is the point of question?

10:50.000 --> 11:08.000
So everything is good to do. But you can still consider it a rather serious matter if during the period of great cooperation with the committee, a person in the old file, having stripped in the time of gun, given to us and represented as a complete file.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Would you consider that a serious matter?

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
I have shown that I'm a 5D that we are operating under the finalized social directive that doesn't it?

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
We were talking about a personnel file in the second grade. We're not putting out a loyalty for an always-stop file.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
And there is no presidential directive for preventing a committee getting a personal file, I don't think.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I didn't get that question.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
I still don't know for a presidential directive for preventing a committee getting a personal file.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I think that's correct.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Or acknowledge.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Keep in mind that we're talking about a correct maneuver.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Is that correct? Is that correct?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
People who are not supposed to be doing this.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
We said there is a very negative attention.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
Now we're not supposed to be saying the laws and directives that governs.

12:03.000 --> 12:12.000
We are not supposed to give out information dealing with loyalty matters in these files, no matter what kind of a file you call.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
For now, let's work your way to think of a possible loyalty matter.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
The fact that a man with the spend with rehire,

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
if you don't give the reason for the suspension, the rehiring, will that be a loyalty matter?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Is it an abstracted personnel matter?

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
I, of course, I'm in a testifying here on something that I have no recollection of,

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
and which I have got to do it on the basis of talking with Mr. Adams there.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
I asked, did you?

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
The first time you were in the file, it was a very serious issue.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I will leave you for a repeat question.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
I think the Secretary of the Interior, Ms. Albert, introduce you to the question.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
Well, one thing that's surprising to me in my mind is that there are very strict regulations covering the giving out of loyalty,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
not of information, very non-lawiality.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
It's not the both that go outside of the executive branch of the government.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
Now, if there's royally information in any file, I don't care what file it is.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
That information under these prevailing presidential directives, as I understand, should not be given out.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
And in the party.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Now let's get this picture clearly in line.

13:38.000 --> 13:47.000
We stand 0.241, let's, and General Loffen, following the presidential directive,

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
refused to allow them to see the loyalty file, allowed them to examine the personnel file.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
Now that time, this mask made notes from the personnel file, not the loyalty file.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
And they asked for the privilege of taking the file along.

14:06.000 --> 14:14.000
They were told that the file that you sent down to the Pentagon, protested out and sent to it.

14:14.000 --> 14:24.000
Now, do you think it was proper to strip that personnel file, not knowing reports, not knowing that we had the notes?

14:24.000 --> 14:33.000
To strip the personnel file, give us to us with the representation, so that was a full personnel file.

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
In this very important case, if those handling this case, Mr. Secretary, were honest,

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
don't you think when they strip that file, if they felt they had some reason?

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
That man in common honesty, they were somewhat a note thing we have removed certain material from this file.

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
I do not bring you any different idea, but I don't think that they could give out material affecting loyalty.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
I think that was, was here because, what...

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
What time is it, Frank?

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Second, Mr. Secretary, I will expect that one thing in my mind.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
We're talking about a personnel file on the Errol & Coal Monarchery.

15:14.000 --> 15:27.000
That's right. Now, Mr. Secretary, is that a presser's band or a lawyer's band covered by President Joe Directive, or is it not?

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
Well, there was evidently loyal information in it, Mr. Tad, I don't ever recall having seen the file, sir,

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
so I'd like to get somebody to testify that can give you the first impact. I can't give to it.

15:38.000 --> 15:46.000
In other words, if a person may have a fax, who's convinced some loyalty of the information,

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
then it's your position that you would have a right to strip the loyalty of the information from it.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Not only have a right, but you've got to do it or you violate the law.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
Now, who has his often, where's the line of demarcation is, whether it is...

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
The routine personnel file that you're permitted to give to the committee, or whether it is loyalty, is fast.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Who pays his own land?

16:09.000 --> 16:19.000
If it either be the G1 or the G2 or the Geno's Fad, could you entertain Park Individual, pinpointing his name?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
How does this Avalon Coleman file?

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
And since either all of it or a part of it to the McCarty Committee, is his personal message in that,

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
I think of what they have, sir. How long would it take?

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Well, I don't know. I hope maybe we could find out by tomorrow or something.

16:37.000 --> 16:47.000
Do you think the fact that the Madison scene, the information to the fact that Coleman had taken from the installation,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
was where he was working?

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
Party out of the secret documents, or trace the fact documents from the installation to his home.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Would that be in place of Fad as a loyalty of the document?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Or would he not?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I just can't answer that, Mr. Jenkins.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
Well, I've never just done anything like that. I don't know.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
I don't know what the line has gone. It would seem the people handling these security matters that would know.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
I would like to get somebody up here, but handle the violence and answer your question.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
That's why I ask you, but I would hand answer. I don't have any first hand knowledge, doesn't it?

17:21.000 --> 17:35.000
If it was strict, as has been charged here now, in substantiating the charge of the McCarty Committee,

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
that you did not cooperate in their investigation of the personnel of Fort Mama.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
If it was, if it were strict, are they part of the fact that,

17:47.000 --> 17:55.000
would it be your policy when such a thing occurs, and a personnel is sent to this investigating committee

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
to advise the committee that it's not the complete fact?

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
But if there has been any information from it, certain loyalty information, is that what is your policy?

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
I think the committee would understand that, Mr. Jenkins.

18:07.000 --> 18:15.000
I think they'd understand that we do not give out and cannot under existing presidential directives to give out loyal information.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
I may have a committee unrepand that.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
Mr. Secretary, Mr. Kohn charged a multiple 14th, that he had seen that fact.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
That he made the obvious note from it.

18:29.000 --> 18:41.000
If it was maintained loyalty information, then would it not have been validating the directives if you had permitted him to look at it when he's on my side?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I think it would have been, Mr. Jenkins.

18:43.000 --> 18:49.000
So there was a presidential directive covering it, it was valid, initially.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
We were all on a global board team, that's in my opinion that's correct, Mr. Jenkins.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I have no further questions.

18:58.000 --> 19:11.000
Can I ask if, in the interest of expediting this hearing, read about six lines from a report, a published report of this committee?

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Mr. Chairman, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

19:15.000 --> 19:27.000
This is a report of an open hearing of this committee, decided over by Senator McCarthy on December 8, 1953.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
I was in discussing here, co-operation, or lack of co-operation.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm really trying here to expedite the thing, if I can show some light on this.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
And I spoke the following, from Senator McCarthy.

19:41.000 --> 19:50.000
I think for the record, at this time, we should make it clear that we have been getting what I considered good co-operation from the Army.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
And all of the individual tool be questioned here, as to their alleged common effectivities.

19:55.000 --> 20:04.000
Have been individuals, have been in the signal corps for a number of years, and the Army has indicated that they are just as anxious to get to the bottom of this as we are.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Is not that correct, Mr. Colm?

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
Yes, Mr. Chairman, absolutely. That is the present administration of the Army.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Mr. Colm, that is correct.

20:16.000 --> 20:32.000
I cite this from the published record of this committee as the testimony of Senator McCarthy and Roy Colm, that as of December 8, and there are other instances that can be cited, that they were getting good co-operation from the Army.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
And I therefore don't understand what all this is about lack of co-operation.

20:37.000 --> 20:51.000
You have a point of order? Yes, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask the chair to order the Secretary to produce the letter, which they wrote to us after we caught them stripping the file, in which they gave their explanation for the stripping.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
The first letter is in existence.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Well, I knew asking the page is the Dean to submit the letter, if I can.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
I don't know the date of the Secretary would have it.

21:04.000 --> 21:11.000
I suggest that in using your time in question is that, if they gave that order, they would not have did right, just that to letter me.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
I mean, I have been there to speak to that letter.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Well, that's right, Mr. Chairman.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
Obviously, from the senator's statement that the letter is indicated in their file, why not?

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
We have a set to letter me.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
We've been trying to locate it. We do not have that letter. If I might say this, we helpful to the Secretary on this point.

21:30.000 --> 21:48.000
The fact is this, I might suggest. And I hope the Secretary will correctly, if I take an improper suggestion, that, after I made this statement to the Secretary in executive session, the Secretary and Mr. Adam, as bias does, yes, we were right.

21:48.000 --> 22:02.000
The file has been stripped of this file information, and that the accused, given was a subsequently determined that it was loyal to information, and for that reason, that stripped it from the file.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
Without telling us that there has been any deletions from the file, we say, sir, that a formal letter was written to us.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
These assignments, this evening, are all by Mr. Adam's name. So, let's all remember.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
Uh, same. This material was in the file, the personnel file, and it is not a privilege of mysterious.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
We have subsequently found that it was loyalty material.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
And we stripped it from the file. I'm sure the decision of this is a letter you received.

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
Yes, sir. Since you now know that this material was in the file, we won't show it.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Mr. Chairman, once again, we can recall your original chairman.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
Mr. Chairman, you will all talk about a letter in the file. I don't think his description of it is the equivalent of the letter itself.

22:49.000 --> 22:56.000
Well, do you think in me, if you're a special letter, the existence is perfectly fine for me, Mr. P. Neige, as I am, since we've been competing.

22:56.000 --> 23:03.000
Right? Well, you know, I'm a special letter now. Mr. Cohen, as we are, since we've been discussing this, Mr. Ricks, the family, I'm not seeing it.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
Mr. Chairman, I ask if the new reluctance to Mr. Wells to bone fairly furnished the letter.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Well, that's...

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
You've got a lot of the...

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Okay.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
By the way, Mr. Sanchez, there's been no reluctance on the part that counseled the party's the letter.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
Instead, the secretary said he didn't have the letter. I didn't give it any give the letter.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
He didn't need food. That's not the letter.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
That's worse than that.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
I understand Mr. Cohen that they've got the letter in his file.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
We don't need to munch.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
We don't have to call the secretary again.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
We don't have to answer that.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
I understand.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Mr. Chairman, may I make my position?

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Mr. Wells, of course, Mr. Reprieve, what I bet, we do not have the letter.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
We cannot locate it. I told you that if we could, we would be more than happy to have it here.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
It's only before you can't locate it.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
That we are asking the secretary and his father to produce their copy of it.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I'll create it, Mr. Shoei.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Mr. Secretary, you have heard Mr. Cohen's statements.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
Which I think Mr. Cohen, you should have put in the form of a question rather than a statement.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
His statement and I will put it in the form of a question.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Is this?

24:11.000 --> 24:20.000
Do you recall telling Mr. Cohen or anyone on his committee that a fast personnel file on Abraham Cohen?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Where is in fact strict?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I do not.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
And the reason it was strict was because the deletions were out of loyalty nature.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
I do not recall.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Very well.

24:31.000 --> 24:43.000
Mr. Secretary, did you write in letters to the McCarthy Investigating Committee with respect to the personnel file of Abraham Cohen?

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
And particularly with reference to any reason why certain information was deleted from?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Was such a matter written to you?

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
Mr. Cohen indicates that there was such a lawyer written to you by me or Mr. Adams.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Frankly, I can understand why he can't file his own file.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I know when I did that.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
I think you've been this code most in the plenty of art.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
I'm asking you Mr. Secretary of whether or not I'm out of it.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
In the kind his statements, Secretary, you understand that.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
I think you write such a letter to the McCarthy Investigating Committee.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't remember how he'd done so, but I want to say to you, Mr. Jenkins,

25:22.000 --> 25:29.000
that whatever papers documents, anything that is in the Department of Army that will help get the truth out here in the table,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
it's yours for the end.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
I'm sure it's the number of you that millions of them over there and that won't appear in the picture.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
How is it if we can't?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
We'll start on the first and that one on the other side.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
We'll do that next year, Mr. Secretary.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Now your statement is that you have no recollection of writing such a letter.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I first made all the fall having done so.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
I might have done so.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
All right.

25:51.000 --> 26:00.000
Do you know whether or not Mr. Adams or anyone under your command wrote such a letter explaining the demissions from the A.R. and Coleman personnel fact?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I sell my debts for what Mr. Collins said.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
You assume that Mr. Adams did to me?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
No, I assume somebody did.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
Now Mr. J, I will ask you to please in cooperation with Mr. Well-Chem, Mr. St. Clair.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
Examine again your files when you go back to the synagogue after this hearing.

26:19.000 --> 26:31.000
And determine whether or not you have any copy of any letter written to the Matata committee explaining the deletions from the Coleman personnel file.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
We'll do that.

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
And if you do, and find any member and the hard copy of a letter, reduce it in the morning.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Yes.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I have asked for that subject sufficient.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
As far as the tripping of the file since the Jenkins, I will certainly wait until the copy of that letter has been prepared.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
No, I don't care.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
No questions.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Senator McIntyne?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
No questions.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Any comments on the right?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Senator Jamelette?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
No, I'm all in.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Any comments on the right?

26:58.000 --> 27:07.000
First of all, I'm going to be on these 35 Jesus, which are in a standard now pending before the while of review.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
We're going to be here a long time just on these KVU.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
I assure you, Senator, that we're not going to be if I have anything to do with it.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
We are permitted to go in the one key solely.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
And that is more detailed than I had anticipated.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
And from now on, I serve no.

27:28.000 --> 27:39.000
That I'm going to object to going into the maze of a single other one of the 35 suspended employees of Fort Mama.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
That is my position and will remain so until this committee overuse me.

27:45.000 --> 27:59.000
Now, in connection with the request made a moment ago, about the buying letter and other information in connection with the elect stripping of this file,

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I think there ought to be a complete statement.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
The Mississippi Committee, what you mean by stripping, I would like to know whether there was an intention to...

28:08.000 --> 28:18.000
to Miss Lee, Senator McCarthy and Mr. Call, by removing an arousal plan destiny,

28:18.000 --> 28:28.000
the material relating to Mr. Kool, as to the elimination of these documents,

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
I mean as to the removing of certain documents to his full.

28:33.000 --> 28:45.000
I would also like to ask the witness at this time, if he knows what was done with this material that was taken from the file,

28:45.000 --> 28:55.000
was it turned over or was it kept at Fort Mama's door, was it turned over to GQ, or what happened to it?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I don't know, a fun outweigh.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
I think there ought to be a complete statement. The word strict is used here, and I want to know, as one member of the committee,

29:03.000 --> 29:12.000
whether or not the details there was an attempt to Miss Lee, the committee or, and whether or not it was secreted away some place,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
this material taken from the file.

29:15.000 --> 29:23.000
I would also like an opinion from legal counsel, whether the material removed from the file,

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
considered to be material within the executive order, I'd like a legal opinion on that,

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
that's what all this time is being taken upon, I guess.

29:32.000 --> 29:39.000
And I'd like to know whether or not that material that was removed from the file came within the executive order.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
If it is, I assume Mr. Chairman, that it shouldn't have been in the personnel file,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
and it should have been in the lawyer file.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
I think the lawyer's not in the form, you would like to have that legal opinion.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
The legal opinion ought to come from the Army and be submitted to the Council of Art Committee.

29:58.000 --> 30:05.000
I would like to have a copy of the directives, relied upon by the secretary,

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
by the committee, the introduction of lawyer of the information.

30:09.000 --> 30:18.000
I would like to have a copy, certified or full to set, of the lawyer of the information itself,

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
allegedly scripted from the personnel file of Ayrn Cole.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
And I'd also like to know when, there's been a lot of talk here and it's so much going on and on,

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
it's so hard to follow this, I would like to know when,

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
these documents were removed by Mr. Coleman to his vote.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
The documents that were supposed to be, I'll be quite surprised by the nature,

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
whether he removed recently or wasn't long time ago, I can't tell.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
From all of the stuff that was included in the scripted material of the committee.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm in total that it was 1946.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
I can't recall a day and death under the Jackson,

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
but we will certainly include that information in our, in our statements.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
And may I have a three hour hour to fly up right now?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Would I keep the register?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Just to clarify the record, I can't.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
You did it.

31:14.000 --> 31:23.000
Mr. J. Vincent is ready to direct his statement by Mr. Cole from the second session of October 14th.

31:24.000 --> 31:34.000
What did you require me, if you were in that time, to give a reading for a day before the whole of the material

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
that's to be involved in information from Mr. Aaron Coleman's file?

31:40.000 --> 31:48.000
The statement is made by Mr. Coleman in the practice of office matter.

31:49.000 --> 31:56.000
I find no response in the transcript from you to leave this full question up in the air

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
and I would like to know when you supply this information while they're not.

32:00.000 --> 32:08.000
You did give an answer at that time in response to the question that Mr. Cole has put to the list,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I guess, or a meeting to the committee.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Mr. Chairman, do you okay with that?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I have the key to the whole thing.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
The letter has been found.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
The one that Mr. Cole can't find in his files.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The sign of this register has been identified.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I'd love to see it going after it.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Not that one's the whole thing.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
So, it's expected that we'll all be ashamed of the time we know of the interdue.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
As this, there is just a whisper.
