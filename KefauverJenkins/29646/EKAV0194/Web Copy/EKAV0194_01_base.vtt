00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Another pilot for staying up until midnight, did you know?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Now it's going to be 27.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
We'll find that time gets my black mark on this booney chart,

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
but if he was on pass until 10th of late,

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
the other drafts he'd get the weightlark,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
even though he was out for real midnight.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Now one of the honest chart we should block that end to until late,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
and I think this is a great waste of time,

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
and I wonder how much money has been spent on these booney charts

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
as long as they're presented.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Obviously, for the purpose of getting them on the television screen,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
it's a great default impression.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
But there's something wrong about staying up until level of fire,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
another private thing up until midnight,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I think we must fill in the chart.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Now let's go on a set for the information, you know?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
On the 24th, we find a black,

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
and we should put this up here so we can see it.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
We find a complete black mark for Cheyenne,

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
because on pass at 11.30 a.m. for just a week in per company topic.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
We find a garbage per private,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
but that's a very bright mark for being on the phone weekend pass.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Let's block that end also.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
And when we give them a black mark,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
you can sign it with the black mark if they have a different price.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Then, what do we have?

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Only 19.00 a black mark against all the Cheyenne,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
because he was on pass.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
For a 440 per company,

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
a white mark for the other part.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Now, one of the honest about this and that of a 40 chart,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
we've a lot of talk about 40 pictures here.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
I think we should block in the other part of the screen as Cheyenne, right?

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Does that make sense for the third track, you know?

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
For some of that, I've got to see that job that you're mocking there

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
about 10 minutes ago, so that I'd rather not comment on that.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Let me know when you come over here, those black and Cheyenne.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I have a copy of this here.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I'll read you a little bit about it.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Just give me my shirt and make me one of those.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Here you'll find that world is areas,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
but you have no black in the world, right?

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Travis Cheyenne got a black mark for doing exactly the frame.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
The other part of it, I mean, you're a command there, does that correct?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yes.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Well, you agree with me that that makes this a completely dishonest and a pony track?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
No.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
No sir, I don't think anything that's been put out from the army is dishonest.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Will it be useful by the army?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Who put it out?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
You know General?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I don't like to have,

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
I've referred to some wire who's running here at the army.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I think that's unfair to the army.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
General, I think I represent the army of much of anyone that's ruined us.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Now, this will not put up for the army general, so I'll find out what it is.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Yes sir, I think it was.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
You know what I'm talking about?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I suppose that the council which represented the army,

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
prepared this from documentary evidence, which is a myth to them.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
I know, but the whole norm, and this is a black and then for a private shine

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
and a white from the normal trainee, I don't know why that differentiation was made.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I said, you're both black.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Maybe I can tell you why I don't know.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
If this is a pony attack,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
to defeat the people watching in television, putting up their charts,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
showing everything black on the shown chart, and showing a white,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm there with 20, let's black it in.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Let's black it in, where the average trainee got castles that's blacked in

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
until the television audience can see what our friends here,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
and they don't represent the army I've been doing.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
But then the third of the Toronto citizens, let's vote for it.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
On the 25th and 23th, the average part of it, on pass all day,

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
more black marks there, but a black out for shine because he was on pass all day.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
If you want to create this right picture, I'm gonna flash this down,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
unless we're not, is my track down here?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
They will vote on pass, yes.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And they should say, if shine is to be blacked out for being on pass,

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
then the other part should be blacked out for being on pass.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Yes, if you're telling your job.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I know, let's get on to the old 33rd.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Thanks.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Oh, the average part of it, absence on pass at 11.30,

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
get the white mark, part of it, because they stayed 15 minutes longer on the post.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Didn't believe until 11.45, get say, black marks.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Now, a time of getting a black mark, believing 50 minutes late,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
staying on the post 15 minutes longer, the average part of it will get a black mark there too, right?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
What's black out here?

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
Well, if we went out of there, we had a local rule there that a train agency leaves on pass

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
either Christmas or New Year's,

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
private shine was absent on post vacations.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Well, then, then for the full, one of the involved in fact to be,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
you're not be blacked in the fabric, right?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Look it up.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
I think the child indicates that private shine was absent on both weekend

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
and the normal time they was only absent on one weekend.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I think you make a good point here of them.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
One of these did not have to work yet.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
The front of his family was fired.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Let's continue with any further questions?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Yes, a few other questions.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Can you come in?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Try to run the clock again.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
The whole group of people is general to clear up these charts.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Now they're still keen with a chart,

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
which is at the top of it from the private G David Church.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
There's that chart from accurate records

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
of the absent suits and telephone messages to the commanding general.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
As far as I know that, yes sir.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
A view of examining the chart, yes sir.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
And it does accurately reflect what it supports to reflect.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
And I'll ask the games to look at the other chart,

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
which is entitled,

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
fiscal, override, absences of an average trainee.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I should say it is, yes.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Can you have examined that?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yes sir.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
Did you have anything to do with the blacking year of the dates of the first chart?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Most of the time I didn't.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I didn't make that.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I didn't make that.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I didn't make that.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I didn't make that.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
I didn't make that.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Most of the time I didn't.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I didn't make that decision.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It would be prepared.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
And there were a few errors in it.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
It was for a fix in this form.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
And those corrections were made as far as hours were concerned.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
But the last chart I didn't see until this morning.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
General, for other people,

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
the elected community case might be maintained by this chart and the last chart.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
And you are invited to the elected group to clear those meetings.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
So there was one chart indicating the absence of a carbon shine.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
And another chart indicating the absence of a normal training.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
And both types of cases did not see until this morning.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
The chart that indicates the absence of carbon shine in this fall,

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
I did see, with the last chart I had not seen until this morning.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
And the way you saw the chart with the information there,

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
there was a blackout and the white face chart to say,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
you said it's very good.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I saw the chart on private shines,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
but not the chart on the average training.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Okay.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
You have questions about these two full calls,

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
General and our scheme is there's anything on you.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
About the practice.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
Making as many as 250 long-distance telephone calls

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
during your eight week basic training period.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
I should say that that was quite a large number of telephone calls

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
for any private to make.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
But if he wanted to make those calls on a spare time,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
and he had the money to pay for them,

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't see any reason why he couldn't make them.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I don't think that there's ever been a five-minute four fix.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I think that about 250,000 go through there,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
from 1947, to the several folks that reckon

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
that the private shine apparently made.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Is there anything on you, you, about a private,

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
in the army calling you girlfriends

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
as many as four times on one day,

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
both during duty hours and off duty?

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Well, I don't know what I think about five-and-chine private life,

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
whether they simply call with girl friends or informers or who they were.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
But I suppose that depends upon the individual.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
How many times you call your girl up on the day?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Do you keep a record down with Fred Dixon,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
all the phone calls, all the drivers in the army make you know?

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
No sir, I'm wondering how we can determine how many phone calls

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
this private makes, whether they're calling you girlfriend or his mother or...

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
We tried to superior the telephone call that's four-six,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
the connection with our Inspector General's investigation,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
but we weren't able to get it.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Instead, the Inspector General couldn't superior phone call.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
He had the call at Marshall, someone in order to get the phone call.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
We didn't see we had special evidence of the call at Marshall,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
so we didn't get the phone call at four-six.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Thank you for that additional testimony indicating the importance of congressional investigation

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
and investigating committees, which is depending almost anything.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
We don't always get it, but we have, and the opinion is very dear.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
This may not be a proper question, General,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
and if it isn't, by no answer,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
that we've popped all around and Inspector General was the point today,

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
but nobody has asked the question which may not be appropriate to ask in that connection.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
But I think we said it was a 619-page report,

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
and I'm not sure what he said you had read it or not,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
he did say you had not made your decision on it,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
but it seems to me that if you have read it,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
and if you know what's in it, maybe you could tell us whether or not

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
private sign did get proper initial treatment by virtue of the fact he misused

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
for past provisions with the grandadium.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Anything that has committed to the committee's banquet,

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
we share, has not read it, and if it's not an appropriate question, I don't want to ask it.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
But if it is, we've talked all around it,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
we've talked about the fact that he had 12 happens,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
that they were allegedly on committee business,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
if he had affected General Mason investigation,

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
but he made a report, so I think he would be quick enough to find out whether or not

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
the Inspector General would be determined as he was over that investigation,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
and if he had a private sign, why would it?

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
In fact, not using his cash privileges for a committee business,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
but he alleged that he was so doing.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
As I stated before, we have no information that private sign uses

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
his cash privileges for other than official business.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
By we, you include your information?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
No further questions.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I can follow the next senator asks questions,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
and while we have the opportunity, I return to our studio because the country

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
to permit our station to identify themselves.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
This is ABC Telegram Network.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
For outstanding comedy and drama,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
tonight's Channel 7, at 9 Danny Thomas,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
who don't happen in the kids just like any other daddy,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
stars in the lipstick and tail on Make Room for Daddy.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
If you furnish access information,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
as far as we were able to get,

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
now will you tell us where in these charts are this on it?

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't see anything dishonest at all about them.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Senator, I think that all I am fresh for more than here

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
are statements that the police and dishonors will do not reflect the truth.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
A lot of you are so bad.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
You have the basic information.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
Do they reflect the truth or are they an accurate in misleading?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
No, I say that they reflect the truth

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
that they're not inaccurate in misleading,

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
and the only difference is that they reflect in the fact that they're

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
the private shine and they have reflect in the fact that they're

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
depending to the normal private.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
General, will you be able to and will you face the charts?

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Face phone number, first more information you have

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
is the man who got both.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
The high doctorate,

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
and they get a change in the charts that you think are necessary

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
to make them for three different and more active

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
information in respect to the West Bank.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
I would be very happy to Senator.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
I agree with Senator McCarthy that surely some of these

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
men that we have make telephone calls,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
which they have headed on by the shine chart here.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I think anyone would agree to that.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
And as far as I am concerned,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
if they want to black in,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
the part indicating the period that the ordinary trainee

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
spends on pass, I'm sure that nobody in the

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
army ties with the check for that.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
So, it's general, the whole purpose of the bill.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
If this committee is being imposed on by this

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
on a chart, but it's calculated to misread and deceive,

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
either this committee is American people or anyone else,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I want to find it out.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
That instance is here before the committee.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
That this committee has been imposed upon by these charts.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
I know of no one who knows more about the facts than you.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
The B charts are dishonest,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
if they are phonics, if they are inactive, if they are accepted.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I ask you to correct them.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
The committee is in that corrected form for it to reflect the truth

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
as you know it to be.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Are you willing to do that?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I'll be very willing to do that.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
All right, that's all.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Mr. Newton.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
So, general, right, I exposed the telephone installation

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
at CAMP the XIVH,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
here's a signal-core installation.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Those are, say, five of the installations run by the

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
bell telephone company.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Now, Dennis, how did the youngsters in CAMP telephone

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
receive calls? Are these on, uh,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
so-called, uh, pay-facings facility?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Pay-facings facility, yes.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Are they monitored so that you would know whether private

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Jones makes some of the calls or private students,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
so many of you received so many?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
You wouldn't have that.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
No, sir, what not?

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
So, you wouldn't have any way of comparing whether the number of

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
calls that time made the greater than, perhaps, some other boys

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
in CAMP, you think?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
No, sir, what not?

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
No, the rest of it, of course, is only a gratuitous observation

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
because when I landed in the Army way back in 1918,

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
I know that my bunk buddy was making an important

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
that number of telephone calls,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
but I discovered later why,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
because he was the right president of the manufacturing company.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
And, uh, every day, he either gets white for his

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
subordinates or calling up, or he was calling and giving some

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
directions.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
In connection with business interests and where I may have made

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
one call in a week, the chances are he may have been making a

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
hundred, so I suppose, uh, to get an extra picture of the matter

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
he would have to know what to hold back down to.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Yes, each individual would present a separate payback.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Excuse me.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Any objections?

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Uh, General, just one point that you made the distinction of

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
reference to the phone call from the chart.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Uh, the phone call will put on fire, the chimes, uh,

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
fire, the chimes chart, referred to what kind of call, General.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
Very fair to the, uh, incoming calls from members of the committee.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
To you, to my headquarters with the French Minister of Regimental Headquarters,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
and then relate to private time.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
How many calls was every, uh, five of it?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Do you get from the average private to you?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I don't get any.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
This is the only case that I've ever had any.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Well, the five of these phone calls from the charter concern

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
relate specifically to the unusual nature of the cloud to you or to your aid.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Yes, sir.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And the pilot?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I have no words with this gentleman.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Other than that, other of the fact that I'm wealthy,

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
because the General Ryan, the biower, has to work.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
You come out again, I'm like the General Ryan's to me.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You like that?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Uh, Sunday's time, you think?

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
General Ryan, this is a quasi-judicial body as I understand it during these hearings.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
I'd like to ask a couple of questions.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
Do you know who prepared these charts?

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
These charts were prepared as I understand it by the Council for the Army,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
based on information that we found.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
And the original charts was made sometime back on private time.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
There was respect to us, and there were a few discrepancies that we directed and sent back.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
Well, in its marches, the charts were prepared for public display.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
And in the minds of the average American black is supposed to be negative and white is positive.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
And in its marches, the Army has made these charges for prospective private shine.

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
Don't you think it might have been more fair to have put the black on the average and the white on private shine?

19:09.000 --> 19:17.000
I don't know what the motive was, but it looked to me as though all of us will agree that they both could have been black.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Yes.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
No further questions?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Sorry to rush back.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Mr. Welk and Mr. Schumfeld.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
I have one question, Mr. Schum.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
General was due to ceremony start for a private key day of the shine.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
I don't know if there is any reference in that chart for many telephone calls,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
other than telephone calls to the committee.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Go ahead.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
So that if it has been asserted here that this chart reflects telephone calls to girlfriends,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
that as it is, the person is not correct.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Yes, correct.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
No further.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I know that.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
General, I think maybe you might want to correct one very slight mistake in your testimony,

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
which I know is in a book and I'm sure of that, because I've got complete respect for your relative.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
You said that all of this information was known to you.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
I know that from this chart we have called from Carter to Adam.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
That information obviously was supplied by someone else, I think we should have the record corrected.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Yes, I have no information on that.

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
But one minimum is chart, again it was very important.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I think this is very important.

20:37.000 --> 20:47.000
This short of what you might as being tried to force from 20 million people,

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
there is no possible guilt in my mind as the racing for putting this chart in China,

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
leaving it here on the eve of our morning, because it could be part of that,

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
so the televised audience could see it, then all they talked was completely right,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
showing the average price.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
I think it's one of the most different on it.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Job, no.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
The temperature is sufficient, I'll never clean, but like all of the intensity,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
the temperature is sufficient.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
There is something that's fair, but it's not just lacking in the average product,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
instead of giving him a white mark where you get sign of black mark,

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
if you may, on the frame on time chart, on Friday,

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
the person January is on path all the way to get the black mark for that right here.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
The average product gets the white mark, but on the flame in the seconds,

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
sign a black mark for a path all the unsaturday the average product,

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
a white mark, sign a black mark because he was 10th for it on the sixteenth,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
his camp's working, and the answer is something general.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
And no reason why a pilot should get a black mark from being 10th for it,

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
from one to the sixth and another, there was no fault his last mark was there.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
So I think we would agree that when you put a chart up on a television screen,

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
starting, getting a black mark from being 10th for it,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
from one of those frames and at least the people watching us,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
is that only confirmed?

22:24.000 --> 22:31.000
Then it looks to me as though the person who prepared these charts wanted to make one different from the others,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
on a TV, but by a comparison,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
by the person who did well the other way,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
they certainly did another pro cover outside of the pro cover right here.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
The clock in on the 10th,

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
it happened to a midnight for the average pilot,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
a white mark, sign a black mark,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
sign a black mark,

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
so no reason why sign a black mark for coming home in our early hours there.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
May I go?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
No sir.

23:01.000 --> 23:13.000
We see twenty-first, we find the sign is playing because it's basic training for K company stars.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
That doesn't black in it.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Just to do a lot of testing.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
And we find out for what are the eight of these tomatoes,

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
many things filled in because sign says we do the utestifier that he made up,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
and he keeps he do the emit,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
so he doesn't make up that K-T-duty,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
he went to the telephone exchange after he left my office

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
to put in many telephone calls that they should have gone back to K-T.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
Otherwise, he does not make up the K-T you off on the fine side.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
All right, the one final point,

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
and I think maybe now we can see the design of the original chart.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to applaud before the committee,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
and for the annuals,

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
the men who have prepared the completely substantive chart,

24:06.000 --> 24:14.000
giving shyness black mark for getting the passes with the average pilot's guts and giving him a white mark.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
And I think some of the findings will make a good point of that.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
Now, Mr. General, just one final question we agree that

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
Private Shrine got many more passes than the average trainee.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
Yes, do you think that it is any special privilege for a pilot to be allowed to work

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
after his training is over,

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
work on the work of a committee with an ex-bozine communist,

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
or the other private who is used to go to the movies,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
they can go up to the North La Caire.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
There was just no special consideration for the private.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Senator, this wasn't very unusual for me because I had just returned from Korea

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
where we were seven days a week,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
sometimes 16 and 18 hours a day.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
We had no weekend, Saturday, Sunday, holiday,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
or any of the new,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
we're fall day every day.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
And the professional core of the army today doesn't take weekends off.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
So you would have proved them.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I didn't question that slightest bit.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
In other words, you would have proved the private working weekend,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
working evening, no objection to that.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Do you say you've worked seven days a week,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
much more than 12 hours?

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
You've got no objection to giving this pilot the permission to work

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
when he's training with over.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yes, sir.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
He was doing work for the committee, I certainly think that it was all right.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Thank you very much, Senator.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Hello?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Senator, are you completed?

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I have no further questions.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Anybody ready for the questions?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Anybody else?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Mr. Wilson?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Mr. Wilson, you are included?

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
I'm afraid I'll have one more question, General,

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
if you will look at that chart that has now been marked up by Mr. Giuliano.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
Will you observe that Christmas has been blacked out as well as New Year's?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Is that correct?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
The Northern Order is trained to eat out.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Just a moment, please, General.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
It is, it is correct.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
It is not that Mr. Giuliano has blacked out Christmas and New Year's.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Yes, he does.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
And if it's a sign on that chart, right in front of anyone who would mark it,

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
is the effect that the trainees are authorized, either Christmas or New Year's passes,

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
but not gold.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
That's correct.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yes, sir.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
So that private shines, is trained to pass on Christmas and on New Year's.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
That's correct.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Yes, sir.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
And an ordinary pilot would not have.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Yes.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
If you have black, that chart is somewhat misleading, isn't it?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Yes, sir.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
That respected it.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
That is the one on the other side.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
That's correct.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
You can pretty much use another example of...

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And I'm not sure if you have any.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Here's another example of attempting to testify.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
When the General pointed out to me, Mr. Giuliano was blacking him,

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
both football and New Year's, he pointed out that one should not be blacked out.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That was made very, very clear.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
The interesting part was sitting there, he knew that.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
And I think we should try and stick to some rule that you'll follow in the course.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Let me ask you this, General.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Seeing us and brought up.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I don't have any idea what your answer will be.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
Is it true that some trainees get more Christmas and New Year's,

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
they will wear some trainees that they get both Christmas and New Year's.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Okay, thank you.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Some trainees are out of time.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Very few, yes.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Thank you very much.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
I believe that we have concluded with General Ryan, you auditioned.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I'm sorry, I might like that one more.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I'm sorry, because I have to ask questions after the other table,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
if I'm not pressed, if you're fine.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Everybody conclude it is any moment to consult.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Anybody from my right?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Anybody from my left?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Okay, Mr. Giuliano.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
Would you tell us, General Ryan, under what circumstances they filed about

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
to frame me as what this would get both Christmas and New Year's,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
all under the words of the circumstances?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Thank you.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
A further question?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I trust to make a fairer now, however.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I don't think you was General Ryan.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
I think you were General Ryan.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I think you were General Ryan.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Thank you for coming.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
You've done a very first right Christmas.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Up until now, I trust the General Beasley's Christmas are mostly here.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Explicit witness, but I think you're running a close parallel out in General's

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
make-it witness.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Thank you, sir.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Does it hurt about your dismiss?

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a request for the fairer now.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
I hope this can be done immediately as possible.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
We have to, without interrupting the hearing support.

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
We have now a lot of periods to, I don't think I'd be coming on it.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
We've got millions of people looking at these charts,

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
but we have a lot of periods to, then, a deliberate attempt to mislead.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
A white chart showing the average private, one with signs,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
and black stuff.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I think we should find out, Mr. Chairman.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
I think the fact should be instructed to be looked at investigation.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
Find out who is responsible for this attempt to deflection.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
Find out how much it costs, food paid for,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
file all these, for the start, how many have been put out,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
how many generals, how many colonels,

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
how many private have been working on this project and under whom's order.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
The councilor rises me, he will explore that and try to determine the information during the new hour

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
if he weather a witness to be available.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
This time we'll call the next witness for the Army side of the case.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
The Chairman would like to call him, Chairman John Beath.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
General Brown.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
He's calling the councilor to touch the money we're about to give,

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
and just use the whole suit and nothing but the suit for helping judge.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
I don't know.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Maybe she did.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Mr. Pervant, you may begin the interrogation, right?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
State your name, please.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
My name is John Beath.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Brown.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You are a First Lieutenant-Chimbers.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
That's correct.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Where are you, State?

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
I'm stationed at Fort Texan Jersey.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
And what does it use to be there?

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
My duty is to perform the duty that the age you can't for the commanding general, General Ryan.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
And how long have you been ageing General Ryan?

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
I've been General Ryan's age September 9, 1952.

30:34.000 --> 30:41.000
And you were the General's age in November of 1953?

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
That's correct, sir.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
When did you first learn that private duty,

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
that's right with these assigned to Fort Texan?

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
On November 3, 1953.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
And were you informed by General Ryan?

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
Yes, sir, by General Ryan, and also I was present at a luncheon with Secretary Stevens,

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
when he referred to private chants.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
When this private chants were reported to Fort Texan,

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
if you know, on September, 1953.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
What were you?
