00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I was first contacted on 12 November 1953 by Mr. Levinion.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
At that time were you familiar with the fact that Secretary Stevens had given certain instructions

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
or weapons to pass these four private chains?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Yes, sir, I was.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I was completely informed by General Ryan of Secretary Stevens' power.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
The work was for Secretary Stevens' first contact with a member of the McCarthy Committee.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Mr. Levinion called me and introduced himself on the phone.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
I had never met Mr. Levinion and he explained the circumstances about a tax.

00:41.000 --> 00:50.000
They'd like to get a tax of private chains for the weekend of 15, 14 and 15 November

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
for the purpose of private chain performing subcommittee business working at the 25th.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
And in 2016, when the first call, did you receive many or few calls from members of the McCarthy Committee

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
which reference to message the private chain?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I see very many calls.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
Can you tell us how many calls you will receive which reference to private chains?

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
With reference to private chains, as well as the best of my memory and records,

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
I would say that there are an excess of 25 calls with reference to private chains.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
To whom did you talk on the committee?

01:35.000 --> 01:47.000
I spoke with Mr. Cone, Mr. Levinion, Mr. Anastas, Mr. Giuliano, and some of the Secretary and Senator McCarthy's office.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
In all of those calls, take its work directly to the confirmation of security,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
passes or absence, there's no report for private chains.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, no sir, that's not exactly correct.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Some of them were called for information regarding private chain status at 4th day.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
Some of them were complained about private chain, what was happening at the private chain.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
You are of course of your beauty there as aid to the commanding general.

02:20.000 --> 02:30.000
Have you ever received calls in your capacity as an aid to the general with reference to a cleaning passage

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
or any type of commutual treatment for a private or a chaine?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Yes sir, once in a while in my capacity as aid to commanding general,

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
I get a mother of one of the training done at home, and she's interested in seeing that justice is done as far as her voice concerned.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.000
She wants to either get home over a weekend when her other son was been in Korea for say a year or a year or a year for a year,

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
wants to get them both home at the same time, and several calls like that may ensue back and forth.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
We also get calls from mothers who tell me all about the qualifications of their boy.

03:10.000 --> 03:18.000
They say my boy wants to call it, and he has a degree, and he's a fine boy, and we'd like very much to have him put in the engineering field.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
It has a very professional field, and I take all that information down and I say,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
we'll let you know what we can do.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
These calls, if you'd get referred to the day fee, isolated calls,

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
yes sir, I would say there would be isolated, there would be most instances of no degree of persistency on the part of the mother or father.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
They would let me know what they want us, and that would be about it.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
That would follow up to a great degree.

03:48.000 --> 04:04.000
And any of the calls from any members of the McCarthy Committee staff was any abusive or angrily used or implied by any member of the McCarthy Committee directly to a view,

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
and it's told to us that who was on the other end of the land and the date and circumstances of the call.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
The abusive language is very loose of terms.

04:18.000 --> 04:29.000
As far as I can recall, there were no swear words used in my conversations with any of the members of the subcommittee staff.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Several times Mr. Cohen got extremely angry at what was going on.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
As far as Dix, he didn't think things were being handled properly, and he let me know in no uncertain terms.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
Now would you say there's clearly as he can with him, to a very big, destroyed premise of Cohen?

04:47.000 --> 04:57.000
When you say he let you know in no uncertain terms that he was on the topic with the situation that four dates.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
And one occasion he said that the army was reneging on our agreement.

05:03.000 --> 05:14.000
He as General Ryan related on the 9th of January, he talked about choosing officers at four dates.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Okay.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Here, let's make that work.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
You, by Mr. Cohen and me and the officers, switching the further.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Now relate to Houston on the 9th of January.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
And approximately four o'clock, 430 in the afternoon of 9th January, I returned to my quarters.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
And my wife told me that I had a phone call from Mr. Cohen in New York City, and what I please call him back.

05:42.000 --> 05:56.000
I call Mr. Cohen back, and we got into a discussion, which later turned into an argument about private-chime being on K.P. on 10th January.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
We discussed the various of the terminology used in the agreement that we had.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
I told Mr. Cohen that the decision to put private-chime on K.P. had been made by the regimental commander.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
And that the division commander, General Ryan, was completely cognizant of that fact.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
I told Mr. Cohen that we considered K.P. part of the private-chime training.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
And as far as we were concerned, he was not going to get off K.P. on 10th January.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Persuaded to that, Mr. Cohen didn't agree with me, by the way.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
Persuaded to that, he said that some people in 46 had been very cooperative.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
But that's General Wingo and Lieutenant Miller had made things especially difficult for private-chime.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
And that he, Mr. Cohen, had a very long memory and was never going to get their names.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
And that's why he was so close to being named the President of the North Bill North.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
That's right.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
General Earl El Rea, several ING, L-E-R.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Thank you.

07:00.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, was that the only attention in which Mr. Cohen expressed his satisfaction with the way things were going from Mr. Prof. Chen?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
No, sir.

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
On the 16th of December, Mr. Cohen arrived that 46 came to my office to meet private-chime.

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
And at that time, that was stopped until the time when General Ryan told private-chime that there will be no more weeknight passes.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And from that time on, the members of the committee, if they wish to confer with private-chime,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
would have to come to Fort Dick to confer with him.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
And following that on several occasions, members of the committee staff did come to Fort Dick.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
And subsequent, prior to the 16th of December, they came on the 14th, the 15th, and Cohen came on the 16th.

07:52.000 --> 08:03.000
And it's Cohen said to me at that time that he was an angry or anything. He just said to me and he complained that coming down here to Fort Dick's all the time,

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
was killing me and the members of the staff, because I can't do it all the time, and it's just physically killing me.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
That was on one occasion that he complained.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
And another occasion that he complained was on Fort January, when he called me at my office.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
And he wanted to know why private-chime was being investigated.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And I told him that private-chime was being...

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Yes, sir, it was.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You were here.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
He wanted to know why private-chime was being investigated.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
And his opinion there was that no investigation was warranted.

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
And I said that the investigation, again, I told him that the investigation was conducted by the regimental commander.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
And that the general Ryan knew about it, and that the private-chime would be interrogated in the normal force of an investigation.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
That was the other time he came away.

09:03.000 --> 09:12.000
Have you related all of the conversation you had with Mr. Coleman concerning the particular safety that I mentioned?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
In the fires I can recall, yes, sir.

09:14.000 --> 09:23.000
Lieutenant, are you familiar with the two charts that have already been introduced as excited to the testimony of General Ryan?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Yes, sir, I am. I'm more familiar with this chart.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
Now you're holding up the chart labeled private-chime.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Yes, sir.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
I'm not familiar with this chart. Then I am with this chart.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I do not find the last chart.

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
This chart is entitled to authorize absences of an average training undergoing training cycle a lot of time to complete a 47th Infraredment for Techno-Jeris.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
And direct yourself to the first chart that is the one labeled private-chime.

09:54.000 --> 10:02.000
And tell me if you are familiar with the facts reflected on the chart?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Yes, sir. I'm familiar with the facts in that chart.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
Now is that chart an active, authentic reflection of what it supports your representative?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Yes, sir.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
And you know that of your own personal knowledge?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Most of it is of my own personal knowledge.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
There are several things I have yet, but I don't know of my own personal knowledge.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
One is the temporary duty in New York. I was told that he had temporary duty in New York.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
And that's also the China inducted on the third number. I was told I wasn't actually present.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
I left for the period prior to the arrival of the pediatrician.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
Now look at the other chart. The second chart that you held up.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
And I'll ask you if you are familiar with the facts contained on that chart?

10:49.000 --> 10:57.000
I am familiar with it in the sense that I know the procedures that we follow as far as the average trainee is concerned.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
I know about the average number of passes that he was, that the average trainee would receive.

11:02.000 --> 11:14.000
Is that an active, truthful, reflection of what an average trainee receives in a way of passes that forth gets?

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Yes, sir. As far as I know, yes, sir.

11:17.000 --> 11:34.000
Do you know why the dates in which private China was all for pass was marked in black and by the dates in which an average trainee was on pass was not marked in black?

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
No, sir. I do not. You had nothing to do with the preparation, the physical preparation of the chart.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
Sir, I've been giving you the problem on the information.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
If you want to get the physical preparation, so we're cancel with reference to the preparation of these charts.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Only if you provide the information to turn on the charts.

11:58.000 --> 12:08.000
Is there anything in your guess on it or you're just leading with reference to either these charts, the terms?

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't think so, sir.

12:11.000 --> 12:18.000
Sir, I have no questions. I'm in the car. I'm absolutely going to pick the list and direct.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
The literary blog, I mean, it just actually is. How far did it from the 40s to the York City by far?

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I would say approximately 80 miles from 80 miles.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yes, sir.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
And what about air service from the flyer airport base, which I understand is next to 40s?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Yes.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Are there commercial planes that fly in there? No, sir. That's correct.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
I know. All Army transportation. Yes, sir.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Where is the closest airfield for commercial planes?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
To the doctor.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
And how long would it be by car down the Philadelphia?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Approximately an hour and 25 minutes, sir.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Well, the armistice post-NN of the York City. Yes, sir.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
Well, the only reason for the question here is that if staff members of the committee just go up to New York,

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
whether it was convenience for them to drop off from armor to then go on their journey,

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
whether these were special trips that were made from Washington up or from New York down the 40s.

13:09.000 --> 13:16.000
I just assume, of course, that this may have been a convenience in a mediary place

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
that they could catch in the stride and then go on in New York to come back to Washington either way.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I don't know, sir.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I see.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Mr. Chairman, could I interrupt with an inquiry about a weapon?

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Mr. Jenkins informed me last night that he wanted Colonel Ballu available.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
I was informed this morning that he was somewhat ill,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
but that he probably could come, Mr. Jenkins.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
It's given about an hour's notice.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I mention it as we open this morning.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
If you desire Colonel Ballu at any time within the next two or three hours,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I would appreciate knowing if they can be telephones.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
The consular size is a chair that we probably would be getting to Colonel Ballu around three o'clock.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
I will see that he telephones to now.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
30,000 meters of traction before it, and I'll see you in a little while.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Sure.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
It's one of the most interesting connections of Lieutenant Nador.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I'll let us return to our studio at the Culls.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
The Culls are in committee, but our station has a telegram product.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
So I'll contact you if you'll return.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
This is ABC Television Network.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Mr. Nassus, Mr. Giuliano.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Mr. Lavinia.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
And members of the Office staff.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
I'll contact the Senator McCompton.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Well, all of those calls friendly, whether any, any angry words you've...

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
No, sir, other than Mr. Cohn, most of them are very...

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
And in case Mr. Cohn had only on his incident of January 9th.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yes, sir.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Was there any other time?

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
The Fourth of January, sure, when he complained, but he didn't get quite as excited

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
and the Fourth of January 9th.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
That's all.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Friend of Potter.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I have no choice.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
But...

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Senator Simon.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
The Third one, you join the Army.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I join the Army in June 15th, 1950, sir.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
What service?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Infantry, sir.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
How long have you been into?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
In 1950?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Yes, sir.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
I've been in four years.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
You service in Korea?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yes, sir.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
16 months in Korea.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yes, sir, I am.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Any children?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yes, sir.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Two little girls.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Fine.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I see you got a purple heart.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Where are these wounded?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
On Baldy, sir.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Are you looking like a worthy...

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
A worthy gentleman?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Thank you, sir.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
No further questions.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Thank you.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Can I join you?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Yes, sir.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yes, sir.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
You're welcome.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yes, sir.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Do you have any questions?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yes, sir.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Okay.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Well, sir, we have been cleared.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
We're going to the Federal Department.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
We're going to the Federal Department.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
We're going to the Federal Department.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Okay.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Okay.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Okay, sir.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
We'll have to go back to the Federal Department.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Okay.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Okay.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I think that's something...

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It's exceptionally good in combat.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I don't think anyone can...

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Even remotely can't enter your reflections upon your record as a...

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
So, sir, if we had men like...

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
You and men like General Ryan...

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Working with us in this exposure of combat, I'm sure wouldn't be...

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
...right up here today, however we are.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
You made one statement for Tom,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
but you're not going to be able to...

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You made one statement for Tom, but I...

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
...just wonder if he wants to have a stand, however.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
You said yourself there was nothing...

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
...this ought to be the bottom of the chart.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't think you should be called upon to have come that.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I don't think you're an authority, but you have.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Now, we finally have the term unprepared to check.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
As a little woman, we don't know a fool,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
but we will know about it, after you know.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
But they put the left in front of the television screen here for a couple of hours.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
From Dave Shines off for a weekend, it was bookmarked out in black.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Another pilot has offered a pure fight.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Now, I'm sure you and I will agree that the television audience...

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
...looking at things in charge, one pure fight...

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
...representing the average...

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
...vacates.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
And the other one all blacked in representing Shines, but assume that...

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
...there was some significance to the blacking out.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I believe that you and I just can tell when I'll see what a grade it is.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
From time ago, we came to office blacked out...

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
...and another grad chief at a week ago, I came to office...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
...and blacked out here.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
That's all this being tried before an audience, the jury, I should say, is quite a few million people.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
So all I can give you is my own opinion.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
And in my opinion, the reason that it was done...

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
...was just for a comparison.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
The first is just like in a prize fight on television...

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
...one of the fighters were in stock trunk...

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
...and one of the fighters were in like trunk.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
That's the only reason that I can say that.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Good job.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Thank you. Thank you.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Please, why are you always the right to those immediately the general?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Thank you, Senator.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Any further questions?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
No, I'm not sure.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Very, very seriously with no...

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
This is a pretty important matter.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Now I don't think it's possible to be started.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
I thought it was a waste of time, but now the winner has got to...

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
...tremely quickly...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
...factually if we can.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
And we put a chart up here with...

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
...the things all blacked out...

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
...and we can supply a sinus in turn.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
We put them...

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
...the fighters.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
We put them in completely white...

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
...and we blacked it out, too.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Completely white in supply, blacked out, too, too, too.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
Don't you think that the millions of American people who are...

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
...looking at this the way of television...

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
...can't help but think there's something significant about those black...

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
...paches in the chart.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Don't you agree with me? This was done in proper place...

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
...by some covered little lawyer, I don't know who...

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
...at certain ovens you're well.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
To receive the public.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
You know that's the obvious answer of them.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I wasn't asking this question, I don't think you should be...

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
...answered it except you didn't pass upon them before.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So I thought it was correct as far as I know.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I can't say what it was done to the thesis of public enough.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Well, with all you can say is that technically it's correct...

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
...and with all you know the information is correct.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
That's correct.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
But as far as the designs of putting black marks on one...

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
...light lines on the other, a match you wouldn't propose.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I have no share of it, I'm afraid I can't.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Now, just one further question with an...

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
...on this January camp...

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
...or the day when I was in the police...

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
...some of the places you had a Mr. Cone.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Then, on the day when we thanked the Mr. Cone...

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
...with being kept on the base on January camp...

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
...and that Mr. Cone had informed you...

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
...that he had been notified.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
The Mr. Cone would be available for many work...

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
...about a range of investigators present in New York.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
In fact, had a range of secretaries there...

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
...take down some of the material...

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
...the results of the previous interrogations of Cheyenne...

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
...and he was irritated not because Cheyenne had to watch dishes...

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
...for Queen of Stole.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
But he was irritated because he had made all these previous arrangements...

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
...it was an important investigation.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Others were to be threatened...

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
...and he couldn't understand why at the last minute...

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
...that particular day should be picked for K.T....

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
...that you should give Cheyenne the job of watching dishes some other day.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
The announcement wasn't that pretty much the conversation.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
So, I should say this...

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
...that it's Cheyenne knew about it on Monday morning.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Now, the Monday before...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
...which was the...

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
...new about it on the Fourth of January...

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
...that wasn't the last minute.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Mr. Cone waited until the last minute to call me...

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
...and if Mr. Cone was irritated because he had all these secretaries...

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
...and witnesses until both lined up...

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
...he thought he didn't express that idea to me.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
Well, this doesn't mean that he had made arrangements.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
For Dave's time to come back...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
...he understood he was coming back that weekend...

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
...that he was coming back to the purpose...

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
...of putting in the right.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Some of the information he had in regard to...

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
...the radar library at the Fourth of March...

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
...that he knew it didn't pull that...

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
...and that if you want to put Cheyenne and K.P. Doofy...

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
...put him on some other day if he could...

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
...because he felt guilty that day.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Fourth of March the conversation.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
No, Mr. Cone, on that particular day...

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
...never mentioned how many were.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
He did say that he would...

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
...what we wanted to do was private Cheyenne from Monday to Friday...

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
...with the O.K. as far as he was concerned.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
But he didn't say why private Cheyenne had the full K.P. on his front.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Well, that was because we had made arrangements.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I don't know.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Well, now you've heard how it goes.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I'm not saying that it's put in a basket.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
You've heard, you know, that...

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
...Conscion lamps...

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
...use right in the middle of a investigation...

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
...which was terminated in filtration of the radar library.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
You know that I assume that we refuse...

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
...to have him on a time to temporary duty with our committee?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
We suggested the goal...

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
...underway as usual training scheduled...

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
...but that he'd be available on weekend...

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
...and that...

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
...cone this day.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I don't care what's due to Monday to Friday...

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
...for him on all the K.P. you want.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
But let us let him come back and finish his work...

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
...for the committee over the weekend.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
There's not a sense for the...

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I say again that on that particular point...

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
...insofar as I can recall Mr. Cone says nothing about the committee...

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
...that's just one of one's brothers, one of two brother's brothers.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
I have here a number of news reports...

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
...and I know that sometimes they aren't completely accurate.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
So I don't want to tie it down to the internet.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
But news reports to the effect that...

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
...baseball employers at court takes...

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
...Mr. usual training.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Mr. Cone, P. Judy.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
I miss about everything else, I'm going to play a baseball.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I don't have any particular coil...

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
...that I'm quite a baseball fan myself.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
But I just wonder if you and I wouldn't agree...

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
...that if a baseball player...

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
...can you know...

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
...to play a baseball, get off of his actual training.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Big news, traders...

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
...coming at the much more important...

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
...and certainly is not unreasonable...

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
...to have a private...

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
...have his free time...

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
...is weakened to work on this big amount of time.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
That's only correct, sir.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Nothing further, thank you very much, but...

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
...I may say again that the men in uniform...

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
...certainly make a much better appearance on the stand...

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
...on the Army's division.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Mr. Cone, please.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Mr. Cone, can I introduce you to Mr. Cone?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Who's that advanced...

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
...excuse me, Mr. Cone?

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Just one other question or two.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I've been rather interested in the exploration...

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
...of the use of certain hundreds of language...

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
...to indicate the flame of mine of the person who's talking.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Of course, in the Army, you're not on the custom...

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
...to aggressive and vigorous language, are you?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
No, sir.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
And...

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
And a general question once said to me in France...

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
...he wouldn't give a hoose for a soldier who didn't drive...

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
...so that...

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
...griving is something of a phenomenon today, wouldn't you say?

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
I would say that most soldiers drive at one time or another, yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
So that Mr. Cone did use what seemed like aggressive and...

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
...expulsive language...

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
...it didn't fall on the customary.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
No, sir, I say that was true.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Then I was very much interested in your remarks...

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
...to being a just a mother's boxing fan.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
You liked them these two...

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
...a charge to the prize ring where one wears blackknowns...

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
...and the other wears whiteknowns...

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
...in order to make the concept.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Yes, sir. That would be my opinion of those two shots.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Thank you.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Any other questions?

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
The senator dismissed. Thank you very much.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
We will stand and recess until two laps this afternoon.
