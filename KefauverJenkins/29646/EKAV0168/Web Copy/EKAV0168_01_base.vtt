WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
We have a place up there.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
On the different thing in the car.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
And the company is here on the set.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
But as a great effect, the company reflects.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
The people have.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
For us, the legend's power is a very good balance of stuff.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
If my male is getting indicated,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I can tell you that the chairman left

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
the people are switching hearts.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Of the public's work.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Of the cultural repetition.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
The fact that him, Antonin, he has the same.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
With our total job.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
By any means.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
We have a lot of work to do.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
We have a lot of work to do.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
We have a lot of work to do.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
By any means.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Motion offered by 100.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I would.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Better give.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
If I.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Shelters one island.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Of two.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
And they say,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
news that we have enough to be.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
From the well.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Because I have to be a white watcher.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I can assure you.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
That's a send them apart.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
There's an on the same.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
And the other witnesses have evidence.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
There will no additional light.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
On the son of a thief.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I will remember the committee.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
What?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Both who have appeared in other section of necessary.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
To bring out all the facts.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
But Mr. Chairman.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
We have a great opportunity.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
To the American people.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
In looking at your role.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Our prestige in the world.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
To be effective.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
By the hearings going on the pop up room.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Then the Senate office.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
In such a big of our.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
American form of government.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
There's been more.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
By the hearings going on.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
In the pop up room.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I have 20 agree.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Then any person.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
As I charge his meeting in town.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
To have an awful opportunity.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
To refuse those charges.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I say Mr. Chairman.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
That this vehicle.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Call me in upper.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
As personally best.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Then the continuation of the hearings.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Week after week.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Month after month.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Chairman.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Come again.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
All right.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Go on.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Mr. Chairman.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Mr. Chairman.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Mr. Chairman.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I'd like to be very honest.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
As the chairman of.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Some days ago.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I was about to get them.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I was about to be accepted.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Mr. Chairman.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
If I'm wrong.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Mr. Chairman.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Tell me.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I was contacted.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I said by the phone.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I was contacted.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I think that's what I was in time.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Would they be quite.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Or I accept.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
They change.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I was accepted.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
In this document.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I reluctantly accept them.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I think I'm in clearly a.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I hope the power I hate did not favor his changes.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
There's these who are his conditions for.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm putting down the hearings.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I would reluctantly accept.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I was told to accept.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
I remember the committee.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I was.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Sorry.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
My senior grade.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I remember good and bad.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
My career is a judge.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I was shocked.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I was shocked.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
When I found out that the wealth came in here.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
And made the statement that this resolution was new to him.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
And after he had the making suggestions for the new narrative.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
After he had approved, apparently approved the document.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Mr. Chairman.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I am not going to say he was acting in bad faith.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I thought the thumbnail has to work with him to decide that.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I would like to make a suggestion.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
All for an early summer time.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
To tell him the question of how we could start from here.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
We never asked a single question of what.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
It is now for a timely afternoon.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
So I have more people to take in the media place.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
We have 20 months.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
All day to day to ask questions.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I would suggest that you just cannot deal.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
In any manner, paper forums, where they wealth,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
who consistently make offerings.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
And then you come to hear what's on the act before television.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I think Mr. Chairman, that's in this report.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Mr. Welk could be put on the stand.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
He could be asked why.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
He had the original suggestion.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And then Welk done that.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Why he made the suggestion for the changes.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Which I was very shocked and I was lucky we did.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And why after I accepted those changes.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
He came before this committee and told us that.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
That this was a new document and the new document about Mr. Chairman.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
May I say that I think that they complete waste of time.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
No, I don't think that's anything.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I just, today, I think today,

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
unless the motion of the federal law is accepted.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
I think the waste of time to do any attempt at dealing with Mr. Welk is purpose.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
The purpose of the committee is that the atoms are not fair.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
They succeeded in selling the investments that come in the past.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
By making their fear of packing upon my staff and upon me,

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
it is now clear that Mr. Welk, the attorney for the future of the atom,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
is not acting what I would call good play.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
When he keeps me at the phone for two hours,

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
I finally accept, accept what he thinks of the proper document he comes in here

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
as I never saw before.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Mr. Chairman, I urge, I urge that after this motion is acted upon

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
that we have no more dealings no more conversation about how we can pose the hearings

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
that we hear all the witnesses.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
We hear all of them, the public,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
our last Mr. Welk we've called.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
And ultimately Mr. Chairman, I would like to make this request.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Any questions we are able to give Mr. Day, Mr. Chairman,

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
and be able to practice this committee of acting only hearing only about four hours a day.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
We have a fact that we have an investigation,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
and we would be working on six-base links with suspected invitations

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
and sending our prosecutions about to get out.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
We will practice as of this very moment,

06:26.000 --> 06:34.000
at 410-unlay, 10-1954, there are roughly a hundred and some thirty come in any fun plants

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm going to have to share the call and meeting other committees.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Now after permission then,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
that the reason the reason we are working with,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
we are originally passed through with our little hearings,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
our lives within progress, I'm sure that I have asked the voter to mess.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
My little friend,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
self-advocable, four of these names,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
no matter what we,

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
my little eyes, that was the still-abusting of procrastination that may take months.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
Mr. Chairman, I think it's urgent that I have the commission of the committee.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm not asking for it here, but I can exactly expressly commission of the committee.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
The whole hearings every evening, every Saturday,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
not only necessary,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
but on Sundays in the fun plants,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
because of nothing you do with the military,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
and I ask the chair to call out executive commission on its earliest convenience.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
So even while this purpose is going on,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
we may be able to defeat these puppets of Mr. Welts,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Mr. Adams, Mr. Sivins, and proceed to dig out formulas,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
even during this process.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I think I've been getting it to Martin Currius.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
I think I'm entitled to be heard at least for this exam.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Unless my lady is free,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
she's assigned it to Ms. Johnson,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
said that I was on the telephone to him for something I thought of a gentleman.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
The president of the Council can also have a good knock-up to him during his games,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
or if any other time.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I did not talk for Mr. Currius.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I did not talk for Mr. Jenkins,

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
and I did not say I did not talk for any senator sitting on the side of the desk table.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Yes, ma'am, Mr. Johnson.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You will be prepared for making this.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
The day was not until the most best.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
The same change of the business documents.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Were those changes made at your first suggestion to me when I was a witness?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
You mean you knew nothing about being honest?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
They were not.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
I did not even fear of any of those changes before until I came to this room.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
If it's like you know what I did, I used to run,

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
and I laid down on a bread long house in my room with my head on the ground and wet.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Many years to share, it's a decision.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
For the share of the needs, we keep your thesis as well.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Mr. Chairman, you know nothing about it?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
No, no, Mr. Chairman.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Good to hear from you, Mr. Chairman.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Good to hear from you.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yes, ma'am, I have a question.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I'll say it's like you have a question.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I have a question.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I have a question.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I have nothing for this, Mr. Chairman.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
It's very important.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I have a question.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
This is a callocate between the needs.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
This time is very important.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
This is a business name.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm going out of order.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that we should not proceed to take the vote on the resolution or on the motions.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
And then, actually, quite immediately, I'm pleased with the presentation of the proof which I hear.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
The chair of the committee on the日days.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
The chair of the Parliament, Paul Rowe, the chair of the chair of the Parliament, is appointed from the Parliament that he has been appointed.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Mr. Chairman, it cares about your answer to the committee's request.

09:27.000 --> 09:37.000
The chair has consistently told that whatever any of the members of the committee has come forward and he has advised the request for a meeting of the committee to be called to consider.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Now, as they want to give before us to require that meeting, and he will call the meeting to send it to his request.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
The motion is suggested in the chat time.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Mr. Chairman, would you like to have a vote?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. MacIvich.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It's a very important point here.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
I have just made the statement that I had received telephone calls.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
I could buy my phone at noon, and I was like to believe I'm not going to name the conference as we did it.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
The conference was actually a funny start, but the chairman I had received from anything like finance.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Right, thanks.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
The chairman I had received from the committee.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Right, thanks.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Mr. Chairman, may I have any questions?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Okay, may I have any statements?

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
That over two hours of noon, I was being told repeatedly by the television members.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
So, allow me to believe that these changes will suggest a benefit of health.
