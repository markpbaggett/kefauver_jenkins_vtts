WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm not going to ask the soldiers to take the dance.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
I've been using it for the made-break clear.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
By the chair who knows about the counter-break issue,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm not saying it's a fairing self-made approach.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
I think it should be made very clear that I had no inclination,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
no indication of it,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
that this was not coming directly from Mr. Welts,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
and I think that should be cleared up,

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
because I've been on a plane accepting what I thought were well-preserved proposals.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
So I say I don't want anyone to take the stand,

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
give me the details,

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
but I just think it's very nice to leave.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Those thoughts were made.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Should they summarize my thumb,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
so that it's very clear that I was like to believe that I was accepting

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
and offered by Mr. Welts.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I think that's reason, Mr. Chairman.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I think that's very reason.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
The staff is not going to all the calipers,

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
at all the senators,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
and all the people interested in this discussion

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
had during the lunch hour.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
They will have to take us to work with Wred Bull to meet the chiefs on his house.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
The chair of Wred Bull's Secretary of the Committee advised him

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
that he felt that this proposal would be acceptable to him,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
and that the chair had been let to believe

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
by those in times of issue,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
with him it was acceptable to us.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Apparently we know now that this is not...

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Mr. Chairman, may I correct the record in one respect?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
I did not say I was asleep on my house,

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I was not that lucky,

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
but I was reclining on it.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Mr. Chairman,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
can I have an hour to find it from the go-down of Mr. Chairman?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Is it for the Committee on Mr. Ludwig?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Members, Chairman.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Mr. Chairman?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Mr. Chairman, the point of personal further.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Mr. Chairman, may I begin to introduce you to the members?

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
It should be made clear that the representatives of the committee

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
did believe me to believe.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
At least half a dozen phones, all,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
that someone from the military,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Mr. Welts, who is now the unique,

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
and making these suggestions,

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
and that's why I accepted them,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
and I'm certainly clear, Mr. Chairman.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
The infection will go up,

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
so that there is little basis for this.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I think that's a common difference, Mr. Chairman.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I wish you a talk to your council.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Now that it's not clear,

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
not from your house,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
we should know that.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Either somebody was receiving the committee,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
or someone with many was being over his role,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
so I was wondering what to do.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And I think Mr. Chairman, may I finish?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I think I think this is all very important,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
to the fact that he's my velocity estate.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Hey, now, ladies and gentlemen,

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
just a minute, Mr. Chairman,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
it is too much to ask,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
that the chair can stop what he's calling,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
and then either confirm or deny it.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
He can confirm or deny it or not.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But I was standing by my phone for two hours,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
and received a pita call,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
and with regular leave,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I think it's a gesture of tango,

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
we're made,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I think that's it.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Are you going to discuss with the chairman?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I did not believe anybody could ask it.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I think it's a welcome.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Mr. Chairman, I think that's the reason why

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Mr. Chairman is playing out the beginning,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
when he said that he could not have an opportunity

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
to consult with his client,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
to win the lunch hour,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
to reach out to the committee twice a week,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
so he said to consult with his client,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
under proposed changes,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
and the buyers' committees of his client

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
felt that they would be unfair to his interest

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
if we were to adopt.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
One further question, Mr. Chairman.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Who was there after Mr. Chairman Flair,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
for that he was the man, then?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Mr. Hitchcock,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
we are tied relatively all around the table.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
To try to find some worth of a formula,

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
perhaps for that in the hearing,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
that all the kids would say that they considered fair.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Now, we'll take it from the McCarty critically.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Now, openly and publicly,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm tied up with the accepted.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
So, Mr. Hitchcock,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
we're taking him to Mr. Bryan,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
as he's writing his right.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Mr. Welp,

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I'd like to share this,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
my attorney, on the second phone call,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
a heat-op to proceed with the unfair,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
and I'd like to share with Mr. Bryan

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
to become a member of the judge.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Mr. Wien-Neville,

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
sir, Mr. chairman Under it.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Mr. Chairman L. vice- commissioner tanks.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Go ahead for the first,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
try tofficial his recommendation.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
The first, retrospective grounds wait Sharp.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.880
Then the McCarty will start request

03:58.880 --> 03:58.880


03:58.880 --> 04:03.000
I have nowhere known neuropsychinium admittance.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I have just push out on myself,

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
but I have no time left for機.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I believe I've let Circle McCarty.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh, I'm here to greet you.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.320
I told Grisha,

04:12.320 --> 04:15.120
and you asked,

04:15.120 --> 04:16.600
we are steeling Olá!

04:16.600 --> 04:18.500
All right, press istorender.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
We'll try to clear this out.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.500
That will not include me,

04:22.500 --> 04:24.500
or in five-semifim.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.500
Mr. Senator,

04:25.500 --> 04:27.500
I think we should do that.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.500
May I make a very clear,

04:29.500 --> 04:31.500
perhaps, neither you,

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
nor some of the exact same,

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
or some of the primary things that's ever indicated,

04:34.500 --> 04:36.500
but any time that they wanted to,

04:36.500 --> 04:37.500
something during short to me,

04:37.500 --> 04:38.500
or in my hearing,

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
you have no time for accuracy for that purpose.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.500
You have no time for accuracy of news,

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
no time for that subject of years.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.500
That's me table-factor-sharing.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
But I,

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
I don't think we should leave a promise at a date.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.500
I'll leave now.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.500
I already said it up.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
Mr. Tannen,

04:51.500 --> 04:52.500
Mr. Tannen,

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
point of personal privilege.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.500
Take your time.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.500
We shall proceed.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.500
We shall proceed.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.500
Mr. Tannen,

04:57.500 --> 04:58.500
not for me,

04:58.500 --> 04:59.500
though, in personal time,

04:59.500 --> 05:00.500
but for me,

05:00.500 --> 05:01.500
Mr. Tannen,

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
the Tannen,

05:03.500 --> 05:04.500
the first thing that I was under the film

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
was like something changes.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
Mr. Tannen,

05:07.500 --> 05:08.500
the represent me there,

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
and if it were Mr. Welch's,

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
I wish the chair would make that clear for the record.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.500
Yes, I can make it as clear as he can,

05:13.500 --> 05:15.500
and the property of information,

05:15.500 --> 05:17.500
is that the chair himself?

05:17.500 --> 05:19.500
As soon as I met Tannen,

05:19.500 --> 05:20.500
what did he thought?

05:20.500 --> 05:22.500
The chief's proposal to be acceptable to him?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.500
If you know anyone that the chair comes,

05:24.500 --> 05:26.500
that he's not Tannen's to Welch,

05:26.500 --> 05:28.500
and that he's the handsome Mr. Welch.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
I can tell you only that,

05:30.500 --> 05:31.500
because I know no more about it.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
I don't think that I didn't say that Mr. Welch

05:33.500 --> 05:34.500
is actually in good faith,

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
and he was not the police,

05:35.500 --> 05:36.500
just to have...

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
He had come about in meeting a monk.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.500
I'm happy that meeting a monk,

05:39.500 --> 05:40.500
does not have the both about.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
He was doing all the things he could say.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.500
Mr. Welch,

05:43.500 --> 05:44.500
does not have the middle of mind.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.500
He better have the both and become.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.500
That's one question, Mr. Tannen.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.500
Yes, sir.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
I have finally got to share this question.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
I assume there's no doubt that there's mind,

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
because I...

05:53.500 --> 05:55.500
Worst words could be said,

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
Mr. Welch, that way,

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
to get the change.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.500
I'm not sure that it would be fair to say Mr. Welch

06:01.500 --> 06:02.500
involved, I think, just...

06:02.500 --> 06:04.500
It was brought to the center of attention,

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
that this resolution has gone to where you say

06:06.500 --> 06:07.500
you should have listened to.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.500
That is obvious, so...

06:09.500 --> 06:10.500
and hope.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.500
I did some of the other members of the committee.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.500
That was in 50 times,

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
that's going to involve,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
I think it will be fair and honest.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.500
I'm just...

06:17.500 --> 06:18.500
As a final touch, Mr. Tannen.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.500
After the touch is over,

06:19.500 --> 06:21.500
I wonder if the chair would do this for me.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
I wonder if he would give me the name.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.500
As those representing Mr. Stevens and the president,

06:26.500 --> 06:28.500
who would forget to write me to justice these changes.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
I think I'm entitled about...

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
I was graduated with the Welch about them, too.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500
I should know where they were.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.500
I might ask him to write me a record, Mr. Tannen.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.500
But I just think I'm entitled to the information,

06:36.500 --> 06:37.500
because now I'm doing this,

06:37.500 --> 06:38.500
and I saw a ton of things.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.500
I had some good sentiments and thoughts on them.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
I still have.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
I think there's no understanding.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
If the government's a Welch is making it for justice,

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
no, it's right.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.500
If it's fair, we do that after the question is over, Terry.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.500
The chair is not necessary.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.500
And that's the good thing.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.500
He is not much of a judge.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
He will be what he can do with his hands.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
We will now have...

06:54.500 --> 06:56.500
You know how to vote on the votes for them.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.500
Are you ready to vote?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.500
Stand on the count.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
No.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
Stand with it.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.500
Stand with it.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.500
No.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.500
Stand with that.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.500
I...

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
Stand with it.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.500
No.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.500
Stand with it.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
I'm sure it won't.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
No.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.500
I can't feel it.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.500
Let's get out of here.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.500
I'm sorry.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.500
I'm sorry.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
I think I should recognize you.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
It's nothing to watch.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
You said,

07:18.500 --> 07:20.500
fire to the weapons is made by Senator Muffatty.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.500
A few minutes ago,

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
to the possibility of holding nice questions,

07:23.500 --> 07:25.500
I have made some notifications

07:25.500 --> 07:27.500
to remind me to offer a motion,

07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
which I knew of this time,

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
that we both seek to hold

07:30.500 --> 07:33.500
the means of each day from 730 to 930,

07:33.500 --> 07:36.500
PM on each day that any sessions are held

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
at this point is here,

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
by the government.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.500
I'm losing seconds.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
It's just,

07:42.500 --> 07:44.500
on every day that we hold a session,

07:44.500 --> 07:47.500
we also hold a nice session

07:47.500 --> 07:49.500
from 739.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.500
Maybe,

07:50.500 --> 07:52.500
here, it's fire for the...

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
In the morning,

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
today is the day of the resolution,

07:54.500 --> 07:56.500
the year of the 30th anniversary.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.500
It's not knowing about that.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
It's not knowing it is.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
The chairman of one of the four patients,

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
talking a little bit.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.500
There were members of this.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.500
There were members of this.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.500
There were members of this.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
There were very few sessions,

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
and the 30th anniversary

08:06.500 --> 08:08.500
of the 30th anniversary of the 30th anniversary of the 30th anniversary.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
That has been so fun.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
So 13 years ago.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
Yeah, well,

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
I'm just going to get this.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.500
Once again,

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
this is the chairman.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
The chairman.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Anybody want to be a chairman?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
Good, I do, right?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
Yeah, very.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.500
I don't think we haven't.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
The first part of it will do me my foot.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
I look on the floor on seconds

08:26.500 --> 08:27.500
of that length,

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
but I, as I said,

08:28.500 --> 08:29.500
I'll do it if I have to,

08:29.500 --> 08:31.500
but I do want to make this together.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.500
If you have three sessions today,

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
and this applies to all people,

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
that's too long for anything to whip.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.500
I think you want to take one wicket in the morning,

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
a different wicket the afternoon,

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
and a third wicket the night.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.500
Certainly you ought not to take a single wicket,

08:41.500 --> 08:43.500
but taking a little cross examination

08:43.500 --> 08:44.500
for that long period.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.500
I urge that with all my power.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.500
I've seen enough about losses to know

08:49.500 --> 08:51.500
that that's pretty tough on the wicket,

08:51.500 --> 08:54.500
so I'd like to ask that I'm sure

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
it all gets tires and anger

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
and difficult,

08:57.500 --> 08:59.500
and we'll be in more wobbles

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
in the evening.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.500
The evening is going to take a six-year-old.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.500
The evening is going to take a six-year-old.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.500
But as I say,

09:05.500 --> 09:07.500
I'll go on if I have to.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.500
Sure, I can only say that if he interprets that motion,

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
and that is not included in the motion.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.500
I'm sure we'll under the best motion.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.500
Yes, yes.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
Yes, the most good I suppose.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.500
No.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.500
I have another way of considering that.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
I get a fairly, I say a phrase.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
I put him 18 hours a day,

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
and I intend to pursue

09:26.500 --> 09:27.500
some of my other duties,

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
not to stand in the field.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.500
Any other discussion on the motion

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
which has been made by the Senate

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
as an item?

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
Excuse me.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
I understand that the chairman

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
there are some hearings before the Senate

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
appropriates the committee.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
Wouldn't it be better if it takes

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
this matter up an effective

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
discussion tomorrow and make a determination

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
at that time?

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
I'm ready to vote if it's the wicket

09:53.500 --> 09:54.500
of the committee now.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
I merely make that suggestion.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.500
I'm ready to vote in favor of it,

09:58.500 --> 10:00.500
but I think the matter probably

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
will be the first and the third until tomorrow morning.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
So the committee can go over and then vote it in,

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
go to the final, at the beginning of the public

10:06.500 --> 10:07.500
session in the morning.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.500
Are you asking that in the nature of the

10:09.500 --> 10:10.500
substitute under justice?

10:10.500 --> 10:13.500
I'm offering that as a suggestion to my

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
distinguished friend, Tom Idaho,

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
if he was subject to chairman Idaho's

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
secretary of state, he's firmly

10:18.500 --> 10:19.500
actually vote on it.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.500
But I merely wanted to share the oldest

10:21.500 --> 10:22.500
secretary of state.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
I put him in session 14 days and a couple

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
virtually, he's not being so far as

10:26.500 --> 10:28.500
as I've been seeing any of the real facts

10:28.500 --> 10:29.500
in connection with his counterpart.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
From this testimony, let's decide whether

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
it is engaged essentially and far

10:33.500 --> 10:36.500
malice in putting on a TV show for the

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
Americans people or whether we recognize

10:38.500 --> 10:41.500
our responsibility to do to expedite these

10:41.500 --> 10:43.500
hearings and do everything within our

10:43.500 --> 10:46.500
power to get the facts and then to reach a

10:46.500 --> 10:48.500
conclusion so that we can devote our time

10:48.500 --> 10:50.500
to others important duties.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.500
May it be shared in the fire whether it be

10:52.500 --> 10:54.500
followed in the second session in the

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500
morning at 9.30.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.500
It's just that and what it was and not

10:57.500 --> 10:59.500
as it was before the committee, if that

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
was reasonable, the senator from Idaho

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
so that he could renew his suggestion at that

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
time and perhaps work out a more

11:05.500 --> 11:07.500
orderly schedule for hearings and we can do

11:07.500 --> 11:08.500
it on the show at the moment here.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.500
That's right, sir.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.500
You will draw your motion and come early.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
I will come early.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
Chair will announce the new 357.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
Tomorrow morning at 9.30.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
There will be a executive station of the

11:16.500 --> 11:18.500
committee which stands in recess until

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
10.30 tomorrow morning.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.500
You will just heard Chairman Montenau

11:29.500 --> 11:30.500
for the committee will hold its next

11:30.500 --> 11:32.500
public session at 10.30 tomorrow morning.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
There will be an executive station of the

11:34.500 --> 11:36.500
committee at 9.30 to discuss the proposal of

11:36.500 --> 11:38.500
Senator Desvorichoff and make us the moment

11:38.500 --> 11:40.500
to go that night session be held by the

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
duration of these hearings.
