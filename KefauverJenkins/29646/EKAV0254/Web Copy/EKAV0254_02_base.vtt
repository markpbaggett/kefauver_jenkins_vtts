00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I think there's reference to science.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
But when it was reached the point where I just no longer was able to say specificity,

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
there's a constant.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
This issue was difficult.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
And did I just say that I should say this?

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
And I've seen a prayer wasn't somewhere which it consists of coal.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
It's a coal in such a matter as not to hang this coal with news.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
At the same time, and this cause of the situation of my relationship with the committee staff,

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
was its artwork.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
And at the same time, it made this coal the way of the fact that this sort of treatment should

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
continue.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
Then the professor said, Mr. Adams, lift that statement to you on the 29th or any other day.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
It is not meant to have taken our rights to give you the ransomware of the conversation

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
and the 29th or the 9th.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Did he say that it is him that that statement is not accepted?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
No, sir.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
You're going to tell you how the conversation was with Jason?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I think there's a few years inside of this.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Just say what the conversation was.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Mr. Adams came to me on the 9th.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
He told me that he had been working on the staff to find car.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
I told him that I was the only man to get call off the hearings.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
They felt they should be called off, but he should come directly to me.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
He said that Bob Stevens was very, very misdisturbed by the bad publicity the Army was getting.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
He said that the secretary just spoke that we should probably see him drop, but they have served their purpose.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
I told Mr. Adams about that time that what I would like to do is to talk to Mr. Stevens with him,

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
with my friend, and explain to him why we could not throw off a hearing from the skill staff

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
in my situation.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Following my age, it would be impossible for us to chop it off and have a white voice then.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
Mr. Adams and I have to get which one suggested that we meet for lunch in the following day.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
We did that at the Calam Hotel.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
On the 7th.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
On the 7th.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
On the 7th.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Well, the same sign mentioned in the conversation as this in the 9th between you and God Adams.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
I would recall it was Mr. Jenkins with man, if it was not the one question on me.

02:20.000 --> 02:29.000
You did nice specifically, making the statements about which Mr. Adams testified to on these things,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
and if it is to you, Senator, and which I just read to you.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I think you read Mr. Adams' statement, not mine, Mr. Secretary.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
But did not, did I not read Mr. Adams' statements to the effect that he went to you on the 7th and I think complained about Mr. Cohn's...

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
That was incorrect.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Keep me talking.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
You say that no such conversation occurred between you and the madam.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Right.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm nothing substantially approximating that no statement relates.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
No.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
I've got Mr. Adams' entire in there in his testimony of the guy.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
I wouldn't evaluate Mr. Adams' testimony, in the case of the surgery, undoubred after he remembered.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
I don't recall any statement made by Mr. Adams about Mr. Shahn.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
They needed a conversation while Mr. Adams felt the hearings had been called off.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
There was nothing dishonest about his actions.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
He tried to convince me that hearings had been called off.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
He tried to convince me that they would do the job.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I felt they would not.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I felt that we had certain movements that we had to call.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Above all, the loyalty board.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I mentioned that to him.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
I told him that I thought we should move to Mr. Cohn's, that we had been having what appeared to be good cooperation after that point.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
He didn't hear I suggested once the Calam's to make today now 5th day of Shahn.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
It's been...

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
It's Adam's third day of Shahn who discussed.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
I wouldn't say that Adam's of guilty of surgery.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I recall no conversation about James Shahn on that day.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
You've been recalled immediately of the Calam to the sick day of the Army.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I did very well.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I did very well for it.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I think the most important thing to you recall that Mr. Steven...

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
The man he has to be said was in Europe in the sense of the truth for an honest.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
So any or under his oath here on the witness stand,

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
but it's not meeting you as soon as you're assigned to a new York area.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I think the meeting was eight weeks of training at this.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Here's an error, man.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Here's an error.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
That's right.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Then is there a match you make such a request to the sick day of the Army?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
No.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
The action is definitely no.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Right.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Do you know why I just take the day with it?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
For me.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So this is the time, something to discuss.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
The secretary of the government has a very, very bad memory here in the sand.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
He has sent his testimony to the day to day.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
I think that's because of bad memory, not because of any warfulness.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
I assume that any mistake when he made about that meeting was solely because of bad memory.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Did you recall Senator Rufflin named me Frank Curry.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
He did do so in New York City on air about December 17th?

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
In the presence of Mr. Adams, they're out of his presence.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
On account of these days' interstations that have been raised by Mr. Cohn on behalf of Mr. Shane.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, the only thing that I recall, reprimanding Mr. Curry, you can call the reprimand.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, I don't recall the date, but I hope you don't resign after this, Frank.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Well, one night when I fell for your call and as you many whistle-sounds,

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
more than I could take care of an executive special, and I had to keep the whistle-sounds waiting there in the afternoon.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
And some of whom I'm not sure of being heard.

05:56.000 --> 06:07.000
I told Frank that I thought that they should be a bit more careful and be sure that they not have more whistle-sounds than what I could handle.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Frank pointed out that there was no way of knowing how much time I was finned with the whistle-sounds.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
Pointed out that I've been afraid of a plan when I hear that up that.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
330 with no further whittings, had to come back in some other day, the perhaps I would be more irritated than as old.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
They had extra whittings.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I think Mr. Adams was present at that time.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
Here's what I want to review and accept from Mr. Adams 5.0.2586 to the record.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Mr. Carl is in the room.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
When he walked into the room, he began to speak to Mr. Carl about his subject.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
And he began to criticize Mr. Carl about the matter that he had spoken to me about.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
That's that better easy.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
Back there before that, but it is so we will know precisely what Mr. Adams was talking about.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm not anything to say about Mr. Carl.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I'm just next to the right fair, Dr. Murphy.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Mr. Adam.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Seven of the McCarthy's biggest miscellaneous.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
25 of these.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Mr. James, let's see.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
The latest one minute.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
It's me.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, Senator McCarthy and Mr. Coney can frame while we have the opportunity.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Mr. Coney.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I'm sorry, sir.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Go ahead.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
Senator McCarthy stated to me that the purpose of his call is a night before the rise that he had just learned.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I will be talking to you today.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
As the amount of interference through the officials that spoke with Mr. Coney said,

08:01.000 --> 08:09.000
which is that kind of conflict, and that he wished to tell me that as a blame of now, it was soon.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
It had been soon.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
He was not going to be moving anymore.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
I told him I was going to get that information.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
But it would be absolutely impossible for you to be able to stay with Mr. Coney in front of me.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So if you could hear what I've heard, get that out.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Maybe not going to be glad if I was at conversations at play.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
No, the conversations.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I did not get Mr. Adam that night.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
The reason I was trying to call Mr. Jenkins was in regard to the lock-in matter.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Mr. Adam's discelt lock-in was made on afternoon.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
It happened to be, wait until the 60th.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I didn't take it too seriously.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
The timing of discursion.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
I thought it over half I got back to the load-off.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I began to realize the very serious import of it,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
and when he was apparently actually serious, so I wanted to call him up.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And talking about that.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I tried to get him all over.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I couldn't get him.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
The next move, we had a very extended discussion about this matter.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
The lock-in matter made him a tradition.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
But I'm not particularly late tonight at the 60th.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
You'll find that when I was talking to my office,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I didn't call them for that specific purpose alone.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Now, I was talking to my office.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I dictated a memorandum on the lock-in matter.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
The 60s, that's the matter, 30, get hold of the channel.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
You may wonder why I dictated a memorandum to my office

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
just a time as a tone.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
One of the reasons was that I was leaving the following day.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
A friend began sometimes.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
And I wanted to make sure that Mr. Cohn, Mr. Kiner,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
but the situation I did try to get this out of him.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
All evening, I discussed this lock-in matter

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
because I thought it was very serious.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
That's the conversation that, to which Mr. Heddon's just abandoned the lock-in

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
and which I just said to him,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
and to set out on page 25 of the service,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
there's not a curiosity.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
That's what you're saying, directly.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Well, Mr. Adams was going to take it on that.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Why is anything vinegar said

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
with a toxic effect in substance?

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
With Mr. Adams complaining to you on that occasion,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
that Mr. Cohn had the reason

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
to take the day off.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
There was no complaint with Mr. Fowler's in his statement.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
But what let me give you this, Mr. Heddon?

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
There was no complaint that Mr. Cohn had abused him.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
There was a few times I thought there was a much greater date.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
When the instances were made,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
whenever I had a test following the law on the board,

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
once if we did, there would be a court issued cleaning.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
The law was to come in and appear,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
but that was once later than the state I do it.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
But if you told Mr. Adams on the day about this with talking,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
it set out in 25, 85 of the records,

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
that you had learned about the conversations with reference to shine,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
it appears to be a official report list,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
and that it was the same as a grain,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
did you say what, did it get the correct order?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
No, sir.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And you say that you did not speak to me.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Mr. Heddon, you say what you meant to Mr. Adams.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
At some time, I can't recall the date from this,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
but at some time I did that just next door

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
as if we were hearing in regard to the shine matter.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I wouldn't want to excuse him in the first place

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
during the other particular morning.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
We may have discussed some of those news stories,

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
but there will claim that Mr. Adams was fired, ever.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
But Mr. Coleman actually did anything in proper.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So, Mr. Heddon said,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
this June, on that day,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
the 17th day of December,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
hiding as a time,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
clear the size Mr. Frank Carr,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
his cause is the interference

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
of the official report that makes on behalf of Vane Chang,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
well because there's no engine,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
he could get in on the field.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Well, I'm going to give you the part of the memorandum

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
that I have to ask your side of the permit.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
So, in regard to that,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
so date of December 21, Mr. Franklin,

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
well, looking at you from light upon the matter.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
So, there I'm not asking right now.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
In what's the date to date we're talking about December 17th?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
How's this?

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
So, the base of the automobile ride in New York City,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
so is the motorcycle thing?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Well, the date of the automobile ride.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
You, Mr. Carr, Mr. Adams,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and Mr. Coleman, the car.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
That is right.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
You had a arm as we had in the same car

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
and animated discussion.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Here's Mr. Coleman's word.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I'll show you, before that ride,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
it's time.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I think that's the correct description.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
You have called Mr. Adams

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
a testimony to the respect of that automobile ride,

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
and not to do it.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I did.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Mr. Coleman was awaiting him and justigating him

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
and now that sort of thing,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I'm going to prepare the drives and call

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
because of the double car too.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
On the part of the spectacle game,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
the Army was expecting shine.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
I can all look after one of you.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
You can call Adam just testimony?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yes.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
You've got a current senator?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Nothing.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, if anything, say that I'm not

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
going to be a rider with a sickly name shine.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Nothing, I recall.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
What?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
What was that animated conversation about?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I don't know, a lot of them.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I know a lot of them.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
No, no, they're subject of any importance now.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I don't know if it was my life or not.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I don't know if it was my life to stop up the tree.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
The need of the conversation was all about a lot of them.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
No substance, anything, so you do whatever

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
in the testimony of John Adams

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
who was expecting that Adam will be a rider.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I'll take it.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Well, I'll put it in the end.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I'm sorry.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Thank you, sir.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Thank you.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
You know a better solution.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Can I say before you answer questions?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Yes.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Mr. Jones, if you will check the phone call for Port Lama,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
you'll find that I call General Washington.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't recall the exact date.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
But I call Martin.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
I'm going to recite that conversation because I think it has to do with this.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
I call Martin and reminded him on the arrival of New York.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
He said, first cooperation, which I'm giving the committee of perhaps.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Me and I won't get my promotion.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I call him and federal university.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I have a prophetic journal.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I still am really bound to call you and give you the facts.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm so sorry.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I don't have to do with your promotion.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm literally at nothing from the word of the question.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
I said, the plan now is to break in.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Just to remove you from Port Lama.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
I don't know what I can do.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
I said, I do think we have a duty to try and protect the witnesses who have helped us.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
They got kindness.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
And I can see no reason for this except your cooperation with the committee.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
And I said, what's the cost of guessing you have General Washington?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I'm going to thank him in answer.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
I think I can call him a little bit.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
One of the states, again, not a good soldier here.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
He said, I won't know either for my anyone.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
He said, if I get both of them, for doing my duty.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
That's a good way of ending my army career.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
That's all, Senator.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
That's roughly all we have.

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
I think the night of the 17th and the 49th.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And I don't think he talked to General Washington.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
I think he talked to the committee.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
And I think he's not going to make that.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
So we're serving enough about this.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
What I call, what's my name?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I didn't even call.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
I call Washington.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
He's asking me, and I get it, besides of being.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Situation to be.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
And I think what you're going to have to talk about.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Tell you about his conversation.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
But it's not the matter of a very concerned about such a thing.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Because there's more talk about serving our minds.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
About Mr. Washington, of being broken.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Because he was willing to help us.

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
Explosive big coming to South of the Red Island, I'll have a try.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
So, then, just in the 20th second, you'll be better to the 60th Army.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I'll quote them the 50th.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Right, then, I have that right.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Just the other, the Robert T. Stevens,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
and the Daily from the 22nd, you're not.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
I have raised rumors to the effect that some of the members of my staff

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
have intervened with you, the Patlin.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
In the half of the former staff consultant, David Shines.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
That's the center for us, the Vermont.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
My senator.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
All God be from the 22nd, 1953.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Thank you, Bill.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Senator Sanders of the Vermont has just come into the talk of the three of them.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
In the center of McCarthy, a note.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
In an envelope, which the senator has now opened.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
And you'll recall the bitter exchange between senator Flanders

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
and senator McCarthy some weeks ago.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Which Senator Flanders made a reach on the floor of the Senate.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
And suggested that this committee look into the real reason behind

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
the flounder.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
For the fair, I'll put the flounders through my room.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
But I'll put the flounders through my room.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
The flounder is on the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the committee.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
This flounder is just hand up me a letter and I read it.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I think this brings up an important point.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
You'll notice it's informed you that time will make another speech concerning your activities

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
in the center for the afternoon.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
The sooner after morning hours I can get the floor.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
If you're sort of there, I'll be glad to have you present.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
Number one, I will be unable to express it because I was decultifying number two.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I don't have enough interest in any flounder's speech to listen to.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
Number three, number three, number three, number three, number one, here, attention.

18:33.000 --> 18:41.000
Number three, you'll move out the floor of the indicated of the Judd Information.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
While I'm going to the committee, you suggest that the committee is not getting up

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
a part of this matter.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I thought it was an extremely scary little speech.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
At that time, when the committee said it's not a particular thing that you have to tell you

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
about, you know, your opinions.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I think Senator Hitchin has any information about that.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
But you should do as much as I'm doing now.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Take your old friend your right hand.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Let us cross the avenue.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
If you have nothing except the initial smear, bring from the smear seat.

19:17.000 --> 19:26.000
When you should tell the vast center, and I think you should do it to adhere on the floor rather than on the stomach floor.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
And I always be glad to stop a slide now and let you testify on the road.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I was running the commission with you now.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I'll have to rule that the committee has control of these procedures.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
So that's how the plan is to retire from the other room on the other.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
I'm sorry that the commission's kind of shooting is on here.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
If I were to come closer.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm sure that this is not shooting.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
Anything you want to do with our commission has a proceeding.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
They come in open form for a commission with a wait.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
With good care and good care and good care, you can have a wait.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
Mr. Chairman, may I say that we have some of the commission that I have a few to ask Mr. Frandert.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
I have some of my thoughts on the responsibilities of the commission.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
When I was in Brown, I know that.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I know that the commission is a person.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
I have a few Mr. Chairman of the Robert's, the very center.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
The information has information of various listeners.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
That then he should be willing to inform the committee.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Take the oath and across the examines.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
However, there's a share of those.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I am an early witness here.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
The share is running the committee.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
So I'm afraid that.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And it will be the same, but the share obviously.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Thank you.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Thank you.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
It's perfect.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I'm going to finish the one surprise today.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
You got it now.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You know, I'm expected.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Move.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Some of the planners came in and handed.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Some of the drivers out to your note.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Notifying you.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
You're going to make a speech on the floor.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Mr. Chairman.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Please excuse the hurt.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
The rumors to be afraid.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Some of the members of your staff are interviewed with the department of the Army on behalf of the former consultant.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I'm very shy.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
I have directly quoted from the first sentence of the letter.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Have enough time to make a speech.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
But now get away from Senator Flammnys.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
And talk about the issues of this party, Rick.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
He's wondering if we made it.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
I'm sorry, but he's taking it back.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Yes, he looked like they quoted.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Senator, that's December 22.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
That's December 22.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Five months for the day.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Approximately four and a half months we've seen.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.000
From the time you first discussed, Shine was generally heard.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I'm sure you're a calculation of strength.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Not because there's a matter of fact.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
I've been disappointed not because this is an intervention on behalf of the Shine's movement.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
The department of the Army gone far beyond the rumors state.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Well, sir.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Well, then, did you hear such rumors, Senator?

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
The rumors, as I can see, morning that this letter was written.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
One of the greatest comments by an artist that I know.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
A man who had any payroll for four years, a number of the coming of the party.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
According to the testimony from under cover at the IAgent.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
This was marked by a testify to that.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
We've got a lot of evidence.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Let me finish.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Let me show you.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
This is this.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
This is a rumor glue.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
And why I'm hiding in front of a book.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
As I say, the morning the letter was written.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
A newsman who had any payroll.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
A man identified as an undercover at the IAgent of the Communist.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Get any money payroll for four years.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
This Communist was covering the House on American Activities Committee.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
During all of which time our sooner or the time was condemning the House Committee.

23:05.000 --> 23:14.000
He had any payroll of another man who was then named under oath as a Communist.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
This individual as far as I know has done more to serve the Communist cars.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
And we defend Guards.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
A swears against those that dare to fight Communism and perhaps any of them.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Any other writer I know.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And some running a close second.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
A month morning, Rotei, call.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
The usual smear column of Mr. Cohn and Mr. Shine.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
The individual I refer to is...

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
...June Kirsten.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
And I saw this article.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I think I've seen some before that.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
I don't recall by whom I think the outpops were written some.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
And I thought that even though I had told the Secretary verbally,

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
a number of times I thought my position was...

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
...when the Communist lineers started to lose their attacks,

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
I thought that I should put in writing what my position was so that there could be no question about it ever in the future.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
And that now set a democracy as free as up these humans.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
I wouldn't say only from this smear article I think there were a number before that.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
But Senator, you knew as of December 22nd.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
That they had been in a lot of fault.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The California Council.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Between the members of the staff and Adams and the Secretary of the Office to protect...

24:36.000 --> 24:43.000
I think an effort to card my chiefs and staff members to the Secretary of the Office to run down these rumors.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And found me living up there with any baseless and facts to them.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
I think you'll find a memorandum on that...

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
...what day does that?

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Memorandum on the 21st.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
That was the day before I wrote the flutter.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
And if you refer that memorandum, let me also judge the white upon this.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
As a matter of thought?

25:03.000 --> 25:12.000
It was a combination of circumstances that induced me to try and head off the swears much as I could.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
May I say, Mr. Jenkins, of that time?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Of that time and up until the...

25:18.000 --> 25:26.000
...even the 22nd of January, after the 24th of February, as a Mr. Mr. Stevens, there was no coin ever.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
But Mr. Turner had been guilty of any wrongdoing.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
That was thought up.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
That apparently was thought up at the last minute with the hope that they could get.

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
Not only my chief council, but with the hope that they could also get my chiefs and staff knowing...

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
...that that way they could do a great extent correct the committee.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Better as the 20th day of the summer now.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Four in a half and nearly five months.
