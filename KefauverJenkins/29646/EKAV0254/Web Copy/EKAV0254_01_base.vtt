00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Many of you come, Jordan.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Chair would like to welcome, on behalf of the committee, the guests who have come here today.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm going to start with the call to your attention if you're here for the first time.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
The fact that there is a standing committee rule for bidding,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
valuable manifestations of the provoked, or disapproved.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
And you, who are in use of the uniform numbers of the capital police force, which is given for you,

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
and the plain, growing street force gathered in the office.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
I have standing instructions from the committee to remove from the committee room immediately,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
or I'm going to put polite lines.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Any of you who are reasons that know the yourself, either of the provoked,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
the conditions under which you are in the room,

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
I, we have had just one of the provoked, the operations of the audience,

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
for these 16, one or two sessions that we have had with the committee,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
and I'm sure that as the entry-what, with the Jenkins calls to provide a deal,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
you will continue to give us that type of cooperation.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
We have some of the thoughts on the standing,

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
some projections for competitive direct examination,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
that must have yet to be in traffic domination,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
and we'll continue with this time to traffic domination,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
something that might have happened.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
To overcome the continued air traffic domination,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
we respect to the charges filed against you in your firm,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
by students in the office.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I need you to stay here to look from here,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
but you knew that you did not think that,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
that, shine, but,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
a traffic only is up to you,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
that you feel that is correct, is it not?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
No, I'm not.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Thank you.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
For your way of the fact that,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I was on October 27th,

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
approximately one week before the date of the induction of this young man,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Mr. Cohen,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
and the Army officials by a two-story,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
follow-up by Mr. Shawn,

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
beginning as the date of his induction to written on the third.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Mr. Cohen mentioned that he was going to ask,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
for a delay in Mr. Shawn's induction,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
so I could finish up some work at first,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
and I told him,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I thought that was all right,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
and we talked about it a few days later, and decided,

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
that it will be unwise from the standpoint of the Army's press relations.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
The next thing there is another attack,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Mr. Cohen, this is not correct,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
but we understand it,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
and a few days later,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
we'll more or less,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
count them under that request,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
and I collect them in that assumption.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Well, if I talk to them over with the lawyer there,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
they'll say that

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
we'll come here and worry about anything with the committee after he had been inducted,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
and he says,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
do these work?

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
The Army is evening after training on his weekends, and he was on duty.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And you still apply,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
either as a secretary of the Army or a madam,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
or as a duty,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
or not,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I think that they have applied,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
so I may have applied.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Anyway, you knew that everything was going to work,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
but this,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
chronologically now,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
the request was made by the Chief Counsel for a two-week show-off,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
you are some member of your staff,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
a few days later,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
how do members have the request?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And that's the right business.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, it's a holden slightly clear,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
full of temporary duty in the New York area,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
but we ask them to cancel that temporary duty

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
after the duty of Port Vic.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And we're not everyone to fail it.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
And then I, today,

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I think you have made known to the secretary or a madam

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
that you did not bring such.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
They told him that,

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
you guys,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Mr. Colm,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
subsequently making that type known to the Army,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Mr. Colm requested

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
that, shine me alive,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
that we get involved

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
by a part of the first week,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
by the first week of

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
our years to a duty.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Well, I think what Mr. Colm did,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
the very call with Mr. Winning,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
was very call my conversation was going.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
This is just a new effect,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
as it serves the authority of a term,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
and nothing but the accomplished over the weekend,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
and therefore Dave should say,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and work on that course over that weekend,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
and be inducted on Monday morning.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
So, there were three different conversations with the Army.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
I was a secretary and Mr. Adams,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
during the week of October 27th

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
to November 3rd,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
with weapons today, shine,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
and with weapons to

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
grinding hard and knife,

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
some unusual,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
really jar of different things.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
That's correct in the sense.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
There were three conversations with you.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
They're from the Army.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Then, suddenly, on November 6th,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
the date of the luncheon at the Pentagon,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
with Mr. Williams and Mr. Adams,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
and until the year of Mr. Colm,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
it's called,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
the subject of way shine with the sights.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
But you're not?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Only November 6th.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I beg your pardon,

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
I beg your pardon, Senator,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
and if November 6th,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
instead of November 6th,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
you're referring now to the luncheon at the Pentagon,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
that's correct.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I think Dave,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
the shines in the green of an lens,

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
and however not the subject of the conversation.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Well, some days,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
we understand that one of the subjects

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
of the conversation

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
was the investigation.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
He was in conducting the observation of the Army,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
and picking up the Port Mama.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
That's correct, isn't it?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm sorry, I didn't get to talk about it.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
We understand it, one of the subjects

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
discussed about luncheon at the Pentagon,

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
on November 6th,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
was the investigation of the observation of the Army,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
particularly the Port Mama.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Yes, we also discussed the

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
investigation of information programs

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
of the government printing office

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
compared to the federal cooperation we're getting.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So, probably,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Mr. Stemund,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
what's the type we've got from other two luncheers?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And another subject,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
and there was a shine, wasn't it?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Mr. Hagen's was very calm.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
There was some discussion about

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
all in Dave's to have

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
all the time,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
so he would not be intending

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
to work on his many works.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Now, Hagen,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
don't time me down to date,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
because November 6th,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I've been in him in particular,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
but I know we did on occasion,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
and Mr. Stemund was a great poet,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
and I agree that

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
this was most favorite of Dave's time,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
so I want him to work on committee work

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
from the other drafts,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
these were

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
full engaging in recreation,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
I think that's about five recreation centers,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
and I think that's the fourth draft.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I think that's about,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
right then.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Senator, allow me

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
to take your recollection

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
and I am calling

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
from a number

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
of mystical

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
dates

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
to the number six.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Well, just a little bit like that for them around them.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Listen to me.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I better do your check.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
All right, let's do it.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
you told him

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
before in the season.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
You were jammed up trying to get out of the post to style,

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
and with a moment in this division,

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
and a day shine was about to end the army,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
and had much information

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
and material on the reports

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
and investigations,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
and of me

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
could not get along without

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Mr. Steven

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
said in the range to make the complete the work

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
over the game to make it any hour.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I think that's very correct for me

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
of the preparation,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
but Mr. Steven said that he said there.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Well,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
it was worked

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
after hours in the Manhattan training duty.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
So, for the reason that he's four times now,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
that the French defense

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
is showing with disgust

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
between you and your staff and the army,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
and the French defense is affecting the staff.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Steven,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
the team from October 27th to November 6th,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
took me from four years before you mentioned this.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Some of you,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
four months have been a lot.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
From the time it was known,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
the shine was to be in disgust,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
until this request was made

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
in your sentence,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
not Mr. Cone,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
of the security army,

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
of the Pentagon,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
of the Olympics.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
That's correct, isn't it?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
I'll just put the camera off

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
for a little move on the four months.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
That's right.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Why, Senator McCartney,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
was this young man not to

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
try to complete his work,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
and get it up to base,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
and get his reports to you.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Now, doing that so much

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
that he was known to you

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
and your staff that he was living in,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
has had approximately the first of November.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, it's just a little bit of a reason why he was working

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
for nothing,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
because it's very limited from the committee,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
so when I did,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I hired a researcher,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
very confident plan,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
with the Chicago Bytes flag,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
and so, trying to allow the likes of him,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
to proceed to the right through the reports,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
so, however, I have a day of interviewing witnesses,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
he was very patient doing that,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
worked all day long,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
doing his paidy,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
doing long distance calls,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and he called with the suits.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I looked,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
so I did shift,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I tried to shift that work to Mr.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Carole Bytes flag.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
So, for some reason,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
you mean to call it,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
call the committee,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
that this boy had filed up

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
such a tremendous amount of work,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
that he could not bring it up to date,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
and get his work completed,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
he made so much day to time,

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
when it was known,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
that at the end,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
there's not so much he was moving.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Mr. Dengol,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
may I say a few,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
if I'm right,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
we're told he's not off all work,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
and it's not all of the time working on the reports.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
He could have had those reports ready,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I believe,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
but the man he was inducted.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
However, I felt that,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
he was more valuable,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
he was viewing Wittleson,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I had already researched your shoes,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
give a job of drafting your reports.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
I found that later,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
that just didn't work out,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I had no reflection upon it,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
to Bytes flag,

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I found that the man who's merely read the records,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
had not worked and lived with the subject,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
couldn't have worked there,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
but the way the number of reports we had,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
the report on Baker East,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Baker West,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
then all the proposed waste

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
of some 18 million dollars,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
such as cancer,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
about during our hearings,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
where the report on the voice of America,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
which is a radio space,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
and all the information programs,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
we had the income reports

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
from the information program of the whole,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
we had also two of the projects,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
which, incidentally,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
had to drop from the design left,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
because either the man who was supervising

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
and one was the investigation of that phase

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
of the information program

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
which had to do with movies,

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
and the other with crap.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
So it was just a question of judgment,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
now, whether I use good judgment or bad judgment,

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
or maybe open to arguments,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
but, considering having been quit-quaking

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
and all these different opinions,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
and since all these time and the reports,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I hired a researcher to find the reports.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
The one to stand the subject of literature explanation,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
is that childhood,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
indeed, is being that former Canadian interwoven listening,

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
rather than bringing his records up to date

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
and completing his work,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
I guess today, when he's here,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
we can hear him committing.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Well, number one,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
I assume it's the Jenkins that I,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
of course, when I can't tell you

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
what any investigator did in today,

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
I, uh, have a job of chamomile

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
and the subcommittee on appropriations,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
chamomile of the full-smitting and government operations,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I've been offered a tremendous amount of work,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I guess the end result of the work.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
All I can tell you is that,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
the person who wrote,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
and Mr. Cohen and I are discussed with Mr. Cire,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
a question of whether or not we should have devised,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
uh, discontinue all work,

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
and plenty of time writing reports,

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
whether we should hire a researcher

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
to write the reports,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
and a devise continue doing what he was doing,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
and if I just have to have devise continue in our,

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
come the day,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
be front-interview witnesses,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I know some days, be a ton of hearings,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
hearings of witnesses who made interviews,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
not sort of being,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
but, uh,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I just can't tell you

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
what each and all of us together

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
was doing every minute of the day.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
One day in short,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
there is the future completed.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
A number on your staff,

14:41.000 --> 14:48.000
who was known to be subject to the work for a period of four months,

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
far too long ago,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
by being a former state,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
a pain in numerous telephone calls

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
and personal contacts were made on his behalf,

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
by being the least-thinking news of the disease,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
and for several days I have to admit,

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
I think you now have now mentioned some four personal contacts

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
on behalf of this boy,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
in an upper-tigurish furlough,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
our prices over the weekend,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
and he might get his work up.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Now, since the materials,

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
he's been talking rather of sustainable telephones,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
a large waste of running office,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
and to business,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
and to allow this boy to form the university of time.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Without the calling, he means a knows-and-unsafe himself,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
and he's a member of his father.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
So the report's done so that he could go that on in the army

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
like every other private,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
and serve like every other private.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Mr. Durban, where I,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I've heard of you,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
we've just arrived at two furloughs

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
to show him how working for nothing brings one expert to us,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
and I ain't for all that.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
So we agreed that he could help us write their reports

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
on his off-time for the weekend,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and there's nothing training.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
He did the hard work out very well.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
He graduated as you know,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
with a superior rating for Fort Bix,

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
his commanding officer at Camp Gordon,

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
a bit of a general forward that has been general-hard.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
May they public statement that he can fit any one of his bank

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
and can't put this verbatim to one of his outstanding drafties.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
So it has been proven, Mr. Jenkins,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
that we did follow the right course,

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
that Mr. Shane did do his work,

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
otherwise he could not end up with a superior rating as a trainee,

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
and one of the outstanding soldiers at Camp Gordon.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
And you see, Mr. Mr. Trichett,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
isn't there...

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
You recall his mother's call of November 7th

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
as we go in the record I'm sure.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
You have to identify and kill that other copy of it.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
But they...

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
This is one of the final copies of that.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
But call it on.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
That's the day following this luncheon

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
is November 6th in the Pentagon.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
It's on the record.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
He calls it now.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Look, I have a copy of it by Trust me.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
It's in the record, I know.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
I wonder if it's...

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
One of those things that get me...

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
It's November 6th, it's December 6th, 1984.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Can I have you the record, or the original...

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Well, I think we have it right here.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
There's Mr. Jim Juliana going to the record for the Senate.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
He had it in the world.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And the last is to find Carman, the Senate.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
The Carving on the right is to write one of the back comments.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Jim Juliana.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Don't search in the record.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
It's nothing.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
We'll just save time with your hand at me.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
It's in 1984.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm sorry, I didn't know the next day.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Carman, he's the Senate.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I think we have it right now.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
All right, Mr. Dragon.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
And I'm leading the House on the Senate.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
This testimony is a special, well-mannered call.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
The Senate is leading it again.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Oh, the Senate can get all three games.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Base, Roy, play.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The Senate is leading it again.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
The Senate is just there.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The Senate is leading it.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
The Senate is leading it.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
It is one of the things I have seen in you...

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
...completely unreasonable about.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
They will question me that statement.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
If you're a conversation with the Secretary on the November cover...

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I am inclined to think so, that is.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Now, third of the matter is...

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
...that the statement will select the truth...

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
...that he is one of the few things that is the subject of day shine...

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
...that Mr. Colman is unreasonable about.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
That's good. I didn't send him a copy.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And all of the enemies should be in all candy.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
When in all kinds of broken in the Roy night...

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
...this agreed. He felt that...

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
...it would be necessary for a day to send all of these off-terms...

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
...working on the reports.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
I felt that a recession with your advice lying...

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
...could write the reports about tuna seeds...

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
...and they, if I could get you the records...

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
...it could blow the oil, it could, and right.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I found that...

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
...and what I'm not confident with your advice lying was...

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
...the cold record did not give him a picture.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
After Mr. Barthler, I had written a draft of the report.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
I sent it back down there, and sent it down a day...

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
...it had him work on it.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
And we had, I think, about...

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
...how many three or four drafts.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Three or four drafts were reports before we got a report...

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
...that I was satisfied with.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
And while I thought that Roy was wrong...

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
...I think that we're unreasonable as much...

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
...should not be used, I should say wrong.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
I thought Roy was wrong, I thought we could...

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
...get along with maybe one or two weekends...

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
...and months of Barthler I could get down and talk to.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
And there...

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
...I found that Mr. Cohen was right...

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
...and that we had to have this work done by Mr. Shine...

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
...because he had been living it and eating it and sleeping it...

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
...and breathing it for a month and a month...

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
...finishing all the licenses.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
And if you will check the reports, I think you will agree with me...

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
...Mr. Jenkins that he did.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
And for the next one job and also...

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
...when I said in view of his superior ratings in training...

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
...it appears that this work certainly did not interfere with his training.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And then anything Mr. Jenkins...

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
...I just can't see how many special favors...

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
...for a driver to allow him to work...

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
...when the other pilots are out on recreation...

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
...going to dance through, going to the recreation hall.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
And as I recall the testimony...

21:29.000 --> 21:36.000
...Mr. Shine never avoided any duty of any kind.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
All the means of duty works and I think you should get very cut off from that...

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
...and sort of cut off.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
So here is the timely complete of his work with his committee...

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
...as it turns up on date on the reports Mr. Jenkins' yet...

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
...but the occasions I was there with him last week...

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
...I asked Roy to contact me there and ask you about certain individuals...

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
...over the voice of America, the main information program...

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
...who have certain additional information...

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
...I think the matter will be on that, but I assume...

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
...as long as we see that whether I am information program intensive...

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
...I will have to answer the comments to Shine...

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
...those calls will not interfere with his duty I guarantee you.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
But generally, I too shine when two camps go out...

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
...in your committee function right on smoothly and efficiently as I do that...

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
...with Mr. Jenkins' yet to express the whole organization duty.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
...with Mr. Jenkins' we drop through investigations.

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
We drop the investigation of the motion picture branch of the information program...

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
...we drop the investigation of the cross-section of the information program...

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
...there's Mr. Shine had not left our committee.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
He would have continued on our motion investigations...

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
...I feel, since they are very important, the investigation required...

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
...if I even have the same...

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
...yes, I am with that attention to your committee secretary...

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
...I think every investigator in Mr. Jenkins' and essential...

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
...we can get along with anyone, with any two.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
There's no man who is indisputable, I do not have the responsibility...

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
...to appoint him and I'm here to know where the investigation is.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
An investigator, an individual member of your staff.

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
I heard Mr. Bartflying to do the work that Mr. Shine was doing.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
There's some of the inhibitions he was telling the secretary of the Army...

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
...on November 7th that one of the things that Rory was completely unreasonable about...

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
...was the subject of Bill Shine.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
In this weather and I think...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
...he, me, why?

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Things may be a general.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
And work from the pit hospital without us.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
The investigation has really reflected...

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
...the legal farmer's carcass estimates and the trace of Bill Shine is that type of...

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Mr. Jenkins, I'm sure that no one reading this...

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
...I think that this was a serious comment.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Bob Stevens and I were in good terms.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
We ripped each other back and forth.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
We ripped Rory and he certainly, no one could think that I thought...

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
...I should be a general working from the penthouse of the Waldorf.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
No, but Senator McCarty, you were just investigating the importance of...

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
...they, Shine Banding, you talk with the secretary.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
You had been nice with the day before.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
I knew the hood Mr. Colme asked the secretary...

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
...to allow Shine to have the first two weeks...

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
...that he, but for all the projects that are in the army...

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
...half of the week in the army in space in New York City, area.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
You heard that, hadn't you?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I heard the testimony.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Yes, sir.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And, shall we go?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
You mean that the testimony isn't correct about that?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You answered one question, which I haven't answered.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
You said it was by the Saturday day of Shine.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
The answer is no.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Thank you, sir.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I told Bob Stevens and the flutter...

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
...and, uh...

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
...it's rather chopped up on the circuit here.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
It wasn't the flutter.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
I said that he was a good man, but he wasn't indispensable.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
And I asked you for the signature.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
If you didn't pay, say it says it's expected by the monitor.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
The monitor's called.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I think they're right.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
You get me a page with a number and fifty-three.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Eighth and eight.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
The future in the area.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Right, sir.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Put it all.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Mr. Baker, talking with Mr. Baker.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Mr. Baker's 15th post.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
And the president would be calling you not to pay favorit...

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
...because anyone is on a committee.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
I think the wise states that he's been letting them back.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
For me, James, our益ing story is very, very good.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I won't get too much.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Maybe if they say these are odds, they don't work on that.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Not something that might be...

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
...you are right.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
Husting the 60-kays Army to let this young man...

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
...who needs to say why, or am I reasonable about?

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
And who needs to say why, wants to be a general running the Army...

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
...from a fair out from the border?

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I know, Mr. Jenkins.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Let's not speak that too much.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
We both know that.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
That had to be a facetious remark.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
There we are.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Both with the facetious when you ask the 60-k...

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
...to let this young man off for weekends...

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
...are something so he won't get too old soon.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Mr. Jenkins.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
The question is facetious.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
What do you think of the day before that on the 6th?

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
We had to cut the matter of bomb statements.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
The drawings and I deferred about the drawings...

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
...but no one else would be able to write the reports.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And why was proven right?

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
I felt that I'm research-shaking right for reports.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
They've got to take this conversation connection with that.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
Obviously, the secretary wouldn't think that...

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
...after I told him to give this young man no special favors...

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
...that I wanted him to release.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
So he could see his girlfriend because of every private...

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
...if he released her from weekends...

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
...and they can see their girlfriend's lovely once I believe.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
What's the two-spin man?

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
That even suspicion was hard to restrict the shine...

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
...between the dates of October 27th and November 7th...

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
...are he paid about 11 days.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
For 50 minutes and a minute Mr. Jenkins, I think...

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
...that we should read the first paragraph of this...

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
...monitor's call into the record...

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
...so there can be no question about the tenure of the Congress.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Have there been objections he's doing this period?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
But first I'd like to make a question please.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Mr. Barnes, it's two to five.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Now the day's shine.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
I've been discussed with the secretary of the Army...

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
...I had them reading the speech...

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
...after the 27th and November 7th are the battle of the days.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
That's the election.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
I believe that's the failure.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Now you may be the first factor.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Here's the monitored calls.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
I say I don't like this idea of these dropping...

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
...but here I think it's on a form of valuable service.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
Keep in mind that the secretary knew that the call was being used...

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
...grap down I did not.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
And...

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
...you know what I said?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
I said Bob, did that work out all right?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
You were set up for action yesterday?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Yes, it did, Joe.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
So we'd gone down.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
I'd like to ask you one personal favor.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
For God's sake, don't put day them service...

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
...and I'm not finding them back to my committees.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
From three standpoints.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
One, I couldn't get away with it any more than a week.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
The new faceless would be back on us...

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
...the friend of a son, grabbing a man...

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
...and you'd have to send him back in uniform anyway.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
Two, this thing is running long so cleanly so far.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
They have not been able to beat your brims up.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
There's nothing the left wingers would like better.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
They don't like this cooperation between the Committee and the Army.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
And the third thing they would say I asked for it.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
He was a good boy, but there's nothing indispensable about him.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
From my death today I can pick up letters...

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
...and perhaps half a dozen mothers.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Some of his boys are in worst shapes and days.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
And if it would be embarrassing, it's hell to me.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Now, the friends are the garb of our again embarrassing.

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
It's not a mean that if I were asked for something for a day...

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
...and not for the other boys...

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
...you'll find there Mr. Jenkins, I made it very clear...

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
...that there were vast numbers of cases.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
What is in my death is that I said this very day...

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
...from young men who needed special consideration.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Far worse than they have shined it, and I said, for God's sake, don't give him any.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
I keep in mind with the Jenkins, I didn't know this was being monitored.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
So that I think that this bill serve a rather useful purpose.

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
I think the conversation beyond that I think should be taken in the light of this request.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
This request, that he not give him special consideration.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
So I point out that there are many other young men who have...

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
...must be able to reason to get special consideration.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
So this is Mr. Adams over here in the room...

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
...complete the bat Roy Cohn's abuse of him on account of Dave Shind.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
No, sir.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
The Eucalyptus testimony of Mr. Adams...

31:23.000 --> 31:28.000
...let on December 9th, even to you and complain that...

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
...that Mr. Coln had been abusing him about Dave Shind.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
The Eucalyptus testimony of the guy he called him.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
He's testimony.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
To appreciate your collection, Senator, I ought to read it to you.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
Please 25-70 to the record.
