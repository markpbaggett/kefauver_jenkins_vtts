WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I call for a ruling from the chair.

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
I think that question has been asked and answered.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
It will be found in the records.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
He is twenty-one.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
He's up there.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Mr. Thorne, proceed.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
So, Mr. Secretary, I can't use the phone.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Mr. Secretary, not a fact that the Navy waters before those issues,

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
a list was sent over to Mr. Adams, your knowledge,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
containing the name of additional communists.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
When I thought I would throw that in sight,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
a list was communicated to Mr. Adams,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
either in writing or telephonically,

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
containing six names, not the communists in the military,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
and that we ask for the production of those people before this subcommittee.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Mr. Chairman, I do not understand what Mr. Thorne refers to as this report.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
You'll be in the...

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm referring to the army of men making charges against Senator McCaw,

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
the Mr. Car and myself, which are through a fall,

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
the work of our committee and the occasion of the presence of all of us in this room, sir.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
The report of March 11, 1954,

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
reporting to be a chronological account of events from 34 pages long.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
That was the matter to which I refer,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
and my question is to the Secretary, Mr. Welch,

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
whether or not he knows that the Navy for that report was released.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
The Secretary's office was asked to produce before this committee,

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
which is an additional communist, then currently in the military.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Here, here, that's my question to the Secretary.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Mr. Adams informs me that there was a request made in connection with six people.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I don't know whether they were communists or not.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Now, sir, my next question to you is this, Mr. Secretary.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
As Mr. Adams likewise informed you that he had told Mr. Car

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
that if we would stop the hearings and call no more of these communists,

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
or people who had covered them up, this report would not be issued.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I never heard any such thing.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Mr. Adams tell you he had called Mr. Car and invited him to lunch

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
and taken him to the Methodist but the lunch a few days before this report was issued.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I should think that you've asked Mr. Adams these questions,

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
but I don't know about them.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
So I'm inquiring about very important matters which I know, but I don't know about them.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Why don't you ask the frontiers?

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Mr. Chairman, before this his question was dismissed,

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I have no recollection, Mr. Adams.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I should be questioned.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
All right, sir.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
If you have testimony here and see if I understand that you have no recollection

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
of Mr. Adams telling you of a lunch and meeting with Mr. Frank Car of Alistair

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
a few days before this report was issued.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I don't remember that at all.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
You don't remember that at all.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I do not recall it.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
If Mr. Adams made any representation at that lunch and meeting

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
with the acting with your permission or without your permission,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
he was acting on his own.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
He was acting strictly on his own.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
That's correct.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
In other words, he would have had no authority from you to say that if our hearings were stopped

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
in the end, but normal accompaniment in the army of people who covered them up,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
a report which would be embarrassing to us was not the issue.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
He certainly would have no such authority to think for me on that way at any time,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
at any place, in any lunch room.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I see.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
And he did not discuss with you any communication with Mr. Car myself

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
or Senator McRathy on this round.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
That's right.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I answered that question.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I see.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I want to get that very clear.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
As I said, it's not very tough.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I answered that question.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Very well.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Now sir, the next question is this.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Have you had a chance to confer with your counsel and have they been able to advise you whether

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
there is any provision in the laws of this land which gives immunity from the expertise

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
to members of the loyalty board of your office?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Mr. Chairman, that I think was the subject of a memorandum.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
That is, it was the subject of a memorandum which I believe it has been delivered and is

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
important.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.500
Yes sir, and I find that not memorandum, not one citation, or a word, indicating that there

03:50.500 --> 03:53.000
is any such immunity from response to the pina.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
And that is why, having examined that memorandum, I am now, if I may, Mr. Chairman, proceeding

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
to question the secretary on this field.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
You have to remember, and if you need part of the record, it's certainly available to me.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I have part of the record and marks it to property and given numbers.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Very well.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Number 14.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
You remember seeing that you have part of the record.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
And I have the last question, right?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Question, sir, the next question is this.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
If you have a chance to confer with your counsel and have they been able to advise you whether

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
there is any provision in the laws of this land which gives immunity from the pina to members

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
of the law of the board, top your office.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
What they have, for a point of interest, find the letters, find an engraved shirt that

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
they have made under the project, and it's fair that's fine, Mr. Cohn, if there were no

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
side teachings in the memorandum.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
I say, Mr. Jackson, sir, that I read this memorandum and I see in the end not one citation

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
given immunity from the e-creation, specifically responding to a pina which is my question to a

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
lot of people.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
And if I'm wrong, sir, I'm like, well, I have to confer in the five-taxion from page four.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I have a chance to read from them.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I see no such citation in there and I don't think there is any in the law of our land.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
On law, I would like to see.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
The woman of the record of five-taxion has told me that there is no such thing as that.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
I would think this is exit, but I think he put no such regulation in there.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
I would have a suggestion on the local appeal to the U.S.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
and the point of order.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
The most confused thing, Mr. Cohn, may it be my fault and I would say very happy and

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
careful Mr. Cohn, you need to find a paragraph on page five of which the Attorney General has been

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
decelerated in position in the next, I mean the evening of the year.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Do I understand, sir, the distance from the Attorney General Continuing to the final verse?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
I thought this was from Mr. Well.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I don't know if it's from this.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I don't know if it's from this.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Then whoever's from this, it seems to be from the Attorney General in the final verse.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Well, I thought it was from this one.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It doesn't need any general purpose.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
It's made from fire and it does not know it's not a well.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Because the Chair and Fire Minister Dean, Mr. Chairman, Secretary,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Mr. Chairman, do you do some experiments from whom did you get a proof of that?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Mr. Secretary, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Chairman, I'd say to the Attorney General,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
I'd say to the Attorney General, that the citizen I didn't put in the case of me

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
by one of Mr. Well, the citizens, the case of the Well,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
the citizens, the case of the Well, the citizens, they start to talk about the well.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't get to tell you there's no such a charge.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
This is called that.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
I have a number and it was prepared by law and the defendive law.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
I'm tying this law to the Nigel of the Seven Laws and I am trying to tell people what ecosistence is.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm trying to tell people what the law is.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm assuming what the Chair is explaining is dependent on the well.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
If the Secretary is trying to defend the well, the citizens have been clear enough to prefer for the lawyers to do it.

06:49.000 --> 06:49.000


06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
But I do think that the committee is entirely known to do this.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Who did it?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I'll find out.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I don't actually know.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I presume it's positively prepared in the office of the Department of Counselor.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Mr. Chairman, may I make a guess?

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
I think it would be well to get back to the original question which seems to be simple and proper and it is this.

07:08.000 --> 07:17.000
The heavy Mr. Secretary had an opportunity to confer with your counsel and receive advice from them

07:17.000 --> 07:28.000
as to whether or not there were any directives or laws prohibiting the issuance of a subpoena to be served upon a member of a lawy-led board.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
That's a simple question.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
No, sir, I have not had that opportunity.

07:31.000 --> 07:40.000
And you have received no advice from your counsel as to whether or not there is such a directive or is such a prohibitory law.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Is that correct?

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I have not had any even seen this memorandum.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
We've tried to prepare and get it in here.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
I know that this is a subject in which the Attorney General has a great deal of interest.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
And the matter has been to him.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Well, do not thank your question, Mr. Coleman.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
I would very much like if I may to respond to Senator Jack Lebs.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I think he's entitled to an answer to that.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
I think Coleman asked you to ask your question to the Secretary and the Secretary has given the direct answer.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm not going to try to get that open to anybody from any further questioning that's been clear on his way.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
I think Senator Dredge did ask me to call on a question under a point of information and if you want to answer this.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I think Senator Jack Lebs and Piles have an answer.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
I would like to give him one.

08:25.000 --> 08:39.000
Senator Jack Lebs, the purpose of our ethnic questions and the purpose of my writing at this point is that I fully agree that there is no citation in the law of this land which gives immunity from response to the law of this land.

08:39.000 --> 08:56.000
From response to a statement, the members of the Royal Devoids, it is our theory and we hope we will prove it rather rapidly that there is a reason that Mr. Stevens and Mr. Harris try to stop from calling members of the Royal Devoids,

08:56.000 --> 09:15.000
the adherence of those members of the board would prove personally embarrassing to Mr. Stevens and Mr. Harris in that which shows that members of the board themselves had records of communist front activity and had been consistently following the clear comments.

09:15.000 --> 09:28.000
Now, if that is the purpose of this line of interrogation and it is cited in our specification and it is one of our very strongest judges here, chairman of the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Thank you, Mr. Coal.

09:29.000 --> 09:41.000
I will now add to Mr. Secretary if you can tell us of any regulation in the law of this land which would give legal authority to the recess by yourself and Mr. Attis,

09:41.000 --> 09:53.000
that members of the Royal Devoids be held in use from physical response to the speech of subjects and that is how I conclude the role of Mr. Chairman.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
I am very excited to share this.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
I think you are ready to not just question the question, but we will be ready to question it.

10:03.000 --> 10:18.000
I will now add to Mr. Secretary if you can tell us of any regulation in the law of this land which would give legal authority to the recess by yourself and Mr. Adam, that members of the law of the board be held in use from physical response to the speech.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Mr. Secretary, if this is the purpose, I think you may not be able to answer any other law you have been stated.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
He doesn't have any information.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
He doesn't have.

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
I am not a lawyer and I don't have the information but I would like to lease a case of this matter of loyalty to something in which the Attorney General has agreed in.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
Mr. President, do you know of any regulation?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Do you know of any regulation governing?

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
As whether or not the member of the law you report is, if you need some action, it is to see you appear before the McCarty Committee.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
I don't personally know about that but I am not saying a lawyer, sir.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I just don't feel confident between action and legislative.

10:56.000 --> 11:07.000
Mr. Jenkins, I might say that we could move right on if I could get a stipulation from Mr. Wells or any other council representative that there is no such position in the law of this land.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I believe that has begun to see a little faster.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
Mr. Wells, do you know how to lease a court in the Court?

11:14.000 --> 11:23.000
I say this is always better and I don't believe that he is a wasn't in lawyer or a lawyer or a lawyer and I hope to see how he can give you a current bill of opinion.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
That he is a lot of wedge and I think he is about all of the law dealing with the lawyer.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
Mr. Chair, if you want, you are afraid you will have arisen well since very accurate measures.

11:35.000 --> 11:46.000
I think if you have any direct questions or questions, how could we, I am here about to, I am in regulation that Mr. Stevens should have the right to confer with the military council.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
We have really found this very comfortable.

11:48.000 --> 11:56.000
Mr. Van Hitch, the whole purpose of our deferring this inquiry for two or three days, the given is the opportunity to get this information.

11:56.000 --> 12:08.000
The week has shown that there was no legal authority for his attempts to stop us from calling the members of the board and go on to show that he and Mr. Adam strike to stop us from calling these members for other reasons.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Chairman, Mr. Stevens, please.

12:14.000 --> 12:23.000
As I remember, the secretary has stated that his desire members will allow the board not to respond to the opinion.

12:24.000 --> 12:32.000
Mr. Cohen's theory is that the McCarthy Committee had he right to the opinion members of the Lawyers of the Board and have him appear and testify.

12:32.000 --> 12:41.000
Mr. Steve Smith, your secretary's position was that perhaps it was violated of a directive or a law.

12:42.000 --> 13:03.000
That therefore is illegitimate point of inquiry and it is open to proof and Mr. Cohen, our Senator McCarthy, will be entitled to proof whether or not there was a directive or a law that is susceptible to proof by others.

13:04.000 --> 13:16.000
Mr. Cohen has answered that he knows of no such restrictions himself or such laws himself and I suggest that he has no knowledge of it.

13:16.000 --> 13:32.000
Mr. Cohen, Mr. Secretary, as Mr. Jenkins has stated, you now advise us that you know of no such law or regulations.

13:33.000 --> 13:46.000
Would you please tell us a lot I've taken you to in your attempts to stop this committee from subpoenaing members of the Lawyers of the Board which Cleotunniers.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
I've testified as to Cohen that the Attorney General is very much interested in this matter.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
Mr. Chairman, this Board is talking about the question is not whether the Attorney General is interested in it.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
The question is why Mr. Stevens tried to get us to stop our hearings on the members of the Lawyers.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I think the Board is having a question.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Mr. Secretary, you are not responsive to the question.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Mr. Chairman, you said the Attorney General was interested in the matter but you haven't said why.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Now what do you mean by the answer that you just made?

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Well, I'm sorry. The lawyer reports for all these departments, Senator Simonton.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Presumably, they must have some general guidelines under which they're offered.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Are you inclined that you're operating now on the guidelines from the Attorney General?

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
I'm wondering what is the term under my hot rule that Mr. Simonton interfere with, they cost me a little bit for someone.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Being done at the leniency of the Chair, I didn't notice the point of order.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I think the Attorney General would have to write a plan.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I would have to try to identify the answer to this call.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I would have to try it out. I think it would be an interesting time.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I do believe it's a matter of point of order.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
I'll make a point of order. I think a putt of them is an established for interrupting witnesses and...

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It is. The point of order. I'll be sure you have to be healed.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
All of the rest of my time to share these with my names.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I thank the people so healed.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm going to prolong these hearings and not shorten them.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
If the head's been such a president of the South, I'll look in the quickly event.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Chairman, since the time I had a man I have had an hour of water, but he was asking...

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
You're very questions that have occurred to the Council.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
And I think they're pertinent and may I or it may I or it be just this.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
The question?

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
Mr. Cohn, question of this, Mr. Secretary, which I regard as a simple question.

15:31.000 --> 15:41.000
And that is, it is I understandings that you have stated that you know you have no personal knowledge of any president of our other...

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
...actor of the directive or any law.

15:44.000 --> 15:52.000
Reminaries and members of the Law and the Board immune from tension is the thing that is issued by the McCarthy Committee.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
We start out as a predicate.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Then it's questioning it.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
That's the approach of the facts.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
What?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
What is your justification?

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
What is your reason for advising the members of the Law and the Board the monster's response to the procedure?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Have I corrected the same to your question?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I'll definitely take that.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
You've all stated it's out of my question.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Now assuming that you did not know what Senator signing in that view is,

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
that you did not know that there was a preventative directive or a law

16:26.000 --> 16:34.000
and assuming that you had advised the member of members of the Law and the Board not to appear, why did you do that?

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
Well, I didn't, as I recall it personally, like any action in regards to this matter.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
It's all a second hand with me.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
We can produce testimony that will be first hand for you and would like to do so.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
But I do know that we were trying to coordinate our policy in the Department of the Army

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
with early Attorney General, with the policy's affecting all oil efforts in all the parts, and we've been guided accordingly.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
So now Mr. Secretary, I'll ask you another way.

17:05.000 --> 17:14.000
Why did you, are any member of your command, any of the personnel of your command,

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
issue and order to any member of the Law and the Board not to respond to such issues?

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I thought I'd answer that much in doubt.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
That's your answer then.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I have no further question.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Do you have any time to answer?

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
I think there's no one else who has hired to share the time with us.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Ten of the time, if you want any of them.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I'll share that rule, that's very clear.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm under the rule of the procedure that you did not follow the time and process of yieldings that we did.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Very well.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
All right.

17:49.000 --> 17:58.000
Mr. Stevens, is it not a factor that, from the very early stages of our investigation going back to October,

17:58.000 --> 18:08.000
you felt it was the personally embarrassing to you if this committee follows the fact that members of your oil people had been clearing time?

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Did you not ever make such a statement to send them across the oil to me?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
I never did.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
Did you have any telephone conversations with me about that from your home?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
I don't recall any.

18:20.000 --> 18:30.000
Do you recall, sir, having any telephone conversations with me, from your home concerning possible embarrassment to you,

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
in the calling of a member or members of the loyalty board which has cleared time?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I do not recall.

18:37.000 --> 18:49.000
Do you recall any telephone conversations you had with me from your home concerning the calling of members of the loyalty board and the manner that was treated in the press?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I don't recall.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Mr. Stone.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Mr. Stone's time has expired.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
The council has been.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
No other questions, Mr. Chairman.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Mr. Stone, what has won you would like to ask in line with this memorandum, which is the matter of this debate?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I'm coming from the legal department of the ward department.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I would like to read, Mr. Secretary, this final paragraph.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I think this will clear it up.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
Then ask you to have your regular legal talent as divorced from your special legal talent, but in theory.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
Your regular legal talent and the ward department are dependent on.

19:20.000 --> 19:26.000
Find any thought if there be one with this paragraph, because if this paragraph is correct,

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
as quoted from your memorandum, it seems to me that answers the questions that Mr. Stone has been asked.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Final paragraph.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
A spot.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
So this statement is to Brown L.I.D. One qualification.

19:36.000 --> 19:46.000
He, meeting Brown L, he stated that if the congressional committee indicated they bona fide intentions to interrogate security board members

19:46.000 --> 19:56.000
who are misconducting in the performance of their official duties, the board members would probably be required to respond to the convener.

19:56.000 --> 20:04.000
Although they should be instructed, he refused to answer any question relating to their participation in the loyalty process.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Now, you have a copy of this.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I presume that you didn't hand them all in.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
I think this you should have your legal department find out whether that does correctly summarize the situation or not.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
And the committee will know and we can go on with that for that in the here.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Council would like to follow the stands at the target of the Senate.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
Mr. Brown is very pleased that they would like to give us the Attorney General's report on the legality of the here.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
You may step down, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Collier, may step to stand.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Yes, sir.

20:34.000 --> 20:43.000
We will immediately reach out the chair will add after the meeting of the letter from the Attorney General, or the exchange of correspondence with the Attorney General.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Mr. Chairman.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Mr. Collier was unspoorned yesterday.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
That's what it means to be sworn on.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
He's done the first step when you're about to give a kiss to Ho-Too.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
There's nothing but the kiss that helps you guys.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I do.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
You may be seated.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
Mr. Chairman, second, I would like that this time that my assistant council, Mr. Tom Kuitt,

21:02.000 --> 21:10.000
in terrible case of witness to Mr. Chairman, I will take over and counsel for this meeting and in terrible case of witness.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Mr. Groves.

21:13.000 --> 21:31.000
Mr. Collier at the instance of the committee that you on yesterday delivered the two and one quarter page reported copies of a memorandum from the Federal Bureau of Investigation II,

21:31.000 --> 21:46.000
the office of Mr. Herbert Brown-El, which requires that he give this committee and a opinion on the question of whether or not that information could be released properly.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I did.

21:47.000 --> 21:56.000
At approximately five, fifteen years ago, I delivered a letter from Senator Munt together with the two and one quarter page documents,

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
which I personally handed to Mr. Robert Minor, assistant to the deputy attorney general.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
Do you, too, in the opinion in writing from Mr. Brown-El?

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
I do. It was delivered at approximately twelve o'clock today.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Who is this?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
This is a letter.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I'm sorry.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I understand what you answered.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I can't even wrap it in the name of the match.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
I need my letter of ten-level question, Mr. Collier.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Mr. Collier, you may.

22:24.000 --> 22:37.000
This letter is dated May 5, 1954, and addressed to the Honorable Herbert Brown-El, Jr., United States Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.

22:37.000 --> 22:49.000
As chairman of this special Invest Beating Subcommittee and by its direction, I request your opinion as to whether or not the contents or any parts thereof

22:49.000 --> 23:17.000
can be released by this committee to the public of the following documents, one, a fifteen-page interdepartmental memorandum, dated January 26, 1951, from John Etgehers-Rupper Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, to Major General A.R. Bowling, Assistant Chief of Staff, D.2, Department of the Honour.

23:17.000 --> 23:29.000
The Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Subject, A.R. and Pymon Coleman, S.B.N.H., B.R., this document was classified confidential.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Two.

23:31.000 --> 23:46.000
A.2 and one quarter page letter dated January 26, 1951, from John Etgehers-Rupper Director, to Major General Bowling, Assistant Chief of Staff, D.2, Department of the Army, Washington, D.2.

23:46.000 --> 24:04.000
This document was classified, both personal and confidential, in both. This document was furnished to the committee on May 4th, by Senator Joseph Armacosti, and is being furnished to you for your perusal.

24:05.000 --> 24:21.000
By the barrel of this letter, Mr. Robert A. Codium, Assistant Counsel of the Special Investigating Subcommittee. Your expeditious attention to this matter will indeed be appreciated, with best wishes and kindness, personal regards.

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
I am cordially yours, sign, call, e-much, with you states, they renegade me.

24:29.000 --> 24:43.000
Attorney General is only letterhead of the Office of the Attorney General Washington, D.C., dated May 6, 1954, Honorable Call, e-much, United States Senate, Washington, D.C., my dear Senate.

24:43.000 --> 24:57.000
Upon receipt of your letter of May 5, I inquired concerning the 15 page memorandum referred to the area, and was advised that under date of January 26, 1951,

24:57.000 --> 25:20.000
a 15 page memorandum was addressed to Major General AR bowling, Assistant Chief of Staff G2, with a copy to Major General Joseph F. Carroll, Director Special Investigation, the Inspector General, USAF, by Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI.

25:20.000 --> 25:34.000
This memorandum was classified both confidential, which means, under existing law, that its contents must not be disclosed, both in the best interest of the national security, unquote.

25:34.000 --> 25:41.000
It was delivered by hand to the appropriate officials of the Air Force and the Army.

25:41.000 --> 26:06.000
I inquired further to determine whether or not the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any person on its behalf, had ever authorized the delivery of this memorandum to others, and was advised that the FBI has never released or authorized the release of the memorandum, or any portion thereof, to anyone except as above state.

26:06.000 --> 26:16.000
This question as to whether or not this memorandum can now be classified and made public has been presented to me by your letter.

26:16.000 --> 26:34.000
The FBI has a duty as the principal intelligence agency of the government, operating within the United States and territorial possession, to call to the attention of other agencies of the executive branch of the government, information of interest to such agencies.

26:34.000 --> 26:43.000
This is particularly true insofar as the investigators and intelligence branches of the armed services are concerned.

26:43.000 --> 26:58.000
The director of the FBI and other intelligence and investigative agencies must be free to exchange information, one with the other, without the fear that information of a classified nature will be made public.

26:58.000 --> 27:14.000
The FBI with its enormous responsibilities to the President, the Congress, and the American public must have the fullest cooperation from all persons who possess information bearing upon the internal security of our country.

27:14.000 --> 27:24.000
This cannot have unless it is in a position to give assurances that its files will be kept confidential.

27:24.000 --> 27:37.000
It has been the consistent and I believe why is policy of the Department of Justice, therefore not to disclose the contents of FBI reports or memorandum or any parts thereof.

27:37.000 --> 27:52.000
The only exception has been in the rare case where the information contained therein has been fully testified to by a witness or witnesses in court or before congressional committees under oath,

27:52.000 --> 28:05.000
so that no element of disclosure was in fact involved and where no confidential sources of information or investigative techniques would be disclosed.

28:05.000 --> 28:18.000
The 15 page memorandum, ifnate public, would raise the your confidential sources of information of the FBI and confidential investigative techniques.

28:18.000 --> 28:27.000
It contains the names of persons against whom no derogatory material has been shown and un-evaluated data as to others.

28:27.000 --> 28:33.000
It's publication would be harmful to matters now under consideration.

28:33.000 --> 28:45.000
I must therefore conclude that the memorandum should not be just classified and that publication of the memorandum would be contrary to the public interest.

28:48.000 --> 29:07.000
Your second request refers to a two and one fourth-page document dated January 26, 1951, a copy of which was delivered to us by Mr. Robert A. Collier, a distance counsel of your subcommittee, and which is returned herewith.

29:07.000 --> 29:23.000
This document reports to be a copy of a letter with a salutation quote, Major General Bowling, a distance sheet of staff G2, Department of the Army, Washington DC, sir, unquote.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
It is marked both personal and confidential, unquote.

29:29.000 --> 29:37.000
It poses with a following typewritten signature quote, sincerely yours, J. Edgar Hoover, direct, unquote.

29:37.000 --> 29:44.000
Mr. Hoover has examined the doctor and has advised me that he never wrote any such letter.

29:44.000 --> 29:57.000
However, this document does contain phraseology, which is identical in words and paragraphs with those contained in the 15 page memorandum referred to previously.

29:58.000 --> 30:09.000
In addition to this, the document contains a listing of names identical with names contained in the 15 page memorandum.

30:09.000 --> 30:22.000
After these names, there appears the words both derogatory, unquote, are, quote, no derogatory, unquote, which were not contained in the original memorandum.

30:22.000 --> 30:40.000
Although the two and one fourth page documents were reports to be a letter signed by J. S. Erhuver, director of the FBI, these evaluations of derogatory or no derogatory were not made by him or by anyone on his behalf.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
In fact, there is nothing contained in the two and one fourth page.

30:52.000 --> 31:00.000
The following is a letter signed by J. S. Erhuver.
