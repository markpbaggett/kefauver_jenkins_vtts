WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
It was simply a statement of a position which you had stated previously and the rich

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I've written in the fabric has responded to me.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Maybe well, the reason that Mr. Cameron came in was because they had to be answering the

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
question.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
The question is, can you explain it in a car?

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Maybe, I'm not involved in the matter of what was involved now.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
I was not prepared in the state.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm more subject.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
I saw that in order to be fully informed with the committee that I'd give you all of

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
the facts connected with it.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
And that's the reason it went in now as far as expediting the hearings.

00:34.000 --> 00:45.000
And then I'm far too much to do that too and willing to cooperate in any way that you

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
suggest along that line.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
And the recirculation could be resolved with this way that we assume for the purposes

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
of this record the Lee's hearing that there was no new element of charge in what the secretary

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
said about the abuse of General's record.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
He has said that many times before.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
He has answered him many times before.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
And it really isn't a part of this particular controversy to determine whether or not such

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
abuse is a matter of time.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Mr. Chairman, we secretary has made a statement now.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
I think seven or eight times in the process of testimony that I abused a general.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
The evapor of the only element of the state I was saying that's not right to be time on it.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
That makes the record have them to part of the record.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.700
However, I would like to personally secretary as to what steps he took to notify some

01:31.700 --> 01:36.700
of his about the record case, but efforts to use using the record to try and get us to call

01:36.700 --> 01:42.000
off the subpoena of those responsible in the credit case.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
Last night, I believe a rather important incident that the night press location was also.

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
Let's not go into a re-save of this record testimony and the record controversy.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
You said after all, we're not qualified to use the case.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I think I'm afraid we'll listen across from the other case.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I understand that you were then referred to that part of the Virginia special vacation

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
that is there as the weather and not the case itself is used in an effort to get the hearing

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
from the public.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I think it's all right.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
That's quite different from right.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Going into weather and not the case itself.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
You know, I'm not just secretary, getting this discussion going to turn the purpose of this

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
line of ingrained eyes on this.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Did you get a map of Davis from General Flickr at one time?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I did.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
It did.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
And how wide did you distribute that asset?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I didn't distribute it at all.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I recall.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Well, who would have you spend the state?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I didn't spend it anybody.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I recall.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
I think that General Ridgeway and Mr. Adams probably faithful out of people might have seen

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
it, but I expect what this gives.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Now, when I talked to you about these Wicker Matter originally, then I suggest to you

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
that you just keep your feet on the ground and wait to read the testimony.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
But yet all we can to do is ask for wind-thawing, press-hands with all of your newspaper.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
And if the testimony was dispensable, you were putting a panic sign in my eye, say?

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Well, the fact that it didn't I suggest to you before you went off after you read the testimony.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Something that I said, isn't that probably our language?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
You had a monetary classroom, you know?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
What's that?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
You had a monetary room, so you said no.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
That's why you never got the day that monetary conversation?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't have a hair.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
But you can get us and refresh your recollection, can't you?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
I thought.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
All right, let me ask you this.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
Without using that monetary conversation, do you now know that I did suggest to you?

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
If you just keep your feet on the ground,

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
read the testimony.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm not getting excited about it, but you read the testimony.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
And talk to Mr. Rinsel and talk to Mr. Jones for a present of the time.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I told you that you had all weekend to do that,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
because he wouldn't be called back and don't choose the anyway.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Isn't that right?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I recall part of that, not all of the time.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
But roughly, that.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
I know that you were a senator highly displeased with the idea

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
that I had ordered General Quickers not to appear at a hearing on the following

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
to the meeting this morning.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
I want to know if you both stated that it was very clear to me that you thought that I did.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I did.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I did.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I wanted out to you that you had no right to order enough to appear,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
that you would have to appear and that plan that you asked any questions.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
The answer, which was violate Army regulations, or violate any law,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
then you could refuse answer, but you have it on our Athena.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That's what I told you.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I think that was in the conversation.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
It was not roughly the conversation.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I don't think so.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Right, but now get back to it.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
You got an Athena.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
That's right.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That was foring you with it?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yes, sir.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Did you compare that, Athena.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
But with the foreign testimony letter?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Not in detail.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
I turned my attention to the transcript when it was published.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
You found a copy of that.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
Did you not buy air mail to Colonel McCormick who is down in Florida at the time?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Some copy of what?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
The Athena.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I did not.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Did you call him and read the Athena?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I did not.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
You sure you didn't send the copy of the Athena?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I did not.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Just wait a minute.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Let me get the straight down.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Just wait a minute.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
You did not at any time send the copy of the Flickr Athena.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
All right, resume oven.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
This is who that is.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
It resume oven to Colonel McCormick.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I did not.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Now, did you take that Athena to any of the senators returning to the state?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yes, sir.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I did not.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
I did not.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I did not.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I did not.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I did not.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Now, did you take that after David to any of the senators returning to the state?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
No, I do not think that they had died.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I went up and saw them.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
But I make a great statement to get these facts on the table.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I would have no objection.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Very confident here.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Very confident here.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Very confident here.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Very confident here.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And minding you now is the way you're doing it.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Now, if you get any new pages here, the country makes a statement about the country's

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
rigidity.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm trying to be responsive to a term of question questions and I certainly don't want to

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
prolong the thing that you may do on the facts out in the many cases.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
I have, when I first heard about this, which the case on the morning of the 19th of February,

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
following the testimony that his parents for the committee's previous afternoon,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I came over on the hill that afternoon.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Then at the McCarthy without a pal, I was going to come first to be vineyard.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
I decided I would call on each member of this committee that was available.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
And I did so do and everyone was available except the Senator Jackson and Senator McCrarty.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
And I explained to them what had happened in the district case carrying the previous day

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
in New York.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And I advised you to send it in.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
But I was good with not, did not think I ought to be called upon to stand for her due to

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
the Army witnesses.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
I felt this witness had been abused and I was not going to have an appearance in hearing

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
on Tuesday.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
Now, the reaction of the senators, I think I could summarize by saying was that, get what I said

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
was true and I think if they didn't have any way of knowing at the time except what I was

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
telling them, then they quite agree that there should not be abuse of witnesses.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
The resident argument about it, I came over to the floor of the Warren, the members of the

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
committee of the action about Connoctrite and Magdaude's general's written.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
I continued to try to get a hold of Senator McCrarty on the phone.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
He was holding hearings in Upper New York today and I reached him on Saturday morning,

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
about 9.30 as I recall and I explained to Senator at the Wilders calling that I had ordered

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
a general, but did not appear, that I wanted him to have all the facts in the matter, that

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
I'd gone over on the Hill and it's confirmed individually with his senators and dringening

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
up the date, that was the conversation to which Connoctrite, originally, has referred to

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
his testimony and it's the result he's done arrived in conversation, part of which I recall

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
and part of which I don't.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Now, when you answer the question, Mr. Prykker, the question was, did you take the

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
governor's office to any of the senators?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I don't think I had it at that time, Senator.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I was pretty sure that I didn't have it all away.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Did you have any time, did you, as a governor, have a governor, show any members

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
were at the table or any other senators?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I don't think I ever had it.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
And this time, if you talk to me, Mr. Prykker, I have been as respected as you to identify

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
the Colonel McCormick, Colonel McCormick, Colonel McCormick, will you identify him please?

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
I was busy and did not hear the question and did not hear your answer and his entirety,

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
and I heard no reference to Colonel McCormick, but ever, that may be you did refer to him in your own.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
I was referring to Colonel McCormick, the publisher of the Chicago Attorney's Law Act.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
Perhaps I would ask you that question, Senator instead of the secretary,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
and he is not identified as Colonel McCormick.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm Chicago, is that correct?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm sure of a newspaper. Very well.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Senator McCormick, I have any questions I presume not, and it's understood to my left.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
And it is understood to my right. Mr. Welch, no questions to phone or Senator McCormick.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
Mr. Stephen, when I was asking you whether you were in the Senate,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Mr. Booker, the Senate, the Colonel McCormick, you said that you were the Frank,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
the publisher of the Chicago Attorney's Law Act.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
That's right. Did you follow the Colonel and ask him to, or write me a reminder to this?

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
I never did anything, Mr. Senator McCormick, in regards to the, the, the, the,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
the half of the day that you were asked about, I sent Colonel McCormick a wire

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
voting the public release, but I made from the Pentagon on Sunday,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
the 20th part of the February, and the President of the Color Grants voting the release.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
And the public release contained experts from this half of the day that it's no such thing.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Did not, did you call the Colonel also no such thing?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
The only contact you had with him was this wire, that's right.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Now, first, the half of the day that it is of the day.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
The half of the day that is over mile after five per tone.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Now, when you said you went down, you gave the Senator's a story about what happened.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yes, sir.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
During the Booker testimony, did you first take the time to release the testimony?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
It wasn't available for me.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Was it the day after the Booker testimony?

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
That's right, and if you call anyone to sign and get a copy?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
It was an executive session, and I have seen it.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
It took place on Thursday afternoon, and I'm just a Friday morning to talk about it.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, no, you know the whole executive testimony was made available to you.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
The question is before you went down, tell the country's what happened.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Did you call anyone? The official report?

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
No, I didn't call it. Mr. Chairman, I desire this time to make a ruling which I hope the committee will accept.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
It is now my considerate opinion.

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
That's the merit of the General's Wicker case.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Constitution, a collateral issue.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
The Secretary of the Army has said that General's Wicker was abused.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Senator McCarthy has said that he said he was not abused.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I do not think it's proper, I have to further consideration.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
For this committee to allow proof to be introduced with reference to the General's Wicker case,

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
and with reference to whether or not anything Senator McCarthy might have said to him or about him,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
was proper or improper.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
I really mean based upon my conclusion now that it is entirely collateral matter,

11:47.000 --> 11:56.000
and that we should proceed to investigate the pertinent issues involved in this investigation.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
Mr. Chairman, in view of the fact that there is a minute that I have filed on a grave of the ruling,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't think this would have mattered.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
This play is a profession.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
The profession is important to take much more time.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Not a question, the ruling, the government.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
Mr. Chairman, in view of the fact that there is an alpha Davis made by General's Wicker,

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
in view of the fact that the press releases, put out by Mr. Stevens' office,

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
with indicates that half of Davis is contrasted to the foreign testimony of General's Wicker.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
If this is true and I have never seen the alpha Davis understand all that seems to be freshly stolen,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
if that is true then Mr. Wicker,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
find they false math of death.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
In fact, I am asking that we are left to win with the last sentence.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
I am never asking that the alpha Davis be supplied to the committee,

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
and we make it very clear, I don't know what's in the alpha Davis.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
I have never seen an alpha Davis receive in the floor repeatedly.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
All I can go on are the press release,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
and if he did find a false alpha Davis,

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
that would be one reason why the secretary would be trying to call off these hearings

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
because we are telling Mr. Wicker back again to check with him on this particular matter of the alpha Davis.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
This would have to do with motive.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
So I ask the sheriff to call for that alpha Davis,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
and have the staff compare it with the foreign testimony.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Are you calling for the alpha Davis send them a credit?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
I am asking the sheriff to be produced and introduced here in Athens.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Nothing introduced Mr. Duncan's,

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
but produced and given to you and so you and your staff can check the foreign alpha Davis

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
with the foreign testimony.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I ask the rest of the, it's there before the press removal.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Will you do that Mr. Jake,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
there we think that's entirely proper for you to hear.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
You're out in the same state,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
and I'd also like to say that I have no recollection of the sentiment party ever having asked me for that.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Where will we produce in the grand opening council?

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Mr. Secretary,

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
I think everyone here has been talking about expediting the hearings.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
We've been a great deal of time talking about how we're going to expedite them.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Well, you're counsel the other day,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
and I'm sending six for you, is that correct?

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Your counsel's please for you, does it?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yes sir.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
The other day in page 1370, he said that I would say this,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
but if the hearings take the course that I'd suggest,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
first the Secretary and then the senator,

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
I would either be content to let the case rest in those two witnesses,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
although that would give us a somewhat of braviated hearing,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
or at most we would wish to call out to all the two more.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm taking this suggestion,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
it is that you've been willing to let the case rest in those two witnesses.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
That's that time.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Did you agree with it?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
That's the calendar.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
The senator has read only a portion.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
You've went away with what I have,

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
because the senator is under referred to why I said he should read all the time.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm going to add a further cross-examine on that point.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
I think the senator's question is a total question.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
And the question now is whether or not you represent him,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
of course that is a four-dominant conclusion.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
You speak for him, that's a four-dominant conclusion.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And he's asking your time now whether or not at that time,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
the time you made that statement.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
The secretary agreed with you I was willing for that formula to be adopted.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I've seen nothing wrong with that.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
The chairman of the formula is three paragraphs long, that one paragraph long.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
He may be both found during the other further cross-examination.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I don't see a little bit of this.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I can't answer the question without the full-screen paragraph.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I suggest that you answer it.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
It is not going to be spoken to you here.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I don't want to have all the facts out.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
When you read the full statement, the secretary said to the secretary,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
that I suggest that you have before you say 13-70,

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
if you feel I have done violence to the context, then let's talk to him.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
What is it?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Have you got it before you?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
The chairman appointed all the right hand in the talk.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
We have been overdressed more than once,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
and everyone has expressed their opinion about us,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
and all of their opinions and views are in their record.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Thus we go over again the hearing, thought, proceeding,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
and this is not calculated to expedite them, but only to bring out a repetition.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I am not present, but I don't believe the secretary said in the comment.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
There's been asking questions about that.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm sorry, but this is getting to the round.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
People are asking one day, but I...

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
The secretary has not ten million, my ass.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
He has invited the secretary.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
The secretary has spoken for him, and are we going to question everybody

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
if they want their attorney to agree to their attorney?

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
If they want to ask the secretary, will he be willing to agree to our attorney?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
We accept counsel as his attorney.

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
The attorney has spoken for him, and this is not that long over in the records over at all.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
If they can do nothing, they accept the lazy-hearing,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
so no light up on any issue that's now before the committee.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Objects as the secretary.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, may I say this?

17:23.000 --> 17:31.000
As best I remember, this is the first time the secretary has been asked whether or not he has sent it,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
or has come sent it to such a formula.

17:35.000 --> 17:42.000
I can see no possible points in interrogating the secretary with reference

17:42.000 --> 17:53.000
to let matter take place to shed light on the frame of mind of the secretary as to whether or not he desires to present all of his evidence,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
or have his evidence curtailed its conclusion of his testimony,

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
and whether or not he desires all of the evidence on the senator's side to be presented,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
or will be condemned for only a part of it,

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
the only possible relevancy of it would be on the question of moldy's are the frame of mind of the secretary,

18:13.000 --> 18:20.000
and for that purpose only, he seemed to me and I do believe in hope.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
The defendant is entitled as that one simple question,

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
yet a knight should from the secretary and not pursue that matter any further.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
Mr. Jenkins, I testify the other day that I wanted all the facts and the days brought out from all of it,

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
then as I and I stand on it, yes, one of our witnesses, that's the,

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
I think he's answered the question now and I don't think it should be pursued any further,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
he wants all of the evidence on both sides to introduce,

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
as far as counsel for the committee is concerned, I am in accord with you, Mr. Secretary.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Thank you.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Mr. Chairman, may I say the reason why I am in accord with you, Mr. Secretary?

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I believe that the point of order may have been exposed.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
Mr. Chairman, may I say the reason why I propose that the secretary,

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
trust of the point of this, as the chair knows the principal consensus,

19:12.000 --> 19:21.000
made by me and Mr. Cohn, Mr. Farr, is that the chairman and the military,

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
the federal government, Mr. Stevens, the Brown, have taken holiday delivered court

19:27.000 --> 19:34.000
to find keeps this committee occupied in this hearing, starting in the first place to make your charges.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And I'll continue like this.

19:36.000 --> 19:43.000
I propose to bring to this with the chairman to show that as of now, Mr. Welch's objective

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
to Saturday hearings, looks like this matter, evening hearings like expected,

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
that there was bad faith, as the time Mr. Welch made this original offer

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
that we accepted the Middle East and East Plays, that we accepted that offer.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I didn't make it. We accepted that.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
He said he was speaking for the secretary.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
The secretary did not attend the meeting. I would like to know why the change of heart over

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
and night in order to prolong the hearing, if that were a reasonable, semi-scientist place.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm not saying that the guasery was not, if that were a reasonable agreement,

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
made tonight before, the offer, Mr. Welch, except from me, in fact, I want to step further.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
I thought I would dismiss Mr. Chavins from the stand in the founder and take it myself the following morning.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
It's that for a good way of exposing to the matter that night.

20:31.000 --> 20:38.000
I would like to know who decided between 6 o'clock at night and 9.30 the next morning

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
that they should not follow that force to expose Mr. Welch.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
To follow a force that will prolong the hearing's indefinitely.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I think that shed light upon the other issues.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
But if the chair doesn't agree, I will not pursue that any further.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
The chair believes that the secretary has answered the senator's question.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
And Mr. Welch has erected a withdrawal any offer that he might have made.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
And we do not believe that there's a proper function for this committee to investigate as to any reasons

21:06.000 --> 21:12.000
which might have changed his mind, which has changed his mind, which is a representative of the president.

21:13.000 --> 21:21.000
In the interest of fairness, Senator McCarthy has now introduced in youthful,

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
it is my opinion that Senator McCarthy and the finally I will ask the question.

21:28.000 --> 21:37.000
Mr. Secretary, this is the thought of apparently motivating the last question by Senator McCarthy and I will ask it.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to raise a point of order.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
I would like to raise a point of order now against the council's question.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
I would like to raise a point of order before the council's question is not against it very well.

21:49.000 --> 22:01.000
Mr. Chairman, I believe that the question is asked on part of the evidence which has been read by Senator McCarthy

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
and the council for the secretary of the army says that ineffective has been taken out of context

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
because it's not the entire story.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
Then prior to the question being re-praised and there have been re-ass the secretary of the army,

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
the council for the secretary of the army should have the right to present the details of the case

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
as he sees it stopped by reading all the testimony he gave bearing on the question

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
and not having read just part of it by the center for which council.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
Mr. Chairman, my question is if the question is a counsel,

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Mr. Cotation, that the senator refers to, I'd like to share what I've told you pointed out

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
is he just to be ready and full.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
The secretary cannot do on the point of order the question was not yet been asked.

22:46.000 --> 22:59.000
As you may ask the question, Mr. Secretary, you have been asked and I'm out as whether or not you have sought to prolong this hearing

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
for the purpose of curbing or curtailing the efforts of Senator McCarthy and his staff

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
and their investigation of communists and infiltration of communists in the army.

23:12.000 --> 23:21.000
And particularly whether or not you may have and I do not suggest that you have or have not repudiated any agreement

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
made by your attorneys looking to the shortening or termination of this hearing

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
and for the purposes expressed in the first part of my question, do I make it fair?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Yes sir, the answer may be not.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
All right.

23:36.000 --> 23:44.000
The answer is in the negative, the agenda which frankly will proceed on some other line of interrogation.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
I didn't understand the answer, you'll say you know you did not purify the adults for the purpose.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
The answer is positively not, it's not.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
And then I would like to know who did he discuss that agreement with you?

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
Chairman, I would like a firm ruling from the chair of the minister to be inquired into no further.

24:04.000 --> 24:14.000
If we're stated at this in this room by these, that we have set our hands to the bow to bow the long, hard pearl.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
I suggest that at these hearings I'm moving slowly.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
It is because of the tactics of the senator from Wisconsin that's far and the patient.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
For days I have passed when I've been given the opportunity to ask questions.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
For days, which is a member of the past when given that opportunity.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
I suggest that it's time to come to hear this simple thought.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
The senator is now engaged in a fellow bus to bike, device to cross the examination.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Now you're testifying Mr. Wells and not the day of the anybody.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Mr. Chairman.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I think this is an important question.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The repudiation of the agreement.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I don't trust Mr. Wells with right to repudiate it.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
There was no agreement for me, madam.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
There was no agreement that every member of the committee knows that was always.

25:00.000 --> 25:11.000
The member of the chairman, the secretary has been asked the one question only with respect to any alleged repudiation of the agreement.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
That's the possibility of being germinated to the issues in this conversation to with.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Did he or not repudiate the agreement?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I don't imply that he did it.

25:20.000 --> 25:30.000
It did not for the purpose of prolonging this inquiry and thus serving our hamstringing the efforts of senator McCarthy and his first communists or subversives.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
His answer was definitely in the negative.

25:33.000 --> 25:41.000
I think the inquiry should now be entirely discontinued on that subject and ties to another subversive.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
The chairman is entirely proper position.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
The senator has been permitted to ask the relevant questions in that connection.

25:48.000 --> 26:01.000
The chairman has stated that the committee has noticed positions to face counsel on the oaths or any purposes involving but maybe his type and suggestion for conducting the inquiry.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
He has a grant to his own opinion.

26:04.000 --> 26:13.000
Mr. Chairman, if your statements are clear, please note that Mr. Jenkins' testimony did not have goody a agreement to start the hearings.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
That's true. I think I'm entitled to ask him whether or not he discussed that agreement with counsel.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
But our counsel has taken on himself to do it with.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
That's it.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
And some other questions are in the committee for your team.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
Mr. Chairman, I think this is very important because that's the situation.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
But as wise and wise and wise we may go from long to hearing several months.

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
I think that we should find out.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
When the secretary says he did not propitiate the agreement, I would like to know who did it.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
But as a state of heart and the part of the Smith-to-Welts, I think that's a perfectly proper line of inquiry.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
And then it's all in the point of what is the chairman.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
As I remember, a little elementary rule of law.

26:55.000 --> 27:05.000
Conversations and information gain are expressed as the between five and attorney or privilege.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Am I correct?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Make the counsel?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Sir, I'm sorry, sir.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Where's the proceed?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Here we can definitely uphold the point of what you're hearing.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
I think it's very analogous to the one you have failed yesterday.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
Open about relationships between investigators and inquiries.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
You'll proceed, sir.

27:21.000 --> 27:31.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, if Mr. Stevens wants to claim a privilege, he hasn't had to do it.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
But I don't believe that the privilege can be a privilege, you know, that's a claim.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
If any more, you can accord a fifth amendment privilege.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
And I think that's very important across the dead he discussed.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
The agreement with Mr. Welsk, you want to claim the privilege, all right?

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
The one of arguments that I've been sitting here and listening to an agreement.

27:51.000 --> 27:58.000
Now, if we're going into this, I want to ask Comple, another elementary, another elementary rule of law.

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
I suggest that we proceed then, if we're going to follow down this diverse track way off the track,

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
to establish first, whether an agreement exists.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I'm the chairman, Mr. Chairman.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
I'm the one of orders, director of the question.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
First, let me send a rejection.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
The record speaks for itself.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
The record is in writing in a time script.

28:26.000 --> 28:34.000
I do not feel that it is my free robbery of two interpretees, this committee must do so.

28:35.000 --> 28:42.000
Well, this one is, I assume the committee has to, if there any agreements, we have to pass them.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I just wonder what the agreement was.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
There's a U-level statement.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
But, isn't there some rule of law and acceptance and contrast?

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Mr. Acedres-Exon, thanks for being back.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
Senator McCarthy, let you, that Mr. Welsk made an agreement,

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
may they proposition for the shortening of curtailment,

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
are the discontinuous of this year?

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
Senator McCarthy's father alleges that he accepted it, that an agreement was made,

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
as I understand it, Mr. Welsk denies that.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
Any father in query with respect to that matter is wholly immaterial,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
and an unnecessary consumption of time.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Have I made myself clear?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
I have made myself clear.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
Of course, the committee decides on the approval of agreement by four.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
Otherwise, the one who wants to go on, consult can't decide.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Certainly, counsel cannot decide.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
I do, it's not the one who's on, but counsel can't decide.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
Well, does anyone scratch you up or need an order?

29:47.000 --> 29:55.000
Mr. Secretary, I'd like to hand you a favor with Mr. Sikhan's on it.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Mr. Sikhan's on it.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Mr. Sikhan's on it.

30:02.000 --> 30:13.000
I'm handing the secretary a list of six names individuals who were opinion by the committee today before the hearing started.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
I think it'll be improper, but I stand from the hearing feet.

30:20.000 --> 30:31.000
Mr. Sikhan, I'm handing the secretary a list of six names individuals from the Pentagon,

30:31.000 --> 30:37.000
who had been ordered to introduce today before the charges were made public in Switzerland.

30:37.000 --> 30:45.000
I don't think it'll be improper to have those names made public at this time.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
The rule of the committee has been the purpose of being a someone that's actually a session.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
The names might not make public in the latter, but are allowed to appear against the reason for handing in the names to the reason of reading them all.

30:55.000 --> 31:05.000
Mr. Sikhan, you've all lost the other day that one of the reasons why you wanted the hearing of the release that the defendant was,

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
was that you could go ahead yourself and do the job of closing.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
We're talking about Secretary of the Senate and the President about the hearing, but not not.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
I'm not sure about that, right?

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Well, I think it's about the hearing here.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
That's a great pleasure.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
It wasn't your testimony that you wanted the follow-up hearing.

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
I'm telling the principal basically, the Army called up, so you could do the job yourself.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I'm Jackson.
