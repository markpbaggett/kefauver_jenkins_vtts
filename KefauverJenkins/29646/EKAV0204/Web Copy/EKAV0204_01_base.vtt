WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
That will be my policy.

00:04.600 --> 00:07.600
There's no power at birth to have changed around.

00:07.600 --> 00:17.160
And again, I want to compliment the individuals who have placed their oath to defend the

00:17.160 --> 00:22.860
country against enemies and certainly come into the enemies, rather than beyond any presidential

00:22.860 --> 00:23.860
directive.

00:23.860 --> 00:28.100
And none of them will be brought to my grand jury because of any information which I

00:28.100 --> 00:29.100
have given to me.

00:29.100 --> 00:37.400
If any administration wants to indict me for receiving and giving the American people

00:37.400 --> 00:40.900
information about coming up, they can just go right ahead and do the indictment.

00:40.900 --> 00:44.900
If you may, they will have to buy this, but I don't know of any old women in my home.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.500
But the law is to use countries that require them to commit a crime.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.500
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.700
He would be happy to moderate a week to press program during the time and at the base

00:53.700 --> 00:55.700
between sentiment trafficking and sentiment trafficking.

00:55.700 --> 01:01.020
Mr. Guelton, even remotely connected on my table with the hearings, nothing to do about

01:01.020 --> 01:02.020
the document in question.

01:02.020 --> 01:07.980
Mr. Guelton, the 130 economists who still be suspect working in the census mask, and

01:07.980 --> 01:11.100
certainly work with this committee to take us in some other form and not here.

01:11.100 --> 01:16.220
Mr. Guelton, I do hope you will not incite another revolution, but if you might, then

01:16.220 --> 01:17.840
please be heard out for a case.

01:17.840 --> 01:24.280
It's very grateful to you and I say you are sticking to the pattern when I talk.

01:24.280 --> 01:31.460
For many years, I ran the airport of the United States and the civilian head of the

01:31.460 --> 01:36.440
Department of the Family does run under our former government.

01:36.440 --> 01:41.760
From the standpoint of the security of the United States, and I did my best to make this

01:41.760 --> 01:49.000
country as secure as possible against communism, I would hate to think that all the people in

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
the L-Forets of the Army, the Navy, who may have some work against their superior officers

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
or who may feel that their wisdom was superior to that of their superior officers, including

02:02.000 --> 02:09.600
the Commander-in-Chief, for being close to giveaway secrets to those people they thought

02:09.600 --> 02:12.240
in their mind and they made the decision.

02:12.240 --> 02:18.680
They have the right to give some secrets to regardless of the law of the land.

02:18.680 --> 02:24.680
One of my oldest friends in this paper business the other day said that Echahubar told him

02:24.680 --> 02:28.240
that he released the document so he would be jailed.

02:28.240 --> 02:33.520
I read that for the great deal of interest and I have never said that anybody committed

02:33.520 --> 02:41.040
any form in receiving it, but I do say that regardless of his personal opinion, no man

02:41.040 --> 02:48.040
can take an oath of office not to devour secrets as the right to decide to do it.

02:48.040 --> 02:51.040
I have a very question to tell you.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
I'd like to give back to Mr. Cohn's testimony.

02:52.040 --> 02:57.040
I think we've been waiting for the story, but I think there is an old policy.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.040
We hear a lot of this from the next President.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.040
I'm wondering if you share this.

03:00.040 --> 03:04.040
I'll have the authority to protect you in the correct moment if you tell me to just...

03:04.040 --> 03:06.040
I'm talking about your role as a matter.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.040
Of course, there's nothing easy to do about this.

03:08.040 --> 03:13.040
Mr. Chairman, I agree it's fully irrelevant in the farthest appearance.

03:13.040 --> 03:19.040
However, it is very relevant in the farthest work of the investigative media concern.

03:19.040 --> 03:28.040
At this point, I deeply deserve to find my two Democrats, Tully, in effect, notifying

03:28.040 --> 03:32.040
the two million people who work for this government.

03:32.040 --> 03:39.040
So, I think the time for those employees to give the chairman of an investigating committee

03:39.040 --> 03:43.040
evidence of communist infiltration, treason.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.040
I think that will serve to discourage them.

03:46.040 --> 03:53.040
As far as I'm concerned, I would like to notify those two million federal employees

03:53.040 --> 04:00.040
that I feel it's very dizzy to give us any information that they have about graph, corruption,

04:00.040 --> 04:08.040
and communism, treason, and that there is no loyal face to a superior officer,

04:08.040 --> 04:13.040
which can power above and beyond their loyal face to their country.

04:13.040 --> 04:20.040
And I may say that I hope today comes when this administration

04:20.040 --> 04:28.040
notifies all federal employees that any information that they have about long doing

04:28.040 --> 04:34.040
should they give them to any congressional committee which is empowered to take it a period.

04:34.040 --> 04:39.040
The effect on the climate does not activate no mistakes in the statements.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.040
I want to make this our topic.

04:41.040 --> 04:47.040
If this theory is followed, if this principle is adopted, then ever better employee,

04:47.040 --> 04:54.040
just with you everything he knows, that is information against communism,

04:54.040 --> 04:57.040
then you can have no security system in America.

04:57.040 --> 05:01.040
It will destroy totally any irreversible.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.040
Give it up in this criminal thing.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.040
Look, this is our practice.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.040
This one, under traction.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.040
May I inform you now please not to get into this.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.040
I'm going to go for a last-minute session.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.040
Now I hope you can tell these people remain in power.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.040
The main thing is that the administration is going on between the C.P.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.040
We should participate.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.040
We should get on with the theory.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.040
Well, I'm sorry.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.040
Nothing to do whatsoever with the theory.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.040
Well, I'm sorry.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.040
You're not against certain other true autos of America.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.040
They grew autos of America.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.040
The email being serious.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.040
They grew autos of America.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
They came into these theories.

05:33.040 --> 05:38.040
I merely want to say that the expressions that send them a column in timing and send their signings

05:38.040 --> 05:45.040
have made regarding the people who give out such information from the department

05:45.040 --> 05:50.040
is not just a personal view, but is my understanding that Mr. J. Edgar Hoover

05:50.040 --> 05:52.040
and Mr. Brown L.

05:52.040 --> 05:57.040
It's a general of the United States that deployed it and indicated it's a violation of law.

05:57.040 --> 06:01.040
That's not a matter to be sought to run on a personal basis,

06:01.040 --> 06:05.040
but it comes from the highest law enforcement officers in the country.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
That's the technical information.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.040
That's the technical information.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.040
That's the technical information.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.040
That's the technical information.

06:11.040 --> 06:18.040
If a state department employee has not wrapped down the door

06:18.040 --> 06:22.040
of the President's chairman of the Committee, Senator Monk,

06:22.040 --> 06:26.040
and gave him information about prisons,

06:26.040 --> 06:30.040
Alder and his would not be in jail today.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.040
Mr. Edgar,

06:31.040 --> 06:34.040
the column, the technical.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.040
Shall we, Mr. Chairman?

06:35.040 --> 06:37.040
I'm willing to.

06:37.040 --> 06:42.040
I mean, Mr. Cohen, you were telling us the Committee about the work being done

06:42.040 --> 06:47.040
by the Democratic Committee with respect to the investigation of communists and subversives

06:47.040 --> 06:50.040
in the Army.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.040
I'm tired of the beginning of the theory.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.040
That's right, sir.

06:55.040 --> 07:00.040
I don't believe you had finished your statements with respect to that area of investigation

07:00.040 --> 07:02.040
and that now is due to those over the course.

07:02.040 --> 07:07.040
The area of investigation and other words are the information and the allegations

07:07.040 --> 07:12.040
which we had received presented the following picture,

07:12.040 --> 07:15.040
which I might say was confirmed in almost every instance.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.040
Almost every instance.

07:18.040 --> 07:26.040
We found, sir, that pro-communist literature has been imused by Army intelligence

07:26.040 --> 07:30.040
and were still in use in some cases by Army intelligence.

07:30.040 --> 07:33.040
You, sir, it was a thank-miss call.

07:33.040 --> 07:38.040
Sir, I'm giving you the benefit of the information and evidence which we assembled.

07:38.040 --> 07:46.040
And in this case, I would make a reference to public hearing of the subcommittee conducted on September the 28th, 1953,

07:46.040 --> 07:50.040
and I would like to record to speak for itself on that.

07:50.040 --> 07:55.040
Then there was some other areas that the Jenkins which we have not had a chance to do this

07:55.040 --> 08:04.040
which were publicly yet, which concerned generally people following the communist line teaching that very Army institutions.

08:04.040 --> 08:17.040
We found that a directive has been issued in 1944, committing and perhaps in the interpretation of many even encouraging the commissioning of Communists.

08:17.040 --> 08:22.040
So for the benefit of the director of the sub-ministration, was that a directive issue?

08:22.040 --> 08:25.040
Yes, I made some time for the Rosalows.

08:25.040 --> 08:36.040
But anyway, a directive was issued in 1944, I believe by the Department of the Army, or the War Department, that it was then called,

08:36.040 --> 08:42.040
committing the commissioning of people who are Communists and members of the Communists party.

08:42.040 --> 08:50.040
We were told, sir, and we found that a number of persons, a number of Communists, had some commission in the United States Army

08:50.040 --> 08:57.040
that some of them were still in the Army, and that some had been committed in fairly recent years.

08:57.040 --> 09:08.040
Then, sir, we were given an information and we found that as far as the Army civilian personnel were concerned,

09:08.040 --> 09:16.040
there had been infiltrations by Communists, people with Communists records, and people who were certainly security-ripped.

09:16.040 --> 09:25.040
We found that that infiltration had extended particularly to the Army secret radar laboratory

09:25.040 --> 09:33.040
that Fort Lund was new to Jersey, and if I might relate one very short incident, which came to our attention about that.

09:33.040 --> 09:45.040
We were told, sir, that a man by the name of Aaron Cole, named Spiggett and East Proceedings, was still working at Fort Lund.

09:45.040 --> 09:56.040
That was in the spring of 1953. We were told that Aaron Cole and was working at Fort Lund as a civilian employee.

09:56.040 --> 10:05.040
Now, that name rang about. I know that that name had been mentioned in the course of the SB&R trial of the executed Adams-5,

10:05.040 --> 10:13.040
Studio and Apple Rosenberg. One fact, and I checked the Rosenberg's record, the record of the Rosenberg's trial,

10:13.040 --> 10:22.040
and I found that in the course of the testimony of Julius Rosenberg, the convicted and executed Adams-5,

10:22.040 --> 10:32.040
he had testified that Aaron Cole and the same Aaron Cole and had been a friend and an associate of his at Fort Lund.

10:32.040 --> 10:41.040
That month, specifically, sir, I'm referring to folio 1284 of the record that was handed to the Supreme Court.

10:41.040 --> 10:48.040
And Rosenberg had one time worked at Fort Lund. Rosenberg had won a school at first, 12 onwards. He had been there on business,

10:48.040 --> 10:53.040
and he was working technically, sir, so the Army signal score has an effector.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.040
I'm about to clear the record now. That's executed straight. That's good.

10:56.040 --> 11:04.040
Certainly, it was long before Secretary Steve Lund. Yes, it's a soon-to-dead use of his office. Yes, it was. Rosenberg was working for the Army signal score,

11:04.040 --> 11:13.040
I believe, from around 1940 or 41 to 1945. But he found that Coleman had worked there simultaneously with Rosenberg.

11:13.040 --> 11:17.040
Well, that's right. If you want to defend the turn, I think it's a secret self-assignment.

11:17.040 --> 11:24.040
So, did Rosenberg be convicted out of five with air at his trial as well? Question.

11:24.040 --> 11:36.040
Can you give us now the names of some other flat names of yours, with whom you had either social or business relations after your graduation, and by Rosenberg?

11:36.040 --> 11:42.040
Well, there were people who were in my squad and the electrical engineering corps.

11:42.040 --> 11:51.040
Mr. Aaron Coleman, whose subsequent to graduation, I met at Fort Lund when I was the time there.

11:51.040 --> 11:59.040
He went on to say, there are many names of you additional names. He then went on to say, with air by the corps by your German cow.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.620
Did you see any of these people social?

12:01.620 --> 12:08.040
Julian Rosenberg answered the only way I got to see them socially was by going out for lunch with them,

12:08.040 --> 12:17.040
subject by the corps. In connection with the corps, in connection with your business, Julian Rosenberg was my visiting then.

12:17.040 --> 12:28.040
So, in other words, Aaron, the spring of 1953, we were told that one of the people still working at Fort Lundman was a friend and associate of Adam's pie Julian Rosenberg.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.040
And that Berteling was Coleman, that was Aaron Coleman, that leg of bailing your mind.

12:32.040 --> 12:37.040
It did sir the name did, I then checked the records, I have to say what I just read here and other things.

12:37.040 --> 12:42.040
This was before we were ever starting to be hearing, you know, before we were out in the air.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.040
They know, things are going at Richard Coleman.

12:46.040 --> 12:51.040
We went on with the Coleman tater, and we checked around on that.

12:52.040 --> 13:07.040
And we were told, and what we were told is later been confirmed under oath, that this same Aaron Coleman, who was still working at Fort Monmouth, had participated in communist activity with the executed Adams by Julius Rosenberg.

13:07.040 --> 13:14.040
And of course we believe that to present a solid alarming situation, to think that Coleman could still in the year 1953 at Monmouth.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.040
Did or not your investigation prove that to be correct?

13:17.040 --> 13:20.040
Sir, on the record on that I believe speaks for itself.

13:20.040 --> 13:33.040
Coleman on the stand, on the cross examination before this committee I believe on December 8th, admitted that Julius Rosenberg had taken him, had taken Coleman, through a meeting of the young communist league.

13:33.040 --> 13:54.040
He denied membership in the young communist league, but a man named Nathan Sussman, who admitted membership in the young communist league, named Coleman under oath as a member of the young communist league in the same style with Julius Rosenberg and other people who have been found to be spies and Russian espionage agents.

13:54.040 --> 14:06.040
I'm a secone, I have a committee to go into somebody's favor with respect to Aaron Coleman, because his name figures right commonly in the testimony here to forgive him.

14:06.040 --> 14:22.040
And well again, I would ask you whether or not in addition to Coleman, you discovered that there were other employees, some in him employees, at Fort Monmouth are in Charmy, whose records were set as a team.

14:22.040 --> 14:27.040
And it is your interest as a member of the McCartney Investigating Committee.

14:27.040 --> 14:50.040
We were, without mentioning any names, we were told that there were a large number of people with communist affiliations and with connection with the communist spies who were still in 1953 working at the Secret Army radar laboratories at Fort Monmouth in spite of the fact that for a period of years, the FBI had been warning.

14:50.040 --> 15:02.040
People in the Army that these people were in the Secret radar laboratory and giving the Army information on the basis of which these people should have been suspended and removed.

15:02.040 --> 15:06.040
How long did your investigation continue Mr. Coleman?

15:06.040 --> 15:13.040
Working to the assembling of the facts prepared for having years, I would say search to us real form one.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.040
During that time that you meet the Secretary of the Army, we did not.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.040
You did not consider it with me, we did not.

15:21.040 --> 15:29.040
Now, when did your hearing begin with respect to the infiltration of the subverses in the Army generally?

15:29.040 --> 15:35.040
They began in the summer search directly following the completion of open hearings on the government printing office.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.040
Can you give us the month for this?

15:38.040 --> 15:40.040
In August, 1950.

15:40.040 --> 15:44.040
Yes. Those initial hearings, we understand were executive hearings.

15:44.040 --> 16:04.040
Yes. And here we are at various places, sir, at the United States Courthouse, Foley Square, New York, where the committee has an office at Downing, Washington, in this room and in room 357, maybe in another room on the first floor, and that fort Monmouth itself.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.040
He was finally presided over by Senator McKinley.

16:07.040 --> 16:14.040
Yeah, well, he is the chairman of the committee and he decided at those sessions at which he was present, and I believe he was pregnant.

16:14.040 --> 16:23.040
A little bit of rose who did not know Mr. Coleman, it is my understanding, certainly, that one man constantly did a court of one member of the committee.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.040
That's an important point, Mr. Chankin, under the Christophal decision.

16:26.040 --> 16:49.040
So he's referring, yet it is there, in order to make possible prosecution of communists and others for a purgeary, this committee is, I believe, back to the every other congressional committee, has adopted a one-man courtroom, otherwise, when you bring a purgeary or a contemptate, you've got a proof that a majority of members of the committee were sitting right at the table during every second of the hearing, while the defendant gets acquitted.

16:49.040 --> 16:55.040
After the Supreme Court ruled on that, I believe this committee, like most other committee, adopted this one-man courtroom.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.040
The court prevailed this game hearing, all you understand.

16:58.040 --> 17:15.040
Now, Mr. Coleman, I think it's just a tie-up to here-to-for-thee hearings, that initially, you were investigating three elites, the first ones, are communists in the army, generally.

17:15.040 --> 17:28.040
Is this correct? Not exactly, Mr. Chankin. There were three who were called in first. They were number under investigation, but you'll quite correct in saying that if the first hearing in August, we did feel with three specific cases.

17:28.040 --> 17:31.040
They were not a court member.

17:31.040 --> 17:41.040
They weren't at court members, but one of them, sir, was an army signal court employee. And, of course, court member is part and part for the army signal court.

17:41.040 --> 17:44.040
Now, there is really no distinction between the signal court and court member.

17:44.040 --> 17:51.040
I don't ask you whether or not the fact that you were in this to get these three subverses in the army was publicized.

17:51.040 --> 17:56.040
It was. And, you know about William, I say the end of August.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.040
The end of August or early in September?

17:58.040 --> 18:06.040
Yes. Did you later learn, and do you now know, that is the information that was read by the six areas of the army when he was in Montana?

18:06.040 --> 18:11.040
Yes. I believe what he read, Mr. Chankin. He read specifically about these cases.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.040
These three cases, the British testing.

18:14.040 --> 18:18.040
Yes. These without any detail on the free, and without mentioning names.

18:18.040 --> 18:26.040
This particular one in the army signal court, I think within on August 31, was a security guard for the army signal court.

18:26.040 --> 18:33.040
And the evidence which we had, and which I have right here, is that he had signed a written pledge of support to the Communist Party of the United States.

18:34.040 --> 18:39.040
Do you have it before you? I do, sir. Mr. Cohn, what was the team of those three subverses?

18:39.040 --> 18:43.040
Our communists are currently initially investigating.

18:43.040 --> 18:50.040
So I can send you very clearly. Over there, not suspended. This charge is too hard on the still on the job.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.040
Who I think the third was, although I'm not sure.

18:53.040 --> 19:02.040
The one, the security guard and the army signal court, who had signed this Communist Party petition, was suspended immediately after he was exposed by the committee.

19:02.040 --> 19:12.040
The second one, the second army employee for the court of massacre, involved the Fifth Amendment at the certain time in its activity, and was shortly thereafter suspended.

19:12.040 --> 19:18.040
Was it there that you directed your efforts, particularly to Fort Montgomery?

19:18.040 --> 19:22.040
I would say the exposure of the three persons, about whom we've been talking.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.040
I would say yes.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.040
That's correct. What's this one qualification, Mr. Cohn?

19:26.040 --> 19:34.040
We did hold hearings in between on the use of communist, folk-communist literature, a literature with communist content by Army and Sellers.

19:34.040 --> 19:43.040
We had an executive session and a public hearing, but with both exceptions, I would say the concentration was on Aaron Coleman and Fort Montgomery.

19:43.040 --> 19:53.040
And was the concentration on Fort Montgomery as a result of the fact that you had assembled in the previous months of investigation.

19:54.040 --> 19:57.040
It was. I made their record. Did your efforts, Fort Montgomery?

19:57.040 --> 20:01.040
Yes. When did you first meet the secretary of the Army?

20:01.040 --> 20:05.040
At the beginning of September, sir. You call the day the circumstances.

20:05.040 --> 20:17.040
I say yes. I recall it. I recall, generally, the circumstances. I remember that after the hearings were held in New York, very in no story appears.

20:17.040 --> 20:22.040
And one, I wanted to read a paragraph, because I think it's very important, Mr. Jenkins.

20:22.040 --> 20:34.040
It shows that as early as September 2, 1963, Senator McCawsey made it publicly clear that he intended to call the Florida subcommittee members of the loyalty board.

20:34.040 --> 20:44.040
People in the loyalty procedures for the responsible for the clearing of Army personnel with communist and subversive records.

20:44.040 --> 20:55.040
This new story, which is from the Washington Times, Harold. I will admit, it's dated September 2, 1953, the one paragraph which I can't read in my major.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.040
It goes well.

20:57.040 --> 21:13.040
Both Senator McCawsey is saying on September 3. Until we find out who clears these individuals for Army employment, despite their records of communist activity, we will not get to the bottom of this tragic situation.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.040
Could you care to file that? You are right.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.040
Let it be filed in the record of the approval of the chairman.

21:20.040 --> 21:28.040
He gives them the filing, given the number and file. I may just care in filing now. I think he has been advised informally by his Democratic colleagues.

21:28.040 --> 21:34.040
They have no objection to filing the other documents, Mr. Wattsley. He's having an earlier case given the number. Am I correct, Senator?

21:34.040 --> 21:41.040
I have no objection to the file. I simply assert that I have a right to see you know what's going on before it happens.

21:41.040 --> 21:46.040
I will. The committee documents that don't have a proceeding exhibit number and just for the file is carried away.

21:46.040 --> 21:53.040
Mr. Coleman, before asking you, Mr. President, I'm sorry. Mr. Wylander, I'm sorry.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.040
Mr. Coleman, thank you.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.040
The 26th of this may not be the 27th of this, but it is never started.

21:58.040 --> 22:16.040
Before we hear you, Mr. Coleman, with respect to your relationships, your conflicts, your conversations with the secretary of the Army and his attorney, Mr. Adams, I want you to tell the members of this committee, your version, your story,

22:16.040 --> 22:26.040
all your investigation of the versions of Fort Monmouth and the results of that. I have missed you, Mr. Stevens, for his version of Fort Monmouth.

22:26.040 --> 22:42.040
I have missed you, Adams, to relate his version. I should now like to give Mr. Coleman an opportunity to give the cone version of your investigation of Fort Monmouth and the results you obtained without going into specific cases.

22:42.040 --> 22:54.040
Mr. Coleman, from our Lithney S.U.A. specific question, how long did you investigate the alleged interrogation of curious, parser, birthing at the installation of the Army known as Fort Monmouth?

22:54.040 --> 23:02.040
Sir, the committee's attention and the attention of the staff were first directed to that in the spring of last year.

23:02.040 --> 23:10.040
We are not finished and by hope that when these hearings are over, we will be getting back to that.

23:10.040 --> 23:29.040
How many subversives Mr. Coleman and the U.S.A. were suspended? Mr. Args? Otherwise, any disarray may just taken against them whatsoever as a result of the McCarthy Investigating Committee's efforts along that last.

23:29.040 --> 23:38.040
Sir, before we began our investigation, the number of suspensions was zero. Following our investigation, the number was 35.

23:38.040 --> 23:45.040
I believe that one of the 35 that's been said here by Mr. Stevens has been reinstated with full clearance.

23:45.040 --> 23:57.040
I believe a number of others have been put back on the job but have not had the security clearance restored so that we have, before we started, there was zero.

23:57.040 --> 24:09.040
Now there are 34, most of them under complete suspension. Some of them there, but with security clearance and access to classified material removed.

24:09.040 --> 24:15.040
Mr. Coleman.

24:15.040 --> 24:24.040
Do I understand that it is your position that there were 35 suspension that's the result of the work of the McCarthy staff?

24:24.040 --> 24:27.040
I believe that's the fact, sir.

24:27.040 --> 24:35.040
You have read the statements made by the Secretary of the Army. It's written statements. You read the statement made by Mr. Adam.

24:35.040 --> 24:41.040
Yes, sir. You read the statement? I read those in red. You read those in red.

24:41.040 --> 24:55.040
You recall that it was stated by Mr. Adam in his 40-page statement that while the McCarthy Committee defeated up the suspension of these subversives,

24:55.040 --> 25:02.040
the Army nevertheless would have done it in due course of time. Is that your understanding of what Mr. Adam said in substance?

25:02.040 --> 25:09.040
Yes, sir. Well now Mr. Coleman, what's the significance or importance to you at times?

25:09.040 --> 25:15.040
To the time elements insofar as the subversive is concerned in an installation such as Fort Mamma?

25:15.040 --> 25:22.040
Obviously, sir, time is of the yet in removing a security risk or a subversive from any secret installation.

25:22.040 --> 25:31.040
And particularly, sir, from secret radar laboratories such as all the Fort Mamma's because on the one hand you have the offensive weapons like the Adam and Hyde origin bombs,

25:31.040 --> 25:42.040
the collection type of just about all we have left with the armed defenses to aircraft and atomic attacks and radar is an integral part of those defenses.

25:42.040 --> 25:50.040
And Fort Mamma said one of the nerve centers of radar secret radar research is developing in this country.

25:50.040 --> 25:59.040
Mr. Coleman, it is a rate by you and I'm getting them out to the specific delegation.

25:59.040 --> 26:04.040
The Secretary of the Army and his Council.

26:04.040 --> 26:13.040
Using proper means and methods in their efforts to house the work of the McCarthy Committee particularly in Fort Mamma.

26:13.040 --> 26:24.040
And I now ask you to tell the members of this committee when this first overact was committed in that respect,

26:24.040 --> 26:27.040
now whom and where?

26:27.040 --> 26:37.040
Yes, sir. I don't believe Mr. Jenkins that we have characterized any of the acts that Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams would be used to the act of improper or anything else.

26:37.040 --> 26:43.040
We have set forth what the facts are and I will do that now, sir, at your direction.

26:43.040 --> 26:53.040
I'm asking now to bring you to take these chronologically briefs and even on the way to win the first act whether it's over or not.

26:53.040 --> 26:59.040
By the first word or the first deed was set again, have you consumed?

26:59.040 --> 27:10.040
I am a movie staff and should has an effort on the part of the Secretary of the Army and his Council to stop your investigation of the vertices in Fort Mamma.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.040
Yes, sir.

27:11.040 --> 27:21.040
The first time that we had with Mr. Stevens about it I suppose was during September when we told them that the investigation of Fort Mamma was underway and how deeply content we were about it.

27:21.040 --> 27:25.040
I suppose he had heard that rumored around anyway.

27:25.040 --> 27:32.040
Before that Mr. Adams came on the scene in the end of December and I wait for Mr. Holmes to go to the gravity.

27:32.040 --> 27:37.040
Your first contact as we understand it was with the Secretary alone before Mr. Adams came on the scene.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.040
Yes, sir, I met the Secretary some three weeks before I have met Mr. Adams.

27:40.040 --> 27:46.040
And the thing was that this conversation, this first contact, was the Secretary.

27:46.040 --> 27:54.040
Well, the first contact with the Secretary was held after the exposure of the two people with communist records up until you got the one man.

27:54.040 --> 28:00.040
Was it you saying the most priceless of the fact that you were directing your investigation at Fort Mamma?

28:00.040 --> 28:02.040
So we told him about that on September.

28:02.040 --> 28:08.040
The first time I recall talking with Mr. Stevens about that is on September the 16th, 1950s.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.040
Where was that from? New York.

28:10.040 --> 28:16.040
Where specifically you are. That was in the apartment of Dave Shine, sir.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.040
Who was President?

28:18.040 --> 28:23.040
Chairman McCartney, Mr. Stevens. I was there. Dave Shine was there.

28:23.040 --> 28:27.040
Now precisely what did you tell the Secretary of the Army?

28:27.040 --> 28:33.040
I was respect to you direction of your efforts along the at Fort Mamma.

28:33.040 --> 28:39.040
So there was a general discussion about various areas of communist infiltration in the Army which the committee had on the consideration.

28:40.040 --> 28:44.040
I recall still which were mentioned. One was the Fort Mamma's investigation.

28:44.040 --> 28:53.040
And otherwise the investigation of use of communist lying literature by Army intelligence.

28:53.040 --> 28:57.040
What was the Secretary of the Army's say on that issue?

28:57.040 --> 29:01.040
Well, he indicated he was very much concerned about the situation.

29:01.040 --> 29:05.040
What they're saying did he say Mr. Corn?

29:05.040 --> 29:10.040
The fact he didn't believe that he did not want you to conduct such an investigation with respect.

29:10.040 --> 29:16.040
Just a person's in Fort Mamma. On that occasion? They have no medication. Nothing. Nothing, whatever.

29:16.040 --> 29:20.040
Was there anything on that occasion? Do we accept him or sixteen?

29:20.040 --> 29:26.040
Said to the Secretary of the Army that was improper in any way whatsoever.

29:26.040 --> 29:29.040
So they were.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.040
Now, when was your next time back to the 6th day?

29:32.040 --> 29:39.040
The next time back to the Secretary of the Jankin would be the day.

29:39.040 --> 29:44.040
We held an executive session on use of communist literature by Army intelligence.

29:44.040 --> 29:49.040
It's down in the first floor of this building and I think that was about a week later. A week or so later.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.040
Would be then approximately September 23rd.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.040
Well, I think the date was 6th by Mrs. Steven to the 21st of September.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.040
I'm sure that's right.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.040
Was anything improper said to the Secretary of the Army?

30:00.040 --> 30:04.040
Home with respect to your stopping your work at Fort Mamma's denigest?

30:04.040 --> 30:15.040
When was the first time that the Secretary of the Army ever suggested to you that you just continue that work and turn it over to him?

30:15.040 --> 30:20.040
Are maybe the others the decision leading you to believe that he wanted this?

30:20.040 --> 30:24.040
The McCarthy Committee just sent down an album that the Army do that work.

30:24.040 --> 30:31.040
The first conversation which I have a recollection of Mr. Steven's about that, I would think on or about October 13th.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.040
And where was that?

30:33.040 --> 30:35.040
Merchants Club, New York.

30:35.040 --> 30:39.040
Now, on 8th 6th, Mr. Cohn, the police failed the committee in detail.

30:39.040 --> 30:44.040
What the Secretary says on many days, and also with 13th, is the Merchants Club in New York City.

30:44.040 --> 30:51.040
Sir, the base chronological about this, with Mr. Adams had come into the picture in the meantime, there have been some conversation with him.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.040
Let me withdraw my question in the arctic.

30:54.040 --> 31:03.040
I will ask him whether or not the first time you were in routine, these are you, our Senator McCutley.

31:03.040 --> 31:10.040
By anyone connected to the Army, tradition continued your investigation of the forces of Fort Mamma's was done by Mr. John Adams.

31:10.040 --> 31:13.040
It was. Now, where and when was that?

31:13.040 --> 31:17.040
That was up to the United States, what happened to you, after the first week of October.

31:18.040 --> 31:21.040
Yes. Was the 6th day of the Army with the Miss Cohn or Medication?

31:21.040 --> 31:22.040
No.

31:22.040 --> 31:25.040
Who did the Cell of Committee in detail?

31:25.040 --> 31:28.040
What was said on that occasion of Mr. Adams?

31:28.040 --> 31:29.040
And what occurred?

31:29.040 --> 31:37.040
Yes. What occurred was that we had had our hearing on the public hearing on cognitive simpletration of the Army in December 28th.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.040
In December 29th, Senator McCutley was married, but not anymore.

31:41.040 --> 32:01.040
And the staff conducted interviews on Fort Mamma's personnel, people working in the secret radar laboratory, the first Fort Mamma in New York in the beginning of October, while Senator McCutley was away.

32:02.040 --> 32:09.040
Before the Senator has left as the Jenkins, he gave us a play of reaching him by shortwave radio.

32:09.040 --> 32:18.040
I don't think he encouraged us to reach him, but he gave us a method of doing that in case we wanted him to come back.

32:18.040 --> 32:23.040
Were there few interruptions on any moves? I'm afraid we did this.

32:24.040 --> 32:35.040
But before that, we conducted staff interviews of people currently working in the secret radar laboratory in Fort Mamma's during September and during October.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
Now to come directly to your question.

32:37.040 --> 32:42.040
During some of those staff interviews at the beginning of October, we're all in New York.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.040
Mr. John Adams.
