WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
We had been appointed on trouble one.

00:02.240 --> 00:03.480
I met him before that.

00:03.480 --> 00:09.120
I believe that he had come over to our hearing on September 28 and before the appointment.

00:09.120 --> 00:13.680
Mr. Steven told us that Mr. Adams was going to be appointed and would be working with

00:13.680 --> 00:14.680
our committee.

00:14.680 --> 00:19.720
But in any event, during the first few days of October, while we were having in the

00:19.720 --> 00:24.160
employee that led us at the Secret Rade All Laboratory, concerning when we had information

00:24.160 --> 00:29.120
of communist affiliation, association with communist spies, removal of documents, things

00:29.120 --> 00:34.720
of that kind, Mr. Adams came up to New York and sat in on those interrogations.

00:34.720 --> 00:35.720
We were.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.560
Now, if anything, did Mr. Adams stay?

00:38.560 --> 00:44.880
Well, Mr. Adams, I might say that we became friendly, Mr. Carr and I, and the other

00:44.880 --> 00:45.880
staff members.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.880
They came suddenly with Mr. Adams.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.640
He would go out for lunch with us and there was a very cordial and pleasant relationship.

00:51.640 --> 00:56.120
We, Mr. Adams, we discussed the witnesses and the hearings and the whole situation and we

00:56.120 --> 00:58.240
discussed Mr. Adams in a job.

00:58.240 --> 01:03.360
And the notifications, Mr. Adams made it clear to us that he would be very appreciative

01:03.360 --> 01:08.360
if we could find some way of avoiding any kind of hearings.

01:08.360 --> 01:13.440
Executive will public or anything else on the situation of communist infiltration at the

01:13.440 --> 01:16.440
Army Secret Rade All Laboratory at Club Monk.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.080
He, somewhere, his objections, Mr. Cummings.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.440
Well, sir, it wasn't so much a question of objection.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.800
He just wanted to know if we could avoid some way of doing it.

01:23.800 --> 01:29.960
He thought that if we could such an arrangement with the a lot more agreeable to Mr. Steven

01:29.960 --> 01:34.000
and that it was solidified, Mr. Adams, who had just been appointed in his new position.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.800
He thought that if some way to see worked out of avoiding the Chuck Committee going into

01:38.800 --> 01:43.640
this and letting the Army go into it on the basis of such committee information, it would

01:43.640 --> 01:47.640
be a more pleasant arrangement to Mr. Steven's and former director.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.400
Mr. Adams, can you specifically for what purpose he had been employed?

01:52.400 --> 01:56.360
For what principle purpose he had been employed in the Secretary of the Army?

01:56.360 --> 02:02.040
He had been employed at Council, but he told us that Mr. Steven had given him as his first

02:02.040 --> 02:07.800
and most important assignment, working, observing the committee hearing and working on this

02:07.800 --> 02:09.040
fortnight missed investigation.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.760
Later on, I'll see you at that time, Mr. Cohn.

02:12.760 --> 02:18.680
Mr. Steven, desire that you discontinue your investigation at Fort Monmouth and turn his

02:18.680 --> 02:19.680
back to the Army.

02:19.680 --> 02:24.240
He does not make a direct request, Mr. Jack, and he made it clear to us that if some way

02:24.240 --> 02:29.380
could be found to have the such committee not hold hearings, but let Mr. Adams and Mr.

02:29.380 --> 02:34.160
Steven still the job, that would be welcome, those to Mr. Steven's and the draft.

02:34.160 --> 02:42.480
Either not to exceed to that to where we say inference that you grew from, what he said,

02:42.480 --> 02:44.480
not so far too resourceful.

02:44.480 --> 02:50.160
I had no authority in need of Mr. Cohn, any other staff member to exceed to that, Mr.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
Chairman.

02:51.160 --> 02:55.720
Had made the decision and it was not enough how to reverse that decision.

02:55.720 --> 03:03.400
The second point is we could see no basis in fact for even making a recommendation to the

03:03.400 --> 03:05.600
chairman on that for this reason, Mr. Jenkins.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.000
This situation had existed for a long time.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
The infiltration by people with record of funding of defoliation in the Secret Army

03:12.000 --> 03:13.640
rate, I'll have it for you to Fort Monmouth.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.200
The FBI has been wanting about it for years.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.160
Prior to Mr. Steven's administration and during Mr. Steven's administration.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.440
And it looked pretty much like one of those situations where action was being taken

03:24.440 --> 03:25.440
to be caused.

03:25.440 --> 03:30.640
Our committee was investigating and where if we stop, the action might very well stop.

03:30.640 --> 03:36.720
Mr. Cohn had or not the army at that time that is in the first week of October 53.

03:36.720 --> 03:43.320
Done anything whatsoever to your knowledge by way of concentrating its efforts in pinpointing

03:43.320 --> 03:45.960
the existence of the birthdays of Fort Monmouth?

03:45.960 --> 03:51.360
Yes, after our conversations with Mr. Steven in the middle of September, there were, I think

03:51.360 --> 03:56.280
Mr. Steven said five or six suspensions found the secret rate all over the fort lineman

03:56.280 --> 04:00.280
on the ground of security risk charges and communist affiliation charges.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.680
And I have no reason to follow with that.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.360
And the Army then, you bring about a prior to your meeting with Mr. Steven's on September

04:05.360 --> 04:06.360
16th.

04:06.360 --> 04:07.360
As far as I know, it had not.

04:07.360 --> 04:11.360
I think Mr. Steven's charge shows that one person has been suspended in order.

04:11.360 --> 04:17.600
Now, chronologically, was your next contact to the one who was the first week of October

04:17.600 --> 04:18.600
with Miss Adams?

04:18.600 --> 04:22.360
Was it with Miss Adams or was it with the Secretary of the Army?

04:22.360 --> 04:24.360
Well, sir, it was with Mr. Adams.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.840
He was there, I believe, more than one day.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.480
I think he was there two or three days, or maybe more than that.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.720
He would be in on the session when he wasn't there, his assistant would be there.

04:32.720 --> 04:39.120
And he would keep right on talking to us and a topic of discussion on his part was, could

04:39.120 --> 04:44.040
we arrive at some formula, which he could tell the statements about whereby the smithy

04:44.040 --> 04:49.280
would foul out and left the army, conduct the investigations of those conversations with

04:49.280 --> 04:51.880
Mr. Adams, continued on.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.880
They came a time a few days later when the full pricing from that, do I understand you

04:55.880 --> 05:00.880
just say that he said that the Secretary would be happier about it and that it would solidify

05:00.880 --> 05:04.080
him with the Secretary if his desire for it to get to...

05:04.080 --> 05:06.440
He made a clear that Secretary would be happy about.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.400
I don't think he said solidify him with the Secretary.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.200
I think he said it was the effect that it would be of feather in his cap and his new job

05:13.200 --> 05:14.200
if he could accomplish six.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.200
And I would...

05:15.200 --> 05:16.200
He said it was his element of conversation with Mr. Adams.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.200
He said he was a short time there, I think.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.200
Yes.

05:18.200 --> 05:25.200
Well, this same line of conversation continued pretty much from that point on for a period

05:25.200 --> 05:26.200
of months.

05:26.200 --> 05:31.960
The next development was, as we called in and talked to, more and more of these people who were

05:31.960 --> 05:35.120
working in the secret radar laboratory to pull up mud myths.

05:35.120 --> 05:39.360
And as we saw, a lot of the security situation was what the record of some of these people might

05:39.360 --> 05:40.360
see.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.760
And the fact that no action had been taken, I communicated with Senator McCarty.

05:44.760 --> 05:48.760
By shortwave radio, I flew down and I met him at West Palm Beach.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.760
He was in Unnihlin.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
He came in.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.760
I met him at West Palm Beach.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.240
I think I saw some of the transcripts of testimony down with me.

05:55.240 --> 06:00.160
I told him that there had been a few suspensions, but that there were still a size of a number

06:00.160 --> 06:05.400
of people working in the secret radar laboratory at Fort Mudmouth with records of communists

06:05.400 --> 06:08.240
of aviation to a greater or lesser degree.

06:08.240 --> 06:12.280
And the deal was the extremely sensitive work and anti-aircraft defense and radar activity

06:12.280 --> 06:13.280
being done there.

06:13.280 --> 06:18.400
I thought and the staff thought that the situation was serious enough to add Senator McCarty to

06:18.400 --> 06:21.880
come back and start holding formal executive sessions right away.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.400
Did we understand that the Senator was in on these honeymoon?

06:24.400 --> 06:25.400
He had been through yet.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.040
And if Senator McCarty has a result of you're going to West Palm Beach and having a conversation

06:30.040 --> 06:32.880
with him return to Washington, on New York, above.

06:32.880 --> 06:33.880
He did.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.920
I met him on a Friday, Mr. McCarty at West Palm Beach.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.520
He flew to Wisconsin for Saturday and Sunday.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.600
And on Monday, he was in New York to hold here.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.600
And we're hearing a call, they were.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.320
Was Mr. Adam Smith?

06:46.320 --> 06:48.840
I told me call with Mr. Adams was there on Monday.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.200
I think Monday was the 12th and I'm not sure that.

06:51.200 --> 06:56.200
I know that on the second day, both Mr. Adam and Mrs. Seenan arrived on the scene.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.800
Now, that's October 13th.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.800
I believe that's the October 13th there.

06:59.800 --> 07:06.200
I want you to go with the meeting Mr. Cohen, how to cut on October 13th in New York City.

07:06.200 --> 07:11.160
And particularly with respect to anything that was said or done, having relevant issues

07:11.160 --> 07:13.760
against Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adler.

07:13.760 --> 07:19.280
Well, having relevant to start through the facts that they replaced Mr. Seenan and Mr.

07:19.280 --> 07:24.200
Adam Siree Clawis came up to New York and came over to an executive session of the

07:24.200 --> 07:26.000
subcommittee on the morning of the 13th.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
That is the exact date.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.680
Face-out in during the testimony, I believe that a couple of current employees, that the

07:32.680 --> 07:36.720
secret radar laboratory, the Float Line, have testified, a couple of former employees

07:36.720 --> 07:41.000
and folks have said some amendments about S, B, N, I, and sabotage and things of that

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
kind.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
It was a bad situation.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.600
And Mr. Seenan and Mr. Adam heard that testimony.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.760
While they were there on that day, and during the lunch hour when we went over and had lunch

07:50.760 --> 07:57.520
with them, Mr. Seenan and Mr. Adam raised with Senator McCoffee the question of whether

07:57.520 --> 08:01.360
or not we had to have hearings whether we had to continue with them when the investigation

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
was going to stop.

08:02.360 --> 08:09.360
And wasn't there some way that Mr. Seenan and Mr. Adam could get us to stop and let

08:09.360 --> 08:13.000
Mr. Seenan and Mr. Adam show this to themselves?

08:13.000 --> 08:18.240
At that time, the second day, our executive attorney, Mr. Adam, complained about the time

08:18.240 --> 08:22.480
of newspaper from this year that was following from these hearings, Mr. Clawis.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.720
You mean to just that it was unfair and it was like, say, did not?

08:25.720 --> 08:26.720
Obviously, it was this party?

08:26.720 --> 08:27.720
Oh no, sir.

08:27.720 --> 08:32.240
It's a matter of fact, Mr. Adam and Mr. Seenan, I believe, for men on and for men on,

08:32.240 --> 08:34.880
I think prior to that time, I've been present in some of the sessions, I've been present

08:34.880 --> 08:36.880
in some of the news conferences held.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.440
After the sessions had not anticipated some of those news conferences, and I don't

08:40.440 --> 08:45.680
recall of any suggestions of inaccuracy as to anything Senator McCoffee said ever being

08:45.680 --> 08:49.360
made by Mr. Seenan or by Mr. Adam.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.360
I think sir.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.040
Well, this is a matter of fact, these are a number of the staffers that are going to

08:54.040 --> 08:59.120
be used to the place any of the starting just our own faithful account of the proceedings

08:59.120 --> 09:00.120
of those engaging.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.120
So I'm sure we did not say.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.280
We did not, I'm sure.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.040
I'm sure you say there was no complaint about it.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.040
There was none.

09:05.040 --> 09:09.120
Mr. Clawis and Mr. King of the Bible, I would say, Mr. Clawis.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.720
There was no complaint that I was our own Meyary.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.480
I might say, Mr. Clawis, it was very clear that they did not like the fact that there

09:14.480 --> 09:17.880
was Communist, there happened some Communist infiltration.

09:17.880 --> 09:22.480
And that Senator McCoffee was suggesting that it should have been acted upon earlier.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.580
They did not like the fact that thought was being publicized, but they made no statement

09:26.580 --> 09:29.520
that any of the publicity was unfair.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.440
I were in New York on October 13th, Mr. Cohn.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.720
I want you to tell the committee whether or not to have a arrangement was made by Mr.

09:36.720 --> 09:43.480
Stevens with a merchant's club, I would say he was a member with respect to the entertainment

09:43.480 --> 09:48.680
and facilities of that club being a tender to Senator McCoffee and the members of his

09:48.680 --> 09:49.680
club.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.680
Father, Mr. Stevens, I want to say something.

09:51.680 --> 09:57.080
Very, very, very kind and he offers to put the facilities and the merchants across to

09:57.080 --> 09:58.080
which he belongs.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.400
I have a dining room there and I want you to not be disfuzzled of the subcommittee and

10:01.400 --> 10:06.920
instead every day during the time of our business of the New York on it.

10:06.920 --> 10:12.560
And was that to be free of cost in so far as the Senator and members of his club?

10:12.560 --> 10:16.400
And then there was no discussion about that, so I assume that was included in the offer.

10:16.400 --> 10:22.000
And as I might say, I think certainly nothing wrong in the offer, Mr. Stevens was always

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
very courteous and very considerate.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.200
Are you in the trap, I'm wearing a card on that, he said he's throwing that thing

10:27.200 --> 10:28.200
wrong about it, whatever.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.200
I think nothing wrong with that.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.200
Did you agree yourself on these?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.200
No, sir, we didn't.

10:32.200 --> 10:38.680
I believe that when Mr. Stevens was present on the 13th, we had lunch with him there.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.720
I think the next day, Mr. Stevens had left the floor lunch, but some of the generals

10:42.720 --> 10:45.720
were there and Mr. Adams and we went over that day.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.680
There was no room to spend the feast when we had lunch with Mr. Stevens there.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.040
From the great majority of occasions, we ate over a cabinet restaurant right near Polys

10:53.040 --> 10:56.520
there, in New York, we ate over there, not at the merchant's spot.

10:56.520 --> 11:05.000
Now Mr. Coln, I want you to tell the committee to properly stay and to what degree Mr. Stevens

11:05.000 --> 11:11.280
and Mr. Adams in the changing of the Christmas season.

11:11.280 --> 11:17.320
To this continue your games with respect to Fort Monmouth and turn it over to the Army.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.320
Yes, sir.

11:18.320 --> 11:22.480
So there were something I would call infertuning Mr. Jenkins or anything like that.

11:22.480 --> 11:27.280
There was a discussion in which Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams made it very clear to send them

11:27.280 --> 11:32.720
a car to the sooner we stopped investigating the Army, but better communists infiltration

11:32.720 --> 11:35.040
of the Army, the better they would like.

11:35.040 --> 11:40.840
And that would certainly be welcome to them personally if we were stuck.

11:40.840 --> 11:46.720
They do not believe that they can be communists infiltration in the Army, particularly at Fort

11:46.720 --> 11:47.720
Monmouth.

11:47.720 --> 11:48.720
I was like denied by the...

11:48.720 --> 11:52.440
Oh no, there was no doubt about it in the online or an online or anyone's mind.

11:52.480 --> 11:57.880
Did you see a limb with the Coln that they were exerting too much pressure on you and the

11:57.880 --> 11:58.880
senator?

11:58.880 --> 12:00.800
Sir, I attached no special significance to that.

12:00.800 --> 12:05.000
Most people whose departments or agencies are under investigation are not happy about

12:05.000 --> 12:08.600
that fact and the son of the investigation is over, the better they like it.

12:08.600 --> 12:13.280
And Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams obviously were not personally pleased that what my piece

12:13.280 --> 12:18.640
class is unfavorable results and unfavorable publicity from their standpoint and indications

12:18.640 --> 12:23.520
that communists and communists infiltration had gone on and spared the department.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.680
I assume it was personally embarrassing to a certain degree and that they wanted us

12:27.680 --> 12:28.680
to stop.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.680
I saw nothing unusual.

12:29.680 --> 12:35.680
I just have to ask by other people before and why your work is that plain, vain proofs

12:35.680 --> 12:39.480
and were you exposing him causing the suspension of subversives of Fort Monmouth?

12:39.480 --> 12:43.920
Well, sir, I think that the record stands that before our committee started the record

12:43.920 --> 12:44.920
was zero.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.240
After our committee investigation, the record of suspension of people from the secret

12:48.240 --> 12:49.240
radar laboratory stood at 35.

12:49.240 --> 12:52.240
So I don't think they can be much dispute about results.

12:52.240 --> 12:58.240
When Mr. Cohn was the next contact between the McCarthy Committee and the not-say-the-army

12:58.240 --> 13:00.240
we say the second Mr. Adams.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.240
So I wonder the other after all.

13:02.240 --> 13:06.240
Sir, I want to say at this point, obviously I am leaving out here.

13:06.240 --> 13:10.440
You and I have discussed matters which you were one who I know and the well-sinteraked me

13:10.440 --> 13:15.200
about and close examination about the shine matter and about other conversations and discussions

13:15.200 --> 13:19.760
I am trying to channel myself to the areas which you have outlined here and the other

13:19.760 --> 13:20.760
correct about.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.760
Yes sir.

13:21.760 --> 13:28.440
On that, the next discussion was up to over the 14th, the very next day and one was up

13:28.440 --> 13:29.440
to this session.

13:29.440 --> 13:34.160
Well, sir, I got to go back to the 13th for one minute and tell you what Senate and

13:34.160 --> 13:42.440
McCarthy's reaction was to the request or the discussion by Mr. Cohn and Mr. Adams

13:42.440 --> 13:47.320
as to whether or not we could not end our investigation of communist infiltration and the

13:47.320 --> 13:51.440
covering up of communist infiltration by the law senators say on the 13th, Mr. Cohn.

13:51.440 --> 13:57.520
I remember that the senator went into some detail which I want to hear about our investigation

13:57.520 --> 14:02.720
of the government's reting on and used that to illustrate the fact that just how long

14:02.720 --> 14:07.160
it would be necessary for the committee to continue its investigation of communist infiltration

14:07.160 --> 14:11.560
in the army, how it came about and who was responsible for it, would depend to a large

14:11.560 --> 14:16.640
degree on the cooperation received from Mr. Cohn and Mr. Adams on the House cleaning

14:16.640 --> 14:22.440
job which they themselves did not only in getting out communist and security risk but in

14:22.440 --> 14:27.720
getting out the people who had allowed these communist and security risk to stay in the

14:27.720 --> 14:31.400
sensitive post during a period of time.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.960
I remember that the senator was there as well now and we investigated she gone forever

14:35.960 --> 14:37.880
and the senator said of course it won't go on forever.

14:37.880 --> 14:42.560
And the senator said we got other things to do so but happy to all be I can say.

14:42.560 --> 14:47.360
What's the effect I am possible now to spend any kind of a time with him on it, we have

14:47.360 --> 14:52.560
to see how things go, what results are obtained, what kind of a house cleaning job you people

14:52.560 --> 14:53.560
do.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.640
That was the substance of that conversation that shocked over 13.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.640
I believe that was our 12th or 13th.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.240
The day Mr. Davis had come up to talk to the senator.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.240
Now we face the 14th of October.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.240
Yes.

15:03.240 --> 15:07.720
Well let's get to the committee what was said and on that occasion on that date by the

15:07.720 --> 15:08.720
6th day of our Mr. Adams.

15:08.720 --> 15:15.320
Well so there were two, well I was a very significant incident on the 14th of October.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.320
We need to relay to his knowledge.

15:17.320 --> 15:18.320
Yes.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.320
First of all that's a physical presence.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.720
Mr. Adams we had three sessions that day.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.520
Morning, afternoon and night.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.160
Mr. Stevens was present during part of the morning session.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.040
He then left and went someplace else.

15:32.040 --> 15:37.200
Mr. Adams I believe was present during four free executive sessions of the Sunday morning,

15:37.200 --> 15:39.320
afternoon and night.

15:39.320 --> 15:45.240
The two significant incidents Mr. Jenkins are the, and for the first one I have to go back

15:45.240 --> 15:49.960
briefly to Aaron Coleman because that's what it was about.

15:49.960 --> 15:55.280
As I told you, back in the spring we found that Aaron Coleman was still working in

15:55.280 --> 15:56.280
the office.

15:56.280 --> 16:02.280
We found from the public record that this Aaron Coleman had been a friend and associate

16:02.280 --> 16:07.200
of a coffee convicted Adam Pai, Susan Rosenberg.

16:07.200 --> 16:12.920
We had received reliable information that Aaron Coleman had participated in communist activity

16:12.920 --> 16:15.760
along with Rosenberg and that this man was still at lunch.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.920
Now, those are thoughts of the 14th we had found out something else too.

16:20.920 --> 16:26.400
We had been told, reliably, that this same Aaron Coleman, the man who had been a friend

16:26.400 --> 16:31.560
and associate of Rosenberg, gone to the, for the communist meeting with him, had taken

16:31.560 --> 16:38.440
paper, documents, secret documents from the Army radar laboratory at Fort Manda while

16:38.440 --> 16:44.080
occupying a very important sensitive post-air dealing with the secret radar anti-aircraft

16:44.080 --> 16:45.080
culprit.

16:45.080 --> 16:50.360
We have been told specifically Mr. Jenkins that one afternoon, a number of years before

16:50.360 --> 16:55.680
Coleman, while leaving the laboratory, I believe some paper had flipped out from a pocket

16:55.680 --> 16:56.680
in his coat.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.320
That paper was retrieved by a security guard.

16:59.320 --> 17:04.040
The guard looked at it and found it to be a secret or classified radar document.

17:04.040 --> 17:09.600
The guard immediately reported to his superior that the fact that Mr. Coleman had a paper

17:09.600 --> 17:12.960
dropped out of Mr. Coleman's pocket when he was leaving the laboratory and that paper turned

17:12.960 --> 17:16.960
to be a secret document bearing on important radar work.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.360
Was it those types of evidence to be true?

17:19.360 --> 17:24.960
Yes, and it's important for dropping through an incident which took place on our 12th

17:24.960 --> 17:27.960
14th and I'm going to try to slide that right in, Mr. Jenkins, go on.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.080
Those types of things developed to be true.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.840
I might set, well, the next step was this.

17:32.840 --> 17:38.200
After the report was made to the security guard, picked up the document which dropped out

17:38.200 --> 17:41.200
of Coleman's pocket as I recall it.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.200
That might be wrong on a statement detailed.

17:43.200 --> 17:50.200
Mr. Coleman, the security guard, went to his superior in the security and he too set up

17:50.200 --> 17:51.200
at four months.

17:51.200 --> 17:56.880
He told the chief security officer at four months that this man, Aaron Coleman, while

17:56.880 --> 18:00.880
leaving the laboratory had apparently had on his surface a secret document.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.360
The document had fallen out of his pocket and there it was.

18:04.360 --> 18:11.160
The security officer then sent for Mr. Coleman and confronted him and said to him Mr. Coleman

18:11.160 --> 18:18.160
Coleman, if Mr. Coleman stays back, that you have been removing from this laboratory secrets

18:18.160 --> 18:25.160
radar documents and that after a whole with this very time you have put away, fed away

18:25.160 --> 18:28.160
secret radar documents which you have taken from the laboratory.

18:28.160 --> 18:33.660
The testimony under wrote before this committee by the security officer was the

18:33.660 --> 18:40.660
security officer in authorizing a raid by Army intelligence officers on Coleman's home.

18:40.660 --> 18:45.660
The raid took place there and in the course of that raid some 43 secrets and other lines

18:45.660 --> 18:50.660
classified radar documents at his home denied for the investigation from the laboratory

18:50.660 --> 18:53.660
to his home and that they were then in his home.

18:53.660 --> 18:57.660
That's likely he retreated from his denial until he made enough of an admission.

18:57.660 --> 19:02.660
So, one, the security officer in authorizing a raid by Army intelligence officers on Coleman's home.

19:02.660 --> 19:07.660
The raid by radar documents was found in a bureau drawer in Coleman's home and not

19:07.660 --> 19:12.660
by the way I believe according to Coleman's own admission to give a complete picture of the

19:12.660 --> 19:15.660
advantage by this country and radar defense.

19:15.660 --> 19:18.660
Also a certain period I believe that was in 1946.

19:18.660 --> 19:20.660
That's it.

19:20.660 --> 19:27.660
At that time, prior to in December these facts that come to our attention, we did not know

19:27.660 --> 19:28.660
the facts.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.660
We have reliable information.

19:30.660 --> 19:41.660
Therefore, we went down physically to Portland and we had to see Aaron Coleman personnel file

19:41.660 --> 19:44.660
which is available to us for any congressional committee.

19:44.660 --> 19:45.660
Can you give the data that busy?

19:45.660 --> 19:47.660
That was very early in our co-op.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.660
I would say that was about October.

19:49.660 --> 19:52.660
He was called October 14th, Col. 12th.

19:52.660 --> 19:54.660
I say the third of course about cover.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.660
We got it in one.

19:55.660 --> 19:59.660
We went down to Portland and we had to see Coleman's personnel file.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.660
I might say we were in title for this.

20:01.660 --> 20:05.660
It was displayed to us by somebody under General Law and jurisdiction.

20:05.660 --> 20:09.660
We went over that file, the lengthy file.

20:09.660 --> 20:15.660
And in that file, we found documentary proof that what we have heard about Coleman taking

20:15.660 --> 20:20.660
these documents from the secret laboratory to his home was true.

20:20.660 --> 20:27.660
We found a report by Army Intelligence in the Coleman personnel file, corroborating the

20:27.660 --> 20:32.660
facts which we had learned and indicating that Coleman in fact had been caught with these

20:32.660 --> 20:38.660
documents and a bureau throw in his home during a raid by Army Intelligence.

20:38.660 --> 20:44.660
We found a photo file that in Spider-Man and in Spider-Man we know that Coleman's close

20:44.660 --> 20:51.660
relationship was out in Spider-Man and participated in communist activities to some degree with

20:51.660 --> 20:52.660
the Soviet Rosenberg.

20:52.660 --> 20:56.660
In Spider-Man through practice the Association of Rosenberg, the attendance of the communist

20:56.660 --> 21:01.660
meaning and the taking of documents from the laboratory that Aaron Coleman had been allowed

21:01.660 --> 21:06.660
to continue his work at Portland and was in fact still at Portland when our investigation

21:06.660 --> 21:07.660
began.

21:07.660 --> 21:12.660
We brought this to Jenkins that this was known for that we made a verb, say it in common,

21:12.660 --> 21:17.660
we put a pair of papers and copied word for word, the document and the Coleman personnel

21:17.660 --> 21:19.660
file were still these facts.

21:20.660 --> 21:26.660
We then asked if we could take the file with those facts available at that time and have

21:26.660 --> 21:29.660
been available to the Secretary of the Army.

21:29.660 --> 21:31.660
Oh they were in an Army file?

21:31.660 --> 21:32.660
They were.

21:32.660 --> 21:33.660
Yes, of course they were available.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.660
They were.

21:34.660 --> 21:41.660
Now we first I believe that if we could take the file with us, they told us no, we couldn't

21:41.660 --> 21:45.660
take the file with us because that would lead them without any record of the file.

21:45.660 --> 21:52.160
So what would happen was they would have the file hold us down and trans-papy a

21:52.160 --> 21:55.660
photocytic copy of the file transmitted to us through the Pentagon.

21:55.660 --> 21:56.660
That was perfectly agreeable.

21:56.660 --> 22:00.660
We didn't care whether we had the original paper or a photocytic copy.

22:00.660 --> 22:07.660
So we copied out, we copied out, unbeknownst to them I believe, they were all there was

22:07.660 --> 22:08.660
nothing wrong in it certainly.

22:08.660 --> 22:14.660
We copied out the particular question of the file which shows that Coleman, Coleman had

22:14.660 --> 22:17.660
been writing that the secret document is a thousand of your thoughts.

22:17.660 --> 22:20.660
Did you come in contact with General Love and on Medicaid and Mr. Cohn?

22:20.660 --> 22:21.660
I did not.

22:21.660 --> 22:27.660
I came in contact with so members of General Love and the Department of General Love and

22:27.660 --> 22:36.660
I believe and another gentleman who was in charge of the file and he had the same name

22:36.660 --> 22:40.660
as somebody else in his case is later that you came in contact with General Love and

22:40.660 --> 22:43.660
worked with you and me and you were investigating it and of course my members.

22:43.660 --> 22:44.660
I had never met the General Love.

22:44.660 --> 22:50.660
So the way that I say is that we have made this copy of that file out of the file which

22:50.660 --> 22:55.660
is also very significant and they have promised to send us the photostat of the complete

22:55.660 --> 22:56.660
file through the Pentagon.

22:56.660 --> 22:59.660
Now that's really an October, you're talking about October.

22:59.660 --> 23:03.660
Now sir, we kept trusting Mr. Adam for that file.

23:03.660 --> 23:07.660
We told him we kept asking where is the photostat of this Coleman personnel file.

23:07.660 --> 23:08.660
We needed it.

23:08.660 --> 23:09.660
We needed to have it.

23:09.660 --> 23:11.660
And we finally got it.

23:11.660 --> 23:12.660
So I'm in through Adam.

23:12.660 --> 23:17.660
I believe on the 15th of October, although it might have been prior to that.

23:17.660 --> 23:23.660
But anyway sir, on the morning of the 14th of October, Aaron Coleman himself, while they witnessed

23:23.660 --> 23:26.660
before the subcommittee.

23:26.660 --> 23:31.660
At that time had you procured from the items that Cylon Coleman, we thought we had the file.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.660
He gave us what's the photostat to be the file.

23:33.660 --> 23:37.660
And I had that file in front of me.

23:37.660 --> 23:39.660
I gave it over to Senator McCarty.

23:39.660 --> 23:42.660
He was interrogating Coleman, questioning Coleman, under oath.

23:42.660 --> 23:45.660
Mr. Stevens was sitting there and Mr. Adam was sitting there.

23:45.660 --> 23:47.660
I remember that Senator McCarty turned to me.

23:47.660 --> 23:52.660
First we covered the Rosenberg Coleman connection and Rosenberg's position at Fort

23:52.660 --> 23:53.660
Month.

23:53.660 --> 23:57.660
Senator McCarty then turned to me and said, would you take me that file?

23:57.660 --> 24:02.660
I gave him a file and he had now shown me where the documents are that show that Coleman was

24:02.660 --> 24:06.660
caught with secret radar documents in his column and that inside of that fact they let

24:06.660 --> 24:08.660
him stay right on it for a month.

24:08.660 --> 24:10.660
For a period of 40, usually 40 on documents.

24:10.660 --> 24:12.660
I believe the number is 43.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.660
Senator McCarty said, show me where it is in the file.

24:15.660 --> 24:18.660
He was about to ask Coleman some questions about it.

24:18.660 --> 24:22.660
I said it's in such a such a section and I pointed to where it was.

24:22.660 --> 24:25.660
He kept going through and he said it's not here.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.660
I kept saying it is there.

24:27.660 --> 24:28.660
It must be there.

24:28.660 --> 24:32.660
And he gave me the file and I remember there was a little bit of excitement until three staff members started

24:32.660 --> 24:37.660
going through the file with a moment and one was so psyched through and each one had a lot of papers in it.

24:37.660 --> 24:42.660
We kept going through that file and going through it and Senator McCarty kept saying where the

24:42.660 --> 24:46.660
papers, where the papers, where the papers and we couldn't find them.

24:46.660 --> 24:53.660
It had become rather embarrassing at that point and I went over to Mr. Adams and I said, John,

24:53.660 --> 24:55.660
there's something wrong here.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.660
Who had given you the file?

24:57.660 --> 25:00.660
Zolly Colton, Mr. Adams has given us the odds or has come from Mr. Adams off.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.660
I don't remember him personally handing his thoughts.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.660
We got a lot of files from them.

25:04.660 --> 25:10.660
They came from journals and somebody in his office for working under his control.

25:10.660 --> 25:15.660
Anyway, I went over to Mr. Adams I think it was and some of the people working with him and I said,

25:15.660 --> 25:17.660
there's something wrong here.

25:17.660 --> 25:19.660
There's something missing from this file.

25:19.660 --> 25:22.660
I was hurt so that there was nothing missing from the file.

25:22.660 --> 25:24.660
One of the staff members, I think it was Jim.

25:24.660 --> 25:26.660
You told my Jim, you knew.

25:26.660 --> 25:27.660
I think it was Jim Julian.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.660
He had been down at my list.

25:30.660 --> 25:33.660
I think it was Jim who has made the copy of that paper we wanted from the file.

25:33.660 --> 25:41.660
He went upstairs and he got his notes and he changed down with the verbatim copy of what has been in the file and we went, when we left, what that?

25:41.660 --> 25:43.660
And there was.

25:43.660 --> 25:48.660
I then took that over to some of the army people and I said, this paper was in the file.

25:48.660 --> 25:51.660
When we saw the file, I said, for what one?

25:51.660 --> 25:53.660
Would you please show me where it is now?

25:53.660 --> 25:55.660
I think it was Mr. Adams.

25:55.660 --> 25:57.660
Although I have no clear recollection.

25:57.660 --> 26:00.660
You know, Mr. Adams was in the sectarian's land.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.660
It was not in the sectarian's land.

26:02.660 --> 26:04.660
It was either Mr. Adams.

26:04.660 --> 26:13.660
Now, the army people did some coming through the file and they didn't look through it too long and then they said, well, it's not there.

26:13.660 --> 26:14.660
Now, who said that?

26:14.660 --> 26:15.660
I don't recall it.

26:15.660 --> 26:18.660
Either Mr. Adams or one of his people.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.660
Well, why did they say it wasn't there?

26:22.660 --> 26:26.660
At that time, sir, I don't know what they did tell us why it wasn't there.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.660
They said that they must have been in some of the states.

26:28.660 --> 26:30.660
There must be something wrong, but it wasn't there.

26:30.660 --> 26:35.660
They asked me if I was sure that the papers had originally been there. Could not be mistaken.

26:35.660 --> 26:40.660
I saw them that I could not be mistaken.

26:40.660 --> 26:43.660
Our 12th City having arrived, we were standing in each direction.

26:43.660 --> 26:46.660
So, two blocks of traffic.

26:46.660 --> 26:48.660
I have three copies of this.

26:48.660 --> 26:51.660
Somebody's asking what I can give when to eat the wire services on the wall I have.

26:51.660 --> 26:53.660
Well, I don't know.

26:53.660 --> 26:58.660
Your self-served chairman, Mother Now, for the next session of the hearing will be at 2 p.m. this afternoon.
