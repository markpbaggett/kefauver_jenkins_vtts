WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I'm sorry, I'm getting my car in the Senate.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Have some tendency to perform favors.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
And I didn't want them to do with anything of that type of compromise themselves.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
You would just take into the costumes.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Yes or I would.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
You have to take into the costumes with other pilots.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I never had another private scientist.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Well, that's the costumes that you have to take and then instructions you gave

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
are out of the ordinary, new experiences.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Yes or they were.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
You spoke about an advising you that he was down there to study logistics.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
I believe you said.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Yes sir.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
And I also realized the army, you get it up to modern.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Yes.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
You got to act?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes sir.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
When you spoke.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Well first let me ask you.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Do you ever give any instructions to him who has given him any assignment or such duties as that?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
No sir, I had not.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
You know where he got such an assignment?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I have no idea sir.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
You know where they are at in such assignment.

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
No sir, but there were other indications by private sign that he had a purpose of port six other than basic training and which was connected with investigation.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
You elaborate on that and let's see what that is.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I'll slide through sir.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
All right.

01:20.000 --> 01:33.000
On the 4th of January, private sign was sent back to the company from Legmetal Headquarters after it had been directed that he was to perform KP on the following Sunday.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
At that time my unit administrator had him in his office and discussed disciplinary problems with private sign.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
What does it have to do with your problem?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
It was in connection with a past new year sir.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
However, the incident bearing on the question which you asked a previous later on.

01:53.000 --> 02:06.000
Private sign stated to my unit administrator that it would be unwise to put him on KP any more weekend because he would be on pass and would not be present to take such KP assignment.

02:06.000 --> 02:16.000
Furthermore, that rat of violation of your instruction store is approximately a half hour after it was directed that he was to have KP for the following weekend.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
I know but I thought you would be interested in the instruction do not take up these matters with others on the other hand but help you to look at that such thing.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Yes sir, that would be in our incident.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Understand.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Is this a violation of the instruction you had given me?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yes sir.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
All right, I'll see you.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
Private sign said that he was working on reports all the time and submitting them constantly.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
And while I didn't affect the company to any great extent, he would mention me two or three times in his report.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Who was he reporting to?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I don't know sir.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
But he was given you the impression that he was there for other purposes besides getting some basic training.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
And that he was reporting to some higher authority on the conduct of the army there is the base.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
If it would seem there would be that logical connection I had no other previous connections to private sign other than two basic training.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
He did say he had mentioned you first when it took three times and it took four times.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yes sir, he did.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
My brother.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Was he going to mention you then?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I don't know sir.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Oh, I'll go see you.

03:21.000 --> 03:34.000
On the 19th of November when I already had the private sign on the past policy and in private sign and sign out each time you went out, went on past in the early room at a

03:34.000 --> 03:42.000
sign-out book which was in the public office section of the early room, he asked me if that were not a little obvious.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
No obvious.

03:43.000 --> 03:52.000
And I, therefore, in private sign that I just considered obvious that the passes which I discussed with him was the official and communicated to me through channels.

03:52.000 --> 04:01.000
And I saw no reason why he should not use the sign-out book because that was the proper procedure when man was going on past.

04:01.000 --> 04:13.000
On the 19th of November, January, I had occasion to deliver a message to private sign to make a committee telephone call.

04:13.000 --> 04:27.000
At that time, I told private sign that I had been informed that he was transferred to Camp Gordon for basic training and that as far as I could determine for further basic training.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
And that as far as I could determine, he was an ordinary trainee and had no purpose at Fort Dix, other than basic training.

04:37.000 --> 04:49.000
Private sign then informed me that at his next assignment, Camp Gordon, he would no doubt be classified as an observer so that he wouldn't have to be difficult if he had at Fort Dix.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Captain, are you the one that graded him as a soldier?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yes or I am?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
You gave him a good rating and action of rating and I believe it was a soldier.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
I gave private sign as a superior in training.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Yes, I'm a superior in training. He didn't make a good soldier.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
Yes or I felt that he was fired at a frequent passes and committee meetings on post that private sign had applied himself well to the training.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
In fact, during the rain's fire and weak private sign fire, the score of 204, which was especially good for the winter fire.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
Captain, I assume you are related now about all the incidents that occurred. Have you?

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Yes, sir. The emphasis of the type that you mentioned, those are the ones which are in number seven.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
If you evaluate the incidents, would you say that private sign am self self-preferential treatment?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Yes, sir.

05:50.000 --> 06:01.000
The morning when private sign attempted to get moved to an earlier firing order was my mind and the seeking professional treatment on his part.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Did you have the same problem with other private gearing and coach of his training?

06:10.000 --> 06:19.000
There are other instances where private make requests to the company's man or two cashmants which do not come to my attention especially.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, I'm trying to just get the back. There's nothing unusual about this, let's say so.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Well, there was something unusual about it, sir, because I'm going to switch the private sign not to ask any favors of the cashmants.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I have a point I'm making, let's be fair to private sign.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
No, the chairman does not know what the ordinary private might do and the same circumstances.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Who's left state, so is the ordinary, and I think they did have some merit.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
It was a thousand ordinary, sir, because private sign wasn't spoken by me, not to speak such favors from the catcher.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
And the catcher, I told private sign were not to grant him any favor.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
But I did you instruct other private sign.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
As you did, private sign.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
There were not some other problems with other private sign.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Well, why didn't you instruct the other private sign?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Why didn't you give them the same instructions you gave by the sign?

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Because there were not some circumstances connected with our being at court, actually.

07:12.000 --> 07:20.000
A different set of circumstances developed with respect to private sign that necessitated according to your judgment for giving of the instructions you gave.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
And those circumstances did not develop with respect to other private sign.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Also, they did not.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
At the end.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
Before the next senator begins, I sent his men to return to our studio as a prop for the country to permit our statement to identify them.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
This is ABC Television Network.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
The officer is Lieutenant George S. Meithner, sir.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
He has been an other state.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
MEISS, NER.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
He is my counsel. He is from Fort Dick.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
And knows the details of my testimony, sir.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Thank you.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Senator Potter.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Captain Miller.

07:52.000 --> 08:01.000
One of the allegations made in the Fort by Senator McCarthy and Mr. Colton and Mr. Carr.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
The fact that private sign did not receive preferential treatment.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
But in fact, it was in some cases discriminated against because of his former association with his committee.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Now, you were his company commander for BX.

08:19.000 --> 08:30.000
You have stated in answer to Senator McColle's question that private sign was pretty different than some of the other private of your company.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
But you say that private sign was discriminated against because of his, because he was all called private?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
No, sir. I would say not.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
You may possibly prove the fact that I had told him to signal favors from the cadre as such discrimination.

08:46.000 --> 09:00.000
However, since private sign was to have the frequent passes, then it would be necessary for me to make judgment as to when he was to be how his training was being conducted during the day in order to make him available.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
It was necessary for me to handle this personally.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
I didn't want one of my subordinates taking responsibility for a decision of this type.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
But did he, the private sign is going the same relationship with the sergeants and the two leaders as other private?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Yes, sir, he did.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
Captain, as company commander, you were responsible for giving private sign as efficiency ratings.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I correct.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
That's correct.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
And I believe you stated that he received superior or excellent rating.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
He's a superior in training, which is the highest rating that a soldier can receive as that character.

09:35.000 --> 09:45.000
I also understand from testimony that was given yesterday that private sign received a fair rating on his character rating.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Is that correct?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Yes, sir, that is correct.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
For you, it is for the year responsibility to give him that, uh, to give private sign the character rating?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Yes, sir, it was.

10:00.000 --> 10:09.000
Can you give a committee the basis for the fair, which is a, which is not the best rating that a person can receive for characters?

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Can you give the committee your reasons for that rating?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Yes, sir.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I can.

10:15.000 --> 10:25.000
It was my overall judgment of private sign attitude toward me and towards army life and for discipline while he was at Portic.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
And I must say that it was my judgment and I stand by the judgment.

10:30.000 --> 10:42.000
Now I face it upon the various incidents I had with private sign, the attitude private sign created in the company as a result of statements and activities.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And that is my judgment.

10:44.000 --> 10:54.000
Now, on the basis of this, I must go into an incident concerning New Year's Eve.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Good as well.

10:56.000 --> 11:05.000
The policy in the company was to rest the trainees a past on either Christmas or New Year's, but not both.

11:05.000 --> 11:19.000
Sometime prior to the Christmas holiday, I had private sign in my office and inquired of private sign whether or not he would be willing to volunteer to take details during the Christmas holiday,

11:19.000 --> 11:28.000
so that a maximum of soldiers of the Christian faith would take their passes on Christmas and the balance we see their passes on New Year.

11:28.000 --> 11:39.000
Private sign informed me at that time that he expected to be working on both weekends and that I would no doubt hear about these passes through travel as I had always done on previous passes.

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
I reminded private sign that I was authorized to give him a pass on only one of the weekends, but not both.

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
I made out the Christmas and New Year's pass this personally because I felt that it wasn't item which was important to each soldier in the company.

11:57.000 --> 12:10.000
And I placed a soldier on either Christmas or the New Year's weekend on the basis of the details, K.P. and Guard duty, which are rocked and which would accrue to each trainee in the company.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
Private sign, by virtue of the Guard roster, was to for guard on New Year's Eve December 31.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
And therefore I gave private sign pass on Christmas holiday.

12:24.000 --> 12:38.000
About three days before the Christmas holidays, I called each of the batons into a formation and personally informed each trainee what was to be the holiday on which he would receive a pass.

12:38.000 --> 12:48.000
When I had private sign for tunes before me, I called private sign name and stated that he would have a pass on a Christmas holiday.

12:48.000 --> 13:04.000
Upon completing the listing of passes for private sign for tune, I informed them that their position only passed roster once they termed by virtue of the details which they were due to receive either Christmas or New Year's.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
The pass list for Christmas was posted on the Bolton board.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
Private sign name was listed for the Christmas pass. Private sign went on pass for Christmas.

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
The New Year's pass list was posted on the Bolton board likewise during the week preceding the New Year's holiday.

13:22.000 --> 13:31.000
Private sign name was not listed. Private sign name was listed on the Guard roster for 31 December 1953.

13:32.000 --> 13:40.000
About 9 o'clock in the morning on December 31, I was in the orderly room on company business.

13:40.000 --> 13:53.000
And the first margin told me that he had spoken with private sign the evening before and had reminded private sign that he was on tap, on guard duty rather for New Year's Eve.

13:54.000 --> 14:04.000
Private sign told the first margin that he had spoken to me about this matter and that he had expected to be on pass that day.

14:04.000 --> 14:20.000
The first margin reported this to me and I told the first margin that private sign had not spoken to me about this guard duty detail and that I had not authorized the pass and I had not been informed by a higher headquarters that a pass was due for private sign for that day.

14:20.000 --> 14:30.000
I therefore placed a call to Lieutenant Blout, General Ryan Aide, an inspired winner, a pass had been authorized for private sign for the New Year's weekend.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Lieutenant Blout told me that he would inquire of General Ryan and call me back.

14:34.000 --> 14:43.000
He called back and stated that a pass had not been authorized by General Ryan for the New Year's weekend.

14:44.000 --> 14:58.000
I therefore sent to the training area for private sign and since he was not present there, I further inquired and determined that private sign had been sent to the photograph laboratory to have identification photo taken.

14:58.000 --> 15:12.000
I found the name of the Quarko in charge of the detail and determined that private sign had gone to the laboratory, had returned and was sent into the barracks to get changed into a field clothing in order to go back out to the training area.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
The work was justified, he had no contact directly with any part of our committees now.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
He's now recounting events in the private life of David Cheyne. I'm not going to sit here and listen to him.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
Sheriff, wait a minute, sir. I'm going to tell you this, sir. We have much more important work to do.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
We should be investigating Communists. We've got backlog of work. We've got about 100 and 30 of them in different plans at this moment.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm going back to my office and we'll be chair of someone's problem and we'll get through with his drill.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
I'm sorry, he does believe that the testimony about the New Year is passed.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
To be related to whether or not it was secured, it secured at all as the suggestion of the committee staff.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
If the attorney has sent previously, we are not investigating errors or mistakes in act as a seasoned army worker.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
We don't have any investigate for a day.

16:28.000 --> 16:44.000
I think my question was related to the statement made by the senator and Mr. Cole and Mr. Carr that rather than receiving preferential treatment,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
the private time was discriminated against and so many of us.

16:47.000 --> 17:00.000
I was questioned the fact that he received an excellent or superior efficiency rating as to buy received a must-a rating as far as the cleric was concerned.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
The determine whether that was a means of discrimination or not.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
That was a question, no. I think that's why the captain is calling to great detail on it.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I'm not expecting that question, Mr. Potter.

17:16.000 --> 17:24.000
We had a rule originally that before the witness had been called, the arrest of the witness is what he was talking about.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
We obviously had the purpose of determining whether or not the testimony is relevant.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
If this is one witness, we are familiar with the fact that it's too bad that I assume that Mr. Welsh requests the heavy presence.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
He undoubtedly has referenced other witnesses.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
I like Mr. President and I just wish the chairman went away from my time, who was mean to get relevant testimony.

17:45.000 --> 17:55.000
I think the chair does have an obligation to determine whether it's relevant, not the witness should not be wasting the time of all these army officers back here behind him.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
All the censors, he's not going to waste my time with the chairman.

17:59.000 --> 18:09.000
I'll be back and he'll share a belief that the President has reached a very valid point and suggests to send a pilot rather than listening to this long narrative which is getting very long captain.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
You find out whether or not there's something which he invented as a result of the committee request.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
We'll be back for a quick report.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
You're a pilot, what is it?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Very well, sir.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
I would merely like to point out an old fanist from the witness.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Evidently, a Mike is dead.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
I am going to start an old fanist that was witness, I would like to point out that this is the main incident.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
There were other, but this is the main incident on which the character rating was based.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And this is a matter of record service.

18:40.000 --> 18:52.000
Now, the loads of character ratings are a matter of record and when a trainee is given a character rating as low as the one given to follow the child, the company commander.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
The most important thing is why such a rating was given.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
And that's the only reason why Captain Miller is relating the events of that incident.

19:01.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, let's get to the line and testify the considerable length on both the character rating and the superior rating.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
I'll let you make some, you know, let's get to the point.

19:12.000 --> 19:23.000
I feel that I have not utilized a great deal the committee's time and asked what I think is his person to the, to the charges that happened may.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
Now, if Robert Charn has been describing it to me, I think the committee should know that.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
That's the reason I'm asking the question.

19:29.000 --> 19:38.000
Well, I would like to ask if I can have the attention of the committee without any further ado, I would like to have the captain continue and give him a good deal of that.

19:38.000 --> 19:55.000
I would like to ask if Mr. Adams has provided some links on this point of the granting of two passes on the Christmas weekend and the New Year's weekend.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
And that there was also a telegram from Mr. Cohn and some conversation about it.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
I think it's quite material to this case because it's been voted to be taken previously.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
Mr. Chairman, I have to follow this, but on a brief point of order at the relative seat, three points, what Senator Jackson said.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
If captain Miller had any contact whatsoever with me, with Mr. Carl or Senator McCarthy or any member of our state.

20:18.000 --> 20:25.000
And if the captain thinks we ever asked him for any kind of proper, an actual treatment or anything else, we want him to tell the committee about.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
I've been just in the time.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
I didn't mean that.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Yes, well, no, I'm not.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
I'm going to the, to the park where you claimed that whether than to receive my rent or free.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
But that's the private time with the scrimmed that again.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
And I want to find out whether he was the scrimmed that again in this particular case of getting a little character.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
Reading one the same time he has a high efficiency rating as a soldier, which is a little inconsistent.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm not going to look at many.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm sure to take the time to find out whether the car is rating or efficiency rating are too high or too low.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't believe we asked about that. We certainly don't want to make that.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
I'm not sure when I suggest that the court is to mark respect to this witness's testimony.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
The, uh, eliminated and that the witness feel out to tell his story.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
Many other people have been allowed to tell their story and to go ahead with a testimony in this case.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And the father continues to it.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
All right.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Skeptan, I have a virus idea.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I know you're left off.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
But if you can, if you can tie it together as quickly as possible, I would appreciate it.

21:22.000 --> 21:37.000
After speaking to Lieutenant Blouc, uh, on the morning of December 31st, when Lieutenant Blouc informed me that a past was not authorized for private shine, I tried to locate private shine as I previously testified.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I could not locate private shine.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
He was nowhere in the company area where he was supposed to be.

21:45.000 --> 21:52.000
As usual, when someone is not in a place he's supposed to be, I had a search conducted for private shine of all the buildings in the company area.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Well, I could not locate private shine.

21:55.000 --> 22:03.000
I sent someone to the telephone exchange where private shine would be most likely to be if he were not in the company area.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
Private shine was not in the telephone exchange.

22:07.000 --> 22:15.000
I therefore determined that private shine was at least absent without leave from the company area without permission.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
It was then suggested to me by one of the, uh, persons present in the only room that I checked the sign out book.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
I then did so.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
It was 10.45 in the morning.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.000
And private shine had signed out on pass to New York City as of 11.30. That's 20.

22:32.000 --> 22:41.000
Without permission from, without permission from me, without authority having been communicated to me through town, and without my having passed by authority on to private shine.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
When did he return?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I have a shine return on Monday morning.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
What action was taken by you?

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Excuse me, sir, he returned at midnight on Sunday.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
What action was taken by you?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
What action was taken by you?

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
I reported this matter to my superior officer, sir.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
What was done about it?

22:59.000 --> 23:12.000
I reported the incident to regiment headquarters, and the incident was there upon reported to General Ryan through his aide.

23:12.000 --> 23:28.000
And further in the afternoon, about three o'clock, I am told a telephone call was received from Mr. Cohn requesting that private shine be left at home that he was engaged in committee business and would be working throughout the weekend.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
And therefore, private shine did not return to Monday morning.

23:31.000 --> 23:40.000
Was this invalation of the instructions that you would receive before that orders were to come down from the cops, the order for him to be accused for committee business?

23:40.000 --> 23:51.000
Of course, sir, the committee general desired to give private shine authority to be absent for that weekend because a request had been made to him by a member of the committee.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
It obviously made it possible for private shine to be home without my authority.

23:55.000 --> 24:13.000
Well, I understand Captain Miller on a path to the planet through higher authority to private shine.

24:13.000 --> 24:26.000
The Pacific procedures have been worked out wherein you were to be notified of such passes that were not within the normal allotment to the trainees in his company.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Yes, that is correct. Is that correct? That is correct.

24:29.000 --> 24:38.000
In this situation that you're referring to in connection with the question put to you by Senator Potter, do I understand that those procedures were violated?

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
Yes, that they were. We used to say specifically wherein they were violated.

24:44.000 --> 24:52.000
Private shine left without having gotten authority from me. He left the company area without authority.

24:52.000 --> 25:01.000
He signed out at 1130 while he had left sometime prior to 1045.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
How long had it been since you advised him of those procedures?

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
I advised private shine those procedures on the first day he was in the company.

25:09.000 --> 25:23.000
And in my previous testimony I reiterated to private shine before the Christmas holiday that authority for passes on both weekends had to be communicated to me through Channel C-4-5-Cine lost to dust.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Now, in Vandestana when this occurred you reported it to your regimental commander.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Our battalion commander?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Regimental commander? Regimental commander?

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
I know carte marshal proceedings are instituted, initiated or commenced.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
No sir.

25:38.000 --> 25:50.000
You mentioned something about the attitude created in the company in response to a question by Senator Potter.

25:50.000 --> 25:56.000
What attitude did he create in the company?

25:57.000 --> 26:14.000
A day after the Thanksgiving pass I was getting a haircut at the regimental barbershop and the barber before it to me that the private in my company had been discussing private shine frequent passes and the fact that they redundant.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
I thought that was a significant indication of the way the training itself.

26:19.000 --> 26:29.000
At very other times the cadre complained to myself or to the executive officer of the private shine frequent passes.
