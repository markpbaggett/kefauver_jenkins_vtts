00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The colon of the game is a stuff.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Our goal could have been perfect at the same time and that meeting is...

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
There's a whole front, yes sir.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
But you can't explain to this committee now why you made full the staff...

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
...of first the original picture with the three together...

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
...and all the whole one with only two in the picture.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
I've assigned and...

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
...fucked very steep.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
No I can't explain.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
There's a good indeed job.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
ABC radio network and its affiliated stations have been bringing you for the last hour and 25 minutes.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
On the scene coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings, directed from the caucus room...

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
...in the Senate office building in Washington.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
The committee is now expected to recess in a few minutes...

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
...and will resume its hearings this afternoon at 2.30 o'clock Eastern Day...

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
...by time we suggest you stay tuned to your ABC station.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
ABC radio again will be prepared to bring you on the scene coverage of the hearings...

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
...over many of these stations at that time.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
This program came to you from Washington.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
This is ABC radio network.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Introduced in evidence.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
On the other side, the Army side charges that the picture was introduced...

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
...as a picture of the two alone.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
There's a picture which Secretary Stevens specifically requested along...

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
...and because the McCarthy side has said that the Secretary Stevens specifically requested such a picture...

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
...the Army claims that this is a doctor photograph.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Well, it's all a bit confusing that they're trying to get to the bottom of it.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Mr. Giuliana is going to go back on the witness stand.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
I haven't taken you place there yet, but it is expected that Mr. Giuliana will be on the witness stand...

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
...at the opening of the afternoon station unless there has been some change in signal during the noon hour...

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
...and that he will be crossing salmon by Council Joseph Welch.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
The Army Special Council, Joseph Welch, the Iowa-born Boston trial lawyer...

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
...who has developed into one of the personalities in this investigation.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Members of the Subcommittee are all in their seats along the witness table.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Chairman Wont of South Dakota, the acting chairman of the Subcommittee in the center...

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
...at this moment in a puddle with Council Ray Jenkins to his right.

02:57.000 --> 03:08.000
And, I believe that's Senator Senna Cormaclill in the Washington Tower of Arkansas...

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
...I couldn't see him for just a moment in the bright light here.

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
And he's left also Senator Andrew Jackson of Washington.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
Another of the Democratic members of the Subcommittee, all the members seem to be present at the moment.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Carl Mont of the Center, then the Council to the right.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
The Council Ray Jenkins, then Senator Dixon of Illinois, Senator Mottor Mishik and then Senator Worshack...

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
...of Idaho and then to the left to Senator Muntz, where Senator McClellan...

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
...of Arkansas, the ranking Democratic member of the Subcommittee and Senator Stewart...

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
...signing them of Washington and Senator Andrew...

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
...Senator Stewart-Signing and of Missouri and then Senator Andrew Jackson of Washington.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Further down at this end of the committee table...

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
...the Assistant Secretary of Defense to Council...

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
...who has become one of the participants in this investigation...

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
...because of certain charges that Senator McClellan directed against him.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
So far, of course, we've heard no testimony from him...

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
...or as a matter of fact, from any of the real principals in the case...

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
...except the extended questioning caused examination of...

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
...the sector of the RBC1 which went on for six consecutive days...

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
...next to Mr. Ansel is a...

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
...fight-haired gentleman, distinguished looking man...

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
...name Frederick Bryan and Attorney from New York City...

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
...who is Mr. Ansel's personal attorney.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Then down at this end of the table only a few feet from where we are sitting...

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
...or the McClellan Principal, Senator McClellan in the center...

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
...Council Roy Cohn, the Subcommittee Council to his right...

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
...and to his left, Francis Carr, the other principal in the case...

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
...Francis Carr being the Executive Director of the McClellan Subcommittee.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
The Army, of course, charges that Senator McClellan and his eight...

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
...exited them to pressure on...

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
...and the Army to give preferential treatment to David Shine.

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
Now the Senator monthly chairman with his chair.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
The chair would like to announce for the Senate Committee...

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
...and to the credit of the Senate's Laney Club...

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
...that we have a few of you in one of the collateral...

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
...continuations which have a reason in connection with the chair.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
We find one half of it that just...

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
...this room has been reserved some time ago for a...

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
...with annual lunch, the Senate Committee put out in here every year and May...

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
...which is soon to be made for us.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
If you know the committee has been trying to expedite the hearings...

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
...that's impossible, as we...

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
...by announcing the goal decidedly to continue with the hearing...

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
...and I have a lot of here for Mrs. Allen Frer, white Senator Frer, the chairman of the...

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
...Crowman Committee of the Senatewives...

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
...that filled a monthly they had hoped for a month to have...

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
...the lunch in here at an aggregate occasion, white and a president.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
Invited, but this year's contract given a majority of the chairman of the lunch and committee...

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
...and the greater number has expressed the desire to release...

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
...our lives to the coffee fume and cancel the lunch and commit suicide.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
We build up the new committee as a very generous and...

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
...incidually vital request, as we put it to reserve the room...

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
...but we also realize that the business of the Senate...

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
...neccessarily takes fire already over an engagement such as this one.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
On behalf of the committee I desire to express our appreciation...

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
...to the fellow wives and since this is a policy day...

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
...I apologize to the fellow wives on behalf of our commitment.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
I apologize to some of the surveillance of the very...

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
...presentations and the very unsuspective business that we appreciate very much...

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
...for the consideration. Mr. Julianne, I believe you are willing to stand...

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
...and there was someone who expressed the memory of the chair...

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
...as you were without the...

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
...presenter at the firm, but if you're trying to develop...

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
...I think it was...

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
...I think it was, I think it was, I'm not sure.

07:57.000 --> 08:06.000
Mr. James, when I suggested this warning of the...

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
...immediate from the assumption that...

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
...I would have to have a museum following this achievement...

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
...with the staff. He not even heard of what I said to be a human being...

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
...because I was I say to him as senator about the confidence...

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
...if you now join him that request, that Mr. James will speak to us...

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
...that the order is interrupted and that you do belong next.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
The chair must remind again that the council is a committee...

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
...that the control of the hearing is in the hands of the subject...

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
...and that our council will determine the order...

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
...for how size-post-phobosely I have supported this...

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
...that if the senator had his great power to my small voice...

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
...it would be done that way.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I don't know if it's electively and hidden conscious...

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
...if it's determined the decision of the subject committee on that...

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
...I beg your pardon, I merely spoke type of effect.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
This is the right side.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
This is the 50th.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
I may say I have to share one comment before the other one's to have this.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
I desire to say, Mr. Chairman, that I have never given any indication...

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
...please any of the party's interest in as to the order in which the witness is...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
...to speak for all.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Great.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Could I hear it? Have that last two months where I couldn't get it.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
I think I desire to say Mr. Wells that I have given no indication...

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
...through anyone as to the order in which we desire to put on the proof.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
But then we may all have a glass to pass.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
I didn't hear it. I didn't hear it either.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
I have had my stopwatch running for...

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
...two or three minutes, but I guess I'm stuck with it.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Okay, sir.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I'll proceed.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Mr. Julian, I think perhaps it would help us...

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
...in this part of the evening we now got in free sight...

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
...get you all of the answers they took place.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
All of us, they did this to China, and you understand...

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
...it's only New York to get the photograph that has been...

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
...the subject of so much discussion.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
I did not know the exact date it was either...

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
...last Wednesday or Thursday, I believe, of last week.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
That's just a...

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
...and when did the photograph come in the next room?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I received the photograph...

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
...first day of the first day of the year out of our part town of the day.

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
I think it was between 330 and 440, and I was...

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
...when you say I was wrong, I said I was under the impression...

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
...that you're shy and brought them on the very day...

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
...that you received them there.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
No, I think you were right.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
And so you came into the direction of the...

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
...the student photograph on the afternoon of Thursday...

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
...and we could go yesterday at about 3pm yesterday.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
And when did you first talk to anyone about the photograph...

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
...after this game in New York Physicians?

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
I spoke to Mr. Cohn in the office room during the hearings...

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
...by which brings in the hearings of the photograph...

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
...or the picture...

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
...what I assumed to be the photograph for the picture had arrived.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
The photograph?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Is that right?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Well, I didn't know what the photograph was.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
It said the photograph, and you didn't say the photograph.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I will now say the photograph.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Why didn't you hear your testimony?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I sure did.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Well, now I was...

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
OK, and by the way, would you like to change your testimony...

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
...and any respect in which you testify this morning?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't wish to.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Have you read it?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Yes, that has.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
Now, you whisper to me not the photograph that's come...

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
...you are now sure, but both the photograph has come.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Is that right?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I don't have a question, man.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I have a question, man.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
The photo is the best you've been.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
The picture words of the film are quite...

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
Now, you whisper to me not the photograph that's come...

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
...you are now sure, but both the photograph that's come...

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
...and the photograph is...

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
...that's right.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
I think perhaps I better state it again because these questions are unhappily fined...

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
...depend a little on the instructions you give.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
When the picture weeks the court room you turned to Mr. Cohn...

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
...and whispered something to him, didn't you?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I advise Mr. Cohn...

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
...and I'll buy you an award for it, didn't you?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yes, sir.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Well, what if you were buying you an award for that...

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
...the photograph that's come on merely that tape or a photograph?

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
I don't recall the exact words I may have said...

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
...the picture has arrived.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
The picture of a picture has arrived.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
How would you like to choose?

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
I won't choose either one or the other because I cannot swear...

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
...what I told Mr. Cohn...

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
...for you under the impression that Mr. Cohn was expecting...

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
...a picture.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I was under that impression.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Were you under the impression that Mr. Cohn was expecting...

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
...a picture showing Secretary Steven and Cheyne alone?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I did not know.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Now, yes or no, were you under the impression...

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
...Cohn was expecting a picture showing Secretary Steven's...

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
...and try to but Cheyne alone?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I will not answer that yes or no.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Well, come on, I told you I did it to none of their questions.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I don't think that's very unfair.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Did you understand?

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
I'm only asking you what you understood, sir.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I didn't understand.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
And they had the question.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Did you understand?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Mr. Cohn was leaning forward in these seats hoping to see...

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
...a picture of the Secretary and the Secretary...

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
...and the Secretary and the Secretary...

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
...and Cheyne alone?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Mr. Cohn, I was...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
...have you a point of order?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Yes, I was going to suggest a bit better if I'll...

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
...just do well for the assisting money...

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
...yes, and the renters involved the working...

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
...for the committee to know whether or not...

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
...if your manager, yes or no, I'll leave it up to the witness to decide...

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
I don't want to be unfair to the witness.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I thought it was a fair question.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
Would you please, if I'm wrong, come to the right to ask for...

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
...yes or no, that's your decision.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
I'm able to answer your question, no, I presume he has a right to say so.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Right, thank you.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Would you repeat the question please, Mr. Cohn?

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
When you leaned over to tell the glad, good news to Mr. Cohn...

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
...well, you wanted the impression that he was holding me here...

15:43.000 --> 15:51.000
...you had a picture of the Secretary and private shine all over.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
I was not under the impression that this was glad news to Mr. Cohn.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
Glad, good news, glad, good news to Mr. Cohn.

16:02.000 --> 16:09.000
I was under the impression that Mr. Cohn knew...

16:09.000 --> 16:17.000
...and was expecting a picture of Mr. Shine and Secretary Stevens...

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
...to be brought here from New York.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
Which picture Mr. Cohn wished to have placed in evidence?

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
I assumed that that's what the purpose of the picture was.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Without any doctorate.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I assume that too, Mr. Cohn.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
How did you doctorate, family?

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
When you got the bad picture, you now fell in cold water for an hour.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
I adopted the picture, so I quote, doctor, I'm quote.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
I continue not doctor, all right, father.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Would you like that word better, sir?

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Would you repeat the question that I'm pleased with?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Would you rate it, knowing?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
That's what we do, right, sir?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Thank you, right, sir.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
First, all right, father.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Would you like that word better, sir?

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
Would you like better to use the word, all over the doctor?

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm sorry, sir.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
I've linked something preceded the word altered in that question.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Would you rate the question that I had, or one amount, all over it?

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
But you have this word, doctor, didn't you, sir?

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
What do I repeat, right, sir?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
First of all, how did you doctorate this?

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
When you got the bad picture, you now fell in cold water for an hour.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
I have to say, doctor, I quote.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
How did that doctorate, first of all, I have to say, doctor?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Would you like that word better to use?

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
How do you understand the question, sir?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
If you don't, I have to make it clear.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Would you make it clear?

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
My question to you is, why are you either doctor or author in picture?

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
We had a recommendation, but you understood, was the very picture,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
column wished to put it evident.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
I was under the impression as I have previously testified to here,

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
and I was under the instructions we can call them by Mr. Coles

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
and or Mr. Jenkins, that I was to know up this picture

18:52.000 --> 19:01.000
and to make available to Mr. Jenkins a picture of Mr. Shine and Secretary Stevens.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Although the word alone was never mentioned to me.

19:06.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, I am part of my fellow Coles Harlow to know why you just did make the forest bath

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
of the picture that was delivered to you that afternoon and handed over to Mr. Jenkins.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
When you came out, I found you didn't do that.

19:26.000 --> 19:35.000
I just mentioned or just stated that I was under instructions to furnish a picture of only the two individuals.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Well, then you already have no time to inspire.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Stand in my back.

19:45.000 --> 19:55.000
This is one of two questions that Tim, Mr. Wells has been using the word all her or doctor.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
Very delivered, very carefully, from the next son's home.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
I want you to ask you to look at the picture that Mr. Wells presented.

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
Until I was further in the new opinion that's the same picture from which the Enlightenment was made.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
That is for some of my Mr. Wells in case you want to hear Mr. and Janina,

20:20.000 --> 20:33.000
let the assurance to the Committee of that was the original from which the Enlightenment was signed as a Stevens of May.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I'll take a look at the picture.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
The party of the Enlightenment, please take this here.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
Mr. Chairman, come with us for the sake of keeping the record active.

20:49.000 --> 20:57.000
Should we measure the exhibit one, the picture from Dave Shire and Wallace too,

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
and we picture presented by Mr. Wells as number three.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
See, all of the numbers come like everything.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
How are they numbered just now or no?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
This is number three, sir.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
The ones from the three was number three, sir.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
And what number is the one in the distance ever?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Number one.

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
Number one, what number is the one produced by Mr. Wells?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Number two, sir.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Number two.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
But let's call it loss number two, right?

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
And number one is signed.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
And number three is the perfect of it.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
Now, what you will tell me, Mr. Wells,

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
do you remember using Mr. Wells's

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
definition of dot string, which apparently means,

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
like you call a new set of problems in scrubbing,

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
is there dot string, assuming the picture number,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
string is the same as number one,

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
what is there dot string of Wells's picture also?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Otherwise, it's not like that.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Yes, I was myself.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Otherwise, there's clips from left,

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
and left hand from right.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
At least, then a little more than a half a minute.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
And all that things are clips of the picture.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
That's right.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Yes, sir.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
So, if you want to call a new set of problems,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
if you want to call a new set of problems,

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
if you want to call a new set of problems,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
if you want to call a new set of problems,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
I would say so.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
And it's the, the five of these faces are concerned

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
on what the world's picture,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
the shown picture in existence.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
The five of these faces, the posture,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
the shown students, they appear to be on

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
more identical in all three, right?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
They appear so, yes, sir.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Otherwise, just for the light, it is clearly not,

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
but nearly nearly not just on the part.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
No, sir.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
So, if you think the picture is, uh,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
even from shine,

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
forget about the removal of the man

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
with the move from left picture,

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
the removal of the man with the move from the shine picture,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
there's no doctrine of any kind,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
is that correct?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Yes, sir.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
The expression of both seasons and shine

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
is the same in all three pictures, that's correct.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I would say so.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Where the same plane in the back room?

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
It appears to be, yes, sir.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Standing number of drops up

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
for their standing mix each other, of course.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Yes.

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
Now, uh, Mr. Jumila,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
is it correct that you were

24:26.000 --> 24:33.000
asked to get the picture of seasons and shine

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
in light?

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
That request was made either by Mr. Coulomb

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
or Mr. Jankham.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And that, at that time,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
you didn't know about the port of man

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
on the picture, who's in the world's picture.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
I said, I had never seen the picture before.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
I would have never seen the world's picture.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I hadn't seen that.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I had never seen any of these pictures.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
So, someone there in the army

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
never told me, uh,

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
or this is the year for a lot for some place,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
because the port of man was,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
but I, I would assume so.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I guess.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
And, uh, you say that, uh,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
you have the responsibility

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
for cutting off the third man.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I so testify now.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Now, Mr. Jumila,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
before you came to the committee,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
how many years did you work in the FBI?

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
A fraction of the weight, six in the head, sir.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
And, uh, at one time,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Mr. Frank Carr,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
the chief counsel of the committee,

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
you lived a period, he was that.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
In other words, he worked in the coming of the subversives

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
who are in the U.S.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
of that director.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yes, sir.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And, uh,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
you helped develop the evidence

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
that resulted in the conviction of the...

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
you have them so-called second string cousins.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Or, I'm, make sure I take this a little, is that?

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
The 11 first string communist,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
and that second string is that weight of the mound, the 21.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Not all the way to you worked on the...

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
the first string, am the second string, yes, sir.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
Um, I'm going to ask your question, ma'am.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
You may not be the land-signature of the UN,

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
because of the rules and regulations of the FBI.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
What do you report?

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Have you been engaged in over the past year,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
and a few years?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
It's like that, President.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Uh, for the year and a half or two years,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
or you came with a commission,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
what kind of work are you doing

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
for the federal Bureau of investigation?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
The last day of your period of my holiday,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
you were in a regulation.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Insofar as secretaries,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
you're seeing human.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
Of course, we are a few who answer that question.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
Well, I think I can answer by stating that I was on a confidential assignment,

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
involving the internal security of this country.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Look, can you go this far to the rally?

27:14.000 --> 27:20.000
Your instructions to say that you are made highly confidential assignments,

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
having to do with communism or espionage in the United States?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Yes, sir.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
No further questions, Mr. Chairman?

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
ABC Radio is bringing you on the scene coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings in Washington.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
This is ABC Radio Network.

27:46.000 --> 27:59.000
You are tuned to New York City's own station, WNYC.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Now, back to the McCarthy Army hearings,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
where Senator Monti acting,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Chairman is questioning Jim Giuliano,

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
member of the McCarthy staff.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
To eliminate the colonel,

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
however, I was acting on instructions that I had received from,

28:34.000 --> 28:41.000
as I have stated, Mr. Cone and, or Mr. Jacket.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
Yes, but as you can see,

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
these are Mr. Cone and Mr. Cone and Mr. Cone.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
I believe asking to eliminate anything from the picture.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
They are asking to reproduce a blown-up colonel staff.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
If you have one, our secretary seems to not try the time.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Yes, sir.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
And it would, your instructions,

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
relate to the colonel staff,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
or the staff yield that is such a word,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and the police guidance,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
uh, relate to the police that,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
not regard it,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
but result of Mr. Cone,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
who has been deleted.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Yes, sir.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
I took that responsibility yourself.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Now, the question, I think,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
which is the current monitor

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
to the committee and the country,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
why you did that?

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Was that done with the intent

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
to deceive the rejecters?

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
That was done with no intent to deceive anyone.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Well, no more is it done

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
with any intent to trick anyone?

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
It was done because I had instructions

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
to Bernie Smith's Mr. Jenkins

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
with a picture of Senator,

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm sorry, Secretary Steven and Mr. Cone.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
So that you are pressifying that it was your impression?

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
That the security was primarily interested in the licenses

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
of Secretary Steven and private charge.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Yes, sir.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Now, you quite sure in checking your conscience and your mind

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
that there was no attempt to deceive

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
or be fraud,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
anybody by what you had done?

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
I know of no such intent.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
So, you quite sure that none of your associates

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
have suggested to you

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
that perhaps it might be a good trick

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
to eliminate,

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
from that no one ever suggested,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
and why are you sure that a meh's deletion

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
was made on your own responsibility,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
and latering under whatever impression

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
you had, I am quite sure, yes, sir.

30:59.000 --> 31:05.000
What was your purpose of having the additional three-fold steps made?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
You had two majorizing,

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
which the colonel,

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
out of the picture,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
and two of them made to a colonel,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
in the picture,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
was that,

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
who hasn't available

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
if the committee wanted them

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
and somebody instructed you

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
to do that,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
what was the purpose of that?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Senator, I had no instructions

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
as to the number of copies to be made.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
is, or I instructed Mr. Cereen

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
to have two and two maids.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Why, at this point, I can't say definitely,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
but I would,

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
I would,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
go a little further and say,

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
it was most likely,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
because,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
in the past,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
I've always had,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
an additional copy made

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
of almost every document I ever had

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
for the status,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
which goes in 2000,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
the copies for the S.C.I,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
when I was so employed.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Also,

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
I thought,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
in my own mind,

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
it would be good

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
to have an extra copy available.
