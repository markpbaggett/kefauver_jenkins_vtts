WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Do it.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
You may proceed.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Now to conclude this, Mr. Masterson, after this.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Mr. Shine M. Smith,

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
quote, in the testimony of page 1119,

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
we have better send this right up,

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
because Mr. Jenkins is anxious to have it,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
and so we have better not open it.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
If that got said in that room,

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
where you present when it was said,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I don't recall, uh, just saying that.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
He may have said that.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
And if those words were spoken,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
where they spoken in your presence,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
they may have been, I don't, uh...

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And then his last sentence was,

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
and I remember Mr. Masters taking the picture.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
You remember that you took the picture?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
No, I never had one.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Except, uh, let me ask this.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I said before, I took the picture.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
So subsequently brought it up here.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
I gave it to Mr. Julianne.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
You can do this to us.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Uh, is that any further questions?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Here, I'm sorry sir.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Any further questions?

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Uh, no further questions.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Mr. H.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Mr. Masters, I want to clear,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
if one matter here is possible,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
and tell me if I'm correct,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
where the committee's trying to claim the fact

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
you understand that, yes sir?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
If the villains, and if that you may,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
try to be shy in the airplane, yes sir?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
At the airport, yes sir.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
That feeling he'd together,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
with no one else present,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
then went to Room O-1 with a package

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
which you understood contained in photograph.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Uh, sir.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
My aunt was with me.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
And, uh, who was with me?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
My aunt.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
What did you say?

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
We called in, and we called any mountain sealer.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Go ahead, I'll go back there.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
And, uh, by she was driving her car.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, I'm not interested in that,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
and that did she go to Room O-1 with you?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
She, she left this office,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
this is Senate Office building.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And, uh, uh,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
and Dr. Shiner and I, uh,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
went together to Room 101.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Will this put a photograph?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Did you understand it, yes sir?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And into a private room?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes sir.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yes sir.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Now we're trying to find out,

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
and it's obvious, and I'm sure you understand it, Mr. Nastus.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Who next came in the possession of that photograph?

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Sir, if I know or I would tell you I don't know,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
what time of day or night was it when you and that Mr. Shiner

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
went to Room 101,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
before we came immediately from the airport?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
But I don't know what time it was.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
We came, uh, about three or more.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Three in the afternoon.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Three in the afternoon, during working hours.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yes sir.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Mr. Shiner.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Then we extend the midnight.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yes sir.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Mr. Shiner.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Could you have the final warning?

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Uh, I'm not going to suggest in the room that we have the witness here,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
who handled the photograph,

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
who handled the removal of the colonel from the photograph,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
what had blown up.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I would suggest you put him on the stand if we want the fact.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
We all know that all this young man did

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
is pick up Shiner the airport and bring him back.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
And we've got him here.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, that's the end of the picture.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
We have a final warning here.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Mr. Shiner, the board is ready to be served with his same language.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
He just told the room to be served with Mr. Welp.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Mr. Sherman, the committee and the council have been determined

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
the order is requesting him the order is there.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Mr. Sherman, I am trying to cut this down.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
I want to tell you now that we have a witness who will testify

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
that he has a picture with these three people on it.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
The one who's substantially the same as Mr. Welp presented,

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
that he took that picture and he will explain how

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
when, where, why, the third man was cut off.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I would suggest if he were put on the stand,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
we may save an awful lot of time.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
The planning is very shocking,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I have a question if he would ask,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
if you know my address today,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
we could be moving much faster.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
We have no address today,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
and that information is all done

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
to the Mr. Munster,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
to minute the customer picture came up.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So we have no address today.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I want to leave that one in the water.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
If I may, I have a question to witness who's here with English,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I would suspect any information having been given to anybody.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Having been given to anybody,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
and I might, well, I could not be very hungry,

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
we said in my cards,

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
it's in some way that all members of the committee

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
will know what information has been given.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
It's going to be criticism of us examining the witness

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
as I understand it,

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
or a preference on this committee,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
and to examine the witnesses to try to get the truth.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
You're ever seen in St. Petersburg,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Mr. Masters,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
do you, can you give us an answer yes or no?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
As to whether or not you left,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
room 101 that is Mr. Conley's cards

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
of his first,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I did Mr. Shindley there for sure.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
I honestly cannot remember which one of us left for it.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
So now, Mr. Masters,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
here is the testimony given by Private Shind.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
And I'm not indicating that it's disturbed to me,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
I want for the explanation you can give of it.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Before asking you that question,

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
as I understand it, you have told us that subsequent life, too.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
You brought a photograph

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
from the staff office

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
to Mr. Duneana carrying this room,

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
obviously to deliver to me by Presolo,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
what's the number two?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Now, when was that?

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, sir, I guess it was trying to make it easier for you.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
When was it with reference to the time

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
that you and Mr. Shind went to Room 101

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
at 3 p.m. with that original package?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Was after that?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I know it was after that.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
But I knew it was at 3 p.m.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
At first, I thought,

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
I couldn't remember when your staff was interviewed on the ice.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I thought that it was a day or two later.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I couldn't quite remember.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
But from what was said,

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
it appears that it must have been the same day.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You say it was the same day.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
It's carrying and hearing.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
That is, it would have been such with the three-pog and the afternoon.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Oh, yes, sir.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
And you think it was that same attitude

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
that you brought this picture up here

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
delivered to Mr. Duneana?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Sir, at first, I thought it was a day or two later.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I can't remember.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
What do you think an armistro, that's all?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, from what has been said,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
apparently it was the same day.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
That's the same day.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So that,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
if the original photograph

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
that Mr. Shine took to Room 101

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
at 3 p.m. afternoon

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
was a photograph of three persons.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
And if that photograph was brought to this room

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
that same day by you and delivered to Mr. Duneana,

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
it was either important or you photograph of three persons

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
or that same day, sometimes,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
between three o'clock and the time

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
this committee adjourned in series.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
The photograph of one individual

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
has been cut from it,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
you such a fact did occur.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Now is that correct, sir?

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
And in the meantime,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
the picture that's been blown up

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
are in line.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Is that correct, sir?

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
All in the course of

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
the time intervening between three o'clock and the afternoon

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
and the time of adjournment of this committee.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Yes, sir.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
If it wasn't the same day, I still can't remember the exact...

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Apparently it was the same day.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I can't remember the exact...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And I think that your Mr. President

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
was under the notice after talking

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
with the June interview

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
of all of the various members of the staffs.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I...

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
That's my solution.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
You know how long it takes to...

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
...just promise.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
The picture of an individual has had its blow left.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
The last year in British, I don't know anything about that.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I don't see this, sir.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I've never had anything.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I don't recall anything that is wrong.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, now, let me ask you this, Mr. Nantes.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm meeting from my five-inch-line testimony page 1119.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I've been shy, yes, sir.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
And therefore, I do remember giving him the photograph

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
because he came with me to the office.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
He was afraid you wouldn't.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
And as a matter of fact, one of the staff came in and said,

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
let me see the picture of you, Secretary Steven.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Now, that for your information is the testimony of Mr. Shang.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Did you recall, remember, the staff coming in and saying,

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
in effect, let me see the picture of you, Mr. Steve.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Well, no.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It's...

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
That was Mr. Steve Recalli.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Not specifically, maybe.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, not specifically, but maybe got some recollection.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
I didn't get your answer.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I don't remember.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
You don't remember one way or the other.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
No.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Leaving further from Mr. Faye's testimony.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Mr. Shang's testimony.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
And I say that he was...

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
...and Mr. Shang's testimony.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
And I say that he was...

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
...they could Shang say it.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
We had better send this right up because Mr. Jason's life is to have it.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
So we had better not open it.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
And I remember Mr. and Matt just taking the picture.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Oh, I never took it.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I never took it.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Immediately after he had put it on the desk there,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I didn't take it.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Subsequently, when I came back, I was told when I was told to bring it up here.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Then I took it.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Where's that out of sequence?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Do you mean, maybe, hours?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I don't know.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
May have been...

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
...to see it first.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I thought it was a couple of days later or a day later.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
There is a now.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Well, from your...

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
...your first interview, apparently, was the same thing.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
And it must have been a few hours later and an hour later, I don't remember.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Well, Mr. and Matt just...

12:22.000 --> 12:31.000
...if Mr. Shang is correct.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
I'm not sure this is a proper question of it.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Is that a good stuff?

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
I won't try to take the time.

12:41.000 --> 13:03.000
But if Mr. Shang is correct, then that picture was sent almost immediately to me by you as the ever say,

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
I should have been taken into the private office to risk on this cost.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Mr. Chairman.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Mr. Chairman.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Mr. Chairman.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Mr. McCarty.

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
The point is that the border here, some of the sunbursts have been asking me,

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
by the fact that we haven't given all the information about this picture,

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
which is how I would like to, as a courtesy, to have counsel put in the record of this time,

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
the fact that the minute the question of the three pictures came up,

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
Mr. Wilson, that it wouldn't come up, Mr. Shang, the wall, the one that was putting everything.

13:47.000 --> 13:57.000
The minute that came up, that the staff has given all of the information.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And I've had it ever since.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
There is no answer to that, because I gather from the questions asked me by some reason,

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
as I feel that this information has been freely given, I think, in fairness to me and my staff,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
that should be made clear.

14:12.000 --> 14:22.000
I desire to make it clear that no member of Senator McCarty's committee has done anything except cooperate fully,

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
and that they have assured me that they will finish the witnesses to develop all the facts

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
with respect to this photograph.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
As a staff, I mean Senator McCarty's staff.

14:35.000 --> 14:51.000
Now, frankly, Mr. Chairman, I don't think that I should proceed further with trying to develop the facts with respect to this.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
Until Mr. Shang is asked one or two additional questions,

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
I can put on Mr. G. Lee Annis.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I think perhaps Mr. Shang has returned to the room.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I'd like to have Mr. Shang for one or two questions.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Before Mr. G. Lee Annis put on.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
If he has not returned, Mr. Chairman, I'm sure that I will be able to contact him.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I told him on the screen this noon.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Where is it now? I frankly don't know.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I don't know.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I don't know.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
Who is this all I can't ask, Mr. and I still said that no one else cares to know what a call Mr. Lee Annis.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
If I'm in front of him, if Shang is on the way from point one, I will.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Any objections to calling Mr. G. Lee Annis and dismissing his witness?

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
Chairman, I'm removed from that course of procedure before.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Mr. G. Lee Annis, if you may step down, Mr. Lee Annis, come to the stand.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
Yes, sir. It's work. Text money about the gifts you've given us.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
Ten seconds for station identification.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
This is W.A.V.C. New York, AM and FM, 770 on your dial.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Now we return you to the McCarthy Army hearing.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
I'll back to the McCarthy Army hearing where Jim Juliana of the McCarthy staff is on the witness staff.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
Point this inquiry is directed to you not, sir.

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
In order to save time and expedite this matter, such a thing is possible.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
I won't you, Mr. Juliana, soon now.

16:46.000 --> 16:58.000
Tell this committee in a chronological way, all you know about a photograph

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
that was delivered to him 101 by private shine and Mr. Annis.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Being a photograph, I think it is completed.

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
Austin, Secretary Stevens, Mr. Shine and her and Mr. Turner Bradley.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
And please do it chronologically.

17:22.000 --> 17:29.000
Mr. Jenkins, the first time I ever heard of a photograph.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
And for the purposes of identification, I hand you the photograph to which reference has been made.

17:36.000 --> 18:03.000
The first time I ever heard reference to a photograph of Secretary Stevens and by the shine was one evening last week in the office of Mr. Carr.

18:03.000 --> 18:20.000
When you were discussing with Mr. Cohn, the McCarthy Cohn car side of the controversy, I was in and out of the room at the time.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
And the question of a photograph came up.

18:27.000 --> 18:37.000
I recall that you asked Mr. Cohn if the photograph was available or it could be made available.

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
And I believe the answer that it could.

18:43.000 --> 18:59.000
Sometimes during that meeting, I was given to believe that the photograph would be brought down from New York by someone.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I don't know who.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
An interruption will not disturb you, will it be?

19:05.000 --> 19:27.000
Without telling what was said, I will ask you whether or not at the time of my conference with Mr. Cohn in the preparation of the staff side of this controversy, I was told and please do not tell me what I was told.

19:28.000 --> 19:36.000
I was told who requested the taking of that photograph.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Without I believe you were, sir.

19:39.000 --> 19:46.000
And was it them that I asked whether or not the photograph was in existence and could be produced?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yes, sir.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
How you may proceed.

19:50.000 --> 20:16.000
I believe at that time, Mr. Cohn said to me that the picture would be brought to Washington and that when it arrived, I should take care of it.

20:16.000 --> 20:28.000
The next time I heard about the picture was the afternoon of the first day's hearing, which I believe were last Thursday.

20:28.000 --> 20:44.000
When a package was delivered to me in this caucus room by Mr. Anastas, I did not know what was in the package except that there was a picture.

20:44.000 --> 20:55.000
The package from feeling it, you could tell that it was a frame and a rather large frame and it was heavily wrapped in brown paper.

20:55.000 --> 21:08.000
I did not tell the other guy, Paki, when I went down to 101, physically carried the picture to 101 for the first time there I saw this picture.

21:08.000 --> 21:15.000
Being a picture of the Secretary of the Federalist, but that is the time that we have been brought.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It has been made this program.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
Very well.

21:23.000 --> 21:31.000
I unwrap the picture and I immediately tell all the Mr. Donserry and the Secretary.

21:31.000 --> 21:37.000
Donserry and I just got in line with the picture.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I must go back just a second.

21:39.000 --> 21:48.000
When the picture arrived in the caucus room, I immediately said to Mr. Cohn that the picture was in line with the mayor.

21:49.000 --> 21:59.000
I go back to the two, handle it most expeditiously and as cheaply as possible, we would have photos that made rather than photos that way.

21:59.000 --> 22:12.000
The Secretary's statement was to be delivered to you as Donserry if he would handle the photos that he would have.

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
I said that Donserry should have and for the family of Secretary Steven and Mr. Shion.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
Some new and more necessary co-mitter than expected.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
That you wanted a picture of Secretary Steven Donserry.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
I'll wrap you down.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Did I say anything about cutting it?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Mr. Cohn did not say anything.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I understand, Bush.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
In fact, it was too narrow and I did turn with Donserry's.

22:50.000 --> 23:04.000
The following morning, the of the enlarge for the spats of the security with check it, and with Cedar, I got it right away.

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
Sometimes at 10 o'clock in the morning because I know I was rushing to get it to you before the hearing.

23:13.000 --> 23:26.000
I received several enlarged photos stats of this picture, plus being a picture of the three persons.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
I haven't seen it.

23:29.000 --> 23:44.000
I received, I believe, two enlarged photos stats of this and two photos stats like this to identify what you mean by this.

23:44.000 --> 23:54.000
Mr. Giuliani, you first file a picture of the picture of Secretary Steven and Mr. Shion.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Well, I'm staying.

23:58.000 --> 24:11.000
Upon receiving, upon receiving, I believe there were two photos stats of each picture and one large negative of this picture only.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
When you say this picture only, Mr. Giuliani, we request you to identify.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
The picture of Secretary Steven's, Mr. Shion and a panel.

24:23.000 --> 24:40.000
Upon receiving those, I immediately proceeded to mount the picture of Secretary Steven and Prada Shion on a piece of white cardboard.

24:41.000 --> 24:52.000
The other pictures I've put in a filing cabinet where they have been more or less on a more custody until I get a gun of Shion.

24:52.000 --> 24:59.000
Because I was meant to believe that that was what you wanted in the hearing.

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
I did not know why you wanted them, this picture in the hearing.

25:06.000 --> 25:34.000
I mounted it, I put the caption at the top, the wire AFC dash 460 November 17 1953, and I was 11, 19 1953, and I physically wrapped it in a newspaper and brought it to your office approximately 1028 of Friday morning.

25:35.000 --> 25:46.000
You told me at that time that you did not think that we were going to be a gratification of Secretary Steven.

25:46.000 --> 25:54.000
You told me to keep it in my custody that you would hold me responsible for the picture.

25:54.000 --> 26:05.000
Therefore, I returned to room 101, and I placed the picture in a large filing cabinet with a combination lock on it.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.000
It was not locked, I do not know the combination.

26:12.000 --> 26:26.000
I did not touch the picture again until the morning that you requested this to be brought to the hearing room, which I believe was Monday morning from that mistake.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
At that time, I took the picture out of the filing cabinet.

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
I gave it to Mrs. Mims, and I instructed her to bring it to your office immediately.

26:38.000 --> 26:47.000
It was still wrapped. I do not know if she saw what was in it or not, but was in the wrapping.

26:47.000 --> 26:55.000
You received the photograph in large photograph of Secretary Steven and Mr. Shaw.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Mr. Giuliana, I think you have made it very clear.

26:58.000 --> 27:08.000
I joined you in that which Mr. Giuliana, this question.

27:08.000 --> 27:19.000
At whose direction was Colonel Bradley cut from the picture?

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
To my knowledge, Colonel Bradley was never cut from the picture.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
All right. Have it anyway now.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
You know what we mean, do you not Mr. Giuliana?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I know what you mean. He was left off of the picture.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
All right, left off at whose direction?

27:34.000 --> 27:42.000
At whose direction was Colonel Bradley left off of the picture that was introduced here by me?

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
Earlier this week.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
As I previously testified, it was my understanding.

27:51.000 --> 28:02.000
After talking with you and Mr. Cohn about this picture, that you wanted a picture of Secretary Steven and Private Shaw.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
I gave those instructions to Mr. Serene.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
I don't know what you think as I previously testified.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
Then you gave the directions to Mr. Dom Serene.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
What was your expression to leave off?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
No sir.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
I was just wondering what you were going to do with Mr. Serene.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
I was just wondering what you were going to do with Mr. Serene.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
I was just wondering what you were going to do with Mr. Serene.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
What was your expression to leave off?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
No sir.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
No sir.

28:43.000 --> 28:55.000
My instructions were to have photos that blown up photos that of the picture of the three individuals made.

28:55.000 --> 29:03.000
And also to have photos that of the two individuals made, namely, Secretary Steven and Private Shaw.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
Mr. Julianna, did that not mean to your mind?

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
Did you not intend to convey them to Mr. Serene?

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
You're intention or you wish or you desire.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
That Mr. Colonel Bradley be left off of the picture.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Yes sir.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
I never knew Colonel Bradley was on this picture until I opened it down in the middle of the world.

29:25.000 --> 29:32.000
And you were present when I was told that there was an existing picture of the Secretary.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
The Secretary of the Army and David Chine, you say?

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Yes sir.

29:38.000 --> 29:46.000
And you were present when I was told that whose instance the picture was made, and please don't tell what was said.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Yes sir.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
But you were present?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Yes sir.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
And I was in asked for that picture.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Yes sir.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
I have no further questions.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Damn it.

29:59.000 --> 30:20.000
Does the Chairman understand that there are available in large photo steps, not only the one which you have before you of Secretary Steven's and Mr. Chine?

30:20.000 --> 30:27.000
I have a chine, but also photo steps which were made at the same time showing everybody on the picture.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yes sir.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
Do we have those in the country or here available?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
That is the same one.

30:39.000 --> 30:56.000
And we are here to be three, one rather than two, about as well as all of us as the other of the three people.

30:56.000 --> 31:19.000
Who is a specific decision was it, Mr. Juliano, to bring to the committee room in the newspaper in evidence to which the enlarged photo step of Mr. Juliano when you carried Secretary Steven's and Mr. Chine?

31:20.000 --> 31:27.000
The latest gentleman, we are sorry, time does not permit us at this time to continue with the Army McCarthy hearings.

31:27.000 --> 31:36.000
However, for your information we will appear in the hearing that this was taken and he considered that information important.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
No sir.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Why did you consider it important?

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
Because the photo steps are...
