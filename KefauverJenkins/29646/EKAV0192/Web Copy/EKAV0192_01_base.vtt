00:00.000 --> 00:09.660
He did not serve that kind of police due to the administrative difficulties on the company

00:09.660 --> 00:13.660
of the next day.

00:13.660 --> 00:17.660
The General Police is keeping his hands open.

00:17.660 --> 00:20.660
He is looking for his phone.

00:20.660 --> 00:24.660
On the next day, January 11, I'll ask you

00:24.660 --> 00:34.660
to see if you can find anything you need to call for Mr. Colme.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.660
Lieutenant Blombs received the call from Mr. Colme

00:37.660 --> 00:39.660
on the afternoon of the night.

00:39.660 --> 00:43.660
That was Saturday and he told me about it on the 11th.

00:43.660 --> 00:48.660
And that afternoon, Mr. Colme was very much upset.

00:48.660 --> 00:54.660
He was very excited and he was disturbed and disappointed.

00:54.660 --> 01:00.660
And he said, my aid reported to me that he said there were some people at Fort Dix

01:00.660 --> 01:02.660
who were very cooperative.

01:02.660 --> 01:06.660
But Colonel Ringler and Lieutenant Miller had been doing everything they could to

01:06.660 --> 01:09.660
make it difficult for Private Sean.

01:09.660 --> 01:13.660
And that he was not going to forget their names.

01:13.660 --> 01:16.660
That's a statement from Lieutenant Blombs.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.660
Please be seated.

01:18.660 --> 01:25.660
Lieutenant Blombs reported that to me on the 1-day day 11.

01:31.660 --> 01:33.660
Mr. Colme, please be seated.

01:33.660 --> 01:38.660
Lieutenant Blombs reported that to me that he will not be able to conclude his questions in the next few minutes.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.660
So, the sheriff likes to make two requests of Mr. Welch

01:41.660 --> 01:45.660
and then suggest to meet those since the time it comes tomorrow.

01:45.660 --> 01:47.660
First request of Mr. Welch.

01:47.660 --> 01:51.660
So, you try to have delivery to my office by hand to my morning in Fort Dix.

01:51.660 --> 01:54.660
I will invite him, I'll enter on the telephone, so I will.

01:54.660 --> 01:59.660
And secondly, will you convey to Mr. Stevens the request of the committee

01:59.660 --> 02:03.660
that he is advised off when he is ready to come in to testify

02:03.660 --> 02:10.660
as if one person already agreed to provide so that we can try to get that one bit of testimony out of the way.

02:10.660 --> 02:12.660
Thank you.

02:12.660 --> 02:17.660
I think you will find that that has been dealt with with Mr. Jason.

02:17.660 --> 02:18.660
Okay, yeah.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.660
We test the gunner file.

02:20.660 --> 02:31.660
We have Dr. Jammin Munn announced that the next session of the hearing will be at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning.
