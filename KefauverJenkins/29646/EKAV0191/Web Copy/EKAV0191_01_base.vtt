WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The pair is very moving.

00:04.000 --> 00:13.000
And I think right now, the deal with the answers was violent, the executive order.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
He is not really the mother-in-law, but the executive order is proper.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Whether we took the wrong by it, he's merely really the mother-in-law.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
So he's part of the team, so he's going to be a quick support.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Correct.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
The statement is called.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
The other reason is that I cannot answer that, whether or not the January 21st matter,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
which is the hardest and most frustrating with the discussion.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
I cannot answer.

00:38.000 --> 00:49.000
I'd like to have the privilege of this, I don't know.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
This is not a privilege.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
This is an order from the chief executive executive of this country.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I know what this term a tweeted lightly.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I know what this term a tweeted lightly.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
That's what Senator M. Dirtism said.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Senator M. Dirtism has been avert the privilege.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
He is not avert in anything he told me.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
He is not avert the privilege.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Next, Senator M. Dirtism, I'm sure you're right at this.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
If he went to the surprise and he cannot answer the question,

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
it would be horrible.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I accept that.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm going to ask big questions.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm going to answer, sir, to allow the witness to assert his privilege.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
He is more answered.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
He is the only person who can do this.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
That's an elementary rule of law.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I think that if privilege to challenge a cross-missed order,

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
he must assert himself.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Mr. President, we have to answer this question.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Next, you discuss the question January 21st.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
We could annually introduce for after-class meetings.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
And discuss the subject of the death-after-meeting runway.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
The hearing, the testimony was conducted.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
The charges that were being made about the maintenance

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
of the columns to serve with help.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Any other subject?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
We wanted to do that.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
We agree to that.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Yes, I agree to that.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I agree to that.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Sorry, we'll leave the question.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Mr. Aron, what do you have to do with this question?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Did you have to function for a point where you take the time

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
to get the good work towards that meeting?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm just going to talk to the public about the death-after-meeting.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Maybe the hearing testimony was conducted.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
The charges that were being made for a property made against the firm

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
with the firm itself.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Or any other subject related to the issue that is.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
So if you find out an hour from and then come back to the end,

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
that's what it's not.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
That's what we can't write for.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Thank you.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
That concludes the question.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Mr. Aron, I hope that you think you can go.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Mr. Aron, you told us you should go to file

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
on the trial of the New Pigeon's about that.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Isn't that right?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yes.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And you know Mr. Aron talked to the new state of the man who was

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
the foot of my leg just think we are nothing to say to him

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
or thought we were committed.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
That's right.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Well, I don't think I had that impression.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I wouldn't say it was a disease.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I considered it a disease.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It caused us to my admirer.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Well, you might have admired him.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Others might have other views about him.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
That's not the issue here.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
So this purpose I'm asking whether we can agree

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
that he's quite possible to send them across.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Well, you have to go out that way to use air.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
If you want to go out that concludes the question.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Now, let's head to the high.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Mr. Aron, you're telling the patient who's listening.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Did you think he was family to me and the Archimedes?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, I didn't think he was a one.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
He's not a very one.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh, my God.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Now, when did Mr. Out of Compton see him?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Mr. Aron, the time to decide.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Any questions, Mr. Stratel?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Of course he was chairman.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Mr. Adam, you were in the team and said,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
that's sad this morning did you not say it?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And he really didn't say that the preparation,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I think that's a little to try to think of the care

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
that he's made in agreements that they would be able to reach out to.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
That's the long quote from Mr. A.L.I.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I think if I had any test this time, then we'd do this now.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I've just heard the chairman of the Clare A.B.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Reef could talk about a subject with me now kind of a month.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Take a seat, please.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Mayor of Compton, I'd be pleased.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Mayor of Compton, I'd like to have a meeting.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
The explanation of the chair has given the audience.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
There's undisputed by all of our guests here today.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
I presume you're about the same fellow citizens who were here when we went into the recess.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
You know the demonstrations of approval of just approval of an article make here.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
For any time by our guests in the committee room.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
The time of the recess, many Council junctions were about to proceed with some questions

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
that you wanted to ask Mr. John Adams to down the desk.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
The ten.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
The rather we understand is now new and respectful areas the Army has been pulled

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
with responsibility.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Full responsibility alone.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
There's a preparation and the prosecution of these charges against the McCarthy's

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
investigating committee.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Is that correct?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yes, sir.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
And I further understand your testimony today and that is a secretary.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
The things charges were prepared on your own initiative.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Is that correct?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yes, sir.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
I think that the thing is, the word preparation is given you a little bit because

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
of the day that I'll continue to discuss for a moment of my name.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Do you mean me?

06:24.000 --> 06:33.000
Or an arrow, a document like this, probably would be prepared by the Department of Councilor.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Not to work talking with you, but you're the partners.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
So the new Army, no return on the same thing.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
The Army's chronology, the 34th has that all the terminology of the bench which was

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
admitted on the 10th of March.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
But in this particular case, the Department of Councilor was so closely related to the matter.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm part of an interest.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
There's that, I think there was a general theory among those officials who were discussing the matter

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
with the decision that there was described to the state's divin.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
That I probably wouldn't be able to do the job as objectively as I should.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
And it was for that reason that Mr. Brown was assigned to do it.

07:12.000 --> 07:21.000
And the actual writing was done by Mr. Brown, who was an assistant general counsel of the bench

07:21.000 --> 07:29.000
department and he did it by his decision medium of interviewing me, the state and other officials.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I mean, studying various files, memorandum, so my file.

07:34.000 --> 07:43.000
And the actual physical access preparation and putting it together was done by Mr. Brown.

07:43.000 --> 07:52.000
The income or location was brought back to us in kind of semi-final form and we went over it.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
So although the floor was constantly worth the Army, we had a fist.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And that's the point I think that is most confusing.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And I'm trying to state now if I get you that narrative.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Will you put two things on the defense department?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yes, sir.

08:05.000 --> 08:14.000
Then the preparation of the document and the chronological event, the local state document,

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
was done by those in the city gone and putting yourself in the picture.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
And then independently of all other instances are employees of any other department of the government.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
That's right, sir.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
That is correct.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yes, sir.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
And the chronological events, including of 34 pages, and which was released to the public all March to the memorandum faculty,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
was released there to the committee.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
And if they have not to the public by the end, release to the committee on March to the memorandum.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Yes, sir.

08:47.000 --> 08:56.000
While prepared, certainly it's the stomach there, some groundwork to keep it laid.

08:56.000 --> 09:05.000
The memorandum is the two technical positions, some a confirmation of a van that the two have brought about.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
And these are the following years being a federal department of the stomach on the 22nd day of January.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Is that correct, sir?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yes, sir.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And that was done on your own in the city.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Yes, sir.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
There's one thing I might say clearly that I haven't remembered.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
One of my people reminded me that on the 20th of January, which is green tea, the meeting of the 30th General Office,

09:33.000 --> 09:44.000
I have a face telephone call for gifts at which time I have them to give me a manner of a list of all of the passes which private shine.

09:44.000 --> 09:54.000
I have a half while he was in court, indicating that there was crystallizing in my mind then, prior to the meeting in the Attorney General's office.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
The feeling that I have, that I should put these memorandums together.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yes.

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
Then thinking in the consideration, the thing that has been crystallizing in your mind over the days of several weeks,

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
the information that you got as a result of your telephone call to force takes.

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
As the statement is delivered in the May 18th, about 7.25, only evening out January 22nd.

10:22.000 --> 10:30.000
Getting in the consideration, all of them, you as a result of those things, then on your own in the city,

10:30.000 --> 10:44.000
began compiling data documents memorandums, given in your mind and on paper from which the 34th date documents evolved.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Is that right?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yes.

10:46.000 --> 10:59.000
And this evolved slowly, the 34th date documents, from what you had compiled by way of these documents.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
That way of data and documents and dates and events.

11:05.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm very fond of the point of information we have today, to Mr. Duncan, but I have, in the state of the year that we have one or two questions of Mr. Adam,

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
in view of the testimony and the part of Mr. Duncan, that will take me quite some time, so it may be just what I'm looking for.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Mr. Duncan, you're examining the information.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
I will go through this line of both the information of the May and the state.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Is that correct, Mr. Adam?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I don't know if they all have to have that in question.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Red again, sir.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
The interrupts are over the question.

11:38.000 --> 11:47.000
So, let me be speaking.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
We have a little peculiar about it.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
The other time, we will go and reach.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
We have a document of the law and its name.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yes sir.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
All the next questions are on the phone.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And that's that overview.

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
And this evolved slowly, the 34th date documents, from what you had compiled by way of data and documents,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
and they are pretty different.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
I think the word slowly is in correct sure because there were other documentation,

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
the records, memorandum files and diaries, which also were used in the patient's ill-personal interviews,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
in the preparation of the 34th date documents.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
And they were diaries and documents, and memorandum, not only from private views, but by the secretary,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
and perhaps others in the Pentagon, yes sir.

12:34.000 --> 12:43.000
So that you say that you are correct and the secretary is correct in your foreign testimony,

12:43.000 --> 12:52.000
that the charges were prepared, and the groundward further charges were prepared,

12:52.000 --> 13:00.000
slowly on the initiative, on the volition of views and the secretary and the department of the same.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Is that correct?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I think that's the standard.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
I think that's the standard.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
And as far as I ask you and your counsels, it's a standard page 291,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
who love your testimony.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
2912, and I reach from your fifth book.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Wait one moment.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Yes sir.

13:24.000 --> 13:33.000
And at the bottom of that page, the light's there.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Now Mr. Adam, you said that as the suggestion of Governor Sherman Adam,

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
you made up this report with this text and this design.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Is that correct?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Mr. Adam, yes sir.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
How about directly read that question and your answer?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
You have to.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
How do you reconcile that?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
The light's there.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Is that correct?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Just as any of us may be.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
How do you reconcile your previous foreign testimony?

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
That as the suggestion and I'm using the exact words.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Of that as the suggestion of Governor Sherman Adam,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
you made up this report with this text and this design.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
With your statement as of now, a moment of goal.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
That it was done solely and entirely on groundwork and on the event of

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
as it were released in the committee on March 11th,

14:30.000 --> 14:37.000
on the initiative and volition of those in the synagogue and those souls.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
On the second side, you're sworn statement that I have just read from the record,

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
who's you sworn statement has now given to this committee in public.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
Yes sir, this question was asked me about an hour ago and I answered it about an arrival.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Get your answer and I'll write a statement and I'll write it out.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
And I want you not to let some styles of these statements.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
You say you can.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I stayed at enter.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
That I felt that the statement I was making today was an elaboration of the statement

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
as me the other day and that when I thought to Governor Adam,

15:13.000 --> 15:21.000
he made a suggestion to me, which was not a direction and that's the suggestion.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Couple with the event.

15:25.000 --> 15:33.000
The occurrence of the release probably galvanized me to action in the preparation of this report

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
more quickly than otherwise would have been the case, but I felt that I would have prepared it.

15:39.000 --> 15:48.000
You state now that your testimony as a testimony is an elaboration of your testimony previously given.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Yes, that's correct.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
Mr. Adam, this is you state definitely and positively in the testimony that I have read to you.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
That you prepared the report on sign as a suggestion and sermon item.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
You may have guessed it over.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yes, I did.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
And didn't you state positively just now in a moment of going response to my perspective?

16:09.000 --> 16:20.000
That the report on sign and the groundwork from which that report was prepared was made and prepared solely and exclusively.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Only initiatives and volition.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I view another's independent on.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Didn't you say that?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I did.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
All right.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
We're going to make direct contribution of the other.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I don't rather than an elaboration on it.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't think so.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
You don't think so.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
Now that Mr. Adam is a question for this committee to decide and not me and I have no further questions.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Thank you, sir.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Sir, there's a response.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
There's a response.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh, for.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
And you said is my right?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
To my left?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh, for.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
There's still up.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I think not.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
From the majority of the country.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Oh, there's a response.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
No, Mr. Adam.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I think that is from the chair of the president.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
Through the first of the very short set of plans and plans to talk to the rest of the president about the finance of the business.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Very good.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
I think that is from the chair of the president.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Through the first of the very short set of plans and plans to talk to 힘들wood's president about the money.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
I think you said you described that the action decisions in this controversy were both in the army and the army alone.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Now, from the face of your school and touchable.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
That you made up this report with respect to Mr. Shine as the suggestion of Governor Sherman F.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
A White House of Business.

18:08.000 --> 18:16.000
From the face of the fact that you called on Senator McClellan as the suggestion of the deputy attorney general of the United States.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
A member of the Justice Department.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
In view of the fact that you are a athlete on a visit to Senator Durston by Gerald Moore.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
A White House assistant having no connection with the Pentagon.

18:29.000 --> 18:39.000
In view of the fact that the decision to try to kill the investigation on the loyalty boards and bring up the Shine Matter was reached at a meeting.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
Ascended by the Attorney General, the deputy attorney general, two top White House assistant and the UN ambassador.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
It is a serious testimony to this committee that the actions and decisions were both of the army and the army alone.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Which act and which decision?

18:55.000 --> 19:03.000
Well, sir, you admit that this even says that all of them related to this controversy were both of the army and the army alone.

19:03.000 --> 19:13.000
If you wanted to gain this, if you wanted to, no, wait until you call on the things Mr. King and Mr. Steven said to the decision of the army and the army alone was the preparation of the army's chronology.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Well, I have nothing to do with the meeting of 21 January, nothing at all.

19:18.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, would you want it now for the purposes of clarification, say, that the event-taking flight passed in after the January 21 meeting with reference to killing the loyalty board investigation and bringing up the Shine Matter to members of this committee.

19:32.000 --> 19:40.000
Well, the both things were at the instigation of people outside of the army and the Pentagon. Do you want to know what's that matter?

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I lost the question, I'll have to have a thread.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
What's the matter?

19:53.000 --> 20:11.000
Would you want it now for the purposes of clarification to say that the event-taking flight, nothing at the January 21 meeting, the purpose of killing the loyalty board investigation and bringing up the Shine Matter to members of this committee, that all things were at the instigation of people outside of the army and the Pentagon.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Do you want to tell us that?

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Now, what is it? Do I not try to find out the correct?

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
What is your immediate question? I don't follow the question.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Well, sir, what we're trying to find out is that I now have the Secretary of State and people.

20:26.000 --> 20:37.000
He says, I wish to make a perfectly planned statistician and the act on the part of the army concerning the controversy wasn't we being heard?

20:37.000 --> 21:06.000
Whether the decisions and the action of the department of the army below. I'm asking you, sir, if you can reconcile that statement of the Secretary with the sworn testimony that the Deputy Attorney General sent you to see a Democratic member of this committee who is not even a member of the committee, with the fact that a decision of the federal committee, with the fact that you have previously testified that you prepared this report has the suggestion of a White House assistant.

21:06.000 --> 21:30.000
With the fact that as a result of a meeting offended by two White House advisors and justice department advisors, you decided to come to the Republican Congress Committee linking and attempt to kill the loyalty for investigation, with thought about the both role of Home Shine Matter and that you are constantly on one of those visits by a White House assistant.

21:30.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm asking you, sir, how you can possibly reconcile that. Well, like what do they very easily with the statement, but the act and decision have been known as the Army and the Army along.

21:41.000 --> 21:55.000
I can do it very easily, sir. The act and decision to which Mr. Steven was a looting is the preparation of the Army chronology which this place from time after the first of March and which was the minute of the meeting.

21:55.000 --> 22:09.000
I don't remember this committee around the 10th of March. You were coupling it to the actions which I chose to dismiss Steven's absence to this country around the 20th of January, which reference to the loyal report matters.

22:09.000 --> 22:24.000
In each of those cases I have stated to you that there would have been no interview with any member of this committee. Had I told him not to come, I would be official of the Army who would have the responsibility in the area.

22:24.000 --> 22:35.000
I made the call on the senators, the actions were actions of the Army. If the Army hadn't gone, if the Army hadn't participated there would have been no action.

22:35.000 --> 22:53.000
But the action of the Army with reference to the loyal report matters on the 21st and 20th of January was not properly coupled itself as you're attempting to with the action of the Army and preparing charges on the first week of March.

22:54.000 --> 23:08.000
Mr. Adam, I just see a different statement. Yes, sir, and I suggest that you would reach Secretary Steven's statement. I'd like to continue reading a few now. You will find that your interpretation of it I respectfully suggest is not wanted by the plain wording about the statement.

23:08.000 --> 23:19.000
He goes on to say that no time to be Army who are I as the secretary receive any orders from anyone and respect to the preparation of the presentation of the Army's case.

23:19.000 --> 23:31.000
Specifically, the conference of January 21 was only for the purpose of obtaining an interpretation of existing directives. That statement is inaccurate, is it?

23:31.000 --> 23:43.000
The purpose of the conference of January 21 was only for the purpose of obtaining an interpretation of existing directives. That's not an accurate statement. I think it is.

23:43.000 --> 23:52.000
Well, isn't it a fact that if that January 21st meeting has Mr. Rogers' reflections told his whole story about China? I've previously said that.

23:52.000 --> 24:01.000
Well, doesn't that show that the statement that the meeting is not a purpose of the meeting and what's subsequently developed at the meeting might well be two different things?

24:01.000 --> 24:16.000
So, well, might be, well, you say there might be a dual purpose. Mr. Steven says the conference was only for the purpose of obtaining an interpretation of directives. That is the reason I call the Attorney General. That's what I wanted to get. That's what I was after when I was over there.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
I think it is. And the dual purpose of the wrong only had the meeting wasn't a dual purpose.

24:21.000 --> 24:34.000
Well, then that arrow was. The China-Matter said the wrong was a meeting. Well, today before the meeting, you told Mr. Rogers about the China matter and he made a point with the beautiful authenticity that I'm not following about. That was before the meeting. Well, that's right.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
Now I go on to the next thing. Action taken by the Army. Why are four? What's the one to do with the meeting?

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
Work in the depending on the time. Take in Army. Army only points to those.

24:46.000 --> 24:55.000
Is that true, sir? Yes. How can the Army take any of these actions without taking the responsibility for it?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Yes, sir.

25:00.000 --> 25:12.000
Well, Mr. Adams, the point is that they, Sherman Adams and that physically made use of it down and right to read blood and that you were not physically taken over the Senate at Dirkton's office.

25:12.000 --> 25:21.000
I told them I'd be something otherwise. There are not going to answer any more questions and just submit the right to the committee to lay it now stand to see if there's any possible way of reconciling.

25:25.000 --> 25:31.000
I have a little bit of a lot of nights to present that work. After you have been placed in Vietnam, you settle for that.

25:31.000 --> 25:38.000
Have you listened to your personal advice to get rid of this list so we can move on?

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
Yes, sir. Adams, do you run my department on the 22nd of January, right?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I run the department.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
You have the meeting with the Justice Department on the 21st? I did.

25:51.000 --> 26:06.000
Between the time of the meeting of the Justice Department and the meeting of my department, you had called on some of her and heard them that they knew what they'd cut to kill the subpoenas for the loyalty board.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
The clearing of the individuals over the fort moments of coming to the practice.

26:12.000 --> 26:21.000
Well, that's a little longer. I didn't say that. That wasn't the conversation. I wasn't talking about clearing the loyalty bar for two interns.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Well, clearing the conversation.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
I mean, that's not too long. You and my differ as well. They were very kind to me.

26:27.000 --> 26:34.000
When he's any event, one of the subjects of conversation at the department, we were very close to the completely friendly conversation.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.000
What was that? You thought we should not call the members of the old loyalty board.

26:41.000 --> 26:49.000
I think so every time you brought the subject up, I suggested it be deferred for the station and the chief and the return of the party.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Any event you didn't want the peanut issue, did you?

26:52.000 --> 26:58.000
No, but I don't think you and I discussed it. The issuing of the peanut that you're a department that night. I may be wrong, but I don't recollect that.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Well, it doesn't really have to be a custom-funded tale of Adams.

27:02.000 --> 27:13.000
Well, it is a comparison to see how you were handling the full loyalty board in this case with the way Mr. Blackenberg handled the loyalty board in the government printing off of the stage.

27:13.000 --> 27:21.000
I found out to you there that we had found the testimony of the cabinet. Mr. Blackenberg had ordered the loyalty board to appear.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
We found there were a mishandling of agencies here, moved them promptly.

27:25.000 --> 27:35.000
And that might suggest to you that the loyalty board was concerned with was part of the old terms of the theme.

27:35.000 --> 27:46.000
But it had already been removed. Now, if you're curious to know where they were, what they were doing, what they were handling security work, what must the general subject?

27:46.000 --> 27:54.000
Well, I don't think there is a meeting with so much people. I do not recall if you just brought up the government printing office.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
I don't recall as a front of the conversation with the tenor that you're now describing.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
No, I left there and you didn't tell me that you had just been the other son of yours.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
I did not tell you that you knew it. But I didn't tell you that you knew it.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I didn't know it.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
You didn't?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
No, no.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Now, we didn't know it was going to be a good issue.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
You didn't, we didn't discuss the fact that you had been to the other son of yours.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
No, it's there.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
You did not tell me that you had this conference about the White House.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I did not say.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
And you were forced to know that I didn't know that.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I don't know if you didn't know it.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I assume you didn't know it.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
No, there's sort of an interesting sequence of events here you talked to me about tonight.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
The next day you started to prepare the charge.

28:37.000 --> 28:44.000
The next day you were to take care of the memorandum for the record of my meeting with your department.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
I mean, how often does your salary be fired?

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
Well, they're going around.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
Let's pretend we're off to deal with the cost of the country to permit our station to identify themselves.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
This is ABC Television Network.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
I'm not sure regarding some of your previous testimonies.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
Some several days ago, when you were on the spam, you testified as I recall.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
I think this is an exact quote that you found.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
At some time, and of course, it's these events.

29:18.000 --> 29:26.000
You found that I thought that Mr. Cole had the capacity to control the committee.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Is that your testimony?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Yes, actually.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
I recall that I think that there is a substance with me.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
I don't know where I picked up another exact quote on it.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
We've spoken about wrecking silent things here, little.

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
I want to get that wrecking child if you include the Democratic members of which committee will be shut down.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I include it, sir.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
In my whole mind, the people who are within our committee can have that time, sir.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It was out of the court.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
I believe when that remark was made, I don't believe it was ever meant for members.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
And I believe all those there are.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
I don't know if they were going to remember.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm not sure when they left, sir.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But I think less than you, sir.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Then they definitely were not members.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
I want to know what you have said in that report.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I am not, sir.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
All right.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
The fact is that I was just coming to the next.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
I'm not sure if that is the answer to this.

30:29.000 --> 30:37.000
I recall in the earlier testimony that it is extremely sweet between the loyalty board and the government's critical officer.

30:37.000 --> 30:45.000
And the loyalty board and any other agency that you might see on the feet of the agency,

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
the government's minimum distance was under the control of the direction,

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
other legislatures and government.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
But that is not just that.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
I believe in the truth that all the employees here in the government say their mission.

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
Have civil service meetings and time their way in to the federal affairs of life,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
any employee you need to get to the point.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I don't know, sir.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I don't know much about the government.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I believe in the real history.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
I believe in the history of the government.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
I know no administrative functions.

31:21.000 --> 31:28.000
That the junk community on public education started over the first mill in the early 2016.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
These types of complaints were taught to public prisoners,

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
but other than that, we have no administrative issues.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
I intercom had out of the calling functions of the junk community on public education,

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
given the intercom to the character of the poor man and the committee,

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
