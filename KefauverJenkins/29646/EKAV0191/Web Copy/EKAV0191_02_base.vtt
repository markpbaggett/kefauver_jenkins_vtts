00:00.000 --> 00:08.040
In the executive branch, of course, it's mandatory on the executive branch.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.680
I understand that the government printing office uses the same procedures and conforms to

00:13.680 --> 00:15.400
the executive order.

00:15.400 --> 00:21.240
I understand, however, that is an arbitrary decision of the public printer and it is my understanding

00:21.240 --> 00:25.400
that he needs not if he wishes not.

00:25.400 --> 00:30.560
And that the government printing office is not considered to be a part of the executive

00:30.560 --> 00:31.560
branch.

00:31.560 --> 00:37.080
Now I'm speaking from a from partial knowledge service that I shouldn't want what I say

00:37.080 --> 00:39.600
to be taken as God's law.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.600
You don't care that I don't know if God in any further than that.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.600
I want this resolution distinction that is made with the devil.

00:47.600 --> 00:52.600
But it's nothing double been that very often taken.

01:22.600 --> 01:29.600
I believe that because you're a trained lawyer and you have eminent counsel on both sides.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.600
The second one is that you've done a little long down here.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.840
You understand what your position, the executive department, and that you were thought of

01:36.840 --> 01:39.840
feeling around, crudal, and before.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.840
And the third one is that you mentioned it because it was part of a plan that you wanted

01:44.840 --> 01:46.840
to get the names on the right.

01:46.840 --> 01:53.840
What's one of those three is the reason that you're different.

01:53.840 --> 02:00.840
Well, we'll do, we just take three again.

02:00.840 --> 02:05.840
I think we're going to reach the questions in the time.

02:05.840 --> 02:09.840
I think I think that I think that we'll put them in just three words.

02:10.840 --> 02:16.840
Well, I don't think it was any of the three, sir.

02:16.840 --> 02:21.840
Well, remember, you mind telling why you mentioned the names.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.840
I was married in the incident with the occurred, sir.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.840
Just five for instance, most very occurred in the I and I.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.840
Then just five, tell us, no, it's not my case.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.840
Not five, is it all right?

02:33.840 --> 02:35.840
Well, of course, that's what it is.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.840
It was part of my experience.

02:37.840 --> 02:44.840
I was just fighting my mind at least, not consciously or unconsciously.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.840
Yes, that's the norm.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.840
Well, I couldn't because it happened, sir.

02:49.840 --> 02:50.840
It was true.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.840
You thought it should go in and get there.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.840
And so you brought them here.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.840
Yes, sir.

02:55.840 --> 03:04.840
You must have had it, the lawyer, you must have realized what the implications of it would be.

03:04.840 --> 03:11.840
Then you think the committee might be interrupted and why the Kennedy United Nations was down here.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.840
It's got some problems with you.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.840
Well, I have a reason for this one.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.840
It's quite a thing and I want to get to it in a minute.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.840
I don't think that I was worried about it.

03:23.840 --> 03:28.840
I don't think that it's a standard logic to me.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.840
He wasn't the United Nations delegate.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.840
So you have no reason to get this, is that it?

03:35.840 --> 03:36.840
I'm sure it's that.

03:36.840 --> 03:37.840
It's not just an area of the thing.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.840
I tried to narrate everything to the church.

03:39.840 --> 03:46.840
Now that the atoms of some time back as I'm an account for its pointed out,

03:46.840 --> 03:54.840
used there that you made up the judges in effect to get in a Mr. Sherman app.

03:55.840 --> 04:04.840
And later on, you as I followed the efforts to find efforts of our council to define the issue precisely,

04:04.840 --> 04:09.840
instead that they were made up at the suggestion of the Army.

04:09.840 --> 04:20.840
You would want to find yourself facing possible poetry with you as a result of a presidential directive that occurred between those two phases of testimony on your part, no chance.

04:21.840 --> 04:28.840
Do you want to clarify further the questions that you have to the answer that you made to the questions and Mr. Jenkins for the answer?

04:37.840 --> 04:40.840
I really don't think that I know exactly what it is you want.

04:41.840 --> 04:51.840
Well, as I understand it at one point, before the presidential directive, you said that you made up the charges in quite some of the suggestion of Mr. Sherman app.

04:51.840 --> 04:58.840
And after the presidential directive, you said that you made the charges of the Spartan Army and West the Army.

04:58.840 --> 05:03.840
And it seems to me that the two sports don't go together from the standpoint of fact.

05:04.840 --> 05:12.840
Well, I have to say, this is the end. This is the third very respectfully shared. This is the third time that's happening.

05:12.840 --> 05:17.840
Well, I don't want to take any more time on it, but I would like you to do this so that I can study it.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.840
I'd like you to, you will prepare a record for the committee with respect to this.

05:22.840 --> 05:29.840
The presence and preference is your testimony that's been pointed out by the council for this committee and funding to the committee.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.840
If it's the third time and you're tired of it, I'll be fine.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.840
I'm not tired of this time.

05:35.840 --> 05:42.840
As I say, Governor Adams made this suggestion. That didn't obligate me.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.840
I am making this record. It's making this record.

05:45.840 --> 05:51.840
My original statement this day, that I prepared this suggestion.

05:51.840 --> 05:59.840
I just have an hour at home. In this document, I'm further pointed out to you that previous, that meeting.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.840
I have begun to go on again.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.840
I just met this.

06:05.840 --> 06:12.840
I mean, the third award you go to, you say that Governor Adams did not obligate me.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.840
I understand that.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.840
Full-fiddle obligation. Nobody is interested.

06:18.840 --> 06:23.840
In other words, you have no order from Secretary Steven to make up these charges.

06:23.840 --> 06:29.840
I use a, I usually say, to my original file or the charges of my sentence.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.840
I'm referring presumably to the original file.

06:32.840 --> 06:37.840
Well, I had that largely completed. From the before the committee, we have action parties.

06:37.840 --> 06:43.840
Have the suggestion, Mr. Chairman Adams? Well, he made a suggestion.

06:43.840 --> 06:50.840
I have them out every in my mind. As I have told you before, I felt that he galvanized me into more protection.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.840
And might otherwise have been in case that I think that I would have this effect.

06:53.840 --> 07:06.840
One final question. In other words, your position will respect that this particular question has not been changed in any way or any form by the presidential director.

07:06.840 --> 07:13.840
Is that correct?

07:13.840 --> 07:20.840
I beg your pardon.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.840
I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.840
In other words, your position will respect the issues in hand.

07:27.840 --> 07:33.840
Have not been changed in any way in your testimony by the presidential director. Is that correct?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.840
Your position will respect these charges.

07:36.840 --> 07:40.840
They haven't been changed by the day of the director.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.840
No other question.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.840
And it's like that. Mr. Welch, what?

07:47.840 --> 07:51.840
And the metropolis that you have time out for those who have left them.

07:51.840 --> 07:56.840
Mr. Chairman, do you know what the rest of the girls will grow up by talking now?

07:56.840 --> 08:02.840
No. We have another one Mr. Wittler that I will over the next.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.840
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Wittler and Mr. Wittler.

08:05.840 --> 08:10.840
Mr. Chairman, before I get rifting, you are reluctant to react to a practice that the chair followed.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.840
It's like a 1948.

08:12.840 --> 08:19.840
I mean, I had a very curious and controversial fellow hearings of Wittler and Mr. Chairman called upon me to that.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.840
I have been before you did this in unscoring.

08:22.840 --> 08:30.840
But you feel that you have now had a complete and full and fair opportunity to testify before the commission.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.840
I feel that I have. Thank you.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.840
You know, this is Wittler and we'll follow that with this. Come.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.840
We can fire an habit call as the next wittler is going to run.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.840
I'm going to run.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.840
I'm going to run.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.840
I'm going to run.

08:58.840 --> 09:02.840
I'm going to run.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.840
I'm going to run.

09:05.840 --> 09:11.840
You follow me for the testimony about the give of your tooth for whole tooth or nothing but the tooth for whole tooth.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.840
I hope you got it.

09:13.840 --> 09:19.840
Mr. Chairman, I'm going to run.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.840
Mr. Chairman, I'm going to run.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.840
Mr. Chairman, I'm going to run.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.840
Mr. Chairman, I'm going to run.

09:30.840 --> 09:37.840
I know the team of the Bay in front of the order, the managed issues.

09:37.840 --> 09:45.840
I think before he testify, we should know whether or not he will be able to testify and pull.

09:45.840 --> 09:50.840
I know for the implementation of the decision of the legal council of the Army,

09:50.840 --> 09:58.840
so he can testify as a conversation they had with Mr. Adam, with our general, with the team,

09:58.840 --> 10:02.840
with officers in the Army or private in the Army.

10:02.840 --> 10:06.840
I think it's important we know that before he testify,

10:06.840 --> 10:10.840
because I don't like to get any mob pills next morning here.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.840
I think you may have said this with no reflection of all of them, a general.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.840
I know that the good soldiers in the Army are in the order of the things that they've been doing.

10:17.840 --> 10:22.840
There's a family, so it's a question to be resolved when they are raised and brought into that.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.840
I don't listen to the things that he's saying, but they do it that way.

10:25.840 --> 10:29.840
Mr. Chairman, I think this would be a short question for them.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.840
We just have to move this.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.840
I think the other thing is that he probably has in mind the question that he can ask.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.840
Well, that no restrictions based on me was the one.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.840
Very good.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.840
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.840
The next time I visit Mr. Thomas Barrett, I'm pretty pleased to meet you.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.840
And there you go, Mr. Chairman.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.840
It's a tough game, it's my turn.

10:48.840 --> 10:54.840
Mr. Chairman, I've never seen a film in the position of the council of the government,

10:54.840 --> 10:57.840
which I think is in a lot of ways.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.840
Now the exact question is what?

10:59.840 --> 11:01.840
Mr. Chairman.

11:05.840 --> 11:10.840
General, take your call, ladies and gentlemen, right?

11:10.840 --> 11:14.840
And you, rank you, make you general in the Army.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.840
That is generally the United States, out there.

11:17.840 --> 11:25.840
You are the commanding general of what Army installation of the commanding general for six minutes.

11:26.840 --> 11:32.840
So the committee is the nature and purpose of that installation.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.840
Our principal mission is to talk to you.

11:35.840 --> 11:42.840
It's a train that newly inducted soldiers who come into the Army under the strike and serve as that.

11:42.840 --> 11:51.840
And during that first eight weeks, we give them training in individual basic infantry training.

11:51.840 --> 11:57.840
And then after two weeks leave about, they return for advancements and retreats.

11:57.840 --> 12:06.840
So we train them, take their places in rifle, company, special weapons, company, and give them special training,

12:06.840 --> 12:18.840
for special activities such as truck drivers, mechanics, radio operators, field liners, crops, and methods.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.840
For you, the command is for six.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.840
I know them, but last year, I lost.

12:26.840 --> 12:36.840
When this year, there are a few days in China, which is going to be a span for your face.

12:36.840 --> 12:45.840
After a tear of the private China November 3rd, 1953, for Secretary Steven Vistig for six,

12:45.840 --> 12:52.840
he told me that five of the time has been inducted into the Army that day, and he would arrive at Fort Dex in the week to ten days.

12:55.840 --> 13:04.840
I certainly remember that General Ryan was on the line of the government testimony,

13:05.840 --> 13:10.840
that we go along and getting more and more confused by the subject of directness,

13:10.840 --> 13:16.840
we find that Adam can't tell how he goes through, we inform the government,

13:16.840 --> 13:22.840
that General Tal about 150 of Adam's decision, we find that Ryan is here.

13:22.840 --> 13:27.840
I know that he has been on the line with the government, but I'm not in the government.

13:28.840 --> 13:35.840
The government is still reflecting how the appropriations of the military well-forged,

13:35.840 --> 13:39.840
the straddles that the government can testify in total.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.840
I don't like to have certain general priesthoods to testify,

13:43.840 --> 13:49.840
and others not, with the general round of the stands, apparently as a growing,

13:49.840 --> 13:52.840
the government is making a plan, which is good.

13:52.840 --> 13:56.840
I don't wonder now if you're welcome with Adam's authority,

13:57.840 --> 14:00.840
whether Mr. General Watt will be present to me,

14:00.840 --> 14:07.840
I consider the couple of people who will be able to follow the family of General Ryan Watt,

14:07.840 --> 14:14.840
follow my opinion, it's really difficult for us to anticipate what's going to happen here,

14:14.840 --> 14:17.840
but we have to discuss with the chairman of the General.

14:17.840 --> 14:22.840
Well, this is David. I just think that the chairman is a pianist because that was yes.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.840
I would say, as in fact, as a physicist, I think he has very little of this type of thing

14:27.840 --> 14:33.840
that he could possibly testify to, and that the rest of the meetings didn't contest if I am.

14:33.840 --> 14:38.840
I think the simple thing is to get by it. I don't think he has any.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.840
Could you let the chairman come to me as well to be advising Mr. Watt?

14:42.840 --> 14:47.840
Whether or not the other Watt will be operating on the same rule as General Ryan.

14:47.840 --> 14:52.840
I could really hold the line. I would like to let the line take a minute.

14:52.840 --> 14:57.840
I don't want to do the rule for everyone.

14:57.840 --> 15:04.840
I don't anticipate any difference just out of two then and now.

15:04.840 --> 15:09.840
I've only just been a little bit off, so it's just good.

15:10.840 --> 15:21.840
Next Thursday, when that time told me Mr. Shine had been remembered many or remember the staff of the committee to show them.

15:21.840 --> 15:27.840
And that the committee had requested Mr. Stevens to make fire the shine available

15:27.840 --> 15:34.840
to the committee staff to complete certain unfinished work that was meant in pop-up.

15:35.840 --> 15:42.840
And Mr. Stevens told me that he wanted to cooperate with this committee in every way that he possibly could.

15:42.840 --> 15:51.840
And he authorized me to make fire the shine available to the committee on weekends when it isn't interfered with training.

15:51.840 --> 15:57.840
He said that otherwise, fire the shine was to be treated the same as any other training.

15:57.840 --> 16:04.840
He said that he desired that I give this my personal attention in order that it be properly handled.

16:04.840 --> 16:23.840
I accepted this directive in these instructions most enthusiastically, because I had returned from Korea just a short time before, where I spent two years seeing the forces of communism, the communist aggression on the battlefield and in government there.

16:23.840 --> 16:30.840
And if I could help this young man in any way to run down communist, I was a hundred percent fine.

16:30.840 --> 16:41.840
Secondly, I felt that it was my duty as a government officer to cooperate with any government committee, especially a committee of highest legislative body in the United States Senate.

16:41.840 --> 16:48.840
And thirdly, of course, Secretary of the Army gave me these instructions and I had to carry them out.

16:49.840 --> 16:56.840
General, when would your next contact with anyone concerning the U.D. shine?

16:56.840 --> 17:01.840
Private shine arrived at Fort Dick from the 10th of November.

17:01.840 --> 17:06.840
On that day, Mr. Adams called me up and asked me whether or not I knew Private shine was there.

17:06.840 --> 17:12.840
I told him I didn't, because I don't see tract of every private that comes in to Fort Dick.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.840
And he told me that it was I knew it was not Private shine was there.

17:17.840 --> 17:27.840
And I said that I had discussed this matter with the Secretary at length and the Secretary told me that I could let him off weekend, provided it didn't interfere with his training.

17:27.840 --> 17:31.840
And he said, I'm going to move back to the wisdom.

17:32.840 --> 17:54.840
And I said that in addition to the weekend, the Secretary also indicated that the committee might desire him on weeknight, and also that members of the committee staff might desire to come to Fort Dick to consult him after due the hours in the evening when he was available and it didn't interfere with any words that he had set up for that time.

17:54.840 --> 18:02.840
Now I might say that in connection with these factors, Private shine was given 16 passes while he was at Fort Dick.

18:02.840 --> 18:15.840
I authorize 12 of them in each instance that the request of a member of the committee staff, six of these passes were for weekend.

18:15.840 --> 18:22.840
Four of the passes were for weeknight for the purpose of doing business or conducting committee business off the coast.

18:22.840 --> 18:34.840
One was on November 17th, when members of the committee and the staff visited nearby installation of Wild Air Force Base, and one was on Thanksgiving Day.

18:34.840 --> 18:43.840
Four passes were granted the Private shine by a unit commander, just regular ordinary passes that they have authority to grant.

18:44.840 --> 18:51.840
And that is the pass that he had a pass every weekend that he was at Fort Dick.

18:51.840 --> 18:58.840
The general would be few persons, per with any member of the Atlantic committee.

18:59.840 --> 19:10.840
On November 10th, I received telephone call from a member of the committee staff, dating to Mr. Cohn and Mr. Car,

19:10.840 --> 19:16.840
who were coming to Fort Dick on November 11th. They'd like very much to see me.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.840
And I said, I'd be very happy to see you.

19:19.840 --> 19:27.840
They said that they would arrive about mid-afternoon, and I told them to come to my headquarter and I would be there.

19:27.840 --> 19:36.840
During the morning of the 11th, my duty officer received the telephone call saying that Mr. Car and Mr. Cohn would arrive about two o'clock.

19:36.840 --> 19:50.840
And I planned to be in my headquartered, being honest to say, all duty and charge, the job guard and the seat, with the spenders, and the celebrated as a holiday in our home.

19:51.840 --> 19:59.840
And it's called and Mr. Car arrived at 1.30. And not finding me at my headquartered, they came out to my quarter.

19:59.840 --> 20:07.840
I invited them in and we sat in my living room and had a very pleasant conference.

20:07.840 --> 20:19.840
They told me that Private Shine was needed very badly for important committee business, that was in-process, that he had special personal knowledge about a great deal of the business.

20:20.840 --> 20:28.840
And they wanted him to be made available in order to finish this work.

20:28.840 --> 20:43.840
I told him exactly what the secretary had given me instructions to do and indicated that as far as I was concerned, we would make him available on weekend provided that it didn't interfere with the training.

20:43.840 --> 20:52.840
And the conference ended on that note. It's very close, you're all the way through.

20:52.840 --> 21:01.840
And it was very present and we had a perfect agreement that whenever they wanted Private Shine, they would call my headquartered and let me know.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.840
And the arrangements would be made that way.

21:05.840 --> 21:19.840
And General, what if anything were stated on that occasion that you just related the trouble to how long the committee would need to serve as a Private Shine?

21:19.840 --> 21:28.840
Mr. Cohn gave me to believe that the committee business was in the nature of unfinished business.

21:28.840 --> 21:33.840
And that Private Shine was needed in order to complete it.

21:33.840 --> 21:39.840
And they indicated that it wasn't very long. They weren't going to harass us very much.

21:39.840 --> 21:49.840
They'd asked for him from time to time. And he said they wouldn't ask for them any time that they didn't actually need it.

21:49.840 --> 21:55.840
But they made no specific date. There was no agreement that it was too weak or a month or two months.

21:55.840 --> 22:04.840
But I very generally got the impression that this was in the nature of unfinished business and that it would be finished in a matter of weeks.

22:04.840 --> 22:08.840
No, always Private Shine, they can be too brief.

22:08.840 --> 22:14.840
Here I have the fourth section of November 10th and left on January 16th.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.840
That would be approximately...

22:16.840 --> 22:19.840
50 regular eight weeks before.

22:19.840 --> 22:24.840
And if you state that you was wearing a 16-task and you're wearing a 16-task and you're wearing a 16-task?

22:24.840 --> 22:27.840
Yes, a 16-task.

22:27.840 --> 22:35.840
And what is the normal number of tests is awarded an average trainee in that length of time.

22:35.840 --> 22:43.840
And the normal number of passes would probably run three or four during that period for the normal training.

22:43.840 --> 22:57.840
Have you ever had any other trainees at Fort Six where you have served as a player who received the comfortable number of passes on Private Shine?

22:57.840 --> 23:09.840
No, I have never had another trainee receive a comparable number of passes and I've never had another trainee that was working on Senate Committee business.

23:09.840 --> 23:21.840
And the total reason for Private Shine receiving these 12 additional passes was because Committee members have requested those passes.

23:21.840 --> 23:32.840
In each instance they remembered the committee staff who called my head quarters and indicated that Private Shine was needed and in most cases were needed for very registered.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.840
And generally, in effect it brought us to December 8th.

23:36.840 --> 23:43.840
Private Shine was permitted to leave the course on weekday nights.

23:43.840 --> 23:51.840
Private Shine was permitted to leave the course on December 1st, December 3rd, December 4th, and December 7th.

23:51.840 --> 24:01.840
On week nights in each instance, as the specific request of a member of the committee staff for the purpose of working on Committee business.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.840
Definitely, State privilege terminates by you on December 8th.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.840
That is terminated by me on December 8th, yes sir.

24:09.840 --> 24:23.840
Do you ever make any investigation to determine whether or not Private Shine in fact was engaged on Committee business while he was off the coast on these 12 passes?

24:23.840 --> 24:36.840
I accepted the word of the committee staff fully and completely as far as Private Shine being made available for work.

24:36.840 --> 24:42.840
And I personally never questioned and I personally didn't make any attempt to find out.

24:42.840 --> 24:59.840
However, my inspector general has been looking into the allegations that appeared and newspaper in the office alleging proper actual treatment to Private Shine and he hasn't found out anything.

25:00.840 --> 25:14.840
And yet, do you know for a fact that Private Shine made many long-distance telephone calls from Port Vich while he was taken there?

25:14.840 --> 25:21.840
Private Shine received telephone messages continuously while he was at Port Vich.

25:21.840 --> 25:35.840
Some of these telephone messages would be in the form of calling a committee member immediately in which case he would be released from training long enough to make the committee call.

25:35.840 --> 25:46.840
Others would say they were urgent calls and the company commander would say every way that he could to get Private Shine to the telephone exchange in fact as he could.

25:46.840 --> 25:57.840
Some instances when they were getting ready to march in he let Private Shine go to the exchange directly in order to save time to get this urgent telephone call and to the committee.

25:57.840 --> 26:09.840
And then other cases of telephone calls that were urgent delivered to Private Shine and he made those I presume on his own time after supper.

26:09.840 --> 26:18.840
And I suspect that the telephone calls came an average of one of them, definitely my estimate.

26:18.840 --> 26:37.840
General, what a question if you know this unusual treatment in the way of this in telephone calls, which is called a fraction here on the other screen.

26:37.840 --> 26:51.840
I can say that from a division level that has no effect, the recommended level has no effect, the Italian level no effect, for company level and for two level it did have some effect.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.840
Private Shine was the man's suicide.

26:54.840 --> 27:02.840
It was the man that entered the army in the fanfare of publicity with his picture on every page of the local press.

27:02.840 --> 27:09.840
When he arrived at Fort Dix, there was a newspaper report to meet him wanting to get an interview with the man.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.840
About a week after he was there, United States Senator came to see him.

27:13.840 --> 27:22.840
The following day all the local papers had his picture in the paper, the headline, Private Shine visited by the United States Congress.

27:22.840 --> 27:29.840
He had weekend passes, he was allowed to go home Thanksgiving. He got off Christmas in New Year.

27:29.840 --> 27:37.840
He had members of this committee staff come there to meet him and talk with him in the evening.

27:37.840 --> 27:55.840
The collective situation was just to be committed to a company and the two levels there was found to be some repercussions and thoughts or the willaments of the wonderment,

27:55.840 --> 28:07.840
and the question in the minds of the other trainees. There unquestionably was a situation there that wasn't normal and Private Shine looked upon as a man of power.

28:07.840 --> 28:24.840
And I might say that Private Shine himself contributed by indicating he was company commander that he was in Fort Dix to study the reorganization of the United States Army along modern lines.

28:24.840 --> 28:39.840
The General has been a video test for only about a few pieces of existence in the third and January.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.840
Tell us what he's all about there.

28:42.840 --> 29:01.840
We've been still with T.C. incident. Private Shine arrived at Fort Dix at Fort Crocs, the afternoon of the 10th and Private Shine was on Titching Police at 4.30 on the morning of the 11th.

29:01.840 --> 29:15.840
The stories that there was the rent top of the rollout for Private Shine or he was possible to show him favors and give him proper treatment with the exception of work for this committee at Fort Dix is fall.

29:15.840 --> 29:30.840
Private Shine arrived at his organization for duty on the 20th and he started his formal training on the 22nd and the night of the 22nd Private Shine was in the kitchen on Titching Police.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.840
Supplementary Titching Police.

29:32.840 --> 29:44.840
Doesn't work on that day. They needed extra men and they Private Shine was one of the men who were in there and he performed the 30th job in the kitchen, feigning out the soul.

29:44.840 --> 29:53.840
And on the 8th of December he had his regular turn on Titching Police and he was in the kitchen at 4.30 in the morning and he stayed there at 9.30.

29:53.840 --> 30:04.840
When I sent Paul and the come to my office to tell him that he could not have any more weeknight taskings and I must admit that I didn't know he was on Titching Police.

30:04.840 --> 30:12.840
I have misplied his idea of what job he was on except that I was not going to permit him to be absent any more evening.

30:12.840 --> 30:24.840
Now as one of your questions there was an incident of Titching Police on the 30th of December.

30:24.840 --> 30:34.840
On the 30th of December there was a telephone call came to my headquarters on the company commander of this young man asking whether or not a pass is in front.

30:34.840 --> 30:41.840
And my aide came in and I said no I didn't receive any request for pass and I hadn't done any grant.

30:41.840 --> 30:50.840
And then he called me in my quarters. This was New Year's Eve. He called me in my quarters about half past 12.

30:50.840 --> 31:01.840
And said the regulars the up call and said that looked as though Private Shine had absent properly. He left without proper thought.

31:01.840 --> 31:09.840
And he said that he had talked to the company commander and he thought possibly that there was a misunderstanding.

31:09.840 --> 31:19.840
And he said that in his opinion that it was one of those things that we might investigate when Shine came back on the floor of the tanker.

31:20.840 --> 31:26.840
And I asked whether or not Private Shine had a pass. The rich had passed. He said yes Private Shine had a pass.

31:26.840 --> 31:36.840
So I decided then that I didn't think there's that third of the telegrams who have him come back if he left Billy.

31:36.840 --> 31:46.840
Possibility is a misunderstanding. It is a bit of a pass to this pocket that we could investigate it or the regulars could investigate it on Monday.

31:46.840 --> 31:54.840
He called me back a little while later and said that a telegram had already been sent by the company commander.

31:54.840 --> 32:02.840
Oring it man to come back. So I said that perfectly all right. It's a company commander wants to bring it back. It's all right with me.

32:03.840 --> 32:15.840
That's I will not tell the man that telegrams. Let him bring him back. I did however. If the committee called up. Remember the staff called up. That's for him for committee visits.

32:15.840 --> 32:20.840
I had an agreement with Mr. Coles that I must keep him letting go.

32:20.840 --> 32:32.840
So a three o'clock Mr. Coles called up and said that he was needed for committee business and Private Shine was permitted to remain over until the night of the death.

32:32.840 --> 32:43.840
Now at that particular time I didn't know that Private Shine was new or God on New Year's Eve and also for 50 years on the death.

32:44.840 --> 32:52.840
Had I known that Private Shine would have been blocked back. But that information would not pass.

32:52.840 --> 33:06.840
Let's get over it. Let's give them a way to see what the issue is back. This Private Shine was taking full attention to the New Year on January 10th.

33:06.840 --> 33:16.840
The investigation that was held on the morning of the fall. The regimental commander decided that there has been any misunderstanding.

33:16.840 --> 33:25.840
But it was all on Private Shine's path and that Private Shine was new kitchen police on the 10th.
