WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
Where they believe, for instance, in some areas and

00:03.500 --> 00:06.180
democratic countries, both products and Catholics don't believe in

00:06.180 --> 00:07.180
Christmas.

00:07.180 --> 00:10.380
Well, I have nothing to do with issues here and I would not get into

00:10.380 --> 00:11.380
an argument.

00:11.380 --> 00:13.980
Senator, I guess the weather you should separate church and

00:13.980 --> 00:14.980
safe and safe.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.580
Senator, I guess, offer this country, in this country we have

00:17.580 --> 00:19.180
complete separation of church and safe.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.180
Well, I look under creative social issues.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.180
All right.

00:22.180 --> 00:25.020
He has free entry to a free market.

00:25.020 --> 00:26.620
What does that mean?

00:26.620 --> 00:29.020
You've got to, you can see the same as that here.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.020
I haven't discussed this with you.

00:31.020 --> 00:32.260
What does it mean?

00:32.260 --> 00:33.900
I mean, this was the document.

00:33.900 --> 00:34.700
Oh, ready to go.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.340
I don't understand this.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.220
I'm just asking you.

00:37.220 --> 00:39.580
You handed it to me and it's not my document.

00:39.580 --> 00:43.100
You asked for what I told you that he had handed one document

00:43.100 --> 00:45.380
having some suggestions on the psychological warfare

00:45.380 --> 00:46.700
of 30 persons.

00:46.700 --> 00:47.740
Now look at that.

00:47.740 --> 00:51.340
I don't, you must discuss it with him.

00:51.340 --> 00:53.420
Now on page, he's got some pretty good ideas in here,

00:53.420 --> 00:54.100
isn't he?

00:54.100 --> 00:54.580
I know.

00:54.580 --> 00:55.100
Let's look at this.

00:55.100 --> 00:55.900
I'm not.

00:55.900 --> 00:56.900
I'm not.

00:56.900 --> 00:57.900
How many asked the question?

00:57.900 --> 00:58.700
I know six questions.

00:59.420 --> 01:01.420
Look at under item nine.

01:01.420 --> 01:04.420
Under arm, arm for it to see.

01:04.420 --> 01:07.580
He's got members of Democratic Party and key positions.

01:07.580 --> 01:09.060
I can even ask the Republicans.

01:12.260 --> 01:15.140
Then under, let's take items, can't.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.220
No, I, I, I, I, you don't answer your question.

01:17.220 --> 01:18.420
Well, I mean, this is the plan.

01:18.420 --> 01:19.340
It's the hand that's doing it.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.580
I'm trying to figure it out.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.060
Well, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's,

01:22.060 --> 01:23.660
and you're not.

01:23.660 --> 01:25.580
One of the things that you can't say about Jackson,

01:25.580 --> 01:26.820
he's not, he's not down.

01:28.700 --> 01:32.700
And when, when you talk about, they, they, they,

01:32.700 --> 01:35.140
they make the mistake here that I never make it.

01:35.140 --> 01:37.980
I don't think of referring to the non-communist,

01:37.980 --> 01:43.420
the Republican type of government as a democratic form.

01:43.420 --> 01:45.260
I wish he wouldn't make that mistake.

01:45.260 --> 01:46.740
Well, this is in the international field.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.940
Look under community leaders.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.820
He says, special appeals to leaders of community thought.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.220
This is all around the world.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.300
Led us to turn on better in the organization.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.380
So forth, they don't.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.140
But number.

01:56.140 --> 01:57.900
That's Hannah.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.780
He's got the Elks in the Nice to Columbus.

02:02.740 --> 02:05.260
Well, I don't know whether they have an Elks large

02:05.260 --> 02:09.420
and pocket-son or a life long with the Elks.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.300
Mr. Jackson, you'll find things that the numerous,

02:12.300 --> 02:13.980
but see what he says, here he suggests

02:13.980 --> 02:17.420
for them the anti-inflammation program that you charging

02:17.420 --> 02:18.420
about.

02:18.420 --> 02:18.580
Why do you...

02:18.580 --> 02:19.420
What's me finish?

02:19.420 --> 02:20.420
What's me finish?

02:20.420 --> 02:22.580
Mr. Jackson, you must have finished.

02:22.580 --> 02:23.980
What are you reading from?

02:23.980 --> 02:26.380
I am reading from this document.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.140
He is studying for what he thinks should be done.

02:29.140 --> 02:32.780
You'll find that and he lists one of the things

02:32.780 --> 02:35.780
that makes special appeals to the leaders of community

02:35.780 --> 02:36.780
thought.

02:36.780 --> 02:39.900
He does do for Carolyn Veterans' organization.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.380
And he gives an example to Elks, Nice to Columbus,

02:42.380 --> 02:43.860
etc.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.460
But the one with that is not...

02:45.460 --> 02:46.620
Well, I have good idea.

02:46.620 --> 02:49.220
I understand, but is there an Elks large...

02:49.220 --> 02:52.300
He's talking about the media areas of the world.

02:52.300 --> 02:56.260
Is there an Elks large in Africa and Pakistan and so on?

02:56.260 --> 02:58.780
Mr. Jackson, you know that he is talking here

02:58.780 --> 03:01.780
about the utilization of local organizations.

03:01.780 --> 03:05.020
He says, for Carolyn Veterans' organizations...

03:05.020 --> 03:06.300
Well, this is all over the world.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.180
Psychological warfare he's talking about.

03:08.180 --> 03:11.340
Certainly, and he talks about making a special appeal

03:11.340 --> 03:13.380
to the Sentinel and Veterans' organizations.

03:13.380 --> 03:14.780
All right, now let's put it on with them.

03:14.780 --> 03:15.780
Let's turn it...

03:15.780 --> 03:18.740
Well, I want to explain how he's going to do it with these troops.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.060
Now, let's turn to periodical.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.180
Let me ask you this question.

03:21.180 --> 03:21.780
Let me just...

03:21.780 --> 03:22.580
Let me ask you.

03:22.580 --> 03:24.060
Can I ask you this question?

03:24.060 --> 03:27.740
I would like you to answer my question, but I...

03:27.740 --> 03:30.260
In order to answer this, I have to get it clarified.

03:30.260 --> 03:34.420
Do I understand that you feel there's something wrong

03:34.420 --> 03:37.140
with making an appeal, giving information

03:37.140 --> 03:40.900
to the Sentinel and Veterans' organizations?

03:40.900 --> 03:42.060
Is there something ridiculous

03:42.060 --> 03:43.460
or there's something funny about that?

03:43.460 --> 03:46.820
No, but I'm asking you how he was going to do that.

03:46.820 --> 03:47.900
I mean, this is just an outline.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.260
Now, let's turn to periodical.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.500
He has, here, under periodical.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.260
I've paid unit space four.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.020
Give me the number, would you?

03:55.020 --> 03:56.220
Well, it's...

03:56.220 --> 03:57.980
It's B under 15.

03:57.980 --> 03:59.780
B under 15.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.060
Now he's got...

04:01.060 --> 04:01.940
A little further.

04:01.940 --> 04:05.180
And then, then, a subsection B under that.

04:05.180 --> 04:08.540
He has periodical and universal appeal.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.540
Pictures, carcassoon, humor, pin-up.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.340
One of the questions.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.820
Wow, what kind of a Pokemon is he going to carry out

04:19.820 --> 04:20.660
in one of the questions?

04:20.660 --> 04:22.180
What's he used to pin-up?

04:23.140 --> 04:25.140
That's the genus ejection.

04:26.860 --> 04:29.580
Pictures, carcassons,

04:29.580 --> 04:30.940
you don't have an important place

04:30.940 --> 04:32.220
on the information program.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.340
I'm directing the question.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.340
I know.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.340
As to a pin-up.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.340
Sure.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.500
I don't know what he's referring to with a pin-up.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.140
We can all laugh on that one.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.500
But if you go through this,

04:44.500 --> 04:45.820
you'll find...

04:45.820 --> 04:47.940
So that's it, the first time I've seen it.

04:47.940 --> 04:51.220
Here's a pretty detailed suggestion

04:51.220 --> 04:53.980
because of how you can put it through us.

04:56.980 --> 04:58.620
In the anti-communist ideas,

04:58.620 --> 05:02.740
my word for a misjudgment is much, much better

05:02.740 --> 05:06.260
than putting out the 30,000-odd book

05:06.260 --> 05:08.660
written by communist authors as we come out.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.020
Let me just ask my question.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.060
You also notice under advertising media

05:12.060 --> 05:13.700
have billboards and cart-bind.

05:13.700 --> 05:16.420
Really, Senator, when you look at this document,

05:16.420 --> 05:17.820
I, in all seriousness,

05:17.820 --> 05:21.820
you think that this qualified a man to investigate

05:21.820 --> 05:24.820
a multi-million-dollar information agency

05:24.820 --> 05:26.820
in all seriousness, Senator?

05:26.820 --> 05:28.820
Mr. Dersham,

05:28.820 --> 05:30.820
what is the answer to this?

05:30.820 --> 05:32.820
I have a question every time I get fired.

05:32.820 --> 05:36.820
Mr. Dersham, I look at this over.

05:36.820 --> 05:39.820
I don't put it in the slide every time I'm here

05:39.820 --> 05:41.820
with a million more details.

05:41.820 --> 05:44.820
This shows me that this young man

05:44.820 --> 05:48.820
is a good-of-them vacationing,

05:48.820 --> 05:50.820
was giving a great deal of thought

05:50.820 --> 05:52.820
to the information program,

05:52.820 --> 05:54.820
and I might point out, Senator Dersham,

05:54.820 --> 05:55.820
that in your space,

05:55.820 --> 05:56.820
it's going to be quite an eight.

05:56.820 --> 05:57.820
That's not my family's question.

05:57.820 --> 05:58.820
I'm going to answer the question.

05:58.820 --> 05:59.820
I'm going to answer the question.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.820
I'm going to answer your question.

06:01.820 --> 06:02.820
I'm going to answer your question.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.820
In your space,

06:04.820 --> 06:06.820
given investigation,

06:06.820 --> 06:11.820
caused the cancellation of a

06:11.820 --> 06:18.820
ten-million-dollar radio station,

06:18.820 --> 06:20.820
the evidence for us,

06:20.820 --> 06:21.820
the rest could have been built,

06:21.820 --> 06:23.820
for about ten percent,

06:23.820 --> 06:26.820
down outside of the magnetic storm area

06:26.820 --> 06:27.820
with the same results,

06:27.820 --> 06:28.820
given investigation,

06:28.820 --> 06:30.820
regarded to what you may say about this,

06:30.820 --> 06:33.820
this safely-American tax fair,

06:33.820 --> 06:36.820
is a boat's $18 million.

06:36.820 --> 06:38.820
Senator, that's just a matter of fact.

06:38.820 --> 06:40.820
We saw it having this man go into it.

06:40.820 --> 06:43.820
We did not give us the information that RTA and MIT had

06:43.820 --> 06:44.820
endorsed this project.

06:44.820 --> 06:46.820
We did not have any of that in the United States.

06:46.820 --> 06:47.820
Given to its pocket committee,

06:47.820 --> 06:49.820
and I think that I am in favor of our great-grandson.

06:49.820 --> 06:51.820
You're in fact a mess, I'm here.

06:51.820 --> 06:52.820
You're in fact.

06:52.820 --> 06:54.820
I'll be glad to go over the record with you on Monday.

06:54.820 --> 06:56.820
No, you're completely in fact.

06:56.820 --> 06:57.820
Also, do you?

06:57.820 --> 06:59.820
Senator Time has expired.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.820
We did not give us any information.

07:01.820 --> 07:05.820
Senator Potter, you have the floor.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.820
Uh, the chair is facing.

07:07.820 --> 07:08.820
He's going to be getting exploited these years.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.820
I'm sure Senator Potter, he has just a couple of short questions.

07:11.820 --> 07:14.820
Some of the time, we have three or four short questions.

07:14.820 --> 07:15.820
And then, I'll read them.

07:15.820 --> 07:17.820
I do think injustice is...

07:17.820 --> 07:20.820
Every time an officer has been exhibited

07:20.820 --> 07:23.820
by the discussing things entirely out of context.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.820
And to the bad, it's unfair,

07:25.820 --> 07:28.820
and it's so language-so-tu-reason.

07:28.820 --> 07:31.820
And we will assist it to the public-ticket number in the record.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.820
And the positive.

07:33.820 --> 07:34.820
Whenever, of course,

07:34.820 --> 07:37.820
the act you'll call your attention to that now famous automobile.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.820
Right from the...

07:39.820 --> 07:41.820
There's a courthouse in New York,

07:41.820 --> 07:44.820
who on December the 17th,

07:44.820 --> 07:47.820
when I'll be there to yourself,

07:47.820 --> 07:49.820
and Mr. Cohen, Mr. Carr,

07:49.820 --> 07:51.820
and Mr. Hatton,

07:51.820 --> 07:53.820
when Adam, which, out of the justify,

07:53.820 --> 07:55.820
I think, he missed his train three times.

07:55.820 --> 07:58.820
On that day.

07:58.820 --> 08:00.820
He also...

08:00.820 --> 08:03.820
And I don't think this question has been asked.

08:03.820 --> 08:04.820
If it had an anise,

08:04.820 --> 08:07.820
it was asked while I was looking here.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.820
But Mr. Adam testified that...

08:10.820 --> 08:16.820
The conversation was by animated at the time,

08:16.820 --> 08:19.820
to him himself and Mr. Cohen.

08:19.820 --> 08:21.820
He could be justified

08:21.820 --> 08:23.820
that the conversation was concerned.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.820
David Stein and Mr. Cohen testified,

08:25.820 --> 08:27.820
and I'll be you testified,

08:27.820 --> 08:29.820
but the conversation related to General Law.

08:29.820 --> 08:32.820
But every expected of that conversation,

08:32.820 --> 08:34.820
but I wish to address your attention to,

08:34.820 --> 08:36.820
as the statement that Mr. Adam has made,

08:36.820 --> 08:38.820
and I'll be by a quote it's correctly,

08:38.820 --> 08:41.820
after at a later date,

08:41.820 --> 08:43.820
he talked with Mr. Carr,

08:43.820 --> 08:47.820
concerning the animated conversation that he had with Mr. Cohen,

08:47.820 --> 08:50.820
and Mr. Adam stated that he was let out

08:50.820 --> 08:52.820
the middle of the street,

08:52.820 --> 08:56.820
and had to get the cab to get to these people.

08:56.820 --> 08:57.820
Mr. Carr, though,

08:57.820 --> 08:59.820
who do you think you were to do that, Lee?

08:59.820 --> 09:01.820
We did a thing what happens to send him a car to him.

09:01.820 --> 09:04.820
Well, I'm my curiosity.

09:04.820 --> 09:05.820
It's got the best of me.

09:05.820 --> 09:07.820
What did happen to send him a car?

09:07.820 --> 09:10.820
Well, just one minute.

09:10.820 --> 09:11.820
Yeah.

09:11.820 --> 09:20.820
Okay.

09:20.820 --> 09:29.820
I'm sorry, I was just trying to make some...

09:29.820 --> 09:34.820
I'm fine with my wife, my wife, Jim, Jim, and you.

09:34.820 --> 09:37.820
I took him a lot of my questions, and they're very well-taken.

09:37.820 --> 09:39.820
I'm going to be straight away.

09:39.820 --> 09:46.820
The situation, as far as the ride was roughly as far as we...

09:46.820 --> 09:48.820
I arrived at a tunnel,

09:48.820 --> 09:52.820
and I don't know New York City, well enough to tell you about three to the run.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.820
We thought we should turn left,

09:54.820 --> 09:58.820
so it gets Mr. Adam over the neighborhood

09:58.820 --> 10:00.820
so we could make these trains.

10:00.820 --> 10:03.820
I think there was a no left turn sign.

10:03.820 --> 10:08.820
Mr. Cohn asked a placement if we could turn left,

10:08.820 --> 10:13.820
and I believe that he may point to the edge or something he did.

10:13.820 --> 10:18.820
The placement used language which I wouldn't want to repeat here.

10:18.820 --> 10:21.820
In regard to the bad that the road I had,

10:21.820 --> 10:24.820
and I told him to go ahead.

10:24.820 --> 10:27.820
We went on down to the tunnel,

10:27.820 --> 10:29.820
and we got to that.

10:29.820 --> 10:32.820
I was also racing for the...

10:32.820 --> 10:35.820
to get the roller, pick up my bags, get the plane,

10:35.820 --> 10:38.820
and we told him that we could do this,

10:38.820 --> 10:41.820
that he would get out and take a cab,

10:41.820 --> 10:45.820
and go to the depot, and try and prank the takin' me on to the roller,

10:45.820 --> 10:49.820
if we got there, and there was nothing...

10:49.820 --> 10:51.820
I'm not unusual nature about the ride.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.820
We continue to discuss the walking matter, I believe,

10:55.820 --> 10:57.820
almost all the way to the hotel.

10:57.820 --> 11:02.820
Then you had to have a commissioner Adam left the car.

11:02.820 --> 11:04.820
You had no discolour, he would miss the Cohn.

11:04.820 --> 11:07.820
I believe that he'd get the morning miss the Adam,

11:07.820 --> 11:11.820
but the fact that at the entrance of the water,

11:11.820 --> 11:15.820
you were left the car and made quite a hurry.

11:15.820 --> 11:19.820
I mean, I left the car and the hurry,

11:19.820 --> 11:21.820
I think right to age my...

11:21.820 --> 11:22.820
I think it or not.

11:22.820 --> 11:26.820
Somebody, Frank Rory, I believe carried my bus in the hotel,

11:26.820 --> 11:29.820
and one of the things we discussed in the hotel

11:29.820 --> 11:34.820
was the fact that Mr. Cohn would call dinner lost,

11:34.820 --> 11:37.820
and I'm telling him about this kind of situation.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.820
But it's here, time to put on the chair.

11:39.820 --> 11:40.820
Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir,

11:40.820 --> 11:42.820
the morning there was no argument between yourself and Mr. Cohn.

11:42.820 --> 11:44.820
No more trouble, no more not even a movement.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.820
No problem.

11:46.820 --> 11:49.820
All right, send the time again and before I recognize you,

11:49.820 --> 11:51.820
the suggestion, the President and the column,

11:51.820 --> 11:54.820
the chair and elected, when we have this executive testimony released

11:54.820 --> 11:57.820
to the public to have it incorporated in our records,

11:57.820 --> 11:59.820
so I have to be incorporated in the record,

11:59.820 --> 12:01.820
to mark the appropriate exhibit number,

12:01.820 --> 12:03.820
and Ruth, for Mrs. Cohn,

12:03.820 --> 12:07.820
this is in the beginning of the transcript for this action and the session.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.820
And the time is...

12:09.820 --> 12:14.820
Mr. Cohn, and I have just four short questions to complete.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.820
The final of the questions I was asking.

12:16.820 --> 12:20.820
First, with a chair's permission, I've made an observation.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.820
Something said about injustice to Mr. Cohn.

12:22.820 --> 12:24.820
Some of us felt that in...

12:24.820 --> 12:27.820
some of us felt that injustice to Mr. Cohn,

12:27.820 --> 12:32.820
he should be allowed to testify to the hearings in his own defense.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.820
Seems rather paradoxical, isn't it?

12:34.820 --> 12:38.820
We have somebody with apparently as little interest in the proceedings as Mr. Cohn,

12:38.820 --> 12:41.820
and do not plan now to call Mr. Cohn.

12:42.820 --> 12:45.820
By the moment, I have four short questions here.

12:45.820 --> 12:50.820
Did you see Father Cohn on any of the weekends that he had off the fortice?

12:50.820 --> 12:52.820
We looked at the first part of your question.

12:52.820 --> 12:54.820
You looked at our time.

12:54.820 --> 12:58.820
There was no plan for proper conduct in the Father Cohn,

12:58.820 --> 13:02.820
and therefore he would not be justified in taking up the time of the committee,

13:02.820 --> 13:06.820
and he found something which doesn't exist.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.820
If he all thinks he must defend the fact that he worked with the committee,

13:10.820 --> 13:15.820
I just don't think that's necessary.

13:15.820 --> 13:20.820
Number two, you said that, and I see maybe the weekend.

13:23.820 --> 13:24.820
I don't think so.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.820
I saw him down at the fort.

13:26.820 --> 13:29.820
This was the day of the day.

13:29.820 --> 13:31.820
The dance was...

13:31.820 --> 13:35.820
The war airbates was right next to the fort, this morning evening.

13:35.820 --> 13:39.820
Well, you don't think that he is of enough interest and he's participating to come here,

13:40.820 --> 13:44.820
and testify that his name is important, and that's in the proceeding.

13:44.820 --> 13:48.820
I think it's important, but I think it's more important for some of her slamming,

13:48.820 --> 13:50.820
some of the things we're used to, you know, I'm a fan.

13:50.820 --> 13:57.820
Tell me how come you got the protocol advisor, the member of the party,

13:57.820 --> 14:03.820
and the guy at the hearing, I think that there are many witnesses who could be called.

14:03.820 --> 14:06.820
If you and I want to name them off, we can say that's the name of...

14:06.820 --> 14:09.820
I don't know how many times I've been talking about private time for a great many days.

14:09.820 --> 14:12.820
Well, maybe we can talk about private time in the terminal too.

14:12.820 --> 14:16.820
Well, the next question is, I'm sorry, I think, did you do any work with him on these weekends?

14:16.820 --> 14:17.820
No, I didn't.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.820
So, it was on the point of my slam.

14:19.820 --> 14:23.820
I assume Roy Cohen told you that China is getting his path and working on the weekends.

14:23.820 --> 14:24.820
Is that right?

14:24.820 --> 14:27.820
I knew that he was working weekends.

14:27.820 --> 14:31.820
All you knew about how he spent these weekends and is what Mr. Cohen told you?

14:31.820 --> 14:32.820
No, is that right?

14:32.820 --> 14:33.820
No.

14:34.820 --> 14:35.820
That's what I know.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.820
I know for the question.

14:42.820 --> 14:44.820
Here I had one announcement to make before we reach that.

14:44.820 --> 14:48.820
I had been advised by the Sergeant's arms of the Senate.

14:48.820 --> 14:52.820
At the arrow left, which is going to take place Monday at 10.01,

14:52.820 --> 14:59.820
is not going to include the House and Senate Office of the Troids who come here will know

15:00.820 --> 15:03.820
that we can proceed with our customer business and that's arrow left is not introduced.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.820
The Senate reaches the Senate office with the chairman.

15:05.820 --> 15:06.820
Mr. Chairman.

15:06.820 --> 15:07.820
Mr. Chairman.

15:07.820 --> 15:08.820
Mr. Chairman.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.820
I'd like my round of applause.

15:10.820 --> 15:14.820
By the way, I should announce that Mr. Cohen's behalf re-inverts from General Kelly.

15:14.820 --> 15:17.820
And your department has been invented.

15:17.820 --> 15:18.820
Mr. Chairman.

15:18.820 --> 15:19.820
Mr. Chairman.

15:19.820 --> 15:23.820
I don't want to be excused from national guard training or anything else.

15:23.820 --> 15:26.820
I would like my regular round before the afternoon is over.

15:27.820 --> 15:33.820
So ask some questions which might develop true facts about some of the things which Mr. Jackson said here this afternoon.

15:35.820 --> 15:37.820
As well, we have already been sent to our unit.

15:37.820 --> 15:39.820
He's on the front.

15:39.820 --> 15:41.820
We had agreed to reach that at 430.

15:41.820 --> 15:44.820
He made his show say this month and I'm sure the press will deal with the service.

15:44.820 --> 15:48.820
The document prepared the Mr. Shine has now been released and it's entire.

15:48.820 --> 15:52.820
And as the man who has been the right to the right to the American act,

15:52.820 --> 15:56.820
let me say that it is not indeed a losing piece of work.

15:56.820 --> 15:57.820
I read it over.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.820
It has some very worthwhile suggestions, Mr. Cohen.

16:00.820 --> 16:01.820
I agree to that.

16:01.820 --> 16:04.820
And you may ask my section to share to our Monday about that document.

16:04.820 --> 16:06.820
The General recess will come.

16:06.820 --> 16:08.820
In the department.

16:08.820 --> 16:09.820
That's correct.

16:09.820 --> 16:10.820
Bob.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.820
Thank you.

16:12.820 --> 16:14.820
You have just heard Chairman Mullen out.

16:14.820 --> 16:19.820
The next session of a hearing will be on Monday at 10AM.

16:19.820 --> 16:26.820
The ABC Television Network is bringing you the complete hearing into the McCarthy Army Controvers.

16:26.820 --> 16:33.820
The session is breaking out.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.820
There's no McCarthy stand on your behind committee table.

16:36.820 --> 16:46.820
So, under McCarthy talking with Jack Lava, the associated text, Jack developing a little further information on this inquiry and on the witness and the testimony that was given today.

16:46.820 --> 17:05.820
Mr. Jenkins is telling the reporters there at the committee table about the announcement just made by Senator Muntson, the effect that Mr. Roy Cohen has been granted a postponement for an indefinite period of time from the National Guard training that he has both started tomorrow.

17:05.820 --> 17:09.820
The request was made by the committee.

17:09.820 --> 17:15.820
Mr. Jenkins, thank you for moving out of the caucus room.

17:15.820 --> 17:18.820
It's made clear.

17:18.820 --> 17:28.820
Cluster of reporters around Senator Potter and Mr. Jenkins.

17:28.820 --> 17:34.820
Senator Carl Muntson is also announced that there will be a nationwide air raid test on Monday morning at 10 o'clock.

17:34.820 --> 17:51.820
However, that does not affect the working to this committee, the Senate and the House of Representatives and their various establishments on Capitol Hill and Washington, D.C. are an autonomous portion of the city of Washington, D.C.

17:51.820 --> 17:59.820
The matter of fact, they're so autonomous, they have their own police force, the separate and distinct from the Metropolitan Police Force, Washington, D.C.

17:59.820 --> 18:06.820
They're good spectators filing from the Senate caucus room after the afternoon session.

18:16.820 --> 18:24.820
They are the Capitol police moving in to make the way free for the spectators to file comfortably out of the committee room without just the colleagues there.

18:24.820 --> 18:31.820
This is Joseph McCotty leaving the committee room with their husband, the senator from Wisconsin.

18:31.820 --> 18:46.820
The other sub-dripes and rags with a brief summary of the testimony of this session today.

19:01.820 --> 19:15.820
This afternoon, Senator Joseph McCotty was under examination by the members of the committee itself and also by Mr. Wells, who was the counsel for the Army.

19:15.820 --> 19:34.820
In the testimony of this afternoon, it was brought out that the front-out time Jackson, the number of telephone calls were made between Cribe Chin and Cohn and General Rebirth and about the commission for Mr. Chin of the alleged commission for Mr. Chin.

19:34.820 --> 19:38.820
Jackson, I raised the question whether the subcommittee paid for these long-distance calls.

19:38.820 --> 19:45.820
Jackson said many workshops to the subcommittee, Senator McCotty, said that Chin may have re-emburced the subcommittee for these telephone calls.

19:45.820 --> 19:56.820
Later, Senator Jackson brought up a six-page pamphlet which was prepared by Mr. Chin, prior to his going with the committee and was used in the voice of America investigation.

19:57.820 --> 20:07.820
The pamphlet is supposedly two-served as one of the criteria for securing the services of Mr. Chin as an investigator for the permanent investigating subcommittee.

20:07.820 --> 20:15.820
Now here is Gunner Back talking with Senator Carman.

20:16.820 --> 20:21.820
Gunner Back speaking from the Senate Carcasseroom, a term of months, one or two questions.

20:21.820 --> 20:29.820
What how will this document of Mr. Shind on a plan for the information program come back into this thing?

20:29.820 --> 20:30.820
Well, it's come back Monday.

20:30.820 --> 20:36.820
I doubt it as well. I think that was just a sort of a map-and-day diversion which we had on Friday afternoon.

20:36.820 --> 20:42.820
Actually, I read the document over during the time that they were discussing it and it made a lot of sense.

20:42.820 --> 20:49.820
The reason that the man who wrote the voice of America Bill, the reason it sounded kind of funny on the radio, was that you wrote the voice of America Bill?

20:49.820 --> 20:54.820
Yes, that's correct. And a lot of the things that he mentions are being used in different sections of the world.

20:54.820 --> 21:02.820
And I think the idea of having a coordinated solid feeling of free men around the world makes for not a sense.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.820
So then here's the view in general approval of this document, so that's the full.

21:05.820 --> 21:11.820
Well, I would say the right, a proof of that at the standpoint of its contenting is some creative and some constructive suggestions.

21:11.820 --> 21:14.820
Like all the other ideas about the rights of America, they cost money.

21:14.820 --> 21:17.820
Well, I was looking at how possibly could have modern doubt every...

21:17.820 --> 21:21.820
I was able to pick up the last part of Mr. Cohen came in and said that he thought that there ought to be more discussion on that.

21:21.820 --> 21:28.820
Well, he thought of, if we should ask some more questions to bring the facts out, the Senate ejection was reading with necessarily out of context.

21:28.820 --> 21:35.820
He didn't do it deliberately, but along document he picked a word here in a sentence there which out of context didn't sound very sensible.

21:35.820 --> 21:44.820
But if you relate it all to the first three paragraphs which were followed by a Cohen, after which you made about 20 or 30 suggestions, then they have a great deal more significant than mine.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.820
Well, I don't know if they'll bring up the specific questions.

21:46.820 --> 21:47.820
Yeah, I think you don't do that.

21:47.820 --> 21:51.820
Have we got to have our television people know we serve this community and gunner back?

21:51.820 --> 21:55.820
Being in a Mellow Mood on Friday, we didn't necessarily execute it.

21:55.820 --> 21:56.820
We are charging.

21:56.820 --> 21:59.820
We're charging him with bringing some of the blenders in here.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.820
Just to create a nice television.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.820
So, this is your figure, sir? That's my figure, sir.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.820
Hello, I'll tell you a few things. I'm going to keep these things going for six more weeks.

22:06.820 --> 22:09.820
Well, with a set like that, we probably would have whatever stuff.

22:09.820 --> 22:13.820
One more thing, this is what I'm going to tell me about the ultra-forks at for the terminus.

22:13.820 --> 22:16.820
I can tell you that Mr. Wells told me at the beginning of the session today.

22:16.820 --> 22:19.820
I said to one side, he said he would like to have the free session a little early today.

22:19.820 --> 22:21.820
I'm going to be soon to get back to Boston.

22:21.820 --> 22:24.820
And he said, you'll be interested in knowing it as far as I can for a few.

22:24.820 --> 22:27.820
We should be out of here by Wednesday or Thursday of next week.

22:27.820 --> 22:31.820
And since he and the main will be the person asking the questions from Nalan,

22:31.820 --> 22:34.820
I give you that as a pretty good process.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.820
Oh, I thank you very much. I'm going to tell you this a few more days.

22:36.820 --> 22:37.820
All right, Gunner.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.820
We'd love to have you with us.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.820
It looks very valid and very well.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.820
Well, I deny everything.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.820
We've been Gunner's back. I've been talking to Chairman Carl Muntz,

22:46.820 --> 22:48.820
speaking from the time of the time of the time.

22:48.820 --> 22:51.820
That's why I'd like to once again, some years at this time.

22:51.820 --> 22:58.820
There is a chart for Senator McCarthy brought into the committee room with the start of his direct examination
