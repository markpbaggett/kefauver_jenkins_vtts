00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
The Washington ABC radio brings you and on the scene broadcast with the Senate investigation

00:10.640 --> 00:15.080
into the controversy between Senator McCarthy and the United States Army.

00:15.080 --> 00:20.920
This is John Edwards reporting from the caucus room and the Senate office building on Capitol

00:20.920 --> 00:21.920
Hill.

00:22.760 --> 00:30.360
Where the afternoon session in this day of the hearings and the controversy is ready

00:30.360 --> 00:34.000
to begin or should be beginning in a very few minutes.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Members of the Senate subcommittee investigating the contentors here.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
We're getting the contentors here.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.640
We're after the lunch period and I saw Senator Gorshack of Idaho, the so-called seventh member

00:47.640 --> 00:52.600
of the subcommittee appointed to replace Senator McCarthy.

00:52.600 --> 01:01.080
When McCarthy stepped down to the sidelines for the duration of the inquiry, Senator Gorshack

01:01.080 --> 01:04.640
came into the room just a few minutes ago and has taken his seat.

01:04.640 --> 01:11.920
He is the senator from Idaho, Senator Simonton, a Democrat of Missouri, as just entered,

01:11.920 --> 01:13.920
is coming to the witness table.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.920
A few of the principals are already there.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.920
Let's see, over on the witness stand.

01:19.920 --> 01:26.920
Yes, Secretary of the Army Stevens has taken his seat up to witness stand.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.920
Mr. Stevens has been on the stand for six consecutive days.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.920
We could go today on Thursday when the hearings opened.

01:34.920 --> 01:40.920
He read along prepared statements through the subcommittee.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.920
He's been beginning on the following day of Friday.

01:43.920 --> 01:48.920
And then after the weekend recess, again on Monday through the end Wednesday, he's on the

01:48.920 --> 01:52.920
stand and supposedly would conclude his testimony this morning.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.920
Or I should say, the cost examination to which he has been projected.

01:56.920 --> 02:05.920
However, while the council, Ray Jenkins, has completed his testimony, or completed his examination.

02:06.920 --> 02:14.920
And while the other senators have completed theirs, Senator McCley, he still has some questions that he wants to ask.

02:14.920 --> 02:19.920
Now, there's a little noise at the entrance to the hearing room.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.920
And yes, it's private.

02:23.920 --> 02:34.920
G David Schein has entered and has made his first appearance in the committee room and the caucus room since the beginning of these hearings.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.920
The photographer's and reporters are crowded around.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.920
He's standing very tall.

02:40.920 --> 02:49.920
Boy, it's two or three standing looking very impassively over the entire group, saying nothing.

02:49.920 --> 03:03.920
Schein is the former unpaid aide to the McCarthy subcommittee, who is the subject of this, so much of this controversy, you know.

03:03.920 --> 03:23.920
The charges that Senator McCarthy is subcommittee council, Roy Cohn, and his executive director, Francis Carr, exited an undue pressure to, uh, or exited undue pressure to, uh, get preferential treatment for private Schein.

03:23.920 --> 03:29.920
The western private Schein has been most recently at Camp Gordon, near Augusta, in Georgia.

03:29.920 --> 03:36.920
Only a few miles away from the Augusta National Golf Club, where a president and I had an order vacation, totally a week ago.

03:36.920 --> 03:44.920
He was brought back to Washington, put on temporary duty at Fortenmeyer, outside Washington.

03:44.920 --> 03:53.920
Uh, temporary duty for the duration of these hearings to be made available to the Senate subcommittee for questioning if they so wish.

03:53.920 --> 04:01.920
Yesterday, one so much testimony came up in connection with, uh, private Schein.

04:01.920 --> 04:06.920
Certain items were supposedly out of the Inspector General's report.

04:06.920 --> 04:29.920
Uh, about certain things which the Army did to, you might say, cuddle private Schein while he was a rookie, because of that it was insisted that Schein be given the permission to attend the hearing, uh, the tend, the hearing if he so wish.

04:29.920 --> 04:40.920
And, uh, private Schein, uh, last night sent word, uh, that he would not attend the hearing unless he was requested.

04:40.920 --> 04:50.920
So, just informed here by one of my colleagues that Ray Jenkins, the subcommittee council, who came into the room and took his seat while I was talking,

04:50.920 --> 04:56.920
that Ray Jenkins, the council, says that private Schein is here to testify this afternoon.

04:56.920 --> 05:04.920
So, that will mean that we will very likely have a little activity during this afternoon session.

05:04.920 --> 05:14.920
Certain atmosphere of anticipation about the place right now, right at the moment all in the, in the eyes of the many photographers.

05:14.920 --> 05:19.920
Uh, next.

05:19.920 --> 05:30.920
So, let's crowd it around several of the principals involved now that they've left private Schein, seated directly in front of me, where I am sitting just a few feet away.

05:30.920 --> 05:43.920
In fact, is Mr. Drew H. Drew H. Drew H. The assistant secretary of the, uh, of defense assistant secretary of defense, who has become one of the principals in this controversial next semester.

05:43.920 --> 05:53.920
Mr. Hensel is his special attorney, Mr. Frederick Bryan of New York, several, uh, officers from Le Penne gone to the side.

05:53.920 --> 06:03.920
Another little commotion here, Senator McCarty has just entered the committee room, shaking hands with private Schein and the impassive face.

06:03.920 --> 06:22.920
The private has now opened into a big smile. The photographers have left their, have left some of the other principals involved and have moved, uh, moved around the private and, uh, around the senator.

06:22.920 --> 06:31.920
Senator McCarty is now, uh, Senator McCarty is now taking his seat,

06:31.920 --> 06:42.920
seat which he has at the long witness table. My colleague Gunner Back sends me an old to say that there's a lot of confusion out there is to just where private Schein will sit that there is no place for him.

06:42.920 --> 06:54.920
Uh, Secretary of the Army Stevens is supposed to testify, uh, a completed testimony and, uh, apparently Mr. Schein is to testify.

07:31.920 --> 07:46.920
Oh, you heard Senator Montsay that they were waiting to see if they had worked in the senate as to whether they would have to leave for a word call apparently they've had the word, are going ahead with the afternoon hearing this time.

07:46.920 --> 08:01.920
The question is those to whether private Schein, if he is to testify, to testify immediately or whether they will wait until Secretary of the Army Stevens has completed his testimony. Mr. Stevens is still sitting at the witness table however,

08:01.920 --> 08:19.920
with his, uh, special counsel, uh, Joseph Wells of Boston sitting at his side, and, uh, private Schein is standing near one end of the, uh, press and radio table.

08:19.920 --> 08:27.920
I say one end, I'm at one end of it which is, uh, which is right at the side of the committee table.

08:27.920 --> 08:37.920
Private Schein is at the other end near the entrance, who is, uh, they caught this room I hardly seem for a few moments, so so many people have crowded around him.

08:37.920 --> 08:44.920
Taking a seat at the table, smiling a little bit to some of the people who are sitting there.

08:44.920 --> 08:54.920
I just saw Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Democratic Washington, a member of the subcommittee entered the room and looked around, saw Private Schein.

08:54.920 --> 09:06.920
He did what you'd call a double take, he was pretty much surprised to see, so I imagine that the private disappearance here this afternoon is definitely, uh, a surprise to certain members of the subcommittee.

09:06.920 --> 09:28.920
At any rate the word was last night, after the hearing last evening, Private Schein appeared on Capitol Hill, uh, spent a, an hour with members of the subcommittee staff and it was said afterwards that he would be available for, uh, testifying a very short time.

09:28.920 --> 09:35.920
Let's turn to the witness chair and hour, or to the, uh, chairman, seat, now, where Senator Month has diffracted for order.

09:58.920 --> 10:11.920
Well, uh, even though Senator Month has wrapped his, uh, his gavvold and called the committee in this, uh, it's session for the afternoon session of this six day in the hearing,

10:11.920 --> 10:15.920
still nothing to indicate that they're going to start immediately.

10:15.920 --> 10:27.920
Cloud Steel will around Private Schein, Private David Schein, down at, uh, the other end of this radio and television table of art, about, uh, I should say three feet away from where I'm sitting.

10:27.920 --> 10:36.920
Um, couple of photographers, one newsreel photographer who just climbed up on the table, who, take a picture, looking down at Schein, who's sitting there for a quietly.

10:36.920 --> 10:41.920
There's three other photographers that go together around again.

10:41.920 --> 10:48.920
So people often ask the question, uh, speaking of the steel photographers and pictures, that is, in particular, the people who take just the one shot.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.920
Why do they take so many pictures all the time?

10:51.920 --> 10:56.920
And if you ask a photographer that, he will say to you, well, you're a reporter, you take lots of notes.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.920
Yes, you have to answer. Yes, I do. Well, you don't use all your notes to you.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.920
Well, we don't use all our pictures, but we have them in case we need them.

11:04.920 --> 11:13.920
Uh, I'm told that, uh, some of the reporters who try to say something to Private Schein have just had a nod and smile.

11:13.920 --> 11:20.920
We absolutely make no comment at all to, uh, any correspondents, anyone, who's brought it around him.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.920
He has both of these pictures, so I was continuing to post some.

11:24.920 --> 11:34.920
And of course, he didn't post that one picture with a big smile with Senator McCarthy a few minutes ago.

11:34.920 --> 11:42.920
One of the big issues of this, uh, well, let's go back to Chairman Munt now, who is called to order.

11:42.920 --> 11:52.920
Now, again, that the guests in the committee, who are here at the place, here at the committee, we're happy to have you be here.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.920
We asked for only one thing.

11:54.920 --> 12:02.920
Sometimes the committee will be trained to make any manifestations that will prove all far different to the already encores of the hearing.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.920
Here we all have a message announced.

12:05.920 --> 12:10.920
This written in the column, definitely, was submitted about the rule or not.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.920
A Senator is concluding in the meeting.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.920
And that's a little bit in debt.

12:15.920 --> 12:20.920
And so we think we must try anyway because sometimes it takes us wrong for a Senator to conclude the speech,

12:20.920 --> 12:23.920
as opposed to go around and go around with questions.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.920
So I have a comment on what you proceed.

12:27.920 --> 12:33.920
Chairman, and the President makes this up to come out.

12:33.920 --> 12:40.920
Secretary Steven has been on the business stand as I recall now from six days.

12:40.920 --> 12:50.920
It is evidence that he is somewhat exhausted, yet committee views the out of deference to the Secretary.

12:50.920 --> 13:02.920
And to the fact that he has been subjected to an examination and cross-examination for such an inorganously long time, in view of that fact.

13:02.920 --> 13:11.920
In view of the fact that he is the wish of the committee that he questions with his own easy afternoon.

13:11.920 --> 13:21.920
They were born to with respect to the full of drought and introduced with the Secretary and private shine of should be settled.

13:21.920 --> 13:31.920
And that's an in-view of the fact that Mr. Wresch, not only is I understand it compares with us.

13:31.920 --> 13:40.920
In our decision to have the Secretary stand as I, but the question that it views over the reasons of our state,

13:40.920 --> 13:51.920
we have decided to ask Mr. Steven's to stand as I, and now introduce who will respect to the full of drought on November 17th.

13:51.920 --> 14:08.920
Mr. Wresch, I have been with my understanding and I desire to emphasize this that no witnesses belong with respect to any of the circumstances with reference to the taking of us pictures,

14:09.920 --> 14:20.920
or to the picture in your do's as an exhibit shall be examined or caused by any member of the committee or any council,

14:20.920 --> 14:30.920
on any matter, staying with respect to the photographs, the circumstances under which it was taken, and the introduction of the photograph I met,

14:30.920 --> 14:36.920
and I may, with all these efforts, to the members of this committee who have your full objections,

14:36.920 --> 14:41.920
you may even remember to give the committee the opportunity to ask for the resolution for the vote of all of us.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.920
And you may vote.

14:43.920 --> 14:53.920
I suggest one modification in a witness who steps aside is subject to cross examination with respect to his creditors.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.920
On any issue.

14:59.920 --> 15:09.920
I assume that I, I, I, I, I go when his fellow metrics are gone, that his one of the views of the controversial and the ascendant of a fellow,

15:09.920 --> 15:15.920
I have given this that just be a tougher subject to be in fact.

15:15.920 --> 15:20.920
Mr. Gentlemen, you can take that to these relevant line of trust and deletion.

15:50.920 --> 15:58.920
I am the one who has a long time to do in common with the, I am tired of what I left, I am very tired of,

15:58.920 --> 16:00.920
and I will take on a case.

16:00.920 --> 16:05.920
I don't know, I don't know, there is a any other reason, and I would say it's highly unfair.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.920
It's a great deal to let us know that I was left in the middle of our life.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.920
Mr. Chairman.

16:11.920 --> 16:16.920
I do not make any such request, Mr. Steven,

16:16.920 --> 16:21.920
just wanted you to make it entirely clear that he's a member of the Army,

16:21.920 --> 16:28.920
that he was all followed as thinking that he required you to while was told by Mr. Jenkins this morning,

16:28.920 --> 16:35.920
that he do a simple intention to go into the picture incidents almost of the opening of this morning's session.

16:35.920 --> 16:41.920
I then gave my consent to that case, that consent Mr. Jenkins did all the same.

16:41.920 --> 16:47.920
I am not a man from the back that's putting you in that test of only on-mobiles.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.920
Mr. Steven's a little rest of automatic.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.920
You were not, however, permissive you have for a quarter.

16:55.920 --> 17:04.920
You were pretty clever to go on rather than seeing any signal flying so up of any lack of courage on his part.

17:04.920 --> 17:11.920
I think it is clear better for that if the priority won't go on, but I have that as is possible.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.920
I am prepared to have the rest.

17:13.920 --> 17:21.920
I received a decision that I have seen, that it should be fair enough to finish this morning in an executive session,

17:21.920 --> 17:25.920
what is the title of the fall, the procedures that I have now seen you.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.920
Mr. Chairman, that's done by a local, but I think it was them, that's definitely me.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.920
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, that's the term.

17:33.920 --> 17:42.920
There's only one race on earth while we should break the usual rule for falling.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.920
That is the whipping for any time.

17:45.920 --> 17:51.920
The rules that he wants their rest, he should have.

17:51.920 --> 17:57.920
I may say that I have no personal central place for this particular whipping.

17:58.920 --> 18:11.920
He has initiated the charges, asking for the wrecking of the reputations of jobs of my students, top men and my comedians.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.920
I have many questions to ask him about that.

18:15.920 --> 18:22.920
Now, to break this up to Mr. Chairman, if I like to rule the broad doctors,

18:22.920 --> 18:30.920
sometimes a goal would be I think a mistake and a mistake in the secretary wants the rest,

18:30.920 --> 18:32.920
and that's no such a great outcome.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.920
I find it a life on myself, please.

18:35.920 --> 18:40.920
And that's the last thing I want the rest, I don't think we should just mess with the rest.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.920
If it's very clear, if it's very clear, as you take down the responsibility,

18:43.920 --> 18:49.920
the state is able to use the secretary's team to turn the rules,

18:49.920 --> 18:53.920
and for our rest, by having been the deputy questioning for a long time,

18:53.920 --> 18:58.920
secondly, the rule until the hearing and violence of the council is put on the evidence

18:58.920 --> 19:02.920
in the order that he needs to be that and to this.

19:02.920 --> 19:07.920
And the fact that this is the number one thing you can look at this time,

19:07.920 --> 19:10.920
and that you're going to look at this time.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.920
Well, I don't want to take up too much time with this,

19:14.920 --> 19:20.920
but let me say this, that the rule was, the rule of the doctors was

19:20.920 --> 19:24.920
that whenever a witness was on the span,

19:24.920 --> 19:25.920
there was all of it.

19:25.920 --> 19:30.920
10 minutes, the rich man availed him until the witness was testimony,

19:30.920 --> 19:31.920
haven't completed.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.920
Now, to break out his testimony,

19:35.920 --> 19:39.920
for other witnesses, I think it's a complete violation of my rule,

19:39.920 --> 19:41.920
may I say no to Chairman?

19:41.920 --> 19:43.920
May I say no?

19:43.920 --> 19:45.920
No, may I say no?

19:45.920 --> 19:50.920
That one of the rich who has been sharing the rules of my life

19:50.920 --> 19:53.920
is currently the repair of the committee.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.920
The point's gone in my place, but if I have the assurance,

19:56.920 --> 20:02.920
that there's been no change in the ground rule during the hearing.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.920
A whole other way, I would not have asked no one myself in the committee.

20:06.920 --> 20:10.920
And I just think it's much a deck of the rules.

20:10.920 --> 20:14.920
And I think I can do, there's a reason I have to be asked

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
to come to play.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.920
There is my answer to the answer to this, because I think many parts,

20:19.920 --> 20:21.920
I am talking to one of the best lawyers,

20:21.920 --> 20:24.920
who can't hear it, which is completely fair, I think,

20:24.920 --> 20:25.880
and I just want to bring the

20:25.880 --> 20:27.920
ga to the committee.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
I can't wait to ask you that.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.920
I'm on the left.

20:31.920 --> 20:32.920
And then may I say in this,

20:32.920 --> 20:34.920
will the committee argue every like them,

20:34.920 --> 20:36.920
or will I say this,

20:36.920 --> 20:40.920
that you are changing the ground rules for the middle of the day,

20:40.920 --> 20:43.920
we're agreeing about to do this.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.920
I would do that if Mr. Stevens is tired of hearing.

20:47.920 --> 20:52.920
Otherwise, we have a man who is the most brilliant charge

20:52.920 --> 20:56.920
to use the reputation of the integrity of the House.

20:56.920 --> 21:00.920
The micromanian should not be allowed to step down merely

21:00.920 --> 21:03.920
for the purpose of removing his fortunes

21:03.920 --> 21:06.920
of discussing the matter of comfort.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.920
What about the board?

21:08.920 --> 21:12.920
May the chair take you left the chair of the president

21:12.920 --> 21:15.920
and every union to come and meet that for him.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.920
It is not done in the form of a council that

21:18.920 --> 21:21.920
secretary would even do properly to dismiss from the president,

21:21.920 --> 21:24.920
so he'd be deprived of all the rights

21:24.920 --> 21:27.920
and driving the members of the House to ask the question

21:27.920 --> 21:29.920
and he wants to ask, and the reason

21:29.920 --> 21:32.920
is that the ten-minute rule is the all questions are discussed.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.920
This was the chair of the point of order.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.920
This was the chair of the point.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.920
This is the area that is in the right way.

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
We have an agenda.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
I'm going to break it down.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.920
The chair of the House, and that's an agenda.

21:43.920 --> 21:44.920
The committee needs a one.

21:44.920 --> 21:45.920
And I do it with my members.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
I'm going to do an agenda.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.920
On this chair, I'm on my make-up board of orders.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.920
My understanding that the reason why

21:53.920 --> 21:56.920
evidence is not of the effect of money,

21:56.920 --> 22:00.920
is not of the requested by the council,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.920
is because of the incidents that occurred on Monday,

22:03.920 --> 22:07.920
with reference to a photograph that has been given to the council.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.920
I assume that it's always in order,

22:09.920 --> 22:15.920
in order to properly question the witness in this case,

22:15.920 --> 22:18.920
that is evidence is introduced,

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
which was not as represented,

22:20.920 --> 22:23.920
that we have a right to have that information before the witness.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.920
Finally steps down from the witness back.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.920
I've seen no change in the rules,

22:28.920 --> 22:33.920
and I assume that a point of order properly lies against any subject.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.920
In that, you should step ahead to suffice,

22:36.920 --> 22:38.920
not necessarily because of where,

22:38.920 --> 22:40.920
I would insist regardless by the system,

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
as you know from the beginning,

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
and this chair of the forefathers,

22:43.920 --> 22:45.920
which is the case.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
The council has the rules,

22:46.920 --> 22:48.920
and the chairman has the rules,

22:48.920 --> 22:53.920
and the chairman has the right to have the right to have the right to work.

22:53.920 --> 23:00.920
Chairman, one of the reasons why I might appear to be insistent now,

23:00.920 --> 23:03.920
is that I don't like the self-president.

23:03.920 --> 23:09.920
I stepped off the committee and for our right,

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
after the curtain of Brown,

23:11.920 --> 23:14.920
and the Brown rule of the Court reached to by many,

23:14.920 --> 23:15.920
and the committee agreed to that,

23:15.920 --> 23:17.920
and I have to leave you an office,

23:17.920 --> 23:20.920
after the long as we followed all of the Brown rules,

23:20.920 --> 23:23.920
I will not act as a member of the committee.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.920
One of the Brown rules was that, today,

23:25.920 --> 23:27.920
the witness was on the stand.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.920
Everyone on the committee,

23:30.920 --> 23:32.920
counsel for all parties and turn in,

23:32.920 --> 23:35.920
would have an opportunity to exhaust their examination.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.920
Before he left the stand,

23:37.920 --> 23:40.920
that is the rule.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.920
Now, if there is something of a minimum importance

23:43.920 --> 23:45.920
for all of the witnesses,

23:45.920 --> 23:47.920
or if I say the secretary has had good underweigh

23:47.920 --> 23:51.920
Mr. Chairman, I think that we're setting a dangerous precedent.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.920
And let me ask you this, Mr. Chairman.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.920
I understand now that you intend to put on albums about

23:57.920 --> 24:01.920
a picture of Mr. Stevens and Mr. Shine.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.920
Could I ask our all of the pictures?

24:03.920 --> 24:07.920
Could I have a whole year from the military

24:07.920 --> 24:09.920
photographers available?

24:09.920 --> 24:11.920
Did not have the other reason why we did not

24:11.920 --> 24:21.920
attend that sessiontoventry season.

24:21.920 --> 24:31.920
At Tuesday I say goodbye.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
Jennifer I repeat,

24:33.920 --> 24:36.020
it is justœ y ł

24:36.020 --> 24:38.520
l

24:38.520 --> 24:40.520
a

24:40.520 --> 24:43.520
25% of the hearing is gone.

24:43.520 --> 24:49.520
So far we haven't done anything.

24:49.520 --> 24:53.520
Well, Mr. Moudejo is ready for the recording.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.520
Mr. Chairman, I'm in the cardiac.

24:55.520 --> 24:59.520
Mr. Chairman, where I say this,

24:59.520 --> 25:02.520
I am going to leave it up to the judgment of council.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.520
I will withdraw any objections and leave it up to the judgment of council.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.520
I don't think we're about to leave it in proceed.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.520
We're going to leave testimony.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.520
I don't need any.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.520
Get your consent secretary of defense.

25:12.520 --> 25:15.520
There's no doubt in the council's role.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.520
Chairman, I desire to call up the first witness.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.520
I have a C David Jack.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.520
I have a child.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.520
Whoa!

25:29.520 --> 25:33.520
By the shine, call of the witness then.

25:34.520 --> 25:37.520
Secretary of the Army Stevens has stepped aside.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.520
Mr. Shine who is sitting at one end of the radio press table

25:40.520 --> 25:43.520
is moving slowly through the crowd.

25:43.520 --> 25:48.520
Now weeding his way slowly up to the witness stand,

25:48.520 --> 25:54.520
smiling at one of the reporters whom he recognized.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.520
Now ready to take his seat and we'll turn back to Mr. Jenkins

25:58.520 --> 26:02.520
who is ready to swear him in.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.520
I'll get you guys to the radio press table.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.520
Excuse me.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.520
Excuse me.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.520
Excuse me.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.520
Copyrights, D.B.D.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.520
Will you please state your name in the fall?

26:18.520 --> 26:19.520
Sure.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.520
Our David Shine, sir.

26:21.520 --> 26:25.520
Where are you now, station private shines?

26:25.520 --> 26:28.520
An station that bought my order.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.520
You were in the army?

26:30.520 --> 26:32.520
I'm sorry.

26:32.520 --> 26:36.520
Mr. Shine, I want to make this statement to you at this time.

26:36.520 --> 26:39.520
I think it is proper.

26:39.520 --> 26:46.520
The inquiry of you at this time will be in time the one-subject only.

26:46.520 --> 26:54.520
If you are asked any questions with respect to any other issue or controversy in this fall,

26:54.520 --> 27:00.520
in this controversy, I respectfully ask you not to answer the live cell of time

27:00.520 --> 27:02.520
the interpolish objection.

27:02.520 --> 27:07.520
The inquiry is directed to a full-of-graphed,

27:07.520 --> 27:10.520
a legitimate taken-off use,

27:10.520 --> 27:16.520
secretaries, demons, and law-per-touch others.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.520
Where were you?

27:19.520 --> 27:21.520
Turn the phone, ask my order.

27:21.520 --> 27:25.520
In Port of Order, I make it in the nature of a Port of Order.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.520
I should like to ask the same, as Council's winner,

27:29.520 --> 27:32.520
the same, that will proceed with the witness,

27:32.520 --> 27:37.520
whether he has been advised of his rights to have Council President,

27:37.520 --> 27:41.520
and if he desires to have Council President cast this time.

27:41.520 --> 27:47.520
Here is the end of my way to the Council, finally, and certainly to look at that.

27:47.520 --> 27:52.520
This time, do you understand that if it is your constitutional rights,

27:52.520 --> 27:57.520
and if you're right, according to the rules of this committee,

27:57.520 --> 28:00.520
permanent and subcommittee,

28:00.520 --> 28:07.520
that you have the rights to have Council President to advise you from time to time during the course of your examination?

28:07.520 --> 28:08.520
Will the...

28:08.520 --> 28:12.520
do you desire to obey yourself of that right?

28:12.520 --> 28:14.520
I have no counsel with you, sir.

28:14.520 --> 28:26.520
Do you desire Council with you for the purpose of conferring and receiving his advice during the inquiry on this particular subject?

28:26.520 --> 28:32.520
I believe I can answer the questions regarding this particular subject without counsel, sir.

28:32.520 --> 28:41.520
Please say to where you were on November 17, 1953.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.520
What day was that, sir?

28:43.520 --> 28:51.520
November 17, and to call to your mind specifically what I have is my mind.

28:51.520 --> 28:59.520
The day you allegedly were photographed with the Secretary of the Army and perhaps others.

28:59.520 --> 29:03.520
I was the 46th Majority Service.

29:03.520 --> 29:10.520
Please tell a committee of whether or not you were photographed on that day together with others.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.520
I was there.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.520
Under what circumstances?

29:16.520 --> 29:19.520
You see the Secretary of the Army on that day.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.520
Yes, sir.

29:21.520 --> 29:25.520
How did he arrive at Fort Deicks?

29:25.520 --> 29:27.520
I was in a certain position.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.520
In a narrow plane, sir.

29:30.520 --> 29:36.520
He was there, a landing field at Fort Deicks, or an airport near Fort Deicks.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.520
There is one adjoining Fort Deicks there.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.520
You will call the name of the airport.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.520
McGuire and half-fart space there.

29:45.520 --> 29:56.520
You will remember the incident of the Secretary arriving by plane on November 17, at Fort Deicks.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.520
Where do you have the flag?

29:58.520 --> 30:05.520
At this point, we pause briefly in seconds for station identification.

30:07.520 --> 30:12.520
You are tuned to New York City's own station, WNYC.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.520
Ah!

30:14.520 --> 30:23.520
And by the commanding general of the base, the State of Maine, the general Ryan, sir.

30:23.520 --> 30:31.520
General Ryan, order to duty at the McGuire Air Base to meet the plane, kind of putting the Secretary of the Army.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.520
Yes, sir.

30:33.520 --> 30:41.520
Do you know where we reside by General Ryan, who the passengers were on that plane?

30:41.520 --> 30:42.520
No, sir.

30:42.520 --> 30:47.520
Do you know why General Ryan ordered to meet the plane?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.520
Do I know, no, sir?

30:49.520 --> 30:53.520
Do you know why General Ryan told you why he were to meet the plane?

30:53.520 --> 30:59.520
I believe he told me, sir, that some of the Senate Investigations Committee staff,

30:59.520 --> 31:04.520
Senator McCarthy and Secretary Steven for coming to see me, sir.

31:04.520 --> 31:08.520
You know all the hour of arrival of the plane.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.520
It was right after retreat, sir.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.520
That would be about one time.

31:14.520 --> 31:18.520
I believe about 530 or 436, sir.

31:18.520 --> 31:20.520
Still day light.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.520
Still day light.

31:22.520 --> 31:30.520
I believe it was just the entry in the evening, sir.

31:30.520 --> 31:34.520
Who were all the planes?

31:34.520 --> 31:39.520
Senator McCarthy, sir.

31:39.520 --> 31:51.520
Roy Cohn, Frank Scott, Secretary Steven, John Adams.

31:52.520 --> 31:58.520
And I, that might have been the one or two others, but I remember that.

31:58.520 --> 32:01.520
This is your time.
