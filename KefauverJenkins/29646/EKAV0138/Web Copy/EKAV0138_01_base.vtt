WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Certain suspensions are one of certain people reinstated.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Because because you did not want anyone to lose these jobs because of your client's

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
association, that's right.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
I know you have that phrase.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
I might just throw you some other phrase of time to buy an idea of time for a party.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Otherwise, some of these individual versus spend with them from the secret radar laboratories

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
because not because they're going into individual actions but because of their close association

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
which come to that threat.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I don't know about that threat there.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
If you send a individual case or do you can get them out and have them testify?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
So I don't have them at night.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm not going to ask you to take you to a 35-tap.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
I assume this matter was a sufficient importance to you, the secretary.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I can want to review all of the cases.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
This time you would know whether or not some of them were suspended because of their close association

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
with either no one or suspected asking our patients, either no one or suspected come.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
That's right.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
I read a statement yesterday in sign of a card that you have in connection with the 35 cases.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I read it in the director.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm an in-state member of your council for fairy-tory.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I am on the note now about you yourself.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I know a lot of this.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
You've got to be extremely important to us.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Of course, you must be the role of these cases.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I know of it.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I know of these total numbers involved.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
But I do not know the details of the individual case and senator.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I'll be glad to look up to any one that you want to look up.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
No, no, you means the term of your class association.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
You work with money and the loses jobs because of your class association.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
When you make a statement, get your run on mine.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Some of these individuals might lose their job.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Because of association, you're coming with not-for-did-you-never mind.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
I didn't have to ask what I had in mind was to try and convey to the committee

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
a probably rather tired language.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
The idea that in carrying out this job and doing it right for the American people

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
and always resolving doubts and favor the American people,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
but at the same time, we ought not to be unfair or work hard just to serve on individuals.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm not necessarily.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
That's what I find something to let me ask you a little.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
When I make a statement, I ask what you know.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
For several days, the SBI has first received a squad and will make a 40-team with my committee.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
I think that that job won my came with the committee the next morning.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
For years, we had a squad.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
We produced the admins, like his 200-odd win, FBI, and working under him produced the admins.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
It resulted in the conviction of the half-stringed communists, the second-stringed communists,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
working in the Rosenberg case, all their communists case was tied up last November,

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
years, and you said you don't want anyone who was associating with communists

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
or something else, but lose their job because of how association you used to create

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
that you, even with the cards, and lose these jobors, and I'm especially interested in this.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
Mr. Carly is a losing job because the parents had a cause of an association

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
with some of them, or perhaps the Amritschuk communists, or whatever, because the fact of violence

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
and did not correct the chairman from the chair allegedly asked you for improper consideration

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
for some of the crimes.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
I just wonder if you don't think the Mr. Carly is affording my account.

03:34.000 --> 03:42.000
Mr. Carly is not losing job because of guilt-by-spire, if you feel that people family make

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
problems right-wing, just not losing their job because the association is coming with that

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
question too about.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
That's a pretty long question, time and my time.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
It's very very important, Bob.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Do you think we could have a red box?

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
I think we're nearly happy to have this red box in which the senate can break it down in shorter seconds.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
I think it looked like a red box, and if the secretary is here, we count after it, he's here for too long.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Sorry, I don't know if he was in the prime record now.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Why don't we get back?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Let me answer this, my team is there.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh, what's in the FTI?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
The record is flawed.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm a 90-40-king with my committee.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
And he quit that job when I came with a committee in the next morning.

04:41.000 --> 04:52.000
And for here, if you were to have that squad, you could have the average, with two under that,

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
and then FTI and M4 under them, for you to have this with the government, the conviction of the top-screen comment,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
and you have to bring confidence.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
And he worked on the road and work cases and all other commentations over the last number of years.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Do you say you don't want anyone to go to the committee or something you had in the next release of your job to participate in those cases?

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
To communicate with your field, if the card deduces job, or if the catchy specification, if the card deduces job to participate in those cases,

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
I'll give the association a tandem of projects in Mr. Carl's, or rather, because he's that solid and did not correct the German,

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
what the German allegedly had in the BBM for improper consideration for some private.

05:33.000 --> 05:42.000
I just wonder if you don't think that Mr. Carl is without standing background, don't you think he did not lose his job because of guilt by thought?

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
If you feel like people have been in the top 4, 3, or 3, they have lose their job because they were associated with comment.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
I have a question, and thank you so much for a question from me.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Well, I was just one by all the fact that the German had missed the sentence in this sentence.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
It's starting up.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
I was saying, Mr. Secretary, and at any time, when I asked you for a sentence too long, and I must be in fact, if I have an idea,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
then I have a question, if I have a question, then it's not a right idea. If you feel a question too long,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
and you've got my attention, I will certainly try and break it down.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
We must need less subjects to find being in session right now.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I'll give that a...

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
You said that you felt that General Lawson was like, finding top officers, right?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Yes, sir?

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
What do you have to do with the Secretary of State Promotion of General?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Do you think it anything?

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
That's done by the board. Select General's promotion.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Move points to the board.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
But the board's there. Affirmative.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
I'll find the board. You'll find the board.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I guess the suggestions of the Chief of State are...

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm very concerned for promotion with the firm.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm concerned that the individual who passed over the question will feel the fact that you described General Lawson as a fine top officer who could be partly agree.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
I think he's one of the best, firmly often, to my overcome and come back.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
And thank God, he has, he has got, or we wouldn't have had any success in the course of longness here.

07:23.000 --> 07:38.000
Now, I am concerned about this because of the custom one of its will be prepared to be like the Lawson's dead state, hitting south the hit block right below the committee, who are killing promotions.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I find that something's dead still with the motion.

07:41.000 --> 07:49.000
For example, I have a list here with the Secretary and I stated that October, we'll be detecting the firm on the Brigadier General.

07:49.000 --> 07:58.000
Considering for promotion with the firm as Major General October, 1950, 28, that the supply to it by...

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
...that I have these...

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
...sector's message.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
...that the supply to it is the sector by your department.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Some of the meetings are in the area to where the one of their other things.

08:09.000 --> 08:17.000
We find law firm was up for promotion, passed over to find the market was up for promotions from all...

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
...and find the right over her up for promotion from all of them.

08:21.000 --> 08:33.000
Now, the right over her, she done quite a bit, she didn't like the right over her, the man who was responsible for returning, threatening the vegetables.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Let's, let's, let's, let's let the business writers begin.

08:36.000 --> 08:47.000
The, when a man was first the friend of that working woman, he was caged from the past to go to the first Army Law of the Board of the rest.

08:47.000 --> 09:00.000
In the first Army Law of the Board, I wanted to give a sizable number of red-iron workers on the ground of the Royal Geo Security.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
I'd have to check it out to the department of the Carthage.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Well, if we just ask the madam, you know, who's the boss?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Who's the boss? Who's the number's man?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I can't let your madam testify on the things that he knows about.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
But you, you, you do not know now, it's likely that wasn't so deep, right? I had a lot of investigation.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
You just do not know.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
Last, prior to our investigation, we've been in over a number of years.

09:30.000 --> 09:41.000
Some 30-finals in the business, advent of spenders, as workers, finding these were entered by the first Army Law of the Board.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
The 33, I think these figures are correct, so later departments are giving them some.

09:48.000 --> 09:58.000
33, were ordered reinstated by the Pentagon Supreme Board, Royal Board Call of the Committee, or they're sent back to the radar lab at first.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
When was this the decide center? I don't know the year, this is fire of your...

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I don't know your, I'm sure it's not for them, because I'm doing the first part of your business.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
I don't recall any, but tell me the family's experience, since I've been that secretary of the Army.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
I don't recall any, but the mechanism is just something to tell me.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
I also like it from me to take the exemption to one thing that Senator McCarthy said.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Instead of it having nothing for designers, General Lawham, it can be checked on the records.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
But he would have gotten no cooperation or gotten over at Fort Mama.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I object to that violently.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
But General Lawham knows that he had my complete support in this work.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
And whether General Lawham has been at Fort Mama's or not, the secretary of the Army would have seen to it.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
That focal operation would have been forthcoming and something would have been done about it at Fort Mama's, whether or not Lawham was there.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Mr. Chairman, may I make this statement?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Council, time is now here, you certainly may.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
All ready to the secretary.

10:57.000 --> 11:10.000
I do not think it propered a solo and so advanced in the committee to direct an inquiry to the respective Fort Mama's prior to the installation of Mr. Stevens.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
The secretary of the Army, Mr. Chairman, ever occurred or didn't, that occurred to him.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
No wise, reflect upon him or add credit to it.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
And I think the apparent account of that enough.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.000
For the follow-up of the line of pressing your fancy, he didn't put in force, but the purpose is and I'm blamed for that.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
This is being pursued to show what happens to a General who is responsible

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
and known Mr. Stevens as far as we know of, he is responsible for reinstated.

11:45.000 --> 11:53.000
Standing back to the secret red alive, sorry, individuals that have been found on the death of the first one of the board.

11:53.000 --> 12:06.000
Mr. Chairman, unless Mr. Stevens is shown to have any part of that, or to have had knowledge of it and acquiesced in it, I advise this committee that it is wholly irrelevant and incomprehensible.

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
Well, now that I won't forgive the plan, I won't forgive the point now because one time for pressing the other's part, I'll have to correct my perfect time when I will.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Mr. Jenkins, any further questions?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
No further questions.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Chairman.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Chair, ahead, sir.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Mr. Miss Allen?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
No further questions.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Further.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Underdaction?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
No further.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Underdaction?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
No further.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
No further.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Underdaction?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
No further.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Underdaction?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
No further.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
No further.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
No further questions.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Senator McCarthy, there are ten minutes.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Mr. Jenkins, please.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Mr. Jenkins, please.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
No further.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Finally, I'm curious to get.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Well, we'll continue after this ten minutes.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
We just about 12 minutes.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Please.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Are we right?

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Mr. Jenkins, after this, I'm going to ask you a round of questions.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Well, ten minutes under the carpet and then we just...

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
It's a long check, you know.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Stevens, vote your answer in these questions.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
And then I just want you to find out the purpose of the questioning.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Michael Werther, I understand, was the predecessor of...

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
General Law, is that right?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I think that's so.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I'd like to be sure of it.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
There's a rather final case.

13:30.000 --> 13:40.000
At Fort Monmouth, where they're not the many young men who perform the search by military police.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
And some 40 or 45 of them are probably back figures.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
The secret, the top secret, the color classified documents are found in the small.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
You're called at tape, no?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
I remember stuff.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Is this working?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
It's timing.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I remember something about it, Senator.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
The Christmas rolls, or the rather number of your watching chips,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
the spending within the visual.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Is that correct?

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
I can't remember the name of the individual, but I told you sir, I've always case is specified to him.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I looked up if you would tell me to do so.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Well, I'm having within a limit of our presidential directives will supply over the information.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Now, our committee has printed you with all of these.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
I don't know, I haven't seen it all.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Would you know what is available, Dr. Bob?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
I presume that it would be, but I don't personally know if we have it all.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I mean, how many things?

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
I think it's too much to see anector say, an actor from a little bit, he seems to be adding to it.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
It's probably a little better.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yes, it's a good thing.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
But I mean, how many things?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I mean, same as the secretary.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
No, I'm away.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
No, I'm away.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
We do not make it available.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Do anyone else have the committee?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
I think it's a good thing.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
I think it's a good thing.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I think it's a good thing.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I think it's a good thing.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I think it's a good thing.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I think it's a good thing.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I think it's a good thing.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
No, I'm away.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
No, I'm away.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
We do not make it available.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Do anyone else have the committee executive session testimony?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
We did this in this case.

14:56.000 --> 15:04.000
Act, your request, either freshman or student, Mr. Adams, is also not to Mr. Adams, who's

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
allowed to sit in on all executive sessions testimony with one exception.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Was one of our important exceptions that I know?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Yes.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I was letting the channels record testify.

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
He was excluded from the affairs that he had ordered to look at other officers not to testify.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
In this valley, we will move with the hope that they might testify.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
He was not present.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
I think you put that in the form of a question for me rather than a statement.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
I thought of that, correct?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I have a question, Red.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Do you mind?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Fire on the defense.

15:45.000 --> 16:03.000
I don't know why I don't know why he rejected Mr. Adams.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
My personal representative is from the representative of the Department of Army at that hearing.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I don't know why he rejected him.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Okay.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
There are many events of exception at hearing.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
He was present at all, all of a hearing.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
That's right.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
He's the majority of the door for open-choice.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I don't know why I'm personal now.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
It's just that I have so much insight, though.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Good.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
So, if there's no reason why you don't know, I would be able to win an up-and-early victory.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Well, I don't have the opportunity, sir.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm afraid of everything that goes on.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Every hearing of every committee with which we're connected.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I'd like to be able to let you know.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Well, we have Michael Durford.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
We have Patrick Dunlund.

16:48.000 --> 17:04.000
Did you know when Michael Durford was promoted that he had refused to suspend one of the young men who was suspended later by him after locking the victim's indeligiment trust in,

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
according to FBI reports that had been sent to your department,

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
who's known for the kind of young communist belief meetings with Rosenberg,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
that has been investigated.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Mr. Chairman, that this round has nothing to my question, please.

17:18.000 --> 17:27.000
That this round had removed from the laboratories and violations of all regulations.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
That means home to 45 secret other classified documents.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
Michael Durford refused to suspend them and had locked them dead,

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
and that there was serious objections to locked them in suspension of him.

17:40.000 --> 17:54.000
That question is as competent and I value the Secretary not to answer it unless the Secretary was in office and promoted the General to whom Senator MacKide has referred.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Were you in office in 1953, well?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Yes, sir.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I'm going to 53.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Yes, sir.

18:01.000 --> 18:12.000
Just to request your recollection that I hand you a list of promotions and ask you whether or not you were in office in a point of the board,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
half the overlip motion of certain General's that someone else.

18:16.000 --> 18:28.000
That's the worry on office of that time.

18:46.000 --> 18:56.000
Thank you very much.

18:56.000 --> 19:03.000
Thank you.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm sorry, my heart thinks I'm against.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
I may need to help some General.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Young and deaf, he's one of the officers in the United States today about why he was here.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I'm glad he is here now.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm going to see one person now that says the chief.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I think you make the smoke when he helps your right-hand students.

19:23.000 --> 19:30.000
But they certainly the fact is that the current is a very emotional.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
In February, the list of entitled Cremelons Brigadier General,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
and the other in the case of permanent promotions,

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
and I'd like to get down on the on-the-unfraction if I'm wrong.

19:41.000 --> 19:50.000
I have one of the board and from there on, please, the action followed by law.

19:50.000 --> 19:59.000
In other words, I have no right to change the recommendation of that board for the permanent promotion.

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
I use the life of the board, the board, in discretion, the science, which should be promoted to that right.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
That's right.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
And under the law, I can't change that.

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
And they turn on me like that.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
We will just leave right under for a minute and shift to another General with the modem.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
The manager's cartridge before the committee of General Parkridge,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
when your cartridge was left right at five.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
And most of the mis-appartures type of at-time.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
He was the head of chief of staff, G2, in the town.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
That was Richard C. Parkridge.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
I don't recall his initials that I'm not a heir, I think that's right.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
Many events, you were personally present during this executive testimony.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
That's right.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Did you request for the committee not calling him on public questions?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
To Eric, I'd like to ask, yes.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
I thought I'd ask any customer by any second session.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
I just got through telling you, Mr. McGrath.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
It was likely I'd just got through asking you before you attended.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Did the executive testimony you said, yes, that's right.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Or, I said, no question, he just got to point me back to the session.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I just got to find the second session.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
That's an interesting example.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
Did you ask us not to call him on public questions?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I don't know.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I know yes.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
That has the General Parkridge in the week.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
We were not enthusiastic about that.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
And our intelligence people called us public hearings.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
We were not saying it was a natural thing.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
And by the day, near a memory, remember,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
he seems so good about the exact science books and things like that.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
He should have remembered about the general.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Did you, the line memory of not good about the science books?

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, I know one of the charges here is that he seems to work with science.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
We did not make that charge, Mr. Chairman.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Is it in the water?

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
We did something or other, Senator McKenzie.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
You know, well, we did not make that charge.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
The question, Mr. Secretary, did you ask us not to call Mr. Parkridge in public questions?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I'm I very well done, sir.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
Do you remember that you made these statements?

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
That you felt that he was approving himself so in confidence for that job.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
That would be comfort to the enemy.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
If they could watch him in public questions,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
and see how uninvolved he was,

22:27.000 --> 22:35.000
and therefore, you would appreciate it very much to do with not calling or word-to-doubting.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
That's a lot of work there, kind of, McCarthy, and I cannot subscribe to it.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
Well, there will be testimony with your secretary by number of witnesses on that.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
I will not give you a bad habit.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
I don't think I don't propose an attitude for a first thing in my collection, you understand.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
But this matter I'm sure is a decision important to you with the secretary.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
But the suspicion is important to you.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
I'm slightly new and slightly accountable for my job here at one of our specifications.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
That you must assert your memory.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
You shouldn't know about other things.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
You have to not to call Parkridge again, I mean, give these persons a second.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
Think about it and then you can prove yourself really comfortable to the job.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
That you are not going to move in any way.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
And that the public would give you a stage in comfort to the enemy.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
And we are taking a seat in place of individuals who are running our collections department.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Is that not the standard you like to have to do?

23:36.000 --> 23:44.000
I may have suggested to you that I will rather not have in call, because I say we don't like to have our intelligence people,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
a tearing public heritage.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
And also, General Parkridge was not a main in particular good-looking.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
No question about that.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
I have to, but as far as talking about these comforts of the enemy,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
why?

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
General Parkridge is a fine-out table full of long-wrecked behind us.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
And a biohead end would be intangible of doing any technical behavior they can comfort to the enemy.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
You know what? Let's not just see words in the present.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
The President of the Army and the others would not give a lady comfort to the enemy.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
Not because I miss my lessons in our pocket as far as I can understand that.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Your discipline is not a problem because if you give a lady comfort to the enemy

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
and make a statement to complete any compliments of those who can win my collection,

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
this is not a threat to the century when it is just a slow eye.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I have no recollection of that.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
The President's subcommittee during this inquiry into the McCarthy Army controversy

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
has recessed the hearing for the lunch hour.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
A little green convene in a couple of hours.
