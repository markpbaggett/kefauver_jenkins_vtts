WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
As far as I'm concerned, perhaps the end of it, and I can continue with the busy duties

00:07.000 --> 00:14.720
of the Secretary of the Army without further thought until the time comes when, for actually

00:14.720 --> 00:19.840
leaving on the trip, all for the preparation of the remarks that I'm going to make.

00:19.840 --> 00:27.480
In the meanwhile, Mr. Wittles, we'll have this batch little memorandum to appropriate

00:27.480 --> 00:34.480
members of the staff to begin to implement the five points which I've just outlined.

00:34.480 --> 00:42.480
Having done that, each file is notes away, and that's the end.

00:42.480 --> 00:47.480
But each is on the telephone in the manner I have just installed.

00:47.480 --> 00:54.480
What is this telephone conversation between the UN Senator McCarty as of November 7th,

00:54.480 --> 01:01.480
and the UN Senator McCarty has been appointed to the UN Senator McCarty.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.480
Mr. Rufus was on the line.

01:04.480 --> 01:10.620
I have the alleged use of statements from your recollection now that not in these

01:10.620 --> 01:15.620
monitors that record the tenor of that conversation.

01:15.620 --> 01:19.620
Mr. Chairman, your final name is Mr. Wittles.

01:19.620 --> 01:26.620
I'm not asking for the monitor report now, Mr. Wittles.

01:26.620 --> 01:33.620
I'm asking him to tell what was said, whether it was monitored or whether it was reported.

01:33.620 --> 01:37.620
Mr. Chairman, that's how back it.

01:37.620 --> 01:42.620
Mr. Chairman, I think we may still have a few more questions.

01:42.620 --> 01:49.620
Mr. Chairman, I think we may still have to face the legal decision.

01:49.620 --> 01:54.620
I think it could be handled without difficulty, but we don't face it at this point.

01:54.620 --> 02:01.620
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman.

02:01.620 --> 02:08.620
Well, Senator McCarty, for all of the questions that I have just received.

02:08.620 --> 02:15.620
The day after the luncheon and my office, and he asked me if everything is all right.

02:15.620 --> 02:21.620
And I said yes, we have, and I thank him.

02:21.620 --> 02:34.620
He said he went on there to discuss David Sean and said that he did not want David Sean

02:34.620 --> 02:38.620
to sign back to this committee.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.620
That is he is committee. That's right.

02:41.620 --> 02:50.620
Well, as I have never had any intention of signing David Sean, but to this committee, once he was inducted into the army,

02:50.620 --> 02:52.620
there was no follow.

02:52.620 --> 03:02.620
My mind, in that particular way, if he would not sign back to the committee, Senator McCarty, gave some reason.

03:02.620 --> 03:07.620
Mr. Wai, he felt that way.

03:07.620 --> 03:17.620
Which added up to raising a question in my mind, as to just now important, Mr. Sean was to the committee.

03:17.620 --> 03:19.620
Mr. Chairman, I'm a follow-up reporter.

03:19.620 --> 03:20.620
Thank you, Mr. President.

03:20.620 --> 03:27.620
Mr. Chairman, you have the fact that, for each of the members of the committee, getting a certain time across the examines,

03:27.620 --> 03:39.620
and before I have a chance to tell him the secretary, I think in turn, the secretary should be asked to give me reasons that I gave him,

03:39.620 --> 03:43.620
namely that it would be that he was proper.

03:43.620 --> 03:48.620
Just not in the member committee. He is left in for now that I have asked to say to sign up the assigned committee.

03:48.620 --> 03:53.620
Mr. Chairman, please, Mr. Chairman. He has left in for now that I have to say it not for the assigned committee.

03:53.620 --> 04:00.620
Mr. Chairman, I have to finish my sentence. Mr. Chairman, if you have your opportunity to sign up the next those very questions,

04:00.620 --> 04:05.620
and I take the position of saying on the committee, which is now making statement of the vice committee.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.620
And, for this time, I will then be the long example of Secretary of State.

04:09.620 --> 04:18.620
Probably, we are expected to very things, as the saying goes, mentioned that many will have his opportunity, and have the objective, so say much like being in public, and if they might.

04:18.620 --> 04:26.620
We ask the judges to be able to counsel the whole with objection, whether I finish my sentence.

04:26.620 --> 04:32.620
The rest are the few, if you have any point of order, then we will have the meeting ready for the order.

04:32.620 --> 04:46.620
The Secretary of State, I will go left in person, when I ask the sign up the assigned committee, because of some incongruence on the protest sign, I ask the council, and then I send council to the committee.

04:46.620 --> 04:58.620
I wish council would take care of the whole of the black, and make it very clear that the only way to map in that will sign sign of the committee will be because I told him it will be uncomfortable and interpretable for some of orders.

05:29.620 --> 05:44.620
The committee will ask the question right now, so the reason I, the lawyer, is that one of the sign is that people will know that it's more or less better for the lawyer to examine those victims, and I just think it would be completely unfair, and it's just not possible.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.620
The committee will ask the council to have the show this afternoon, he expects to do that.

05:47.620 --> 05:51.620
And you will know probably there will be people who have covered the House in the evening.

05:51.620 --> 06:05.620
Now you, the committee, could I secure up your list that I think an orderly procedure would be to clearly go ahead and ask the Monitored telephone conversation placed in evidence.

06:05.620 --> 06:20.620
May I ask if you have now stated from your recollection regardless of any monitor for CD, the first conversation that has been used by Senator McCarthy on November 7th, if not proceed to do so.

06:21.620 --> 06:28.620
And may I say Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that.

06:28.620 --> 06:35.620
The one thing that I don't want to do is to create any impression, unfurled anybody.

06:35.620 --> 06:40.620
I'm sure if you would have moved your notes on the reason I have wanted to get all of that.

06:41.620 --> 06:51.620
But when you are searching your memory and trying to testify over at some point, I guess a human thought I will not do so intentionally.

06:51.620 --> 06:56.620
I will put the facts out here on the table, get out and defend as far as I know.

06:56.620 --> 07:01.620
Now vote for us, three, three, two, one.

07:01.620 --> 07:08.620
I have not finished my statement, but I was going to wrap this, but you've been as key so now.

07:09.620 --> 07:20.620
I was going to say that Senator McCarthy did say that he thought this would be misinterpreted the real plan of David Shaw in the committee.

07:20.620 --> 07:26.620
He thought it would be misinterpreted and would be bad for me.

07:27.620 --> 07:39.620
If I have any reflection in my recollection as I'm finally called on David Shaw and what I took previously, I did not intend to do that.

07:39.620 --> 07:45.620
I intended it merely in my efforts to get the facts before it came in.

07:46.620 --> 08:01.620
Now in that conversation, Senator McCarthy said that one of the few things that he had trouble with Mr. Cohen about was David Shaw.

08:01.620 --> 08:08.620
He said that.

08:09.620 --> 08:18.620
Senator McCarthy said that he thought a few weeks ago for David Shaw might be a lane.

08:19.620 --> 08:24.620
I will wait for that effect.

08:27.620 --> 08:38.620
Senator McCarthy said that he thought a few weeks ago for David Shaw might be a lane.

08:39.620 --> 08:44.620
I will wait for that effect.

08:44.620 --> 08:49.620
But I'm not going to serve.

08:49.620 --> 08:56.620
Taking care of David Shaw might be a good one.

08:56.620 --> 09:01.620
Now vote for us, six, five, nine, nine.

09:01.620 --> 09:05.620
Mr. Jenkins, then, about to ask the above.

09:06.620 --> 09:12.620
The following question is, you will call it the conversation between you and some of the judges at the end.

09:12.620 --> 09:19.620
If you can still use that conversation with Monica, I said that Mr. Lucas was on the wire.

09:19.620 --> 09:26.620
Do you have a record that makes Mr. Lucas about conversation?

09:26.620 --> 09:29.620
I have no question, Mr. Wells, I have had to be in.

09:30.620 --> 09:32.620
I have no record, made by Mr. McGrillin.

09:32.620 --> 09:35.620
Okay, monitor of that conversation.

09:35.620 --> 09:42.620
Well, as you're going to monitor, Mr. Jenkins, I do not wish to keep the monitors telephone conversation out of this hearing.

09:42.620 --> 09:50.620
I only want the proper legal set up made so that it can go in as I do with them all, which I have discussed with you.

09:50.620 --> 09:53.620
And I think we're at that point.

09:53.620 --> 10:09.620
As you know, Mr. Jenkins, a special subpoena, was served on Mr. Stevens, required him to bring among other things this monitored conversation.

10:09.620 --> 10:21.620
In response to that subpoena, which I wish placed in the record, at this point, he has found the monitored conversation to this room.

10:21.620 --> 10:26.620
In any meeting of another committee, I put some of your signings in West Pazin.

10:26.620 --> 10:35.620
It was that it was that there were such monitored conversations, so that their existence is not actually a secret.

10:35.620 --> 10:44.620
It follows that there are in this room, isn't this room a transcription of this of the North, Mr. Lucas, made.

10:44.620 --> 10:50.620
There have been some of the rest of the scenes which I wish to be made a part of the record.

10:50.620 --> 10:59.620
And if this committee votes, that Mr. Stevens must produce and disclose, he is prepared to do so.

10:59.620 --> 11:07.620
But I ask that he have the protection both of the subpoena and of a committee vote, ordering him to produce.

11:08.620 --> 11:14.620
As you can understand, you raised the point of order that before the notes are produced, and you're introduced to your elected vote by the committee.

11:14.620 --> 11:21.620
We are dealing with the federal communications act, which puts certain restrictions on monitored telephone calls.

11:21.620 --> 11:30.620
And I think mine is that no army man makes properly produced these unless they committee of this then that orders him to do so.

11:31.620 --> 11:38.620
As you can understand, you have raised the point of order that before producing the notes, you would like to have a vote by the committee.

11:38.620 --> 11:41.620
That is precisely correct.

11:41.620 --> 11:48.620
I am allies with the committee to make a vote, which is not on the other side of this monitor, for the prescription of it.

11:48.620 --> 11:54.620
Together with the original child health, shouting for peace to the committee for its function.

11:55.620 --> 12:07.620
I think that the council should first develop further in the secretary had a favorable transcript of the telephone conversation.

12:07.620 --> 12:17.620
I think otherwise impossible for the committee to intelligently decide whether or not to be in this conversation to be quite a recommend, so that I think it's one of those.

12:18.620 --> 12:27.620
I think that the committee, which is not on the other side of this monitor, is not on the other side of the monitor, is not on the other side of the monitor.

12:28.620 --> 12:34.620
The government just stops the senators as those they can proper up to the time of the monitor in the secretary.

12:34.620 --> 12:38.620
The general is a fine of order please and I will go ahead.

12:38.620 --> 12:47.620
I think it's a big limitation in proper to take a recording of like conversations about monitoring the purpose of the other end.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.620
The cabinet has made enough information as it is.

12:51.620 --> 12:54.620
That's why I think that the cabinet is just a part of the committee.

12:54.620 --> 12:56.620
I think that the point of order is there.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.620
May I do it with an opinion?

12:58.620 --> 13:00.620
Why didn't you find a way?

13:00.620 --> 13:02.620
If one of order is there, the point of order.

13:02.620 --> 13:05.620
I think it's completely in power.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.620
Does that start at night?

13:07.620 --> 13:12.620
In the evening, I'm about to report a conversation with a little bit of the person the other end.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.620
I just need to move the conversation this stage.

13:17.620 --> 13:18.620
I shall have it.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.620
If it is, if it is, it's a very high upholstery.

13:20.620 --> 13:21.620
I'll follow you by the way.

13:21.620 --> 13:24.620
If you follow me, what I have, if I have a little bit of respect you can't get.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.620
That you might have a little bit of respect you know the other end.

13:26.620 --> 13:27.620
I'll finish with the camera.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.620
We're going to be doing what I'm planning this morning.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.620
I think I'm about to do those important points.

13:31.620 --> 13:32.620
Please, my lover.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.620
This is the recollection.

13:34.620 --> 13:36.620
I'll sign in the ledger.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.620
I'll drop the car and move to go out.

13:38.620 --> 13:43.620
If it really consists of rules that he may add another word on the car again,

13:43.620 --> 13:45.620
then I think it's enough to let it go.

13:45.620 --> 13:48.620
This is a little bit inconsistent, but I will move on to one of the other words.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.620
I know that we only ask if he's in touch with us.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.620
The charges are on the car.

13:52.620 --> 13:54.620
Just throw it up to me now.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.620
Gerald, I'll follow you by the way.

13:56.620 --> 14:00.620
He comes so well, interrogating the citizens as to whether or not he has.

14:00.620 --> 14:01.620
He tries to get to be good.

14:01.620 --> 14:04.620
Mr. Cannon, could I say a word?

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620
You may be, Mr. Swell.

14:06.620 --> 14:11.620
Mr. Jenkins, for he understands that some lot is difficult for a little question here,

14:11.620 --> 14:15.620
and with extreme courtesy, he did not interview Mr. Lucas.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.620
Who took the note?

14:16.620 --> 14:19.620
He did not ask to see his notebook.

14:19.620 --> 14:25.620
He has merely assumed that there is a transcription now in this room,

14:25.620 --> 14:28.620
for which the committee has a call with the wishes.

14:28.620 --> 14:29.620
I have not...

14:29.620 --> 14:33.620
Anything else to say except the transcription is here,

14:33.620 --> 14:37.620
and that it is devoid of it, it can be produced or testified about,

14:37.620 --> 14:40.620
unless and on sale is committed to both that you want it.

14:40.620 --> 14:43.620
You share a view that before asking the committee to vote,

14:43.620 --> 14:46.620
you want to find out whether or not there is actually a transcript

14:46.620 --> 14:48.620
of the conversation, doesn't it?

14:48.620 --> 14:50.620
We will be finding out hours to have the consult,

14:50.620 --> 14:52.620
interrogate the secretary on that point of view.

14:52.620 --> 14:57.620
Do you have a sign description of that conversation?

14:57.620 --> 14:59.620
But I hear that question, Brad.

14:59.620 --> 15:00.620
He will be here.

15:00.620 --> 15:02.620
Repart your own answer.

15:02.620 --> 15:07.620
Yes, my room is made.

15:07.620 --> 15:08.620
I must look.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.620
Where is Mr. Lucas?

15:10.620 --> 15:11.620
He's here.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.620
A little above.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.620
Yes, sir, he's up here in my house.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.620
I have a little left at the end of the room.

15:16.620 --> 15:17.620
I'm at that.

15:17.620 --> 15:18.620
Have you read it?

15:18.620 --> 15:19.620
Yes, sir.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.620
Don't go there and talk.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.620
Yes, sir, he's up here in my house.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.620
Who is that transcript?

15:26.620 --> 15:27.620
I'm at that.

15:27.620 --> 15:28.620
Have you read it?

15:28.620 --> 15:29.620
Yes, sir.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.620
Dave Robert and Bob.

15:31.620 --> 15:35.620
That transcription was made from memory.

15:35.620 --> 15:39.620
Our Robert and Bob, it was made from notes.

15:39.620 --> 15:43.620
Take them after time and simultaneously with this conversation.

15:43.620 --> 15:47.620
It was made from shorthand notes taken at the time of the conversation.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.620
And you say you have read it?

15:49.620 --> 15:51.620
Yes, he is very well.

15:51.620 --> 15:52.620
Yes, and I'm accurate.

15:52.620 --> 15:57.620
Where did you report your conversation with Senator McCarty?

15:57.620 --> 15:59.620
I was saved by this.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.620
Mr. Chairman.

16:01.620 --> 16:02.620
Senator McCarty?

16:02.620 --> 16:06.620
Again, in this way, I think it's early that Robert and...

16:06.620 --> 16:09.620
Recording a list of conversations, we should put in the record.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.620
But I think it should not put in the record.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.620
And you'll let the Lucas that's here in the room.

16:13.620 --> 16:18.620
And swear, it contains everything that is said.

16:18.620 --> 16:22.620
And as a group, the group actor says,

16:22.620 --> 16:25.620
if that is on, I think it should be put in the record.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.620
I don't think Mr. C.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.620
I don't know.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.620
Mr. Moore, questions from you.

16:29.620 --> 16:30.620
Mr. Aburn.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.620
Shadow off, all of us at the library.

16:32.620 --> 16:35.620
We will have Mr. Aburn and testify before introducing the transcript.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.620
I can see that in my opinion Senator McCarty is in trial, right?

16:39.620 --> 16:41.620
Correct the body?

16:41.620 --> 16:45.620
It is now practically adjourning, Dave.

16:45.620 --> 16:48.620
May I suggest the meeting now be adjourned.

16:48.620 --> 16:52.620
And that Mr. Stovans stand beside a superman

16:52.620 --> 16:54.620
and Mr. Lucas, we put all of that back.

16:54.620 --> 16:57.620
May we have a recess and a two-hours meeting?

17:09.620 --> 17:13.620
From Washington, the ABC Radio Network has been bringing you.

17:14.620 --> 17:18.620
The block gas, non-the-C block gas,

17:18.620 --> 17:22.620
the investigation, the very controversial,

17:22.620 --> 17:27.620
no-hold-squared investigation between Senator McCarty and the Army.

17:27.620 --> 17:34.620
And Senator Munt has just called a recess somewhat earlier and usual.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.620
And the hearings until this afternoon,

17:38.620 --> 17:43.620
now 12.25, Washington on time, eastern standard time.

17:43.620 --> 17:46.620
And the hearings are to take up again this afternoon,

17:46.620 --> 17:50.620
at 2.30 in two hours and five minutes from now.

17:50.620 --> 17:55.620
The testimony in the last half-hour

17:55.620 --> 17:59.620
developed one of the controversial points in the hearings.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.620
They devoted to a telephone conversation

18:02.620 --> 18:07.620
which took place between the Secretary of the Army, Mr. Stovans,

18:07.620 --> 18:12.620
and Senator McCarty on the date of November 7.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.620
It was a telephone conversation that had been discussed previously

18:15.620 --> 18:19.620
and the Army's charges, first charges against Senator McCarty,

18:19.620 --> 18:24.620
in which it was said that he had made certain statements about David Shine,

18:24.620 --> 18:28.620
and also about his counsel Roy Cohn,

18:28.620 --> 18:33.620
supposedly, according to the early charges that were made,

18:33.620 --> 18:36.620
Senator McCarty had made certain remarks about Mr. Cohn.

18:36.620 --> 18:41.620
And he didn't want Mr. Cohn to know

18:41.620 --> 18:44.620
of some of his comments that he, the senator,

18:44.620 --> 18:47.620
did not want Roy Cohn to know some of the comments

18:47.620 --> 18:49.620
that he was making about David Shine.

18:49.620 --> 18:54.620
In other words, he wasn't so anxious to take care of Shine as had been stated before.

18:54.620 --> 18:59.620
Well, at any rate, whether this conversation is to go under the record or not,

18:59.620 --> 19:03.620
or because quite a little bit of discussion here,

19:03.620 --> 19:09.620
all involved a legal point under the federal communications laws,

19:09.620 --> 19:15.620
a monitored phone conversation may not be made public,

19:15.620 --> 19:22.620
unless the person who had that conversation was held admits that,

19:22.620 --> 19:24.620
or admits that to be done.

19:24.620 --> 19:29.620
In this case, Mr. Joseph Welch, the attorney from Boston,

19:29.620 --> 19:32.620
who is acting as the special counsel for the Army,

19:32.620 --> 19:35.620
insists that the committee, the investigating subcommittee,

19:35.620 --> 19:37.620
under the chairmanship of Senator Munt,

19:37.620 --> 19:43.620
should vote that this monitored conversation be permitted to come into the record,

19:43.620 --> 19:46.620
and that the subpoena, which was served for that,

19:46.620 --> 19:48.620
also be put in the record.

19:48.620 --> 19:52.620
All of which will make the matter quite legal

19:52.620 --> 19:56.620
and so far as the secretary of the Army and Mr. Stevens is concerned.

19:56.620 --> 20:01.620
And as you were, Senator McCarty has interrupted on this point,

20:01.620 --> 20:07.620
saying that he wants to be sure that it's not just a conversation based on memory,

20:07.620 --> 20:10.620
based on notes that were made from memory later.

20:10.620 --> 20:14.620
And as the secretary explained, this was a conversation that was monitored

20:14.620 --> 20:17.620
in his outer office by a Mr. Lucas, a civil servant,

20:17.620 --> 20:22.620
whose job it is to listen in on telephone conversations for the secretary

20:22.620 --> 20:25.620
to make notes there upon.

20:25.620 --> 20:28.620
The secretary testified that it is a monitored conversation,

20:29.620 --> 20:35.620
not from memory, but from shorthand notes that were made by Secretary Stevens.

20:35.620 --> 20:41.620
Mr. McCarty has interrupted to insist that Mr. Lucas himself is still a clerk

20:41.620 --> 20:44.620
in Secretary Stevens' office, be called here,

20:44.620 --> 20:47.620
to testify that it is an accurate transcript.

20:47.620 --> 20:52.620
So with all of us very elaborate legal discussion over the point,

20:52.620 --> 20:55.620
testimony of the hearing is being recessed until this afternoon,

20:55.620 --> 20:59.620
when I will be taken up again and obviously Mr. Lucas will be brought here.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.620
Now all the testimony this morning has been a questioning,

21:01.620 --> 21:04.620
cross examination of Mr. Stevens.

21:04.620 --> 21:09.620
Yesterday, and the closing hours of the session, the secretary of the Army,

21:09.620 --> 21:14.620
read a very long detailed statement making certain charges against Senator McCarty

21:14.620 --> 21:17.620
and his aides of undo pressure.

21:25.620 --> 21:35.620
Thank you.
