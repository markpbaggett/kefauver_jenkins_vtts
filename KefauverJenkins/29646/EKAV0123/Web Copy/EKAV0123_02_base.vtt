WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
The afternoon session of this the second day of the hearings is about to begin before

00:08.720 --> 00:13.560
the Senate Subcommittee on Prominent Investigation, Senator McCarthy's own committee.

00:13.560 --> 00:18.160
All over the Senate, as we move himself completely from the committee, was a duration of this

00:18.160 --> 00:19.160
inquiry.

00:19.160 --> 00:23.800
His twice as chairman and tells temporarily, by Senator Charlie Munn, Republican himself

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
to call out.

00:24.800 --> 00:31.400
As you as well as big, Mahogaday panel room is again crowded over-drawing with some 450

00:31.400 --> 00:37.000
spectators, the principals in the affair, and close to 200 reporters and photographers.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.560
Some of these spectators arrived at 730 this morning, three hours before the show began,

00:42.560 --> 00:43.560
many were standing.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.200
Today's chief witness is Secretary of the Army, Robert T. Stephen, the chief antagonist

00:49.200 --> 00:52.400
of Senator McCarthy in this dispute.

00:52.400 --> 00:57.160
But now as we begin this afternoon session, we understand that Secretary Stephen is going

00:57.160 --> 01:02.040
to step aside temporarily only so that another witness can be heard briefly.

01:02.040 --> 01:07.120
He is Jack Lucas, an employee in the Secretary of the Army's office in the Pentagon.

01:07.120 --> 01:13.320
Lucas is going to testify above listening in and recording a telephone call, which Senator

01:13.320 --> 01:19.640
McCarthy made to Secretary Stephen's office last November 7 on the subject of G. David

01:19.640 --> 01:22.920
Shai, who had just then been inducted into the Army.

01:22.920 --> 01:29.880
You'll hear the Committee Council, Ray H. Jenkins questioning Lucas, about that telephone

01:29.880 --> 01:35.160
conversation after Chairman Munn gabbled the Committee as the hearing session to order.

01:35.160 --> 01:41.360
It's quite likely that before Secretary of the Army, Stephen finishes his testimony here,

01:41.360 --> 01:46.520
and I might say it's quite likely to be prolonged testimony that considerable time will be spent

01:46.520 --> 01:52.480
on cross-examination in going into this matter of the recorded telephone conversation

01:52.480 --> 01:59.560
of last November 7 between Senator McCarthy and Secretary of the Army.

01:59.560 --> 02:04.320
Just before the hearing took its noon time recess, Stephen's related his version of that

02:04.320 --> 02:10.640
telephone call from the senator and said that McCarthy privately vetoed a request which

02:10.640 --> 02:16.220
had been made earlier by his own chief counsel, Roy M. Cohn, seeking special favors in the

02:16.220 --> 02:18.560
Army for David Shai.

02:18.560 --> 02:25.800
Shai, now a private in the Army, was a consultant on McCarthy's Committee serving without pay.

02:25.800 --> 02:30.200
The chief counsel of the Committee under McCarthy, that is, while Senator McCarthy was Chairman

02:30.200 --> 02:35.760
Cohn, allegedly brought heavy questions to get special treatment for young Shai.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.920
There's this senator himself, according to the Army Secretary.

02:39.920 --> 02:45.960
Then he testified Secretary Stephen in that phone call, the senator reversed the saying

02:45.960 --> 02:48.840
that he had been taking up to that time.

02:48.840 --> 02:54.040
Stephen's courted McCarthy is saying that Shai was, quote, one of the few things he had

02:54.040 --> 02:57.240
trouble about with Roy Cohn.

02:57.240 --> 03:02.720
Senator McCarthy also said, according to Secretary Stephen's testimony, that Cohn's

03:02.720 --> 03:09.560
off-set is Ben Shai, off to be a general and operate from a penthouse on the Waldorf

03:09.560 --> 03:12.040
Astoria.

03:12.040 --> 03:18.200
We notice that as the afternoon session prepares to get underway, that's the chairman,

03:18.200 --> 03:25.280
Senator Mutt, the South Dakota, has given up the class H3, which he's due to yesterday

03:25.280 --> 03:30.440
for a gavle, and now has obtained for himself and honest to goodness gavle.

03:30.440 --> 03:38.240
He's ready to use it now to thank the order, as soon as the large group of photographers

03:38.240 --> 03:44.480
directly in front of the table finish taking their pictures.

03:44.480 --> 03:48.120
Even more people turned up for the day, as you're hearing, and were on hand for the

03:48.120 --> 03:53.200
opener yesterday, according to the police reports we get, but there weren't merely as

03:53.200 --> 03:56.640
many VIPs aging in ahead of the line today.

03:56.640 --> 04:01.560
So more of the, what should we call, the notorious godia, but still there were about a hundred

04:01.560 --> 04:09.200
of them, left standing outside, and a few were admitted to standing room only, but others

04:09.200 --> 04:11.720
were not able to get a look here.

04:11.720 --> 04:16.120
Senator McCarthy, you've got to pick hands from the audience when he made his first entrance

04:16.120 --> 04:22.520
yesterday at the opening day session, which the door today, Justice Chairman Mutt, was

04:22.520 --> 04:25.920
warning the crowd that they must not demonstrate.

04:25.920 --> 04:32.920
So perhaps that was another factor in that matter, was that the photographers, right,

04:32.920 --> 04:38.400
Mr. Jean-Mutt, McCarthy, wasn't with the photographer this morning, but I notice she has

04:38.400 --> 04:43.120
just come in now with the senator, and it's being helped to her seat.

04:43.120 --> 04:49.800
Mr. McCarthy is still on the conscience as result of an ankle of a plate that she suffered

04:49.800 --> 04:55.720
in a taxi cab accident in New York, several weeks ago.

04:55.720 --> 05:02.720
In the morning session today, the Army Chief Counsel, Joseph and Well, say Boston Attorney,

05:02.720 --> 05:08.240
complained about it, played it, because he didn't have a microphone, and he said he wasn't

05:08.240 --> 05:13.200
having much luck sharing one that was used by Army Secretary Steven, that they were

05:13.200 --> 05:14.200
at the table.

05:14.200 --> 05:20.520
So he asked Chairman Mutt to use what he called once that power to see if another microphone

05:20.520 --> 05:22.520
could be obtained.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.880
White Mutt said with a laugh that he didn't know how much power I had in this field.

05:26.880 --> 05:31.400
A minute or two later it's developed that he didn't have very much because he had to tell

05:31.400 --> 05:35.640
this to Well, so that he's just expected to get him a microphone.

05:35.640 --> 05:40.640
And speaking of Senator McCarthy and these receptionists that he's been getting from the crowd

05:40.640 --> 05:47.840
here, I've noticed that a number of spectators here are wearing red-white and blue lapels

05:47.840 --> 05:54.840
and a post-inflection, they found the legend, I'm from McCarthy.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.640
They're seating arrangements I might add here.

05:59.640 --> 06:06.120
Apparently, just Senator McCarthy off from what was, I think, a rather favorite committee

06:06.120 --> 06:11.120
routine of his for some months have thought about a life of little joke.

06:11.120 --> 06:17.560
The Senator from Wisconsin usually makes quite a big show of pretending to be suffocated

06:17.560 --> 06:24.560
by the spokes from the ever-president height for the guard of Senator Mutt.

06:24.560 --> 06:31.560
So in the past, frequently Senator McCarthy has handed over to Senator Mutt what's

06:31.560 --> 06:34.560
supposed to be better brand of the guards.

06:34.560 --> 06:39.720
And we call it once he rang in of the guard, bearing the assertive one of a federalizer

06:39.720 --> 06:41.040
company.

06:41.040 --> 06:48.040
And later, when Senator Mutt went up, he saw Gates, Senator McCarthy, for best or discovering

06:48.040 --> 06:50.040
the label.

06:50.040 --> 06:57.040
There seems to be quite a bit of confusion in the room now, but Senator Mutt is finally

06:57.040 --> 07:00.880
obtained some semblance of order from the photographers.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.720
All the committee members are in their place.

07:03.720 --> 07:09.400
The committee council, Ray Jenkins is talking over months' shoulders of Senator Mutt's

07:09.400 --> 07:14.480
own, the ranking Democratic member of the committee.

07:14.480 --> 07:22.400
And Senator Mutt has the gabbled toys looking around, start-up like a starter in a crew

07:22.400 --> 07:27.400
race waiting to see that everyone's in position before he shoots off the gun.

07:27.400 --> 07:34.400
They're always at these delays of a start-up hearing because of the abundance of photographers

07:34.400 --> 07:41.400
and the ever-president of Teal of just one more, sometimes, Secretary Mutt, who is a very

07:41.400 --> 07:46.400
even temper who really a jovial person, gets a better noise, but now the gavel is banging

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
at Senator Mutt's feet.

07:48.400 --> 07:54.400
Here is an announcement to make first of all, Attorney Senator Fortjack, who is attending

07:54.400 --> 07:59.400
the General of the French and his company early after the committee will be back with it,

07:59.400 --> 08:02.400
soon after the beginning of the afternoon session.

08:03.400 --> 08:10.400
Second announcement is that some say question of locality seems to have arisen under Section

08:10.400 --> 08:18.400
6-05 of the Federal Communications Administration for the Title 47 of the Act dealing with Federal

08:18.400 --> 08:19.400
Communications.

08:19.400 --> 08:25.400
That is the assumption that unauthorized publications are used of communications.

08:26.400 --> 08:34.400
A question which we believe the subject is going to with its counsel in executive session

08:34.400 --> 08:40.400
to be sure that we know exactly the grounds that which we are operating, it has then decided

08:40.400 --> 08:47.400
not to proceed with the interrogation of Mr. Lucas at this time, nor to proceed with Mr.

08:47.400 --> 08:52.400
Stephen from the standpoint of any question dealing with the monitor's conversation,

08:53.400 --> 08:59.400
but to temporarily dismiss Mr. Lucas and to ask Mr. Stephen to return to the stand,

08:59.400 --> 09:02.400
and we will interrogate other faces.

09:02.400 --> 09:09.400
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I am Mr. D. Mutt, I am the D. Mutt, I assume that the legal question

09:09.400 --> 09:16.400
has disappeared because the senator has intended to the publication and therefore an all legal

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
question remains.

09:18.400 --> 09:26.400
The lawyer has done the subcommittee seem to be in some doubt as to the legal question.

09:26.400 --> 09:34.400
Here we spend our time to consent publicly for the publication of that communication, then

09:34.400 --> 09:39.400
it is my opinion, Mr. Chairman, that we may proceed with Mr. Lucas.

09:39.400 --> 09:46.400
And I think it is unauthorized by Senator Barcaiwi to now make some public announcements with

09:46.400 --> 09:49.400
respect to whether he does or does not consent.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.400
I would like to do that.

09:50.400 --> 10:02.400
Senator Barcai, as I do the good to do, my position is that if we publish one conversation

10:02.400 --> 10:10.400
in Mr. Stephen and Senator Barcaiwi, then we must publish all of the conversations with Mr.

10:10.400 --> 10:15.400
Stephen and Barcaiwi and the members of the committee.

10:15.400 --> 10:22.400
In other words, I don't think Mr. Stephen can be in the position of selecting one conversation

10:22.400 --> 10:26.400
and using left and hiding all others.

10:26.400 --> 10:34.400
I would like to proceed with the interrogations of Mr. Lucas this time to find out just how

10:34.400 --> 10:37.400
many conversations they have monitored.

10:37.400 --> 10:45.400
For example, Mr. Jenkins, I know there are a number of conversations with other members of the committee.

10:45.400 --> 10:52.400
The interpretation of those conversations with the different, I know, using the words of Mr.

10:52.400 --> 10:59.400
Stephen's in line, I feel they were the purpose of finding to keep up from receiving with the investigation.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.400
Mr. Stephen's, I know, it is an interpretable conversation differently.

11:02.400 --> 11:08.400
And I would like to, this time, if we could, I don't feel strongly about it, certainly will

11:08.400 --> 11:10.400
abide by the chair's ruling.

11:10.400 --> 11:15.400
I would like to get Mr. Lucas a picture of just how they go about this monitoring,

11:15.400 --> 11:20.400
what they do is by mechanical device, whatever, whether they have verbating, verbatim,

11:20.400 --> 11:25.400
the transcripts of the conversation with all of the members of the committee on down the line.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.400
I think the chair makes a good point and he says that you have to do exactly the same thing

11:29.400 --> 11:36.400
with the conversation beside brother, not just the brothers, but the right hand answer to your question, Mr. Jenkins,

11:36.400 --> 11:37.400
again I say the same thing.

11:37.400 --> 11:44.400
I do think that all of the conversations regard up to other, there's a violation of all that's taken

11:44.400 --> 11:52.400
and this may be made of one of the lectures but not just one of the conversations on a specific date with Mr.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.400
Chairman.

11:53.400 --> 12:01.400
I quite agree with Mr. Senator and all monitors, conversations will be made available to the committee council.

12:01.400 --> 12:09.400
And he, he, he, he, he considers the material to this, he will fire, they will be introduced in evidence,

12:09.400 --> 12:16.400
provided the person on the other end of the wire, contempt to their being admitted as I understand

12:16.400 --> 12:17.400
that Senator now consent.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.400
No, no, no, Mr. Chairman.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.400
You're not going to do that.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.400
You're not going to, you're not going to select conversation.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.400
He can't.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
Just a minute, just a minute.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
You're not going to select conversation.

12:28.400 --> 12:34.400
We introduce one conversation in regard to this communist investigation.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
We are going to introduce all of them.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.400
I think the chair is a very concerned, I'm not the chairman but that is my position.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400
I think the chair is a very concerned, I'm not the chairman but that is my position.

12:41.400 --> 12:46.400
And I, my position is that no, no one person can keep any conversation out of this lecture.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.400
Once we start going to do this, Mr. Chairman, may I say this?

12:51.400 --> 12:54.400
I think Mr. Wump is a very concerned.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.400
I think the senator gets under strict measure.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.400
We are not choosing a disabled, what one goes in evidence.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.400
We are saying they will all be offered to committee council.

13:05.400 --> 13:12.400
And Mr. Jacobs may put any or all in the he considers material.

13:12.400 --> 13:18.400
So long as he either has the consent of the man on the other end of the telephone

13:18.400 --> 13:24.400
or the committee orders the witness to state them irrespective of the consent.

13:24.400 --> 13:30.400
Mr. Chairman, in order to clarify the question, it is my opinion.

13:30.400 --> 13:37.400
That all conversations between the respective parties for this controversy

13:37.400 --> 13:42.400
are properly admitted as evidence provided they are relevant.

13:42.400 --> 13:52.400
Irrespective of the consent of these parties, that all monitors conversation

13:52.400 --> 14:00.400
and all transcriptions of monitors conversation are likewise properly admitted

14:00.400 --> 14:06.400
provided that party on the other end gives his consent.

14:06.400 --> 14:12.400
The extended democracy does now unfiligate the deal his consent.

14:12.400 --> 14:21.400
Does he admission of a transcription of this monitor conversation of November 7th?

14:21.400 --> 14:27.400
Then I am ready to proceed with the introduction of proof.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.400
I do not know what to come in to me.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.400
Mr. Jacobs, I would like to ask you a question.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.400
I know what is the nature of the censor.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.400
I am here to ask one of the first things that I have planned to do.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.400
I have had to have done.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.400
As I said, I think that we are very thankful for that.

14:45.400 --> 14:51.400
If we find the laminated introduction of it, I propose the first qualifying.

14:51.400 --> 14:56.400
And I say that change of democracy is entitled to supplement my examination

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
and I think you are a senator.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
Yes, the senator does not consent.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.400
They will then become a matter for the committee to take up any second.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.400
That would be my view, sir.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.400
Yes, sir.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.400
It is a country where you call the President.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.400
Mr. Lucas.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.400
Mr. Lucas, you are the soleilist for the testimony you are about to give as a excuse.

15:45.400 --> 15:49.400
The whole truth is that nothing but the truth don't have to go.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.400
I so am the senator.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.400
Mr. Jacobs, you may remain in full favor.

15:56.400 --> 16:01.400
My name is John J. Lucas Jr.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.400
What is your official position with the Army?

16:04.400 --> 16:06.400
Are we Mr. Stevens?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.400
A flightman clerk to the Secretary of the Army.

16:09.400 --> 16:14.400
How long have you sent a appointment for the Secretary of the Army?

16:14.400 --> 16:21.400
Since December of 1949, on full time, what are your duties?

16:21.400 --> 16:31.400
In general, to help the Secretary in connection with his appointment and his telephone call.

16:31.400 --> 16:36.400
Are you an experienced reporter?

16:36.400 --> 16:44.400
That is, I mean, are you experienced in the thinking of a conversation or a dictation in short-hand?

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
Yes, sir.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.400
How much experience do you have?

16:49.400 --> 16:56.400
I went to a short-hand store for about five or six months.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.400
What was that?

16:59.400 --> 17:04.400
In about 1934.

17:04.400 --> 17:10.400
And then, sometime after I left, sure you ever been a court reporter.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.400
Not in an actual court.

17:12.400 --> 17:17.400
Have you ever held a position in which you were required to take dictation?

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
Yes, sir.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.400
And to make reports of theory.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
How much experience have you had in it?

17:23.400 --> 17:27.400
That particular line of work, Mr. Luther.

17:27.400 --> 17:32.400
During the war, I was with a joint chief of staff for about three years.

17:32.400 --> 17:38.400
And I sat in on meetings of committees of the joint chiefs of staff.

17:38.400 --> 17:44.400
And took notes with the proceedings and made transcripts.

17:44.400 --> 17:53.400
I'll ask you whether or not you consider yourself an expert in taking notes from dictation

17:53.400 --> 17:59.400
and in transcribing those notes to type.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.400
Yes, sir.

18:01.400 --> 18:05.400
I won the 200 Greg Diamond medal years ago.

18:05.400 --> 18:09.400
What the preliminary or academic education do you have?

18:09.400 --> 18:12.400
Four years of college.

18:12.400 --> 18:19.400
You are a college graduate, yes, sir.

18:19.400 --> 18:23.400
Are you able to state positive, Mr. Luther?

18:23.400 --> 18:28.400
And I, of course, know that you remember that you are unrolled.

18:28.400 --> 18:40.400
Are you able to state positive that a report you took, if you did take one on November 7,

18:40.400 --> 18:48.400
1853, doing a telephone conversation and taking the viewing shorthand,

18:48.400 --> 18:57.400
while accurately worked for work for Baton, set down in shorthand on your notes,

18:57.400 --> 19:01.400
it was substantially accurate.

19:01.400 --> 19:14.400
You are not the same as I said that it was accurate, word for word, verbatim.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.400
Is that correct?

19:18.400 --> 19:20.400
Is that correct?

19:20.400 --> 19:25.400
I cannot say that it was absolutely word for word verbatim.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.400
I may have a word here and there.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.400
I am not a interpretation of any of that.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.400
Are you the man who is making yourself the jet,

19:34.400 --> 19:40.400
whether or not he was substantially accurate or otherwise?

19:40.400 --> 19:43.400
How do you say it was substantially accurate?

19:43.400 --> 19:44.400
Yes, sir.

19:44.400 --> 19:55.400
I think it does ask that you are making yourself the soul and the excuse of just how much it's missed the mark,

19:55.400 --> 20:02.400
how much it came to getting a full accurate detail verbatim report.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
Is that correct?

20:03.400 --> 20:04.400
Yes, sir.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.400
Then you won't say as you sit there now.

20:08.400 --> 20:14.400
That is, you have, I think, a transcribe that you're not, besides.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.400
Yes, sir.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.400
You will not say as you sit there now.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.400
That's your transcribe.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.400
The garden we get to meet here has suddenly come up with new lighters,

20:23.400 --> 20:25.400
makes it impossible to see the witness.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.400
I wonder if we could have that light over there.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.400
Turn down the sun to hold.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.400
Just about two seconds ago came on, so we've been doing pretty well without,

20:36.400 --> 20:39.400
and I hope we can continue to do that.

20:39.400 --> 20:46.400
Mr. Chair, once again, that I ask Mr. James to not go too swiftly on his next question.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.400
Let's witness the answer if you will, sir.

20:48.400 --> 20:54.400
I think if you go a little more slowly, you perhaps get answers that are more accurate.

20:54.400 --> 21:00.400
Mr. Lucas, my question now is this.

21:00.400 --> 21:04.400
That as you sit there now at this moment,

21:04.400 --> 21:11.400
with your transcription of this telephonic conversation of November 7th before you,

21:11.400 --> 21:14.400
you will not tell this committee.

21:14.400 --> 21:23.400
That it is an absolutely perpy record, record, record, word-for-word,

21:23.400 --> 21:30.400
and verbatim of an alleged telephone conversation between Senator McCarty and Mr. Steven.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
Is that correct?

21:32.400 --> 21:38.400
It is not a word-for-word recording, sir.

21:38.400 --> 21:44.400
Face the further examination of this witness to the chair.

21:44.400 --> 21:51.400
Did I understand your last statement, Mr. Lucas, that it is not an act of its word-for-word verbatim account?

21:51.400 --> 21:55.400
I drop a few words from the conversation and making the note.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.400
A very few words I have to leave.

21:58.400 --> 22:03.400
May I inquire about just how it is monitoring done?

22:04.400 --> 22:10.400
You listen on the telephone recording and then play back to you or how do you get this text message?

22:10.400 --> 22:17.400
I listen on the telephone and at that time write notes in direct short answer.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.400
As they are taking place?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.400
Yes, sir.

22:21.400 --> 22:27.400
Is that your full-time house, down here monitoring telephone calls and that site?

22:27.400 --> 22:30.400
Is that your primary duties and responsibilities?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.400
It was one of my main duties.

22:32.400 --> 22:41.400
I also arranged, or helped with Secretary and just with his appointment.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.400
Is it customary procedure when telephone calls are received?

22:45.400 --> 22:49.400
The modern call of the Hill offices of Congressman and Senator,

22:49.400 --> 22:53.400
is for you to be called in to monitor those conversations with Mr. Lucas.

22:53.400 --> 22:58.400
The assistant exceptional for a senior who has worked out Senator McCarty and the incident.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.400
That process is the part of my duty, sir.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.400
All calls coming from the office of Senator McCarty.

23:05.400 --> 23:12.400
All calls coming in from the department of the best switchboard on which the Secretary of the Army speaks,

23:12.400 --> 23:17.400
unless the Secretary of the Army asks me not to let me.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.400
So it is standing up waiting for me?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.400
Yes, sir.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.400
I'll engage.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.400
You sit there with your shirt hand.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.400
No, sir.

23:25.400 --> 23:30.400
You get calls which don't for some particular reason.

23:30.400 --> 23:34.400
I'm glad the Secretary says, don't listen to this one, which might be a security case of such a threat.

23:34.400 --> 23:39.400
Is standard normal procedures issued and monitored these calls which come to you,

23:39.400 --> 23:40.400
regardless of when you come home?

23:40.400 --> 23:41.400
Yes, sir.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.400
It has been a normal procedure for years.

23:43.400 --> 23:47.400
There is one other exception.

23:47.400 --> 23:54.400
For example, I do not monitor telephone calls from our width members of the Secretary's family.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.400
Well, I, you said it was a misunderstanding.

23:58.400 --> 24:03.400
Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, I'm trying to get you standing up waiting for me.

24:03.400 --> 24:08.400
When did this procedure begin?

24:08.400 --> 24:11.400
I know many of my colleagues are going to be confused.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.400
These hearings are not going to be clear as a kid.

24:14.400 --> 24:20.400
I know that you mean how long has it been done in the office of the Secretary of the Army?

24:20.400 --> 24:22.400
We are sorry, you have to look.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
How long have you been doing it?

24:23.400 --> 24:31.400
I've been doing it since the time, well, I started doing the time of Secretary Royal.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.400
About like you, sir.

24:33.400 --> 24:40.400
About, well, in 1949, I was a substitute for a Secretary shot my predecessor.

24:40.400 --> 24:47.400
And he also listened on phone conversations and I understand his predecessor did.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.400
Sir, here are phone calls.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.400
These charges in 1949, that is spending up to operating procedures.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
Yes, sir.

24:56.400 --> 25:05.400
Your duties in that connection are limited to listening to phone calls to the office of the Secretary of the Army or the other monitor can call that you also listen.

25:05.400 --> 25:10.400
My duty is to monitor the Secretary's call.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.400
I have no other questions. I'm sorry.

25:14.400 --> 25:28.400
As I understand that has been no change whatsoever in procedures and practice with respect to taking notes on telephone calls that you began in 1949 or 1949.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.400
There have been some changes, yes, sir.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.400
What changes have been made under Secretary Steven?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.400
No change made under Secretary Steven.

25:42.400 --> 25:54.400
In other words, you are now following the same procedures and practices with respect to that part of your duties that you followed under the Secretary Steven's predecessor.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.400
Yes, sir.

25:55.400 --> 26:07.400
Are you saying these notes you made to your hand, note you took of the conversation, are not complete?

26:08.400 --> 26:15.400
They do not record each word that is spoken by the part is spoken.

26:15.400 --> 26:26.400
So I attempt to make them just as complete as I can, but the conditions are such that I cannot swear that they are word-for-word-compliant.

26:27.400 --> 26:41.400
Let me ask you if you undertake to get every word or you simply make sufficient notes so that you will have the information that will enable you to carry out your further duties with respect to the conversation.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.400
That's what I try my best to do.

26:44.400 --> 26:49.400
You try your best to get enough information from the conversation and to make no summits.

26:49.400 --> 26:56.400
So for your guidance, thereafter would respect the dissatisfaction and information to get the further services rendered.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.400
Is that correct?

26:57.400 --> 26:59.400
Yes, sir, that is correct.

26:59.400 --> 27:18.400
Now, all the okayies of this conversation that is in question, were you given any special instructions or any different instructions in the making of that telephone conversation to any others that you were taking in the portion of the conversation?

27:18.400 --> 27:23.400
In the course of your duties along with that time, no special instructions.

27:23.400 --> 27:33.400
Were you particularly alerted to be on the phone at that time and take notes of this conversation?

27:33.400 --> 27:38.400
Did the second day say that you get on the phone and take notes of this?

27:38.400 --> 27:39.400
No, sir.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.400
You did it in the normal course of duty.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
Yes, sir.

27:43.400 --> 27:49.400
But you cannot say that you got it full of complete enactment.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.400
That is correct, sir.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.400
I cannot say that.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.400
Let's damn on the side of the slide.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.400
Here.

27:55.400 --> 27:59.400
Well, it's not very much under any other questions.

27:59.400 --> 28:04.400
We'll be here on this point, except for the principles of the law.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.400
Let me ask this, however, uh...

28:07.400 --> 28:14.400
Mr. Wilkins, do you have an opinion as to whether or not the words that you may have dropped in the course of the conversation

28:14.400 --> 28:26.400
and not step down with him anyway, modify or distort or substantially change the meaning and the substance of the conversation at the time?

28:26.400 --> 28:45.400
My opinion is that I put down in my shorthand notebook, practically all of the conversation and the little that I may have met would have not altered the substance of what I did just now.

28:45.400 --> 28:53.400
You think even the best before you can take down perfectly everything that is said from two answers?

28:53.400 --> 29:09.400
No, I do not think it is possible to be 100 percent accurate in taking conversations over the telephone, apart from that matter in a large, round-table conference.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.400
You can make this.

29:12.400 --> 29:17.400
I don't think that's absolutely appropriate if I can get the procedure.

29:17.400 --> 29:22.400
I will use Marker a conversation.

29:22.400 --> 29:30.400
Do you have an opinion as to which sounds the words spoken by the parties on each end of the line?

29:30.400 --> 29:31.400
Where's the words?

29:31.400 --> 29:33.400
Where's the right substance?

29:33.400 --> 29:38.400
From Washington, the mutual network is bringing you a new on-the-spot coverage of the McCarthy Army hearing.

29:38.400 --> 29:43.400
Our coverage will continue after this 10-second pause for station identification.

29:43.400 --> 29:46.400
This is the mutual broadcasting system.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
Seven ten on your dial.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
W-O-I. New York.

29:50.400 --> 30:05.400
Back in Washington and mutual coverage is the McCarthy Army hearing before the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigation.

30:05.400 --> 30:09.400
Senator Jackson is now questioning the witness John L. Lucas.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.400
The beginning of the call.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.400
The where the physics of the call has been turned.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.400
I accept to get every word, word for, word.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.400
Now let me say you as now.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.400
What do you mean by that?

30:19.400 --> 30:24.400
You mean that all human beings are thought of all of them and make an error on the word?

30:24.400 --> 30:26.400
That's what you mean.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.400
I mean that.

30:27.400 --> 30:32.400
I mean also, if there may be a noise in the room, I may not be able to hear it perfectly.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.400
I may be distracted.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.400
Somebody might come up and try to stop them.

30:36.400 --> 30:41.400
Well, if that's true of the telephone conversation in question now before the committee,

30:41.400 --> 30:45.400
do you have any recollections of whether you...

30:45.400 --> 30:50.400
Do you need a certain word that you may have left out words or is it that you...

30:50.400 --> 30:52.400
I'm trying to say you may have.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.400
If you say five or seven minutes, you must have...

30:54.400 --> 30:58.400
I can say five or seven words that I left out of two words.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.400
Why did you be bothered with this?

31:01.400 --> 31:03.400
I don't know if it's my third.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.400
It's me.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.400
I don't know exactly.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
Did anyone have to delete them?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.400
No, I know.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.400
What am I sugary?

31:11.400 --> 31:15.400
Because that's what I marked in my books that indicated that I had as a spot where I did.

31:15.400 --> 31:21.400
You made a note that when you went along and connected with the taking down of the conversation in short-hand,

31:21.400 --> 31:25.400
you made a mark that I have some other notification at that point.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.400
Yes.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.400
They were all from the human complete trans-fifth of us.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.400
Yes.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.400
Is that right?

31:31.400 --> 31:32.400
Yes.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.400
I'm going to give that one.

31:34.400 --> 31:39.400
I'm asking what this particular telephone conversation again.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.400
The...

31:41.400 --> 31:45.400
The two have a certain word for answer.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.400
They have a certain meaning.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.400
They have a certain meaning.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.400
So reading the telephone, they have certain things.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.400
I'm not going to say they were in the body of the call.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.400
They're not in the reading.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.400
Thank you.
