00:00.000 --> 00:08.200
In view of these facts and because the document constitutes an unauthorized use of information,

00:08.200 --> 00:15.440
which is classified as confidential and for the reason previously stated, it is my opinion

00:15.440 --> 00:18.120
that it should not be made public.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.560
Concertior's Herbert Brown, L. Jr. Attorney General.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.560
You may step down and be informed.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.560
May it withstand the recess until 2.30 pm.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.560
Sir, that's a big error.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.560
The Secretary of the Justice, please.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.560
I'd like to make an honest statement.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.560
Many recesses have been gotten out here with you.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.560
We'd like to hear a reclam.

00:40.560 --> 00:44.560
I would like to be heard in this request before the recess.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.560
I think it's very important to request.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.560
Did the minister with the chair's permission?

00:49.560 --> 00:52.560
The chair is now thinking of a while.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.560
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to request now.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.560
We can get the committee back together.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.560
I will listen to you.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.560
I think time is of the else.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.560
I'd like to request now, Mr. Chairman.

01:06.560 --> 01:10.560
I'd like to request now, Mr. Chairman,

01:10.560 --> 01:13.560
for the chair's permission to be sent to the committee.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.560
Yes, that's right.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.560
Go ahead.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.560
I'm sorry.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.560
I'm so following the 21st session of the Senate Subcommittee hearings

01:26.560 --> 01:28.560
and the Army and McCarty dispute,

01:28.560 --> 01:30.560
the committee has recessed for the luncheon period.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.560
Following some rather heated and complex testimonies.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.560
Now, at 2.30 this afternoon, eastern daylight time.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.560
I'm there.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.560
I'm leaving.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.560
The chair has an announcement to make in connection

01:49.560 --> 01:53.560
with the manager's telephone calls before doing that.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.560
Following the meeting to order, he wants to start with the

01:56.560 --> 01:59.560
customary welcome to our guests in the committee room.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.560
And the customary welcome to the guests in the committee room.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.560
And the customary welcome to the guests in the committee.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.560
And the firm committee rule that there should be no manifestations

02:08.560 --> 02:12.560
of approval or disapproval from members of the audience at any time.

02:13.560 --> 02:18.560
And the officers who have done a perfectly splendid job in the chair's opinion

02:18.560 --> 02:20.560
of the colleagues who will hear this.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.560
A wonderful job.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.560
The officers continue to have the order from the chair without further

02:27.560 --> 02:30.560
and right to remove from the room a likely bit firmer.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.560
Anybody violating the conditions under which you entered the room,

02:33.560 --> 02:37.560
which were to be framed and manifestations of approval or disapproval.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.560
Now, Mr. Welch, I hope you will listen closely to the chair as he endeavors

02:41.560 --> 02:46.560
to state the status of things in connection with the manager telephone call

02:46.560 --> 02:51.560
because the chair is not entirely sure that he understands the picture.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.560
At least a penny in conformity with the agreement.

02:55.560 --> 03:00.560
All or any manager telephone calls are transcriptions,

03:00.560 --> 03:04.560
which might be in the position of any of the parties who are either

03:04.560 --> 03:06.560
the side of the current country,

03:06.560 --> 03:09.560
or the state of the current state.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.560
They were the penny some time ago with instructions that at the time

03:13.560 --> 03:16.560
they were assembled and transcribed,

03:16.560 --> 03:21.560
the parties were interested in submitting them to make out a certificate subsequently

03:21.560 --> 03:27.560
to be sworn to under oath that these were in fact a total presentation

03:27.560 --> 03:31.560
of all of the manager telephone conversations, all of the notebooks,

03:31.560 --> 03:34.560
all of the notebooks,

03:35.560 --> 03:39.560
yesterday I told the press after our executive station of yesterday known

03:39.560 --> 03:44.560
that we felt the time had come to finalize the presentation of those managers

03:44.560 --> 03:46.560
of the consultation committee council.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.560
And that we had advised the Army,

03:49.560 --> 03:53.560
and that we technicaled a metrathy side that by this noon,

03:53.560 --> 03:56.560
at the latest, we wanted those presentations made.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.560
Mr. Welch has advised the chair that they have run into some delay

04:01.560 --> 04:05.560
and some difficulty on the army side of this request,

04:05.560 --> 04:11.560
which stems from the fact that Mr. Welch is the manager.

04:11.560 --> 04:16.560
The manager is the telephone calls as testimony now shows that come in

04:16.560 --> 04:20.560
from wherever they come in with the exception of the White House,

04:20.560 --> 04:23.560
members of the Secretary's family or his personal friends.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.560
But he monitors them in the order in which they come,

04:26.560 --> 04:29.560
and they're all in notebooks

04:29.560 --> 04:33.560
where the consecutive telephone conversations are inclusive.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.560
Mr. Welch advises the committee as a consequence.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.560
When on occasion there is a security matter discussed,

04:41.560 --> 04:44.560
which under the executive order should not be disclosed,

04:44.560 --> 04:48.560
either periods in the notebook in the order in which the call happened

04:48.560 --> 04:53.560
or the taken under switchboard rather than in some separate notebooks.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.560
So he believes that it will be necessary for the Attorney General

04:56.560 --> 05:01.560
or somebody from his office to rule on each of the phone calls

05:01.560 --> 05:05.560
from the Stanford Security before they are presented.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.560
And so we run into the delay involved,

05:09.560 --> 05:14.560
and we run into the difficulty of making sure that all of the phone calls

05:14.560 --> 05:19.560
pertinent to this sensitivity are received to the satisfaction

05:19.560 --> 05:23.560
of all parties concerned as to their totality.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.560
We don't know just what the answer is, but that's the problem we confront.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.560
We still want to get to the monitor phone calls,

05:30.560 --> 05:32.560
we still want to confirm in the record,

05:32.560 --> 05:35.560
I think a way must be worked out perhaps whereby.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.560
A representative of the Attorney General's Office can be present

05:39.560 --> 05:45.560
to delete from the phone calls and the notebooks

05:45.560 --> 05:50.560
or black them out or something because the PD calls to the notebooks themselves

05:50.560 --> 05:55.560
and black them out so that we don't get information which we should not have.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.560
And some representations from the trial decided a country for these persons

05:59.560 --> 06:05.560
to make sure that we get all of the phone calls that I suppose to be included.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.560
That's the difficulty from the Army side of the presentation.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.560
I'm Mr. Welch.

06:09.560 --> 06:13.560
If I've indirectly stated that, I wish we'd take to the floor now on my time

06:13.560 --> 06:17.560
and straighten this out and attempt to try to tell the public in the press

06:17.560 --> 06:21.560
where we stand on the problem that you've been presented to the chair over and over and over again

06:21.560 --> 06:23.560
when you're going to get the phone call.

06:23.560 --> 06:28.560
Mr. Chairman, you have presented with your usual accuracy, sir.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.560
I would like to say a word about the position of Army.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.560
Council on the thing.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.560
I think everyone is understood.

06:34.560 --> 06:39.560
We want all of us to tell a phone call that our material indicate that it's proper to have them in.

06:39.560 --> 06:45.560
But we do have this serious security problem both as to the three.

06:45.560 --> 06:51.560
Mr. Welch is no book and perhaps a system of a call themselves.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.560
I can think of a comfortable answer to it.

06:55.560 --> 07:00.560
It's just to adopt a suggestion that somebody from the Department of Justice

07:00.560 --> 07:06.560
is sitting on the charting and tell us when we have a security matter

07:06.560 --> 07:08.560
and just ruin out.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.560
That's what has to be done.

07:10.560 --> 07:16.560
Nobody is opposed to the Department of Justice on us that I know of.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.560
But I think they surely will be a service to the committee if that.

07:21.560 --> 07:27.560
Well, even if the Jenkins and Raya personally had time to read these monitor telephone calls

07:27.560 --> 07:33.560
and I think I'm correct in saying no one's permission to take in stock as yet yet any of them.

07:33.560 --> 07:40.560
They have been kept under lock and key as both of those two such transcriptions as they are and as to the original notebook.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.560
So what therefore I really have nothing to what you said Mr. Chairman

07:44.560 --> 07:49.560
excessive I should think someone on the committee should approach the department just as much rather

07:49.560 --> 07:54.560
we're done by someone on the committee and they have a problem to them and get their assistance

07:54.560 --> 08:02.560
and bring these things to the party and so they can be brought into the courtroom and dealt with the committee wishes.

08:03.560 --> 08:09.560
Well, the council thinks that this might be a helpful suggestion in removing this particular road lock

08:09.560 --> 08:11.560
for greater progress in our hearing.

08:11.560 --> 08:19.560
Mr. Jenkins would assign somebody from his desk and you permit Mr. St. Clare to ask for the opposition

08:19.560 --> 08:25.560
to meet after the hearing is asked and then the people that we cannot work out with the Department of Justice

08:25.560 --> 08:28.560
and any other party can follow the notice of the running.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.560
Well, by looking smart, come on, just long, laborious jobs.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.560
Give me not be so long on the board, I don't pay a dear sir.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.560
Long before you get the job done and the other gets rough.

08:38.560 --> 08:45.560
I have to admit for a note, some will stop so that Mr. St. Clare is very, very badly needed by me on something else.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.560
I'd be happy to have him do that.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.560
I have that for us and it's a day.

08:49.560 --> 08:54.560
And it's my duty to have some other member of the staff that be assigned from your standpoint as the committee.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.560
Oh, yes, sure that they can find some of the others.

08:56.560 --> 09:05.560
Will he meet whoever is assigned and with Mr. Jenkins office after the hearing is asked and gladly sirs to harvest the Zoll and it is in my own manner.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
All right.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
Mr. Johnson.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
Mr. Bryant.

09:08.560 --> 09:13.560
One further, my first concern is telephone calls.

09:13.560 --> 09:18.560
Mr. Hensville would also show us today's phenomena in that my heart.

09:18.560 --> 09:36.560
And Mr. Hensville is prepared to make whatever appropriate specifically under those or otherwise the counts to make suggest to the effect that he has no monitor telephone calls, no transcription, and that is phone with no time monitor during any of the periods in question.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.560
The drug has to be fulfilled by that problem very easily.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.560
I will read his end of the game with the correct answer.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.560
Mr. Chairman.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.560
Mr. Ponderpatter.

09:47.560 --> 09:57.560
Mr. Chairman, I wish to restate again that we get in the second or the third week or the end of the second week.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.560
Are they hearing?

09:58.560 --> 10:06.560
No, I don't know how the other members feel, but I feel as if I just set into the hearings and bring bars.

10:06.560 --> 10:18.560
And I know that certainly the persons who have been more active than us and the kind of persons and I must be equally worried.

10:18.560 --> 10:22.560
We know that we have many other important duties to attend.

10:22.560 --> 10:33.560
Now, if I could foresee that just hearing what's out and through them before a deal for future, I wouldn't make any request that I know about to make.

10:33.560 --> 10:41.560
But I can't see from any end in sight for many days, weeks or months.

10:41.560 --> 10:51.560
Therefore, I wish to move at the time, Mr. Chairman, that we have the conclusion of hearing the facts in them.

10:52.560 --> 11:07.560
So we reach that until Tuesday morning, that in order for us to take care of some of our other important business, we have the staff art liaison, which has been debated on the fall of the Senate.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.560
Many of us would like to participate in that debate.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.560
Many of us would like to prepare for that debate.

11:13.560 --> 11:26.560
So, in our brief, that's the participant, committee and the public, for greatly benefit by reaching out to Tuesday morning.

11:26.560 --> 11:32.560
I so wish to join Mr. Chairman, Senator Mozilla.

11:33.560 --> 11:39.560
So, I would like to say that Senator Mozilla to reach that tomorrow, to me on scale Tuesday morning.

11:39.560 --> 11:46.560
I would like to reach that, that conclusion of hearing tonight until Tuesday morning.

11:46.560 --> 11:54.560
So, I'll give a pardon, and Monday, when the staff of the act will be debated on the fall of the Senate.

11:54.560 --> 12:01.560
I worked on that bottle piece of legislation, take care of other duties, which I know that all of them do have to take care of.

12:01.560 --> 12:09.560
And I'm sure that the participants in the Army and the desire for that other rest.

12:09.560 --> 12:20.560
Mr. Chairman, the problem, I will hold the search for two motion that we reach that tomorrow at noon until Monday morning.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.560
I don't think this is good.

12:25.560 --> 12:29.560
So, here's no second to any motion that has been made so far.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.560
Second motion.

12:31.560 --> 12:36.560
Moved by President McClellan and seconded by President Jackson.

12:36.560 --> 12:44.560
But in the nature of the substitute, well, they will be the Senate's Martins of Year, Florida, and it's fine that they're the Chief Sub-Sutes.

12:44.560 --> 12:53.560
We reached that tomorrow morning, on till Monday morning, not where you are.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.560
The afternoon, in fact, in tomorrow will be the test with, and that's all.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.560
Power for discussion.

12:58.560 --> 13:02.560
And on the table, we have a full section open.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.560
I believe was that there will be folks tomorrow afternoon.

13:08.560 --> 13:13.560
And not like in the game, that I may be, but...

13:13.560 --> 13:36.560
But I, in mind, was that this committee should work at all times for extra-night tea-stereys, and we can work until the morning, and then we can attend over until Monday morning, and we do work, and it's necessary to share into the afternoon of Monday or the afternoon tea-stakes, through May 2nd, so...

13:36.560 --> 13:45.560
But I, in a little effort to postpone these shares, one instead is not absolutely necessary.

13:45.560 --> 13:57.560
I have written here, and I, I was before my original motion, but rather than to have a discussion on it, I will accept these.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.560
I remember that offer by the distinguished members of the March itself.

14:02.560 --> 14:09.560
The other motion made, and I'm sure it's here to all members of the committee, which are just to meaning in some sense that we...

14:09.560 --> 14:12.560
We've had to hear each tomorrow afternoon.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.560
Is there any further questions?

14:14.560 --> 14:16.560
I read it for questions.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.560
Those in favor say aye.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.560
I'll try and know.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.560
The motion is prepared.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.560
I have no further questions.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.560
The chair has no questions.

14:28.560 --> 14:33.560
If the chair has any questions, I may have to send it to my left.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.560
No questions.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.560
I'll get the chair in the second now.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.560
I think it's a little...

14:41.560 --> 14:43.560
No questions.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.560
The chair is fired.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.560
I'll send it to the chair.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.560
The chair is fired.

14:53.560 --> 14:59.560
I'll take that to the next room.

14:59.560 --> 15:04.560
But before I do that, I wonder if the chair is failing itself.

15:04.560 --> 15:11.560
We suggest that the monetary commission be examined by council for the...

15:11.560 --> 15:16.560
The future statements and the future atoms and council for the committee.

15:16.560 --> 15:23.560
I gather from that he was including anyone from my side of the aisle.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.560
No.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.560
What does it matter?

15:25.560 --> 15:26.560
I made a chair.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.560
I just had a unit with the security.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.560
Which one should the eliminate and the stand for security?

15:30.560 --> 15:31.560
The attorney general?

15:31.560 --> 15:36.560
Well, with the chairman, I was wondering all of the black stuff.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.560
So, I think the chair said that if Mr. Welk...

15:40.560 --> 15:42.560
Well, it was Welk's...

15:42.560 --> 15:44.560
I think it would have been my two minutes.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.560
I think the chair said that if the somebody from the committee could be present.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.560
What did that say?

15:49.560 --> 15:50.560
That's what I thought.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.560
What's the term on this morning where...

15:52.560 --> 15:56.560
I have no authority to give you clarity with Mr. Welk.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.560
Or if you knew that, Mr. Attorney General,

15:58.560 --> 16:00.560
and you got me, but it's not as committee as well.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.560
I was going on all parties, ever since.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.560
Mr. Smith, what's the term?

16:05.560 --> 16:07.560
I know what's the role.

16:08.560 --> 16:12.560
Mr. Brown, according to 54, they report.

16:12.560 --> 16:17.560
Well, as red, I like to lead Mr. Brown, and regard to...

16:17.560 --> 16:20.560
In regard to...

16:20.560 --> 16:26.560
The 15-day Jeremy document, and the two-day quarter page...

16:26.560 --> 16:28.560
Not from the past, a minute.

16:28.560 --> 16:33.560
Well, I know Mr. Brown, what Brown, I know is what her,

16:33.560 --> 16:39.560
but the material cannot be submitted many forms.

16:39.560 --> 16:45.560
The chair will recall last night, I suggest that we delete any security information.

16:45.560 --> 16:51.560
Anything that could indicate the sorts of information informants, etc.

16:51.560 --> 16:57.560
That has all been deleted from this two-in-a-four-to-page document, as far as I can tell.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.560
As the CERAN-O's, this has been authenticated.

17:01.560 --> 17:07.560
So the target, one, two, three, four, six, four, seven, and eight,

17:07.560 --> 17:12.560
which is in our body of the letter for a document, so what you might.

17:12.560 --> 17:17.560
With the exception of the man as an actor,

17:17.560 --> 17:20.560
as a man of the...

17:20.560 --> 17:22.560
I'm random from Zadger Cooper.

17:22.560 --> 17:26.560
And with the term, I think to the view of the important public.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.560
Now Mr. Brown, I want to be called in executive session.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.560
I think you should be questioning, as the other are not there,

17:33.560 --> 17:36.560
if anything, in this two-in-a-half page document other than the name,

17:36.560 --> 17:40.560
has suggested a delete of a security nature.

17:40.560 --> 17:45.560
As I read, Mr. Chairman, I'm sure the Attorney General will have to agree that...

17:45.560 --> 17:49.560
This may be embarrassing to some people.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.560
Embarrassing those tribes with the security of our military, but that's it.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.560
You know we involve security.

17:57.560 --> 18:02.560
Now, I may say Mr. Chairman, that we have a precedent for releasing material.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.560
As the CERAN-O, Mr. Brown, I only made a teaching Chicago,

18:06.560 --> 18:08.560
sometime ago.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.560
We named the NUCTY Live Aspires, which we're discussing here,

18:12.560 --> 18:17.560
who are still tribes that are right there over the Douglas Mammative Nation VISTA before.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.560
We named a very important debt spy.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.560
I don't criticize him for that.

18:23.560 --> 18:28.560
I think that his information with the public should have had long ago.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.560
He was his graph.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.560
He was present. He was criticized for that.

18:33.560 --> 18:36.560
He then made public.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.560
At the hour, sports time authorized to play by Mr. Robert Morris,

18:40.560 --> 18:45.560
Mr. Judge Morris, who was the chief counsel of the committee for whom he appeared.

18:45.560 --> 18:49.560
And out of that time, he made available to the committee.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.560
For sure, the last FBI effort which had never been disclosed before.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.560
Again, I say I don't criticize him for that.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.560
He didn't make available any information.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.560
I think it was a job well done.

19:00.560 --> 19:04.560
But he has established a trust in his famous chairman.

19:04.560 --> 19:11.560
But as the chair well knows, I have never, during the entire course of my investigation.

19:11.560 --> 19:15.560
I have never disclosed the name of a singling formant.

19:15.560 --> 19:20.560
And the chairman of this document here is a very, very sharp way to keep out the name of any informants,

19:20.560 --> 19:23.560
or the thought of any information.

19:23.560 --> 19:28.560
I think the chair knows that also that I have never obtained any information from the FBI.

19:28.560 --> 19:33.560
But when I received FBI material which is disseminated,

19:33.560 --> 19:37.560
and is in the hands of loyalty board members with communist records,

19:37.560 --> 19:42.560
I can no longer respect any classification of them.

19:42.560 --> 19:46.560
In other words, one of the things that is in the conduit available to communist,

19:46.560 --> 19:51.560
I think maybe that I have no authority to keep this material secret.

19:51.560 --> 19:55.560
I don't intend to remain as famous a chairman of this time.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.560
It's my request that I can button make of the chair.

19:58.560 --> 20:04.560
But as far as I have spoken, and as far as there is no formant directive or any other directive,

20:04.560 --> 20:09.560
which is designed not to the security of the nation,

20:09.560 --> 20:14.560
but to prevent embarrassing, although responsible for covering a communist,

20:14.560 --> 20:19.560
no such direction will keep me from making available to the public.

20:19.560 --> 20:27.560
The type of information that we have here showing growth and neglect, which are terminated.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.560
I think the claim is from when we should decide at the committee.

20:31.560 --> 20:36.560
I have addressed this to my Democrat colleagues, as well as the Republican colleagues.

20:36.560 --> 20:43.560
But I'm not sure if forever continue operating under that troon blackout order of 1948.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.560
I'd like to Mr. Brown out.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.560
Hello, for example.

20:47.560 --> 20:53.560
But progress has been made on the recorded attempt by the Justice Department,

20:53.560 --> 20:56.560
or the chair will recall their new story.

20:56.560 --> 21:03.560
I believe about a year ago, maybe more of the Justice Department have been ordered to study the troon blackout direction

21:03.560 --> 21:06.560
to the views of the Senate and make more information available to the committee.

21:06.560 --> 21:10.560
I would like to question Mr. Brown now as to what progress has been made.

21:10.560 --> 21:20.560
I would like to also make it very clear to the American people that I have made a solemn promise to them that I did

21:20.560 --> 21:26.560
to close the coast last year that they would get rid of my Democrat friends who liked us

21:26.560 --> 21:31.560
that we would no longer be honoring these blackout orders.

21:31.560 --> 21:36.560
I think this is a good time Mr. Chairman to have this order.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.560
I don't think that a congressional committee is bound.

21:40.560 --> 21:45.560
If I may have the chair of the Senate, I don't think that any congressional committee is bound.

21:45.560 --> 21:51.560
But the opinion of anyone in the executive, as a fellow and fellow, is rightful talking to me.

21:51.560 --> 21:58.560
I think the committee must determine that matter for themselves, looking closing with the Chairman.

21:59.560 --> 22:07.560
I want to again point out that this letter, well no great significant opinion of itself,

22:07.560 --> 22:19.560
is part of a sequence of letters showing that there has been an astronaut, a dash, a Russian, in normal secret, right out of the laboratory.

22:20.560 --> 22:27.560
And the sequence of reports from Mr. Chairman, in my opinion, will convince anyone to exercise a good common sense

22:27.560 --> 22:34.560
that we have no fix it from the coming of the Civil War by any kind of concerns,

22:34.560 --> 22:37.560
but the very serious situation to make with the Chairman.

22:37.560 --> 22:43.560
And if it is true, then we should get to the bottom and find out who is responsible.

22:44.560 --> 22:51.560
And I may say that I am getting very very weary of sitting here and acting as though we're playing some little game in this committee,

22:51.560 --> 22:56.560
this committee, that says these may well determine for this nation to deliver that.

22:56.560 --> 23:04.560
We've got to clean up the growth of responsibility to Chairman and to concession those responsible,

23:04.560 --> 23:08.560
either knowingly or because they were simple dooms.

23:08.560 --> 23:13.560
Covering up constant players, not dead ones of the lives.

23:13.560 --> 23:22.560
And I have the Attorney General be called an executive session so we can question him as to what information can be made available to this committee,

23:22.560 --> 23:26.560
and what information can be made available to the public period.

23:26.560 --> 23:31.560
The Sanders question is a little long, but the chair will never answer it if he can.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.560
I think it has two parts.

23:34.560 --> 23:42.560
The first part is whether or not the Attorney General has ruled on the admissibility of the two-and-a-quarter page,

23:42.560 --> 23:47.560
the two-and-a-quarter page, the chair must confess he has not read.

23:47.560 --> 23:54.560
The chair will have to say that in his letter of transmission, he encroached the letter which the senator refers to,

23:54.560 --> 23:58.560
and helped specifically the question of the Attorney General, whether or not he is a pinion,

23:58.560 --> 24:03.560
and it would be injurious to the nice for security to have a spread in the rest.

24:03.560 --> 24:08.560
And the reply of the Attorney General is on the affirmative that he thought it would be injurious.

24:08.560 --> 24:12.560
If the senator from Wisconsin desires to have me read another letter,

24:12.560 --> 24:19.560
indicating whether certain changes of that two-and-a-quarter page, the two-and-a-quarter page letter can be introduced, I'll be happy to do that.

24:19.560 --> 24:24.560
The answer to the second part of the question is whether the chair believes he's following Attorney General in,

24:24.560 --> 24:29.560
for the Monday old and asking why he decided as he did, the chair would answer that question

24:29.560 --> 24:32.560
and the negative of a piece overruled by his colleague on the committee.

24:32.560 --> 24:39.560
Mr. Chairman, this is a more serious matter and I don't think it should be this close to the moment.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.560
I don't, I think Mr. Chairman with the graduate take,

24:43.560 --> 24:52.560
sitting in mind that a vast number of critical health in various bureaus have access

24:52.560 --> 24:55.560
to the distribution of these letters.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.560
I think it's a great mistake for the governor to say, well, we can't even speak out.

24:59.560 --> 25:05.560
The governor's most difficult to perform their duty must leave the sequence of letters from the FBI.

25:05.560 --> 25:09.560
And what they point out today, after day, after day,

25:09.560 --> 25:14.560
for the danger situation you have in our top secret radar laboratory,

25:14.560 --> 25:21.560
and with the term unless we do that, unless the numbers of committee can see those reports,

25:21.560 --> 25:25.560
after there has been deleted the names of informants,

25:25.560 --> 25:29.560
it will be impossible for this committee to determine the extent

25:29.560 --> 25:38.560
to which we have had rules, negligence, putting it mildly, or work in various departments or governments.

25:38.560 --> 25:45.560
Unless Mr. Chairman, the members of this committee can see those excellent reports submitted by the FBI.

25:45.560 --> 25:53.560
It will be impossible for the members of this committee to know why, why they commend us efforts have been made to call this committee off,

25:53.560 --> 25:57.560
the investigation of the disclosure of communist and government.

25:57.560 --> 26:01.560
Mr. Chairman, again I say we're not playing any game here.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.560
You think we've heard the way we've been banning these things back and forth,

26:04.560 --> 26:08.560
but we're getting right down with Mr. Chairman at the point where the blue chips are down.

26:08.560 --> 26:13.560
And if we neglect Mr. Chairman, if we neglects to get to the bottom of the pack,

26:13.560 --> 26:16.560
because of some true murder of 1948,

26:16.560 --> 26:21.560
then every one of us sitting at this table should not be in the tunnel.

26:21.560 --> 26:25.560
The chair is in no position to override the ruling of the Attorney General.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.560
He submitted it in writing, got an answer back in writing,

26:28.560 --> 26:31.560
and suggest therefore the decision to resign to the prosecutor's office.

26:31.560 --> 26:34.560
Mr. Chairman, why may it be if any general defences?

26:34.560 --> 26:44.560
Mr. Chairman, does the chair take position that a committee of the Senate cannot differ with an appointed officer,

26:44.560 --> 26:48.560
the Attorney General, certainly the chair doesn't take that position.

26:48.560 --> 26:55.560
Mr. Chairman, if the Attorney General has some good reasons why these documents should not be made available to the committee,

26:55.560 --> 27:00.560
he should not be rational about coming down the executive session and telling us why Mr. Chairman,

27:00.560 --> 27:05.560
he can do it, as he did in the Harry Dixon White case in the case of a dead spy,

27:05.560 --> 27:14.560
he can delete the security information and give us the information showing the type of reports the FBI did some,

27:14.560 --> 27:22.560
then we can check into this matter and find out who was responsible for ignoring Mr. Chairman's reports.

27:22.560 --> 27:28.560
And there's always been God's Earth, Mr. Chairman, why the Attorney General should not be called executive session

27:28.560 --> 27:35.560
and made two answers why the parts of these letters, how having to do with security,

27:35.560 --> 27:41.560
but which might be awfully embarrassing, I agree, to some people why they should not be made available,

27:41.560 --> 27:48.560
number one to the members of the committee, and then the next question whether or not they should not be made available to the public.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.560
I think both.

27:49.560 --> 27:57.560
Hi, I again asked the Chair, I asked the Chair to not to move upon this in the forum, what is too important?

27:57.560 --> 28:04.560
I asked him to call an executive session this committee and a good of that in detail and make a decision.

28:04.560 --> 28:12.560
I think the plan is to come, Mr. Chairman, when we should see Chairman Pouder and not the Congress as a power to get the necessary information

28:13.560 --> 28:20.560
to guard the security of this nation, we can get Mr. Chairman, we can get information about dishonesty, about corruption, about drag,

28:20.560 --> 28:28.560
but it seems we cannot get information about something a thousand times worse than with reason.

28:28.560 --> 28:35.560
And Mr. Chairman, I asked the executive session and if we want them to throw, decide this question of Pouder and not.

28:36.560 --> 28:40.560
We are the lacking to obey a free rule rule.

28:40.560 --> 28:46.560
A decision made by someone in the executive department, the head of the executive department,

28:46.560 --> 28:51.560
because he has a standing rule that will have any member of the committee or any of the council,

28:51.560 --> 28:55.560
if they are the having executive session called to discuss the business of the committee, he will call.

28:55.560 --> 28:59.560
I would like to call one of the two presenters to request any technical session.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.560
Mr. Chairman.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.560
Mr. Chairman.

29:03.560 --> 29:06.560
Mr. Chairman, you're the right.

29:21.560 --> 29:28.560
Mr. Secretary, all of the lunch hour, have you had the opportunity to refresh your recollection?

29:28.560 --> 29:38.560
So you can now tell me whether or not you spoke with me on the telephone concerning the calling of a member of the loyalty for which I clear-spirited comments.

29:38.560 --> 29:45.560
No, I remember that you called me as my home occasionally, but I do not remember the substance of the conversation.

29:45.560 --> 29:52.560
I would think that I believe that this is the only time I ever called you at your home and the only time I ever spoke with you at your home,

29:52.560 --> 29:55.560
and I believe that what Saturday night are compulsory first.

29:55.560 --> 30:00.560
On my desk, sir, do you have a monitor on your phone telephone as well as your other phone?

30:00.560 --> 30:05.560
No, sir. Do you have any type of recording to keep notes that I take?

30:05.560 --> 30:13.560
So, to refresh your recollection with the secretary, I would suggest you, sir, that on the night of our compulsory first,

30:13.560 --> 30:18.560
following a conversation between Mr. Adams and myself, I had a conversation with you.

30:18.560 --> 30:31.560
And would you state it would be personally embarrassing to you if the facts were made known that a member of your loyalty for themselves had come in his front record?

30:31.560 --> 30:35.560
I absolutely have no recollection of any substance conversation.

30:35.560 --> 30:47.560
Mr. Secretary, I now hand to you a news article which appeared, I believe, the night of our compulsory first concerning the exposure of a member of your loyalty for having his come in his front record in F,

30:47.560 --> 30:55.560
whether or not it says not to refresh your recollection, and whether or not it says not to stress this article with me over the telephone.

31:17.560 --> 31:25.560
No, that doesn't help, Mike. The member is far as any telephone conversation is confirmed.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.560
Well, sir, maybe I can approach it this way.

31:28.560 --> 31:36.560
Do you recall, sir, that there was a time when this committee at the direction of Senator McCarthy asked to have some heavy force?

31:36.560 --> 31:39.560
A member of the secretary?

31:47.560 --> 31:50.560
You
