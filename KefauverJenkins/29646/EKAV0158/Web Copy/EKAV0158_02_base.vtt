WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
He has heard before you're admitted, didn't he?

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Yes, sir.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
He did.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
I was not there, I was there.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
I know you weren't there, Mr. Staden's security.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
You discussed this with us, and you know about it, did you not?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
I was.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Why, you removed him from the loyalty panel after he was called before our committee, didn't you, sir?

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
I don't recall it. I'll look it up and say.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Did you hear me, Mr. Sutter?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
I don't remember.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Brother, you removed the man from the loyalty panel.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
After he was called before our committee, and after he was exposed,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
so I've had communist connections.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
I was, I'm a party, I have a lot of things to do with Secretary Army, and I don't know about every move or every rotation

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
that's made off of loyalty for him.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll look it up and see if I can find out the fact, but I do not throw it around in my mind, I simply can't.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Would you consult Mr. Adams to give other information?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
But to Adams will test the final point.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
Mr. Stevens, you told us a dozen times, and I'll let you let all these people around just so you can get the information that you can't remember.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I want to know whether or not you're moved.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Why, I want to know whether or not you're moved.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Why, I want to let Mr. Adams test the fly on the thing, but he knows about first hand.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
This Secretary might be so slow to turn around and ask you.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
You're first your recollection, because you are the family order.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
I think Mr. Adams should be allowed to test the fly on the thing that he knows about first hand, and if it is not a thorough proper procedure,

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
for me to continually have to be satisfying on things that Mr. Adams knows and it's a positive pull me.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Mr. Secretary, any amicably just, if that thing will be helpful to you in pancing that question.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Now the question appears to be very simple.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
And it is whether or not you know that a member of your security lawyer, the board, was removed from the board.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
I think he had been questioned in a session of the McCarthy Investigating Committee.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Now, do you know of your own knowledge, or from what Mr. Adams told you?

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Are any other person told you whether or not such a thing occurred?

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
I know Mr. Jenkins that there are changes in those boards repeating.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
After whether or not there was a change made immediately after a man paid before us and in the McCarthy Committee, I honestly don't know.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
That's a perhaps a partial answer.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
And Mr. Secretary, however, not a four-witcher.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
And the question, have I faced the question correctly?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yes, of course, Mr. Secretary.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
Now, Mr. Secretary, there's no disposition on my part that caught anyone we're trying to get along.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
And the question is this, I repeat, do you either know of your own knowledge or do you have information from Mr. Secretary?

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
No, I don't. I cannot remember whether or not to remove that after that.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
That's what I'm about to say.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Mr. Chairman, is that a mistake?

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Mr. Chairman, is that a mistake?

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Mr. Chairman, is that a mistake?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Yes, that's a mistake.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Mr. Chairman, is that a mistake?

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
Mr. Chairman, is it true that you point the members of that board?

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
There are recommendations made for me, and I think it's my thought, Mr. Chairman.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
It's a part of my name.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
So it's in there removed in your name?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
That's right.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, I just asked you, do you the fact that you can't remember whether or not to remove this man?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Move the fact that you are the man who let it take the action.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
I merely asked you to refresh your recollection by bringing him to Mr. Adams as you did just now.

03:43.000 --> 03:55.000
And I'm not talking about any action in this madam's part.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm talking about action on your part that you and you alone can testify to.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I just say you don't remember.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I ask you now if you won't refresh your recollection by turning to one of them.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
The busy layers you have around you.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
And then after doing that, if you still can't tell us, well and good.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I think Mr. Adams will testify on that.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
For Mr. Secretary, there is no objection on the part of anyone.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm sure none on the part of the committee.

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
He is now turning to Mr. Adams and having him refresh your recollection on that point of impact.

04:31.000 --> 04:43.000
I'd like to make a move here before I do that there are thousands of actions taken in the name of the Secretary of the Army for the Earth War for the Navy, but they know nothing about.

04:43.000 --> 04:53.000
It's just utterly inconceivable that a Secretary of military departments will possibly know of all the actions that are taken in his name.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
If I don't know about the removal of one man from one board, it's no unusual thing.

04:58.000 --> 05:13.000
Let me assure you there would be no criticism of your father's concern merely suggesting that no harm can come now from a 10 minute conference with Mr. Adams to determine whether or not he can refresh your recollection and make a nice on something else.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Mr. Secretary, I may like a very clear on behalf of the Sun Committee.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Certainly, we think your statement is 100% correct.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
There must be a great many action you take if you cannot remember that you're taken in your name.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And certainly there is no criticism of you.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
The planning because you're aged to have brought with you that we have suggested you properly brought with you for that purpose.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
To consult with you, you can be expected in oil.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
And the interest of moving you're hearing along is when you need your consultant's company.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
It's certainly nothing you prefer about your asking.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
For Mr. Adams, before he works for the purpose of pacifying, he's to be a witness.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
You know, there is a lot of money that you both see out here.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
Now, for a hair, they first have special knowledge and certain fields that I may want to refer to and are not expected to be one.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
You may consult with any of the age, you may have had an intimidation, you get to see age in here.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
We look like elements.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
So I found a conversation with the Assistant to look at it.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
There's a difference between refreshing a man's recollection, which is always proper.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
And this is the goal of something that he does not recall and will expect to be repeated.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Powerful as to this committee.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
I don't suppose, Mr. Adams, electing him a question will actually be expected.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Like I found it out along with Mr. Wershund, there are many other subjects.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
I certainly see no objection to it.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
All right?

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
He's been a lot of time discussing it and it could have been determined in just a minute to go out.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
So many to go out and say.

06:39.000 --> 06:52.000
I just don't, this is somewhat extensive discussion I'm having here.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Not just the yesterday, no business.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
And I don't feel that I'll be able to answer that question for a considerable period of time until I go into it and get the facts and come back here.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
It's prepared to testify.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
If that's what you want me to do, I'll put Mr. Adams on about him.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Mr. Chairman, ask him just five minutes.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm not sure that'll be long enough.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
All right.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
The Secretary, there's nothing that would be long enough.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
May the Secretary just, if that question requires, along the country, even in five minutes,

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
that you make your turn to switch in during the question to easy and we defer the answer that particularly questions are tomorrow.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
The other, as you know, would be to refer to the Secretary's recollection.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Mr. Secretary, can I ask?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
To refer to recollection.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Mr. Chairman, I will.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I have to say that you call the President now that he's held what?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
What is wrong?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I have no objection now.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
The rest of their certain facts have been proven by more than one witness.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
And apparently, the Senator has a right to question the Secretary's on the witness stand.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
And the fact that Mr. Adams knows about it does not seem to like to say, being asked about it.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Tell me I have this question for the Secretary's part.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Here's the re-objection.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
On the part of the McCarthy staff, Senator McCarthy's staff.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
For the purposes of refreshing the Secretary's recollection, and in order to enable us to get along,

08:15.000 --> 08:23.000
the right to name a rep person and not make it public now, and place it to him and letting him see that name and see whether or not that profession is.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Not only did we write his name, but I believe we furnish Mr. Stevens' council.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Well, if we rewrite it now and place it to him and not make it a matter of public record,

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
and if that does not replace his recollection, I would say nothing would and that we ought to place to another point of inquiry.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Mr. Jack, as I just want to make it clear that this is a...

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
This is not one of the thousand, okay?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
This is...

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have been so...

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
We'll be no further talk.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Now, if you look at that...

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
If you look at this, Mr. Secretary, can I ask you whether or not you and I,

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
doesn't discuss this particular case at the Pentagon today, you invited me and my staff over for lunch.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I don't recall having seen that name before.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
Will you recall that you've called me later, and if you don't recall I wish you'd checked your monitor, called me.

09:17.000 --> 09:27.000
You've called me an apologize for the safety of Mr. Adam to make it a fact that he said that this man did not spend this charge.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Half-line told the President he had been this charge.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
How sure I have no recollection.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
No recollection at all.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
That's correct.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Now that you have the name of this man, Mr. Stevens, and you, the bank, if you are the individual,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
who removed and if he was removed,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
you are the manager of the final action.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Said you turn around and talk to Mr. Adams.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
I assume he can refresh your recollection because Mr. Welk said this stated that Mr. Adams had testified of it.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
With my am asking you the answer is because it is your act, not Mr. Adams.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Just turn on talking.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Now, I'll take it.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
I'll take some time.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
This is a complicated saying.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I'm not about to help the no answer.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Now, if you want to be fresh for a while, then you talk to Mr. Adams about being left,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
but you come back.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'll take this now, Mr. Chairman.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
To take it.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
To the purposes of resolving brilliant family and for all time,

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
thanks to this one question that we do have the Secretary of mouth and the same.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
And call Mr. Adams for the one specific question of one only.

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
And that is whether or not a member of the law of his security forward was removed from that panel,

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
the answer he has been questioned by as a representative of the party investigating the case.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Maybe as you get to our objection, I think that the figures you will be following Mr. Adams is standing for.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm just following the first testimony about Mr. Welk's proposal and that he must be looking for help in doubt.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Mr. David did?

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Mr. Adams, did you know to testify on the one point of local?

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
Mr. Adams, on the one point of all,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
you have seen the name of the gentleman with his cousin, have you not?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I have.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
You've seen that on the floor of the table.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
We just handed up the Mr. Stephen.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I have.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
And for this man, a member,

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
I just mentioned a member of the Lawy of the Security Council.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
The Lawy of the Security Screening Board of the Office of the Secretary of the Army,

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
who had the answer where you present in New York on the 30th day of our poll,

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
1953, when this member of the Lawy of the Security Training Board of the Secretary of the Army

11:42.000 --> 11:51.000
gave testimony and answered questions, put it in concerning his own permanent front activity.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
I was present in New York when this man was interrogated.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
If your question needs further amplification,

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
because there is some difference of opinion as to whether or not he was on the Lawy of the Security Screening Board at that time.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
May I explain it fully?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yes, sir.

12:10.000 --> 12:18.000
I would first ask you that did he not say on that day that he was then and there a member of the Lawy of the Security Screening Board?

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
And I have reference to say, I think 14...

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
14, 20 of this testimony was referred to you with Mr. Walter's request from two days ago,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
so you could be prepared, especially.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Was that not the testimony of this gentleman on that day?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Are you speaking of this testimony?

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Is this testimony from your stenographic transcript in New York on October 30th?

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Yes, so I'm asking you whether or not this man, when he was interrogated by us in New York, is not safe.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
I am still a member of the Lawy of the Security Screening Board.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
I have another notified that I am still eligible to fit.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
I have no recollection of it if you have a transcript in which he said that,

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
that is the best evidence, but I repeat, sir, I should like an opportunity to amplify my answer.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Well, certainly, sir, say anything you think would care for our lives.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
The individual was a member of the Secretary's Lawy of the Security Screening Board.

13:24.000 --> 13:32.000
In about February of 1953, he sat on the last panel in which he ever participated.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
During the summer of 1953, some facts of a minor derogatory nature against the individual came to be attention to.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
The first of the people who managed the operation of the board.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
At that time, they ceased to select the men for participation.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
subsequent to the time that that information came to attention, he never again participated as a member of the board.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
His name was not removed from the board.

13:59.000 --> 14:08.000
A letter was submitted to this committee in response to an inquiry in September over the signature of the director of legislative liaison major general relievers.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
which listed among the members of the board with individuals.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yes, sir, I have a time.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Any out-to-need, Mr. Cohn?

14:15.000 --> 14:27.000
At that time, the letter came to my attention and consultation between my office and the officials in the Army who handled the law of the security screening board matters were undercaten.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
The officials at that time pointed out to me.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
I first pointed out to them that back at this name had been submitted by the former member.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
I was assured that the individual was no longer participating.

14:39.000 --> 14:53.000
I was so reassured that the simplest method of dropping the individual from the lowerly screening board was to wait until the new procedures established the new board which was due in a very few weeks.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
In the meantime, not to wait for the individual on any panel.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
That was the procedure which was followed.

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
The loyalty, security screening board was abolished in about November of 1953.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
When a subsequent board with a different name was established, the new individual was wronged and that individual was not one of them.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
I repeat, sir, subsequent to February of 1953, the individual sat on no lowerly panel.

15:20.000 --> 15:29.000
The time has expired. I wonder if in the interest of progress by unanimous contempt we could agree that Mr. Cohn have another ten minutes to complete his inquiry.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Is there a picture? If anybody else has any questions, sir, I would be happy to wait.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Does anybody have any questions?

15:35.000 --> 15:44.000
Mr. Stadden, then, if I understand the situation, this man whose name shall remain anonymous.

15:45.000 --> 16:03.000
While merely, technically, a member of the Lawyer of the Security Board had not technically been removed therefore, but had not participated in the hearing and was facing the bomb any cases whatsoever since February 1950.

16:03.000 --> 16:13.000
That's right. That's right, sir. And for the reason, that information had come to the attention of the proper officials indicating that perhaps he should not serve until his own name was cleared.

16:13.000 --> 16:21.000
And so he just said, I'm just going to say initially that there was information of a manager, a regulatory manager, a manager.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
That's all I have to say. Chair has no questions, Senator McClellan?

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
Yes, sir. The question seems to be directly the secretary.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
This man, I believe, was on the board. Was we at the same secretary's, Regent, so far? Yes, sir.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Yes, sir. I think he was. I'm not sure, but he was.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
I think we should share that out. He was on the panel for a long time, maybe 18 months or so.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
Well, February 1953, you say he didn't serve any after-ass.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
When did the secretary see the firm secretary on the first of February?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
About the first of February. That's correct.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
Apparently he didn't serve very long after the secretary came to know if this is actually right.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
He did not participate, sir.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
He was on the board. He was called at participate.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
You're correct, sir.

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
Then you looked up your records and asked if they in and what meetings he did participate as the secretary even became secretary of the army.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
That can be done.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
So why is that information? I'll be glad to see.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
One question, Mr. Adams.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
Do the members of the lawy board enjoy a GSA rating?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Are they classified?

17:34.000 --> 17:41.000
The lawy security screening board consists of civil servants and officers of the army.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
And the board is rather large. It's about 20 or 25 people.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
And groups are selected who are known as panels to sit on the separate case.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
And a list of about 20 or 25 people may be selected to be on the lawy screening board for a period of two years.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
And during that period, one of the individuals from the board may sit on only three or four panels.

18:08.000 --> 18:17.000
And may consider as few as two or as many as ten cases as a participant while the whole board with the...

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
total 25 people may consider 250 between those.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
We're going to listen to the individual.

18:23.000 --> 18:30.000
Mr. Wax may have participated in three, four or five decisions during the time he was on.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
And he had his extracurricular activity that he did as a civil servant.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
In 2010, however, leaders, fiscal calls came in on.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
This list from the government service?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Or to the lawy board.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Or this list of some of the sensitive work.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
Or he can be removed from the lawy board by an auditory action of the secretary,

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
which is done by this abortment to the secretary who assigned the responsibility.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
Or just as any other civil servant, he can be discharged for any one of the reasons that the civil service has.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
And an officer of the Army also can be removed from the lawy board.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
He didn't serve on the...

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
What is the screening board?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
The screening board.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, I don't think he's screening board.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Out of February, 53, what did he do?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Well, he was a permanent employee in...

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I don't think he was...

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
No, no, he was on...

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
He was a permanent employee on other days.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
He's still employee where he was employed.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
And from time to time, maybe once every three months, he was called on the telephone and said,

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
you're on another panel, you're to come here and fit for two days and listen to this.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
So his boss would let him go and he would come to this meeting and listen to one, two or three cases

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
and participate with the panel in aid decision.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
And then he would go back to his regular work.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
In other words, the panel job was not a full-time job.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I know he was a very short job.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
What's like to hang around and making...

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Having the responsibility for just collecting community checks.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
What do you think he's doing?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
You're asking for a specified work now?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
No, well, he is doing work...

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
I shouldn't answer you because I don't know what his assignment is at the moment.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Is that your partner?

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Mr. Adam, is this employee...

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
Is there an investigation to make of the charges against him?

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Is there a regulatory material by a minor nature?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Is there an investigation that was made of him?

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
Insofar as I know it was, I do not know what the conclusion was.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I should repeat, sir.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
I am not in the security business, and the matter was in the hands of the security division

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
which has the responsibility.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
What the ultimate decision in the case of that individual was, I do not know.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
I have not seen the individual since last October.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
October, and there has been no reason for his name to come up until the last couple of weeks.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
So I've been on this.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
It was not worth the building where I worked.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Do I understand or say that he was a bit in the employee?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Yes, sir.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
And there is your loyalty.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
Review of civilian employees, different from the military employees.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
There is a difference, yes sir.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
That's all.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Okay.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Do you understand?

21:06.000 --> 21:17.000
Mr. Adam, did you say that the last time, as a man, that was served on a loyalty board was in February 1953?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
That is what I said, sir. I should say.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
I don't know that from looking at the record myself.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
I know that from talking to the people who managed the loyalty board activity.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
I did not personally look at the file and see that his last participation was in February 1953.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I was told that by the responsible officials.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Will you check the records and find out?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I will, sir.

21:38.000 --> 21:45.000
You therefore, most certainly do not know the date of the last time he did not say it.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
What day did the secretary of the Army become secretary of the Army?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Was he confirmed and went to work?

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
I think it was February 4th, sir, but I'm not sure.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
For a lot of them, I would like to...

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
The secretary, I said you were happy.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
That was just the secretary.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
For all of you, the sole of my colleagues, not...

22:05.000 --> 22:14.000
Too much to prove, but would you mind turning and asking for the secretary to even defeat the members of the day that he was February 4th, 1953?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I have a question, Mr. Chairman.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Senator Dwight, sir.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Mr. Welch.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Mr. Higgins.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Mr. Sinclair.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Mr. Sinclair.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Thank you.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
I am a lawyer at the Department of Justice and the State Board of the State Department of Justice.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I told him the first thing.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
You have to listen to the case.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
You have to make Mr. Ex-testify the Bureau of the Last Family of Saddam,

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
and I will have to wait until March, right in 1953.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
On page 1440, there is a statement from Mr. Cohn.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
Now, for how long the period of time did you serve in any capacity on the Screaming Board, Mr. Ex- Responded?

22:54.000 --> 23:04.000
From April 1952 until I think the last panel I saw, I think it means I sat on, was along in February for March of 1953.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
I have not sat on a panel since February for March 1953.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Mr. Higgins, in the words of Mr. Ex from the transcript, Mr. Cohn just posted.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
And when was it Mr. Adams and Mr. Ex-testify before the so-called McCartic Test Committee?

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
October 30th, 1953.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Thank you very much.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Sir, Mr. Adam.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
Is it not a fact that on the day that Mr. Ex were calling him here,

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
he testified in New York on October 30th.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
He at that time had full security clearance.

23:39.000 --> 23:47.000
He handled classified materials and was a member of the Loyalty Security Screaming Board.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Technical or however he would have.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Mr. Cohn, you have been in the office for a long time.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm sorry. I'll break him down until, too far, sir.

23:54.000 --> 24:01.000
Is it not a fact that Mr. Ex himself testified that he at the very moment he was testifying at full security clearance?

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
I have not read the transcript since...

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I don't think I've ever read the transcript.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
My recollection is that he did testify that he had security clearance.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I might say to Mr. Cohn, as we submit as transcripts.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I think today, I think you have it now.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I'll make sure to request his recollection.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And then I'll ask him to retire the end.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Remember, I'll give the two days to read.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Adams, I would ask if you could glance at the copy of the transcript and refresh your recollection.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
And tell us whether or not Mr. Ex did not say he had security clearance.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Give us the pay.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Please pay the bill.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
I would suggest you look at the pay 1420.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
The Duman Television Network is bringing you through its facilities, the Army McCarthy Subcommittee hearings.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
We pause now for station identification.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
This is the Duman Television Network.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
WABD, Gen. 5, New York.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
One, two, the second question on page 1420.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Then I'd ask you to follow that up with...

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
We weren't furnished to transcripts of page 1420.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
There our transcript begins on page 1428.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
1448.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
May I see the copy of that?

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
Yes, I'd like to record to note that the entire transcript was supplied.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
There is a different representation on the copy that was made up for Mr. Adams.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
Can you bring the pay and I'm bringing up...

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
I think we can do that rather properly.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
I've now been furnished with the copy that cards fund exactly with the copy Mr. Adams has and so far of pay and I'll bring it.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
And I'll return to him the copy we gave him and I'll use it.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Very good.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
Then he will refer to the page number and the very language we should give him and move along.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
We'll see if we can get the copy.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
We'll see if we can get the copy.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
We'll see if we can get the copy we gave him and I'll use it.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Very good.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.000
Then he will refer to the page number and the very language we should give him and move along more rapidly.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Wow, we're waiting for it.

26:44.000 --> 26:51.000
Sir, I have no past testimony that Mr. X sat on 4th on 14 May 1952.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
One on 17 June 1952.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
One on 13 November 1952.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
And one on 19 February 1953.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
This is Steven Secretary of the Army on that day.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Yes, he had been for 15 days.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Yes, sir.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
Now Mr. Adams may I direct?

27:11.000 --> 27:25.000
Just Mr. Adams, we're concerned not merely with Mr. Steven, but with all of those who have been handling these matters over the past number of years, we're still there.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Let me ask you this. Do you know what I left?

27:29.000 --> 27:40.000
Mr. X voted in each one of the cases, or he was a member of the security panel to clear, clear, and everyone was coming to this question.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
It would not be competent fifth of money in addition to that.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
That was not competent.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Sorry, did any criteria to address you?

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Well, Mr. Steven, then it is objective to Mr. Steven.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Mr. Steven.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Mr. Tim, this is not a trial of Mr. Steven.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
This is not a trial of Mr. Steven's.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I meant to put those in the Pentagon.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Well, then there will pass number of years are still there.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
We're charged with security.

28:02.000 --> 28:09.000
And who let him and I like Mr. X sit on these panels with the records that you have.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Mr. Chan, in order to know what I think finished please.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
This is not a trial of Mr. Steven.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I think he's one of the minor characters in this trial matter.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
It's all happening.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
It's all happening.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
It's all happening because it's in name and they both are over there.

28:24.000 --> 28:31.000
But I am interested in the individuals who have been there who have been clearing communists for secret work.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
And if you just restrict us to the date Mr. Steven took over, it's rather a useless investigation.

28:37.000 --> 28:46.000
The senator is broadening the scope of inquiry now to perhaps include hundreds and thousands of additional parties and members.

28:46.000 --> 28:57.000
I say Mr. Chairman that Mr. Steven says the party in interest and Mr. Adams says and that those two parties are the only parties in interest who are now in the Pentagon.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Mr. Chan, I think the senator's question is entirely out of order.

29:01.000 --> 29:07.000
And I advise the Chairman to overdo that, Mr. Chairman.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
Mr. Chairman, Chair, could you really like the end of the point of order?

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
I thought we'd mind if I tried to law fit the point of case within the judge's announcement rule for the point of the defendant.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
Would you like to hear from me even though you have made your mind?

29:22.000 --> 29:29.000
I can't say that I'm coveting the opportunity, but if you want to be heard, you have that right.

29:30.000 --> 29:58.000
Mr. Chairman, the contention which I've made over and over and over over the past number of months is that somebody is trying to cover up his improper conduct some of the Pentagon that they're using a fine, not overly experienced secretary.

29:59.000 --> 30:07.000
As their tools leads individuals really, I don't know, but there's somebody definitely afraid of being exposed.

30:07.000 --> 30:18.000
And in order to show the supply of the issuance of the Federalist Report and Mr. Cohen, we've got to move the background amendment like Ken Silver.
