WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm not going to sit in the middle of it.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
No, but I'm going to be working on it together.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
It's a pretty good question.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Chair, I just wanted two questions.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
I want to ask them in line, Mr. Wilson is bringing us,

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
because I'm afraid that possibly Mr. Wilson

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
brought out an implication, which I am sure he could be the last man

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
in the world to want to bring out.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
And that is simply because we all agree that he's just the best army

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
in the world.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
We all agree that we have a magnificent office, of course.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
We all agree that they went over and did a terrific job

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
of fighting against communism in Korea.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Those things were in agreement about it,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
but the implication might be that those things being truth,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
that there could be no communists in the army.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I want to ask you now as an old FDR agent.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I want to ask you in your present capacity as staff director.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Whether in Europe, you're a young communist boy

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
drafted into the army.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Ceases to be a communist operator simply because you've

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
gifted him to the army under the draft.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
No, sure, he does.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
He is not only then in uniform of the United States,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
but we find a man in uniform of the United States

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
who was there primarily for the purpose of disrupting the army,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
of breaking down our security, of delivering

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
sequest to the enemy, of sabotaging our defense.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Would that be right?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yes, sir.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
And I think it largely has a result of the Perez case.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
The defense department has taken steps to be in a position

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
to better handle the induction and the subsequent army career

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
or defense department career of such persons.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
And I want to join you in congratulating the defense department

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
in doing what it did last April.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Mr. Wells, we're confronted with a very serious problem.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
You and I, I'm sure, will agree that a communist

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
should not have a draft exempt state.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
He can't be a country and a subductor.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
So the army has to bring him in.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Now, what to do with him when you get him there

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
raises some very real problem.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
And because for a time they treated communist draftees

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
like everybody else and gave them commissions.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Promotive them as it is in the case of Perez.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
That thing having been highlighted before the public.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
That thing being demonstrated as it was,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
made everybody realize at least that is in the way it should have come.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
So they have tried some new methods.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I hope the satisfaction is not an easy problem.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
And we're not quick to condemn the army or anybody else

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
for dealing with the tempestious problem.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
But the idea must not get abroad in the United States must be.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
It's simply automatically because a communist has a uniform on

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
that we now have a good American instead of a potential

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
or an actual spot.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
That's correct.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And I'm sure Mr. Wells, you will agree to that.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I just wanted to make that clear because our listeners

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
and our readers might get a false implication of the ones.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I send him a comment.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
You have 10 minutes.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
What's going on?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It's over.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I don't know.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Of course, I am.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Have whatever you've been to the committee, Bill.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Mr. Far, I thought I had concluded and had a moment ago.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
But I find I should ask you one or two other questions now.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
If you have a fair, you may follow me.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I think I'll read it correctly.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
I want to read your charge number 46.

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
Or read from that charge.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
Follow me as I read the last sentence in that charge.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
But as soon as they both turn to the infinitely more important

03:44.000 --> 03:52.000
questions of who was responsible for protecting communist infiltration

03:52.000 --> 04:01.000
and the protecting communists who had infiltrated every conceivable obstacle

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
was placed in the path of the committee search for the truth.

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
I have used the term or word cuddling with respect to that charge.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Now, I may have been challenged for the use of that curve.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Will you tell me in view of that charge and you're having testified

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
that that charge is true if the use or the application of the term cuddling

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
is too strong a term to apply to it?

04:36.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, Senator, I don't wish to get into a dispute on the other conditions of words here.

04:48.000 --> 05:00.000
But I think perhaps cuddling might imply that the persons alleged to do the cuddling

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
were in favor of the communists that were being cobbled.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I think this is a continuation.

05:07.000 --> 05:16.000
I think this statement here more clearly expresses the position that it might not be

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
that they like the communists any better than the rest of us.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
And I'm sure that you yourself from your experience that you have repolled in connection

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
with the private that we will bring in here. I'm sure that you had no love for them.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm sure that they may demonstrate that to you.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yes, I did.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Yes, sir.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yes, sir, you have.

05:37.000 --> 05:46.000
But I think that this language here implies that there may have been not a desire to protect the communists

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
but a desire to protect other people, maybe themselves, maybe a citizen.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
This language serves ample texting communists. It's direct. It doesn't serve the people.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And full texting communists who had infield rated.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
That's correct.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Well, that's a direct target. They were protecting communists who had infield rated.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Yes, sir. I don't withdraw any of this language.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
I just am giving you the thought that I think that the protecting of the communists

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
might have been for some of the reason.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
But it actually isn't coddling a much softer word, weaker word,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
than full texting.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
If I had made the wrong term, I wouldn't know it.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
So I don't follow with your senator about your terms and don't follow me.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, if you do then wherever I have used the term or the word codlings,

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
I'll substitute the word protecting if you think it is making a difference.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I don't follow what you only use.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Thank you.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
That's all.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Thank you very much.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes, sir.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to address this to Mr. Well.

07:05.000 --> 07:15.000
And this is really only a footnote to the rather pleasant discussion we've had about the extent

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
to which the legislative power goes in investigations of the executive branch.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
Now, what I propose to say is not exactly a matter in point because I have recognized

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
the distinction that is involved.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
But that in the immigration hearings, which were held in this very room incidentally

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
by the Armed Services Committee of the Senate, there was an inquiry into the dismissal

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
of General MacArthur in April of 1951.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
And the Armed Services Committee held a close hearing in this room in the following month.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
transcripts were made available to the press as soon as they were cleared with respect

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
to security information.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
General Bradley, who was then chief of staff and certainly bore a confidential relationship

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
to the President of the United States, came to voluntarily to testify.

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
And as I recall, he testified that the decision for the dismissal of MacArthur had been made

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
at a White House conference, which was attended by President Truman, General Marshall,

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
Admiral Haramon, Secretary of State, and then there may have been others.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Now, having made that statement, Senator Wiley then sought to ascertain whether or not

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
somebody was in attendance in that conference who expressed an observation in General Bradley

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
at that point said that because of the clear separation of powers between the legislative

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
and the executive, he refused to testify any further.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
The committee went into that question at considerable length and as I recall,

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
there were seven members of the Senate who felt that General Bradley ought to be compelled

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
to testify with respect to everything that had been said at the conference.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
However, the issue was not fresh and got lost in the welter of things as I recall.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
And so, frankly, I think we're back to that question again and somewhere other

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
is going to have to be more clearly resolved than it has been at any other time in the course.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
That raises his question of whether or not the committee can actually subpoena

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
members of the top loyalty of screening board in the Army and not only compelled him to appear,

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
which I think is a right under the Marbury of the St. Madison decision by General Marshall on the go.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
But the more important question whether they can be compelled to testify as to the reasons

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
why they reversed the lower loyalty boards in the Army structure.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
And that question of course has not yet been resolved.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
We've sort of bounced from the edges in the course of this very long period.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
But I wanted to allude to it only for purposes of the record because there's some future time

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
it must be explored. That's all the trouble.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I have just a moment.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Indeed so.

10:07.000 --> 10:15.000
And this will be the most friendly approach, Senator Dirkson, as you would expect from one in my position

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
as a lawyer.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
The way this thing points up in my mind is as follows.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
It's quite simple.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
As a lawyer you and I know that when a case is tried in a courtroom and it's decided,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
nobody ever has the power to call on the jury and say how come you did what you did?

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
And nobody ever has the power to call on the judge and say how come you did what you did?

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
Now these loyalty-reduced boards aren't quite a lot like a judge and jury as any lawyer will admit.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
They're not precisely like them but they're quite a lot like them.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
Now you're in that area where you either do or you don't call them up and say how come you did what you did.

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
And on that point sir, as I need not tell you lawyers differ and on that point the Army and this committee differ.

11:05.000 --> 11:14.000
And as I have said before it will not be resolved in this part of, in this room, but somewhere one of these days it must be resolved for the good of the country.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
Well I would raise only two questions with respect to that as well as the first one is here.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
Whether they perform a case I judicial or an administrative function is done.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
And perhaps the more important query.

11:27.000 --> 11:38.000
If you assume for instance that somebody on one of those boards had some rather oblite ideas let us say about communism and our neighbor allegation of course.

11:38.000 --> 11:51.000
And the committee was trying to in its efforts to get that information the question is then how could a committee of Congress evoke all of the truth or in a matter of such importance to the security of the country.

11:51.000 --> 12:07.000
I know of course that you and I shall not resolve it here, but I did want the record at least to show that in one way or another only within the last few years this same constitutional question has been bouncing around in the Congress.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
And what I like about is that in a country like this honorable and patriotic men can differ about it. And I think you will agree they may.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That's correct.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
And the question.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
And the pilot.

12:20.000 --> 12:37.000
Let's share that I would like to comment on a statement that you made during your period of question about the communist being drafted into the army and the Department of Defense ruling on how to meet that situation.

12:37.000 --> 12:52.000
For the interest of committee on my mention I'm working on legislation along that I hope to cure that problem in my opinion.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
A member of the Communist Party is not fit to work uniform of the United States.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
We should be we don't allow criminals to work uniform.

13:05.000 --> 13:13.000
We should allow a commoners who is dedicated to the overfill of our government by forcing violence to work uniform.

13:13.000 --> 13:28.000
I think our selected service act should be amended. Provide a special designation for persons who use the federal amendment to refuse to state whether he's a member of the communist party.

13:28.000 --> 13:40.000
The designation will be plainly stamped upon all of its records so that people will know that this man was refused military service.

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
He was on fifth to work uniform because that man was not loyal to his country.

13:47.000 --> 14:00.000
I have a few questions.

14:00.000 --> 14:15.000
Mr. Carr, there has been raised here the question of what can be done with a communist who has been drafted is in the military.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
Is it correct that we called four cases each one of them handled differently.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
One was a doctor who was kept in as a private.

14:29.000 --> 14:38.000
The next the Fifth Amendment communist then just given an honorable discharge.

14:38.000 --> 14:59.000
Another one still a doctor in the military and a fourth who had been a member of the Communist Party for short creative time, gave the FBI all the information he could about the communist conspiracy.

14:59.000 --> 15:07.000
He got less than an honorable discharge, not exactly a dishonorable discharge, just the second grade discharge.

15:07.000 --> 15:24.000
They were told to the purpose of demonstrating clearly to Mr. Stevens and Rose and Shards that there was no policy up until the time at least to be called these people all four handled in a completely different fashion.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Yes, that's correct.

15:26.000 --> 15:36.000
The only one who got less than an honorable discharge and I won't use his name here was the young man who had been a member for a while.

15:36.000 --> 15:46.000
Frankly, his military was a member, gave the FBI, gave Army intelligence, apparently all the information he had about the people who were with him and the communist movement.

15:46.000 --> 15:55.000
Yes, as I recall, he was a testify that he had been cooperative with the Army and he was most cooperative with the committee.

15:55.000 --> 16:07.000
Mr. Char, there was very big question of what a wonderful job our young men did in Korea.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
I agree that it is a tremendous job over there that it is the fighting men.

16:11.000 --> 16:26.000
I think it's especially appropriate that I ask you some questions about that today and view the fact that we have here behind the table, Sergeant Gilbert Humboldt, the Army clinical center of Maryland,

16:26.000 --> 16:34.000
who is in Korea for about 14 months, has selected as the outstanding soldier of the Second Army.

16:34.000 --> 16:44.000
I think it may be quite appropriate to be discussed with the three-margined view of the fact that we had one young man over there who was fortunate enough to come back alive,

16:44.000 --> 16:53.000
but might well have died because of the results of a few things I would like to question you about now.

16:53.000 --> 17:14.000
For example, I think in the congressional record of January 17, and in search by Senator Stiles Bridges, we find here that General Low was sent by President Truman to Korea.

17:14.000 --> 17:22.000
Senator President Truman wanted to have some eyes and ears over there so he would get a first-hand report.

17:22.000 --> 17:29.000
Why he sent him I don't know, but apparently he was not too satisfied with the report he was getting.

17:29.000 --> 17:37.000
And Low apparently was not sending General Franti a very good selection by President Truman.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
And we find the story that Low's report never did get true to President Truman.

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
If they had, we don't know how many more young men would be living today or dead now.

17:51.000 --> 18:02.000
We find in the story in page 820, the congressional record January 17, and I may have quotes in the story by Bill Cunningham,

18:02.000 --> 18:09.000
as a result of an interview with the General who looks for seal for some time after he came back, the time that he came unsealed.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
He says General MacArthur was right in Korea, and if he had been left alone, he longs since we were one in Korea.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
Then dropping down, he says, what we face now is a disgraceful stalemate.

18:22.000 --> 18:31.000
They're writing off of tens of thousands of needless American casualties, the loss of faith through the entire area of the world,

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
and a pointless undefined position for ourselves.

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
MacArthur was chemstrung and finally brought down by the interference of the safety partner.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Then he goes on to describe this.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
Here's the man, six by President Truman.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
You can't, we don't know whether he's a Democratic or a Republican, I assume he was just a great American soldier.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
All the records in the kid he was.

19:01.000 --> 19:12.000
He says that MacArthur we could have long since won the war, because MacArthur was chemstrung and finally brought down.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
We've had to write off tens of thousands of casualties.

19:18.000 --> 19:27.000
Now, international Mr. Welch's question about whether or not the American people have the right to know the plan.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
Don't you agree with me wholeheartedly, Mr. Carrier?

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
The point you have in situations such as this, for a top general,

19:37.000 --> 19:46.000
does that in effect that thousands of men died because a general was not allowed to win the war?

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
If the American people are entitled to know the plan, all the plan, and they should not be kept from the people.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Yes, sir, I would.

19:54.000 --> 20:06.000
Number two, Mr. Carrier, seems to be a gather being built up some idea that there's something sacred about what a member of the loyalty board does.

20:08.000 --> 20:16.000
If a man steals ten thousand dollars, there's no question about our right to expose him, is that right?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
No, sir.

20:19.000 --> 20:34.000
Wouldn't you think that it is ten times more serious to find a man ordering a communist return to secret radar laboratories knowing these are coming up?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Yes, sir.

20:36.000 --> 20:45.000
I would like to call your attention, Mr. Carrier, to a statement by a major general, C.E. Gerhardt, once and a half, and before this committee.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
But the statement was made publicly.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
So there, my name is no, I mean, no violence, any conflict for repeating it.

20:56.000 --> 21:12.000
He says that the 24 civilian employees of the Second Army at Port Mead, Maryland, want a subversive list before protected by some law in the Department of the Army.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
His court is having stated on May 15, 1954 that in the cases of some of these civilians,

21:21.000 --> 21:35.000
would carry the removal proceeding successfully to every stage of court, only to have these cases in every instance reversed by the President's loyalty security review board.

21:35.000 --> 21:42.000
Now, is that roughly the same situation we found in regard to Port Mead? Yes, sir, it was.

21:43.000 --> 22:07.000
Do you think, Mr. Carrier, that there's anything sacred, any reason for the American people should not know who is clearing these communists, who is sending them as I have so often said, back to a position where they are in effect, poised with a razor blade over the juggler blade at the vein of this nation?

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
No, sir, I don't. Now, President, I am from the heart of the State of the Union message.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
May the statement, I'm again, referring back to Mr. Welch's discussion of the Korean War.

22:21.000 --> 22:34.000
I got the impression he felt that because our soldiers did a great job there, that perhaps we should not protect them from traitors who might be able to infiltrate the Army, and maybe I'm doing what you want, then justice.

22:35.000 --> 22:58.000
That's the impression I got from the statement. Let me read what the President of the United States said if I may, and see if this does not indicate either subversion or criminal income, which resulted in the death of an African young man, the situation, but should have been exposed along the course of time.

22:58.000 --> 23:23.000
Here's the President of the United States. He says this. He doesn't June 19th, this day following the aggressive attack on the Republic of Korea, the United States seven fleet was instructed both to prevent attack upon Promotive, and also to ensure that Promotive should not be used as a base of operations against the Chinese Communist mainland.

23:23.000 --> 23:36.000
And I call your attention, fight for the dead. This has been a fight that the United States Navy was required to serve as the defense of the arm of Communist China.

23:36.000 --> 23:48.000
The President of the United States, may I repeat that, he says this has been a fight that the United States Navy was required to serve as the defense of the arm of Communist China.

23:48.000 --> 24:00.000
Then dropping down further, he says this, the Promotive was communist with greater impunity to kill our soldiers and those of our United States allies in Korea.

24:00.000 --> 24:20.000
Now I may say that I hardly agree with President Eisenhower when he says that the order which was an existence until he took over the President's state in effect made our seven fleet a defensive arm of the Communist Party, allowing them to kill American young men.

24:20.000 --> 24:31.000
If the statement is true, I am sure it is, it means that young American men are dead today who believe that we are not for this trifle or a slaughter.

24:31.000 --> 24:39.000
Now do you agree, can I finish the question? Do you agree with Mr. Pire? Do you agree with Mr. Pire?

24:39.000 --> 24:58.000
There is no reason on earth by the American people who should not hear the individuals who are responsible for such a place or order find out whether they were communists or whether they were merely stupid beyond words.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I agree with Mr. Pire.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I am a former-dwell-star, Mr. Pire. We have the opportunity.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
This is very important.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
Well, Mr. Pire, we were talking, I think, about the price button.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Oh, yes, sir.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
It's quite a little smaller scale than we did before.

25:27.000 --> 25:33.000
I think I'm wrong. I think we passed that into around December sometimes.

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
You remember, Anne, and indicated that Mr. Adams was using some strong language.

25:43.000 --> 25:55.000
Now I suppose, Mr. Carr, that you would not look upon those alleged activities of Mr. Adams as being very much in the order of cooperation with you and your staff.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
In the order of cooperation, sir?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Yes.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
How do you mean that?

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
Well, if I were to blackmail you or attempt to blackmail you, I wouldn't be cooperating with you in the same breath, would I?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
I have said it in a way. Go ahead, sir.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Would you please?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Perhaps, maybe, it should be rest.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
All right, fine.

26:26.000 --> 26:35.000
Well, if I were to blackmail you or attempt to blackmail you, I wouldn't be cooperating with you in the same breath, would I?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
I'm sorry, I was, I wasn't saying that.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Well, that's all right. It's not a very difficult question.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And you wouldn't look upon any of them.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I wouldn't look like the hair, so I mean.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Oh, certainly, you may.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Why don't I just restate it, sugar?

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
So, if I were to attempt to blackmail you, you wouldn't think that that would be highly cooperative with me, would you?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Oh, no, I wouldn't think so now.

27:07.000 --> 27:16.000
And if I threatened the whole of the friend of yours as a hostage, you wouldn't think that I was highly cooperative with you, would you?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
No, sir.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
Now, you say these things happened on December the 9th, don't you?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Yes, sir.

27:23.000 --> 27:37.000
I'm not sure in my mind whether at least insofar as the hostage language is concerned, your testimony is that it was the feces or not, perhaps you could tell me that you consider it the feces.

27:37.000 --> 27:46.000
The use of the term hostage by Mr. Adams was on many occasions, feces. It's, it might have been at this time.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
It might have been at this time?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Might have been.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Would you have written a memorandum about it, sir, if it was the feces?

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
I wrote a memorandum about the other statements.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Well, it also includes something about hostage, doesn't it?

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
Well, it includes, they include the fact that we, I think, are hearing.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
It includes many things, but the reason I wrote it was this other statement.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
Sure, you don't mean to suggest that you wrote a memorandum about a feces, remarked by Mr. Adams, do you?

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
No, of course not. It was serious, wasn't it?

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
No, no, the reason I wrote this memorandum was because I was not very mocked by Mr. Adams.

28:20.000 --> 28:27.000
All right. But insofar as the question of hostage is concerned, he was serious, wasn't it?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Or I do know.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Yes.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
How do you, he was serious?

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
Well, he's serious on several times, other times it's in the station.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
The process fell when, which, which is which, sometimes.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
Well, he certainly wasn't very cooperative with you or the staff on December 9, wasn't it?

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
No, I don't think he was being cooperative, no, no.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
And you wrote it, it was so bad that you wrote a memorandum to Senator McCarthy about it, didn't you?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
That's right.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
And when did you write it, sir?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
The same day.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
The same day.

28:59.000 --> 29:09.000
I might say that he was trying to be cooperative, if we wanted to cooperate with him, yet.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Would you read me that answer?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I didn't quite understand it.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I'd require you to get it.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
Answer, I might say that he was perhaps trying to be cooperative as we wanted to cooperate with him.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Yes.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Do you mean if we wanted to cooperate?

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
If you mean to suggest Mr. Car that while he, as you said, tried to blackmail you, he was also being cooperative?

29:34.000 --> 29:42.000
No, I said he might put the interpretation on it that he was trying to be cooperative with us if we wanted to play ball with him.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Yes.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
He was making him offer it.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
He said, what's there in it for us?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Well, you didn't accept the offer it is.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
That's right.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
So he was not cooperative, was it?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
No, but it was a try.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
It was a try.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
I don't know.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
But it didn't result in cooperation, did it?

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
No, sir, not respect.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Not in any respect on that day, did it?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
That's...

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Sometimes we create.

30:03.000 --> 30:10.000
You know, sir, that about a week later the senator stated for the public record.

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
That Mr. Stevens and those who are now in charge, which would include Mr. Adams, had fully cooperated with the committee.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
You know that, don't you?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yes, sir, I do.

30:20.000 --> 30:30.000
You consider that the information you gave to the senator on December 9th is consistent with his statement in the public record on December 15th?

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
I don't know that it's consistent with it, no.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I know that...

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Senator, highly inconsistent, don't you?

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
It's inconsistent with it, yes.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Inconsistent with my memorandum, yes.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Sure, and the information you imparted to him?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
That's correct.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
And the information you've been imparting to him since October the 9th?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
That's correct.

30:53.000 --> 31:01.000
Did you were you, President, when the term in Senator McCarty made that statement for the public record?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I don't know what.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
I'll just end this thing, so I could give you a little exact amount.
