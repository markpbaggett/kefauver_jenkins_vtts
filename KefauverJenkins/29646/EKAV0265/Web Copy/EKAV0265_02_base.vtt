00:00.000 --> 00:10.120
I think maybe I could say a little time by saying it now that Senator McCarthy, when I

00:10.120 --> 00:18.680
gave him this memorandum, after he'd seen this memorandum, and I spoke into him, he thought

00:18.680 --> 00:22.200
that I was overly disturbed by the situation.

00:22.200 --> 00:29.040
He thought that I was asked to disturb by this, and that Adam might not have meant what

00:29.040 --> 00:31.040
I thought he meant.

00:31.040 --> 00:37.600
Well now, Mr. Adams was sent by you as you testified to see Senator McCarthy that same

00:37.600 --> 00:39.080
day named in December 9th.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.080
Well, I wouldn't say so.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.360
I suggested he might go see the Senator.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.360
That's right.

00:44.360 --> 00:47.840
And you know that he did go see the Senator?

00:47.840 --> 00:50.800
Uh, I, yes, I know that.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.800
Sure.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.560
Now are you suggesting that the Senator didn't quite believe your memorandum?

00:56.560 --> 00:57.560
No.

00:57.560 --> 01:04.680
Uh, I'm suggesting only that the Senator was not as disturbed about the situation as I

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
was.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
I see.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.560
You have no doubt in any event, though, Mr. Carr.

01:09.560 --> 01:14.240
But that Senator McCarthy, when he stated for the public record on December 15th that he'd

01:14.240 --> 01:17.880
had full cooperation, he meant what he said.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.880
Uh, I have no doubt that he had, I don't know what he meant.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.880
So you don't suggest that he didn't mean it, do you, Mr. Carr?

01:27.880 --> 01:32.400
Uh, well, uh, he said it.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.160
The record speaks for itself, I guess.

01:35.160 --> 01:39.200
Uh, well, you don't want all these people to understand the Senator speaks for the public

01:39.200 --> 01:41.160
record and not mean it, please.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.160
No, I don't.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.560
I, I want you to ask the Senator what he means when he says that.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.560
Perhaps we will, Mr. Carr.

01:47.560 --> 01:52.040
But in so far as your concern, I just want to get it established.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.120
The Chairman has a December 15th.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.120
State has been full cooperation.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.120
Well, all right.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.120
He's a problem.

01:59.120 --> 02:04.000
And that you consider that inconsistent with your memorandum that you say you wrote

02:04.000 --> 02:05.720
on December the 9th?

02:05.720 --> 02:08.520
I consider it inconsistent with my memorandum, yes.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.520
That's right.

02:09.520 --> 02:14.240
Now, I'd like to go back for just a moment, change a pace a little bit.

02:14.240 --> 02:19.440
Do you remember the flight support from a choir or a McGuire base in the Jersey on the

02:19.440 --> 02:20.440
17th?

02:21.040 --> 02:26.480
And there's been an awful lot of talk about a photograph that was taken on that day

02:26.480 --> 02:28.480
or a series of photographs.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.480
Yes.

02:29.480 --> 02:36.080
Uh, it now turns out that you are the, the serious fourth man in the picture, aren't you?

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
Yes.

02:37.080 --> 02:42.640
Now, did you see private Chinese you got off the plane?

02:42.640 --> 02:44.280
Yes, sir, I did.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.120
Did you go up to shake hands with them, say, a lower time?

02:48.120 --> 02:52.120
As I recall, there was a, uh, more or less of a round of hand shakes.

02:52.120 --> 02:56.320
Uh, I don't know whether I went up to see him or he went up to see me.

02:56.320 --> 03:02.640
Uh, there were some, uh, other people there that, uh, he shook hands all around and you shook

03:02.640 --> 03:03.640
hands all around.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
Hi, I'm sure.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.880
I'm sure that I must have shaken hands with him.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.560
I know I shook hands with General Ryan.

03:10.560 --> 03:14.240
And other people shook hands with private Chinese and General Ryan and other person.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.080
That's correct.

03:17.080 --> 03:22.080
So, did you see that private Chinese had two coats with him?

03:22.080 --> 03:25.560
Uh, I don't recall that he had two coats.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.880
I don't recall that he didn't have two coats.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.040
Well, when the picture was taken, he had a coat on, didn't he?

03:32.040 --> 03:33.040
That's correct.

03:33.040 --> 03:37.040
You didn't see him hand another coat to any Colonel, did you?

03:37.040 --> 03:41.440
Uh, no, I can't say that I saw him hand a coat to a Colonel.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.040
Well, either you did or you did.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.040
Which is it?

03:44.400 --> 03:50.160
Well, I say, as I say, I can't say that I saw him hand a coat to another Colonel.

03:50.160 --> 03:58.600
The reason I wanted to go on was because the reason I can't say is because I recall that

03:58.600 --> 04:08.960
on the flight to Boston that night, Senator McCarthy and Mr. Cohn and I were joking about

04:08.960 --> 04:15.280
the fact that somebody had held a shine's coat so that he could have his picture.

04:15.280 --> 04:20.480
Now, I can't at this point state whether somebody held shine's second coat or his first

04:20.480 --> 04:24.240
coat or whether somebody helped him on with his coat.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.240
I don't know.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.240
I know we joke about it.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
We thought it was General Ryan.

04:27.240 --> 04:31.000
At least I thought it was General Ryan, who held his coat and they had been one of the

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Colonel's.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
The General passed in the column.

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
Mr. Cohn, I'd been using the word Cohn and the commonest them apparently.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.080
There was some objection to it.

04:48.080 --> 04:55.320
Let's take up another term now that has been used to describe situations that's not

04:55.320 --> 04:57.720
mentioned in the charges.

04:57.720 --> 05:04.680
That is holding a razor blade at the juggler vein of this nation.

05:04.680 --> 05:12.440
I believe you agreed with Senator McCarthy with his application of that term to whom he

05:12.440 --> 05:15.160
referred and his questions while I go.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.160
Did you?

05:16.160 --> 05:23.880
Well, hands in pretty long questions, but I know I will agree that the commonest and especially

05:23.880 --> 05:33.760
those strategically placed in defense industry and in government and in other places do hold

05:33.760 --> 05:36.680
an effect or razor blade at the throat of the nation.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.680
I agree with that.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.680
We'll agree on that now.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.680
Let's go a little further and see if you agree on this.

05:41.680 --> 05:52.740
Do you agree that if your charges are true, that Mr. Adams and Mr. Secretary Stevens

05:52.740 --> 06:02.860
in protecting commoners who have infiltrated using your language are also holding a razor blade

06:02.860 --> 06:06.100
over the juggler vein of this nation?

06:06.100 --> 06:12.340
Could I have the reporter read that I want to tell you?

06:12.340 --> 06:17.540
I can read the data.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.540
You want me to read the data?

06:19.540 --> 06:20.540
If you will.

06:20.540 --> 06:21.540
Yes.

06:21.540 --> 06:28.640
You have agreed that commoners, individual commoners, working in defense class or who have

06:28.640 --> 06:37.300
infiltrated, holding a razor blade over the juggler vein of this nation.

06:37.300 --> 06:47.540
If your charges are true with respect to Secretary Stevens and Mr. Adams, that they have

06:47.540 --> 06:54.420
been protecting those who have infiltrated those commoners.

06:54.420 --> 06:59.780
Would you also agree with me that they are holding a razor blade over the juggler vein of

06:59.780 --> 07:01.580
this nation?

07:01.580 --> 07:06.380
Well, let me put it this way, sir.

07:06.380 --> 07:11.120
I wouldn't say that they are, I think the Communist of the ones that would be holding a razor

07:11.120 --> 07:13.260
blade at the juggler vein of the nation.

07:13.260 --> 07:21.540
I would just say that our charges are statement being what it is, they are not rushing to pull

07:21.540 --> 07:22.540
the razor away.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.540
They are not writing to pull it away.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.540
That is protecting the razor blade.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.540
That is the best I can say.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.540
All right.

07:29.540 --> 07:30.540
Thank you.

07:30.540 --> 07:31.540
That is all.

07:31.540 --> 07:32.540
And there is an injection.

07:32.540 --> 07:38.740
Just a couple of questions, Mr. Car.

07:38.740 --> 07:44.900
What was the reason that you made the trip on November 17th to see private shine at

07:44.900 --> 07:46.500
four days?

07:46.500 --> 07:52.060
Well, I didn't make a trip to see private shine at four days.

07:52.060 --> 07:54.020
I in effect went along for the ride.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.020
I was going to Boston.

07:56.020 --> 08:05.020
I was going to Boston by commercial airplane and the Secretary offered his plane to, in

08:05.020 --> 08:11.900
fact, the insisted that the senator and his party use his plane and I went along.

08:11.900 --> 08:16.100
Well, do you know what the reason was for the trip?

08:16.100 --> 08:17.100
Forced it.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.940
You were highlighting it as a passenger.

08:19.940 --> 08:20.940
Right.

08:20.940 --> 08:26.380
The only answer I could give you to that is that was really the trip to McGuire Airport.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.380
That's right.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.380
That's right.

08:28.380 --> 08:33.900
The best answer I could give you to that is to tell you that what happened.

08:33.900 --> 08:44.060
I had no knowledge as to the purpose of the trip when I was invited to go along.

08:44.060 --> 08:51.380
Only thing I know is that when we were there, Senator McCoffey in front of the two panels

08:51.380 --> 09:00.300
and a gang later told a private shine that he wanted him to work at every moment he had

09:00.300 --> 09:05.980
an awful lot of training on getting out the reports prepared.

09:05.980 --> 09:12.380
Well, was there any work discussed at this meeting on November 17th?

09:12.380 --> 09:14.140
Yes, there was.

09:14.140 --> 09:15.940
What did you discuss?

09:15.940 --> 09:17.540
I mean, what project?

09:17.540 --> 09:22.060
Well, I personally didn't discuss too much with him.

09:22.060 --> 09:23.980
Mr. Cohn did.

09:23.980 --> 09:30.980
The Senator talked with him about the reports.

09:30.980 --> 09:38.740
When you say report, you're referring to the report on the voice.

09:38.740 --> 09:46.940
When you say the report, what report are we speaking about the information-centered reports

09:46.940 --> 09:52.340
and what in the Voice of America report?

09:52.340 --> 09:59.340
I recall that the Senator spoke to him about other things.

09:59.340 --> 10:06.820
I recall that he mentioned the Oppenheimer situation.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.300
To private shines?

10:08.300 --> 10:11.340
Yes, there was something with discussion about that.

10:11.340 --> 10:15.420
What it was, at this point, on recall.

10:15.420 --> 10:27.940
I mean, if there was some discussion about an investigation on Mr. Oppenheimer, I couldn't

10:27.940 --> 10:28.940
say that.

10:28.940 --> 10:36.300
I just, I get the impression that it related to something perhaps that the shine had done

10:36.300 --> 10:37.900
or knew about.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.900
I didn't pay much attention at this point.

10:40.900 --> 10:44.340
That's about all I can say about it.

10:44.340 --> 10:53.180
You don't recall any information or anything that you need to get from shine on that occasion.

10:53.180 --> 11:00.580
I did, personally, I think maybe Mr. Cohn did, and I don't know whether the Senator needed

11:00.580 --> 11:06.020
it or just wanted to discuss something with him.

11:06.020 --> 11:11.580
But you didn't have any information that you wanted or not at that particular time.

11:11.580 --> 11:15.700
I just went along to get to Boston.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.900
But your recollection was that it was something with reference to the Oppenheimer matter.

11:19.900 --> 11:22.460
No, that's not my recollection, that's what it was.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.260
I don't know all about it.

11:24.260 --> 11:28.860
I do recall that there was some discussion of that subject.

11:28.860 --> 11:33.340
Were you with private shine, Mr. Cohn all the time?

11:33.340 --> 11:35.140
Most of the time, yes, sir.

11:35.140 --> 11:44.520
There were two channels with us most of the time, and I spent some time discussing many

11:44.520 --> 11:47.660
topics with them.

11:47.660 --> 11:59.700
You worked on the hearings in connection with the later of the hearings at Boston, yesterday.

11:59.700 --> 12:08.320
You recall that Mr. Cohn has testified that, on page 646, the circumstances of our meeting

12:08.320 --> 12:13.580
private shine were that prior to commencing certain hearings in Boston, we desired to obtain

12:13.580 --> 12:16.740
from private shine information which we had.

12:16.740 --> 12:21.740
So pertaining to the investigation which we were about to open in Boston, for that reason

12:21.740 --> 12:25.420
we went down to see him and we thought we were going to bot that and that alone.

12:25.420 --> 12:30.060
That's probably very, probably very true, sir.

12:30.060 --> 12:35.420
As I say, I went along to the right.

12:35.420 --> 12:39.340
One of the investigations of the defense plan started.

12:39.340 --> 12:47.780
The investigation of defense plan started as I recall sometime during the fall of the

12:47.780 --> 12:48.780
year.

12:48.780 --> 12:50.780
You know about when?

12:50.780 --> 12:51.780
Yes.

12:51.780 --> 13:01.780
I was during the course of the, during the course of the Fort Momet hearings, I developed

13:01.780 --> 13:11.500
that this radar work was more or less farmed out to different electrical companies and

13:11.500 --> 13:12.500
establishments.

13:12.500 --> 13:21.940
Did the signs start in on this new work then and connection with these defense plans

13:21.940 --> 13:23.940
when he's already in the army?

13:23.940 --> 13:24.940
No sir.

13:24.940 --> 13:33.300
This was in October and it wasn't a question, as far as I know, it wasn't so much a question

13:33.300 --> 13:40.700
of his starting in on new work as a question of his receiving information from an informant

13:40.700 --> 13:47.220
of his who had some knowledge concerning that's my understanding of it.

13:47.220 --> 13:56.820
Some information that was important in connection with the defense industry.

13:56.820 --> 13:58.820
That's all.

13:58.820 --> 14:00.820
Question in my right.

14:00.820 --> 14:04.820
Senator McCarthy, I don't have any questions.

14:04.820 --> 14:05.820
Mr.

14:05.820 --> 14:18.260
I have discussed a number of things publicly when I call.

14:18.260 --> 14:30.100
Trasons have been criticized for that because some claim that I use a word that is too strong.

14:30.100 --> 14:37.580
I would like to now discuss the statements by a five, rather outstanding Americans.

14:37.580 --> 14:41.700
I think all of them telling the truth.

14:41.700 --> 14:46.180
I believe it adds up to what we could call a treason and I'd like to discuss with you

14:46.180 --> 14:53.580
the question of whether or not the American people are entitled to the information or not.

14:53.580 --> 14:57.540
As I've said to you often I think you've hardly agreed.

14:57.540 --> 15:00.780
This is no game or anything.

15:00.780 --> 15:01.780
We think so.

15:01.780 --> 15:06.780
But we see going here some days.

15:06.780 --> 15:12.020
The boot chips are really down now.

15:12.020 --> 15:15.140
There are first our two theories.

15:15.140 --> 15:20.500
One is that if they favor the American people to give them the information about their

15:20.500 --> 15:26.500
servants are doing the other is that they're entitled to the information about their rights.

15:26.500 --> 15:30.300
As you know I subscribe to the letter.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.300
There you are.

15:31.300 --> 15:35.980
I would like to reach you if I may.

15:35.980 --> 15:40.860
From the statements of three individuals and ask you if you don't agree that regardless

15:40.860 --> 15:48.260
of how the information is classified, the American people should not know the background

15:48.260 --> 15:49.260
of this.

15:49.260 --> 15:58.660
General Van Sweets was only with us and one of our really great generals.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.060
Next to Douglas McArthur.

16:00.060 --> 16:04.260
In page 31 he had this to say.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.260
Some are buried as asking a question.

16:06.260 --> 16:11.820
He said, you reported I think General the newspapers as they're called as saying on two

16:11.820 --> 16:15.100
occasions that you could have got from the military victory in Korea.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.900
Is that correct?

16:17.900 --> 16:18.900
General Van Sweets.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.900
I think that was a little overstate of the paper.

16:21.900 --> 16:26.260
Or we might define what you mean by military victory.

16:26.260 --> 16:28.260
I would not say a complete victory.

16:28.260 --> 16:35.100
But in June of 1951 we had the communist armies on the run.

16:35.100 --> 16:39.340
They were heading badly out of supplies.

16:39.340 --> 16:41.340
Completely out of hand.

16:41.340 --> 16:42.340
Out of control.

16:43.340 --> 16:49.340
They were in a panic and were doing their best to fall back.

16:49.340 --> 16:53.900
During their best to fall as far back as possible when we stopped by orders.

16:53.900 --> 16:57.700
We did not pursue to finish the enemy.

16:57.700 --> 17:03.140
Senator Bird, did you recommend that the attack be continued?

17:03.140 --> 17:04.940
General Van Sweets.

17:04.940 --> 17:10.060
I was crying to them to turn me loose.

17:10.060 --> 17:15.780
Then dropping down Senator Bird, if you had had the authority to go ahead and pursue the

17:15.780 --> 17:21.940
enemy as far as you could, what would have been the result?

17:21.940 --> 17:23.940
General Van Sweets.

17:23.940 --> 17:29.540
I believe we would have gotten all his heavy equipment and perhaps two or three hundred thousand

17:29.540 --> 17:30.540
prisoners.

17:31.540 --> 17:35.340
Then General Ridgeway was testifying.

17:35.340 --> 17:36.900
I do not have the money here.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.740
But I can recap it.

17:39.740 --> 17:41.060
I think pretty much the memory.

17:41.060 --> 17:47.340
He was talking about the order to cut down the production of ammunition.

17:47.340 --> 17:52.780
In order which was signed in 1960, he never countermanded.

17:52.780 --> 17:57.580
And as Ridgeway said, as I say, I am not quoting him verbatim, but an effect he said,

17:57.580 --> 18:09.820
in the ammunition piles, ran low, the corpses in the grave's registration section, pile

18:09.820 --> 18:11.820
pie.

18:11.820 --> 18:17.060
And I am quoting you from five individuals.

18:17.060 --> 18:26.900
And one other now, all disconnected episodes, all part of the same picture.

18:26.900 --> 18:37.220
General Boat was testifying about the order which General President Eisenhower counseled

18:37.220 --> 18:40.660
when he took office.

18:40.660 --> 18:47.300
The order which the President referred to as using our Navy as a protective army of the

18:47.300 --> 18:53.660
communists, using our seven fleet of the protective army, army of the communist army.

18:54.660 --> 18:57.780
Here's what General Boat says.

18:57.780 --> 19:03.780
He says the anti-communist Chinese Navy is forbidden to act in any way by order of our

19:03.780 --> 19:09.540
government, which has given orders to our fleet to prevent it from stopping the communist

19:09.540 --> 19:12.620
supply ships going up to Korea.

19:12.620 --> 19:20.420
Those communist supply ships, they'll write by Formosa, equipped with Soviet munitions, put

19:20.420 --> 19:24.020
in the communist ships in Gideonia.

19:24.020 --> 19:31.500
They come all the way around and go right by Formosa and fail past their taking those weapons

19:31.500 --> 19:35.740
up to be used to kill American soldiers in Korea.

19:35.740 --> 19:41.980
And by order of our government, the Chinese Navy is flatly forbidden to stop them on their

19:41.980 --> 19:42.980
way up there.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.820
And some of them are watching us ask the question.

19:45.820 --> 19:53.020
He said with the Chinese Navy, the anti-communist Navy, with the Chinese Navy of the power, except

19:53.020 --> 19:58.300
for the order to intercept them and capture them, and bastard Boat.

19:58.300 --> 20:02.940
Certainly without question sir, without question.

20:02.940 --> 20:07.900
So Mr. Karvin, we are talking about investigating.

20:07.900 --> 20:15.260
We have here a sequence of statements made not 20 years ago and not 10 years ago, from

20:15.260 --> 20:16.260
the very recent plan.

20:16.260 --> 20:23.860
A statement made by General Lowell, till he affects that, because General MacArthur was

20:23.860 --> 20:29.740
hemstrung and brought down, we had to write off tens of thousands of casualties.

20:29.740 --> 20:37.620
This statement by President Eisenhower, that until he took off, our seven fleet was being

20:37.620 --> 20:41.460
used as their protective arm with the communist party.

20:41.460 --> 20:48.820
The statement by General Fan Sleeve, that we could have captured all of the heavy equipment.

20:48.820 --> 20:55.060
And two or three hundred thousand of the enemy, if politicians in Washington had not stopped

20:55.060 --> 21:02.860
him, the testimony of General Ridgeway, to the effects that the ammunition shortage.

21:02.860 --> 21:09.140
When the piles of ammunition ran low, the number of corpses piled high.

21:09.140 --> 21:16.580
The testimony of a master Boat, to the effects that by order of our government.

21:16.580 --> 21:24.500
The Boats were being shipped by Formosa, being used to kill American boys.

21:24.500 --> 21:29.900
Now I have referred to that Mr. Karvin's presence.

21:29.900 --> 21:35.660
I'm not going to ask you to say how you would define it.

21:35.660 --> 21:44.700
I hear Mr. Welch and individuals here talking about the importance of secrecy, whether

21:44.700 --> 21:48.860
or not the American people can know what's going on.

21:48.860 --> 21:55.680
You and I know Mr. Kar, that if individuals were in the government responsible for the

21:55.680 --> 22:00.300
five different incidents which I have just related to you.

22:00.300 --> 22:07.820
And if all of the information is stamped secret, we have no way on earth of knowing whether

22:07.820 --> 22:14.380
they are still there, whether they are still holding important jobs, and the only way

22:14.380 --> 22:19.940
the only way we can determine whether or not the individual responsible for these, what

22:19.940 --> 22:22.900
I call five incidents of treason.

22:22.900 --> 22:29.660
The only way we can find out whether they are still holding positions of power is that

22:29.660 --> 22:38.300
we have access, pretty late to information, except of course anything which would give

22:38.300 --> 22:43.380
out the names of the informants which would endanger the security of this nation.

22:43.380 --> 22:49.900
And do you agree with Mr. Karvin that we get down to this?

22:49.900 --> 22:56.500
It is important beyond words that when we get through with this hearing that somehow

22:56.500 --> 23:05.380
somewhere we work out with this administration, a formula whereby we can get the names, the

23:05.380 --> 23:12.540
American people can see the places of the individuals responsible for as well as says the

23:12.540 --> 23:16.340
deaths or tens of thousands of casualties of America.

23:16.340 --> 23:22.100
I think that we and the people have the right to know and I think it is important that

23:22.100 --> 23:26.820
we, some policy has worked out on that line yesterday.

23:26.820 --> 23:34.620
Mr. Karvin, can you think of any reason why the old Truman Blackout order of 1948 should

23:34.620 --> 23:39.620
be maintained in effect as of 1954?

23:39.620 --> 23:42.980
No, sir.

23:42.980 --> 23:55.820
And if our committee is to perform a function, it is imperative that not that every Blackout

23:55.820 --> 24:03.540
order regardless of whether it is Truman's right or not to be counseled in the standard.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.540
That's correct.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.540
No further questions, Mr. Chairman.

24:06.540 --> 24:09.300
Bob, we have the opportunity to return to our chief.

24:09.300 --> 24:13.860
The Truman Television Network is bringing to you through its facilities the Army McCarthy

24:13.860 --> 24:16.100
Subcommittee hearings.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.100
We pause now for station identification.

24:19.100 --> 24:22.100
Prickly Television Network.

24:22.100 --> 24:26.700
WABD, Channel 5, Duman, here in New York.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.700
In his military parade.

24:29.700 --> 24:33.100
That's the best way correct is.

24:33.100 --> 24:37.100
I mean, if the Army felt that he should be a private, that was all right with you.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.100
That's correct.

24:38.100 --> 24:45.100
You had no interest when we were the other, right?

24:45.100 --> 24:46.100
No, no, no.

24:46.100 --> 24:51.940
Do you think Mr. Colm had any personal interest in private signs, Army career?

24:51.940 --> 24:56.380
No, I don't think he had any, what you call personal interest in his career.

24:56.380 --> 25:04.580
I think he had an interest in his career to more so than I would have since he knew Mr.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.140
Shine better than I did.

25:06.140 --> 25:13.180
To see that, the Army did not miss you's private shine because it comes from the committee.

25:13.180 --> 25:23.580
Did you have any information, sir, that the Army was misusing private shine in any way?

25:23.580 --> 25:26.140
No, I don't, let me think for a second here.

25:26.140 --> 25:33.220
I don't recall any information that the Army was misusing private shine.

25:33.220 --> 25:41.220
No sir, but that wouldn't prevent alertness to such possibility.

25:41.220 --> 25:45.220
Did you think there was such an alertness on your part?

25:45.220 --> 25:49.220
No, I didn't have any great alertness, no sir.

25:49.220 --> 25:55.220
Do you think that Mr. Colm had a great alertness toward the possibility of misuse of private shine?

25:55.220 --> 25:58.220
Well, I think that he didn't have any great alertness.

25:58.220 --> 26:10.220
I think that he had perhaps more than I did and awareness of possibilities of such action being taken by the Army.

26:10.220 --> 26:13.220
Do you think that he was extremely tender on that subject?

26:13.220 --> 26:16.220
No, I don't think he was extremely tender on that subject.

26:16.220 --> 26:19.220
You don't think that he was quick to find any misuse, sir?

26:19.220 --> 26:21.220
No, no, that's misuse, partner.

26:21.220 --> 26:23.220
No, I don't, sir.

26:23.220 --> 26:24.220
No, I don't think he was.

26:25.220 --> 26:33.220
When I think that if Mr. Adams were to offer you a quote, tidbit, unquote, and would fall on deathbears,

26:33.220 --> 26:37.220
you had no interest in this man as an Army private.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.220
Yes, sir, it would fall on deathbears.

26:40.220 --> 26:44.220
Would it have fallen on deathbears on Mr. Colm's part?

26:44.220 --> 26:46.220
Yes, sir, I think it would.

26:46.220 --> 26:52.220
So that these were simply silly acts on the part of John Adams to offer you quote, tidbits, unquote.

26:52.220 --> 26:53.220
I think maybe.

26:53.220 --> 26:57.220
Just plain ridiculous, isn't that right?

26:57.220 --> 26:59.220
I think they were ridiculous, sir.

26:59.220 --> 27:06.220
I think it's your testimony yesterday that John Adams, a reasonably intelligent person,

27:06.220 --> 27:11.220
is said to have offered you tidbits to exchange for breaking a general.

27:11.220 --> 27:13.220
Isn't that right?

27:13.220 --> 27:21.220
I don't recall, I don't know that that's my testimony, but I recall the train ride,

27:21.220 --> 27:23.220
I think that that's what you're referring to.

27:23.220 --> 27:28.220
Well, I'm referring to several things, but that is one.

27:28.220 --> 27:36.220
No, I don't think I said yesterday that he offered tidbits to, uh, and return for the breaking of a general.

27:36.220 --> 27:39.220
No, I don't think that would be the exact way of saying it.

27:39.220 --> 27:43.220
Well, then just saying substance on one occasion, Mr. Adams said,

27:43.220 --> 27:48.220
if you give me a good word on General Lawton, I'll give you a good word on private shines things.

27:48.220 --> 27:49.220
That's the thing you can.

27:49.220 --> 27:51.220
I said that yesterday.

27:51.220 --> 27:53.220
Now, do you really think that happened, Mr. Caron?

27:53.220 --> 27:54.220
Really think what happened?

27:54.220 --> 28:01.220
That he offered a weekend pass to a private in order to get this committee's approval for breaking a general.

28:01.220 --> 28:05.220
Well, you say that he offered a weekend pass.

28:05.220 --> 28:11.220
You give a different connotation to it than I would, and then I did.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.220
He said...

28:12.220 --> 28:15.220
Let me read it to you, so we won't have any misunderstanding.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.220
This is saying 65-15.

28:17.220 --> 28:22.220
Mr. Adams said to Mr. Combe.

28:22.220 --> 28:28.220
Well, if you can give me some good word on the Lawton situation,

28:28.220 --> 28:34.220
maybe I can give you some good word on whether or not Shrine will be available this weekend.

28:34.220 --> 28:35.220
I'm quote.

28:35.220 --> 28:38.220
Yes, that's November 24, no?

28:38.220 --> 28:40.220
That's right.

28:40.220 --> 28:43.220
Yes, go ahead.

28:43.220 --> 28:53.220
Is that the suggestion of a rational person that a weekend pass for a private is a counterbalance for approval of breaking a general?

28:53.220 --> 28:54.220
No, sir.

28:54.220 --> 28:56.220
I think you...

28:56.220 --> 28:58.220
You asked for your testimony. I read it, sir.

28:58.220 --> 28:59.220
Oh, all right.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.220
All right.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.220
You want me to explain it to you now?

29:01.220 --> 29:06.220
No, I just want to know if that's what you intended to give as your testimony.

29:06.220 --> 29:07.220
Yes, sir.

29:07.220 --> 29:08.220
Yes, sir?

29:08.220 --> 29:16.220
I'll stand on any testimony I've given here if you can show me something that is wrong if I've met a mistake.

29:16.220 --> 29:22.220
Well, am I wrong in suggesting to you that your testimony is gone Adams' off in a weekend pass

29:22.220 --> 29:26.220
or Senator McCarthy's approval of breaking a general?

29:26.220 --> 29:28.220
No, my testimony here.

29:28.220 --> 29:30.220
If I'm reading from the same page, you are, sir.

29:30.220 --> 29:32.220
65-15.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.220
That's correct.

29:33.220 --> 29:34.220
I haven't misread it, have I?

29:34.220 --> 29:36.220
The second full paragraph.

29:36.220 --> 29:44.220
It says here, Mr. Adams said to Mr. Cohn that if you can give me some good word on the lot in situation,

29:44.220 --> 29:50.220
maybe I can give you some good word on whether or not Shine will be available this weekend.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.220
Did I misread it?

29:51.220 --> 29:52.220
Well, you didn't...

29:52.220 --> 30:03.220
I'm not sure that you read it, but you're talking about did Adams trade off a weekend for a private as against a demotion for a general?

30:03.220 --> 30:13.220
Adams is saying here, as I interpreted it when he said it, he's saying here that if Cohn would...

30:13.220 --> 30:18.220
Actually, he's referring to Senator McCarthy, that's what he's interested in.

30:18.220 --> 30:32.220
If Senator McCarthy would give some good word, that means Senator McCarthy would go along and not make any public statements concerning a removal or demotion.

30:33.220 --> 30:34.220
Of a general?

30:34.220 --> 30:35.220
Of a general.

30:35.220 --> 30:37.220
He then...

30:37.220 --> 30:42.220
He then might be able to do a little...

30:42.220 --> 30:50.220
be a little more agreeable as to whether or not Mr. Shine would be available that weekend to work on committing business.

30:50.220 --> 30:54.220
Now, the secretary of the Army had previously said...

30:54.220 --> 30:56.220
You still answering a question or you making a delay?

30:56.220 --> 30:57.220
I'm answering a question.

30:57.220 --> 31:01.220
I'm not addicted to making speeches, but I like to get the question in here.

31:02.220 --> 31:06.220
The secretary of the Army had said that...

31:06.220 --> 31:07.220
That...

31:07.220 --> 31:09.220
Shine would be available these weekends.

31:09.220 --> 31:11.220
Now, Mr. Adams is using...

31:11.220 --> 31:13.220
Is trying to...

31:13.220 --> 31:15.220
You step the...

31:15.220 --> 31:19.220
The far, assume of the secretary, he's changing things around.

31:19.220 --> 31:26.220
Well, it's still add stuff that there's on one side of the balance, the question of a weekend half for a private.

31:26.220 --> 31:32.220
And on the other side of the balance, the ratification or at least silence on the part of Senator McCarthy...

31:32.220 --> 31:34.220
As to the breaking of a general.

31:34.220 --> 31:35.220
What would that be?

31:35.220 --> 31:37.220
If you want to add it that way, that's all I was made of.

31:37.220 --> 31:40.220
Well, don't you think that's a fair way to add it?

31:40.220 --> 31:42.220
I don't think it's a...

31:42.220 --> 31:44.220
I don't think it's necessarily a fair way to add it.

31:44.220 --> 31:45.220
All right.

31:45.220 --> 31:46.220
You don't have to...

31:46.220 --> 31:49.220
I don't wish to continue a disagreeing with you.

31:49.220 --> 31:53.220
You are entitled to disagree with me at any time you waste it.

31:53.220 --> 31:55.220
Until then, I'll continue.
