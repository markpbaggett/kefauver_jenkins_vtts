00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
The typewriter that you use for it is...

00:03.200 --> 00:08.840
Well, I asked whether the Memoranda had been checked against all the typewriter in the

00:08.840 --> 00:10.800
office in question.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.440
And I had no idea when I asked a question as to whether or not we were going into the

00:15.440 --> 00:22.040
accuracy of the Memoranda from the standpoint of when they were written, whether they were

00:22.040 --> 00:23.040
proper.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.440
I asked if they'd been checked against the typewriter, and presumably that was not the question

00:27.440 --> 00:31.440
that Mr. Jankadad had for the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.440
The subject's timing is entirely correct and I'll get into it.

00:36.440 --> 00:41.440
In theory, the assistant to the director of Federal Bureau of Investigation is for whether

00:41.440 --> 00:49.440
or not such an investigation would be feasible in revealing his answer was, we've spent so much

00:49.440 --> 00:51.440
time around nothing but...

00:51.440 --> 00:55.440
And this could be what a way of such an investigation.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.440
I thank the...

00:57.440 --> 00:59.440
I thank the counsel and I want to make this point.

00:59.440 --> 01:03.440
My Chief interest has nothing to do with the individual in this case.

01:03.440 --> 01:08.440
My interest in this case are the armed services of the United States and how defense in

01:08.440 --> 01:10.440
this country against communism.

01:10.440 --> 01:15.440
I want to point out that the Chair and the Council, that many charges of luxury have

01:15.440 --> 01:20.440
been affected and made against the Secretary of the Army and his assistant.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.440
Now, let's be well.

01:22.440 --> 01:27.440
The Chair feels that if you're going to request, does the Committee go to the expense of

01:27.440 --> 01:30.440
how he's documentary experts?

01:30.440 --> 01:35.440
I think he should give us some indication at least as to some reason why you think such

01:35.440 --> 01:37.440
a request could bear proof.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.440
The Chair recalls the conversation which has been posed in his office.

01:41.440 --> 01:48.440
Early in the hearings or occurred in the suggestions that perhaps such a case might be fruitful.

01:48.440 --> 01:53.440
The reply was in a negative, which the Chair recalls on the basis of two points.

01:53.440 --> 02:00.440
The first was in the stand-rate of age as to whether they had been done perhaps since March

02:00.440 --> 02:04.440
11th or prior to March 11th, the back is rise up to the second.

02:04.440 --> 02:08.440
Or advised that in less documents that age considerably more than that,

02:08.440 --> 02:13.440
it would be impossible for any kind of fire and physical analysis to determine whether

02:13.440 --> 02:17.440
something would happen two months ago or three months ago or four months ago.

02:17.440 --> 02:22.440
The Chair can develop that kind of a meticulous evidence by the scientific test.

02:22.440 --> 02:27.440
And it's in the second point, since the talk about his change around so frequently,

02:27.440 --> 02:31.440
since we have evidence here that we don't know whether the documents that are now before the young lady,

02:31.440 --> 02:35.440
are originally there are topics that were picked up after a press conference,

02:35.440 --> 02:40.440
and seem to be the least you have for them to indicate that such a church could be fruitful,

02:40.440 --> 02:43.440
and be putting the country in the Congress with considerable expense,

02:43.440 --> 02:46.440
with no possibility of getting a defendant to that.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.440
Now, if we have such evidence, Mr. Welk,

02:48.440 --> 02:53.440
make sure that certainly I say here because there is some basis for believing

02:53.440 --> 02:56.440
that these documents are broadly presented.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.440
Of course, that is very pertinent to the investigation before.

02:59.440 --> 03:06.440
Mr. Wood, I will have a small and perhaps small note.

03:06.440 --> 03:10.440
Given my call to the state, he has such evidence, I think it should be present on the oath.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.440
I have no such evidence that there will be no such statement that will be given,

03:14.440 --> 03:16.440
my statement is precisely as follows.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.440
So, for sure, I'm going to back in front of the room,

03:18.440 --> 03:21.440
if I don't want to talk to others, just for the kind that other 90s tells us

03:21.440 --> 03:24.440
he has some such evidence that these evidence can be presented,

03:24.440 --> 03:25.440
of course, to be put on the oath.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.440
If he says he has none, it's not necessary for him.

03:28.440 --> 03:33.440
The obvious to be that Mr. Jenkins' mind must have some earlier days of this work,

03:33.440 --> 03:38.440
since my mind has worked today, and that he considered having the documents examined.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.440
He says to me that he finds that there is no way that it can be done

03:43.440 --> 03:46.440
that it is either for this or not, hopefully.

03:46.440 --> 03:52.440
I certainly cannot ask for the fact there is money to use to make such an examination.

03:52.440 --> 03:59.440
Mr. Jenkins will confirm the fact that he and I have talked about this problem in the past.

03:59.440 --> 04:05.440
And that when your parents leave, now, stand and then see and I,

04:06.440 --> 04:13.440
prepare with the dictation book from the trip in the typewriter and the age of the document,

04:13.440 --> 04:16.440
they can't actually check it.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.440
That means you serve the document that you stated to you.

04:20.440 --> 04:27.440
I came into this room, I hope sure that the reputation of the UN is reasonably honest, man.

04:27.440 --> 04:31.440
I hope to go out for a fact, reputation on this day of the month.

04:31.440 --> 04:36.440
I could not help myself with the strictness of the document,

04:36.440 --> 04:41.440
and I still am unconvinced because of some internal evidence in the week's one-up.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.440
But in any of the had eye now, it's dangerous.

04:44.440 --> 04:50.440
But if there is a riddle, it's right in the middle and they come as we will be able to solve it.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.440
But I would like to ask you a question.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.440
Mr. Wilson, I think Mr. Wilson has yielded.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.440
We have fairly, which is the intelligent theory, I think, many of the people.

05:02.440 --> 05:06.440
I have come under oath, I have read many, many statements,

05:06.440 --> 05:11.440
Mr. Collins has ever been able to take on an oath.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.440
We have made the statement.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.440
So are given the indication that you've got some evidence,

05:18.440 --> 05:21.440
for in the case there's something wrong about the document.

05:21.440 --> 05:25.440
What is the queues in this thing when you hear a perjury of questions?

05:25.440 --> 05:31.440
Well, I do think that this is the link to Down there and right here right hand,

05:31.440 --> 05:34.440
and square that you have no evidence, but all you've done,

05:34.440 --> 05:39.440
all you've done is try to raise an implication hoping you get violated.

05:39.440 --> 05:43.440
If you've got one I owe to others,

05:43.440 --> 05:46.440
then you should be willing to give us that under oath.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.440
If you have, it's not for sure.

05:49.440 --> 05:54.440
Then you should be willing to tell our jury of millions of American people

05:54.440 --> 06:00.440
that this claim is just as foamy and just as false as the claims against Frank Carrworth.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.440
And I would like to do that.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.440
I am going to go back on the stand under oath,

06:04.440 --> 06:07.440
but the call is going back on the stand under oath.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.440
Mr. Vistula's under oath,

06:09.440 --> 06:12.440
why would Mr. Wilson should not be willing?

06:12.440 --> 06:15.440
He makes these statements to the front under oath.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.440
I don't know, and I'm really going to ask the chair.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.440
I'm going to ask the chair to put you under oath before the hearing is there.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.440
I'm going to ask him to have you be sworn.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.440
Not only on this point, but upon many of the statements that have made it.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.440
I want to know if there's any statements in fact.

06:33.440 --> 06:38.440
I don't think a lawyer has any special privilege in this hearing rule.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.440
If he makes a false statement,

06:40.440 --> 06:43.440
if he makes a statement with no basis in fact,

06:43.440 --> 06:45.440
then I'm wanting to sworn.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.440
I'm not going to ask the chair to do it now because that's the five o'clock.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.440
Mr. Chairman, I believe it is. I can see the clock.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.440
Those five funny.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.440
I'm not asking the chair to do it now,

06:55.440 --> 07:04.440
but I am serving notice that I will formally request Mr. Wilson to be put under oath and be asked to testify.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.440
Mr. Chairman, is that?

07:05.440 --> 07:07.440
I don't have information. I like that.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.440
The phone is at John's office.

07:09.440 --> 07:16.440
I have to ask the question in order to fully understand what conflict is better moment of joy about.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.440
The determination of the age of a doctor.

07:19.440 --> 07:27.440
So I understand that there's no scientific need to do advice by the FBI of determining the age of a doctor.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.440
The subject is so anxious.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.440
So I am assuming he's doing it.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.440
The subject is so anxious.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.440
I made the statement.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.440
I'm just trying to get the right to testify.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
And justice is the FBI.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.440
We want to have that statement grow.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.440
The misunderstanding of the FBI can determine the age of a doctor.

07:44.440 --> 07:49.440
If there's a considerable disparity between the age, the thing we were advised,

07:49.440 --> 07:54.440
is to confirm the term of the test that you can narrow down to the point where a week or two or a month,

07:54.440 --> 07:56.440
that you can be determined.

07:56.440 --> 08:01.440
And unless the fate of the case, it doesn't question the going back to a document which might be several years old,

08:01.440 --> 08:04.440
where it becomes a disease or had yellow or had dimples.

08:04.440 --> 08:10.440
Because they couldn't tell with that narrow precision that whether a document was done on Monday morning,

08:10.440 --> 08:14.440
the first day of September, a Monday morning, the first day of October,

08:14.440 --> 08:16.440
the tests were not that meticulously.

08:16.440 --> 08:22.440
What I want to find out, Mr. Chairman, is that we have a record straight.

08:22.440 --> 08:32.440
Whether or not it's possible to determine an age of a document, whether it's one month, two months, four months, eight months, nine months,

08:32.440 --> 08:35.440
a bell, less than a year, that's the question.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.440
I would just like to have for the record some assurance on that.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.440
And if it's done the FBI, I think we ought to have a letter.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.440
So there won't be any argument about this after the hearings are over.

08:44.440 --> 08:50.440
You know what will happen, or you're going to have a lot of wires letters from experts explaining that this is all along.

08:50.440 --> 08:55.440
That you can determine the age of a type written document, week by week, month by month.

08:55.440 --> 09:00.440
And I would like for my own assurance to have that information.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.440
I think we ought to have it for me, FBI, or whoever gave it, Commissioner.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.440
Chair, I'm specifically thinking.

09:05.440 --> 09:09.440
I think it's probably desirable, and it's like a worthwhile, which it comes to.

09:09.440 --> 09:15.440
It was talked to the FBI, and I'm meticulously about just how long a time has to adapt before they can make it happen.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.440
I'm guessing Mr. Chairman.

09:17.440 --> 09:23.440
I think there is a scientific way as the Germany-Burley Church is in the slaughter.

09:23.440 --> 09:31.440
Why was a circuit judge back in the conference we had to be used quite often in the device known as a live detector?

09:31.440 --> 09:35.440
I have complete confidence in those live detectors.

09:35.440 --> 09:47.440
Now, I know that maybe the Secretary of the Army may feel that it violates his sense of dignity to send himself to it, but I would like to hear him now to get.

09:47.440 --> 09:51.440
I agree.

09:51.440 --> 09:59.440
Just to admit themselves, the live detector, I think to the Metley, Mr. Chairman.

09:59.440 --> 10:07.440
We can get a lot of information, we don't want to otherwise not get, but to make it very clear, I realize you can't force anyone to do that.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.440
That would be violating his constitutional privilege.

10:11.440 --> 10:21.440
But if we could do that, Mr. Chairman, in one day, I believe, in one day we could end this whole hassle we've been in.

10:21.440 --> 10:31.440
I would like to say that I will be the first to agree to submit to such a test.

10:31.440 --> 10:39.440
I think a live detector, properly operated is practically unbeatable.

10:39.440 --> 10:47.440
I think in all of the principles to be good to do that, and we might be able to end this thing in 24 hours than 24 days.

10:47.440 --> 10:53.440
I think as far as the instant case before, it's not where we test until kind of clock tomorrow morning.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.440
Let's go with the public information in the comments.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.440
This request is made, I think, now I've said with a long problem.

11:01.440 --> 11:10.440
But the difficult problem would be as I see it, it may be testifies that she doesn't know whether these are the ones that were tied to the regime.

11:10.440 --> 11:16.440
Where there was, it's about the 11th day of March.

11:16.440 --> 11:25.440
If you establish the fact that these were tied to the 11th day of March, it would not establish the fact whether they were the original or not.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.440
I'd just anyway, to pursue it to get to this space unit.

11:29.440 --> 11:35.440
If you want to have that suspicion, I have a right to pursue it as counsel, but then I'm what this turns me is.

11:35.440 --> 11:46.440
Even if you establish the fact that the documents here present were written about the 11th day of March, that wouldn't establish the fact that they were only not to lose.

11:46.440 --> 11:52.440
She says she doesn't know whether the original were handed out to the first or whether these are there.

11:52.440 --> 11:58.440
Unless you can clear it, I don't see where the experts would be.

11:58.440 --> 12:02.440
There are many times that was noted in what the chair stated.

12:02.440 --> 12:08.440
When he asked counsel, whether or not he could suspend to it some reason.

12:08.440 --> 12:16.440
From going to this expense in view of the test and only which is before, someone added by the information we secured from the FBI.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.440
So, if we have information, we can check further.

12:19.440 --> 12:23.440
If you're not, they can tell whether something has been done two months or four months ago.

12:23.440 --> 12:32.440
But we then run into the roadblock, established by the evidence that we don't know whether the documents before the young lady were original or picked up after the first time.

12:32.440 --> 12:41.440
They seem like a few to taste unless Mr. Wolfe has an evidence to submit and the chair understands Mr. Wolfe's directly and I hope he'd be correct if he does not.

12:41.440 --> 12:46.440
Mr. Wolfe said that his suspicion is new entirely out of the evidence that he heard in the news.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.440
And he did not ask to submit any additional evidence.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.440
Am I right in that, Mr. Wolfe?

12:50.440 --> 12:55.440
I cannot make it too clear that that is so.

12:55.440 --> 13:04.440
And I do not wish anyone that here is my voice in this country to think that my suspicions were based on anything other than what we heard in this room.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.440
I cannot make that too clear.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.440
Thank you. I can translate the chair to chair.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.440
The chair to chair.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.440
I have a question.

13:11.440 --> 13:16.440
On the file, what is written on this is this goal.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.440
I can find a file.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.440
Yes.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.440
Investigations committee.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.440
One was that.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.440
On it.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.440
I was originally made up.

13:23.440 --> 13:28.440
Well, I think that's a matter if you wanted to check if that's where...

13:28.440 --> 13:29.440
When was that left?

13:29.440 --> 13:31.440
When the file was first put up in our cover?

13:31.440 --> 13:32.440
Yes.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.440
All the other memorandum in that file.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.440
All of the other memorandum in the file.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.440
You don't know whether that's original now or not.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.440
I get it.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.440
It's all the plain type.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
It's only the original.

13:43.440 --> 13:52.440
It's the file itself with the folder with the writing that you just referred to.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.440
The investigation.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.440
Yes.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.440
That is original.

13:56.440 --> 14:00.440
Are the chair and the file before we meet that?

14:00.440 --> 14:07.440
Are there any other consular wills for anybody else around the committee table desire to ask Mr. Just to throw the questions in the morning.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.440
