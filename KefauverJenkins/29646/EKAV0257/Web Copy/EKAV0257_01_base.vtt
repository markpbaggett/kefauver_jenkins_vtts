WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.980
And so, just a name-gen is just a preliminary and they rather curtailing types of investigation

00:11.980 --> 00:18.960
that is not concluded either way, to combine names in an engine which indicates the rather

00:18.960 --> 00:24.960
information which is later disproved as a consequence of a fueling company.

00:24.960 --> 00:31.960
And you can also find cases of very serious ethanol agents which would not kill up naturally

00:31.960 --> 00:32.960
in a name yet.

00:32.960 --> 00:33.960
Sure, 100% right.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.960
The name is Mr. Welch that normally occur in a name set.

00:37.960 --> 00:42.960
Are those who have operated in some capacity or another above ground?

00:43.960 --> 00:48.960
And our segments and the most important segments is the birth of activities in this country

00:48.960 --> 00:49.960
as well as the low ground activity.

00:49.960 --> 00:56.960
If it's a below ground activity, it's not likely to come up in the name set of one of our

00:56.960 --> 00:57.960
investigating names.

00:57.960 --> 01:03.960
It might or might not come up in the name set of FBI files because they have filed

01:03.960 --> 01:08.960
assembled in parts from the information they get from the Archimedes and the Un-American

01:08.960 --> 01:09.960
activities.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.960
Mr. Welch, you may be interested in learning.

01:12.960 --> 01:18.960
That's during the many years that I was a member of the Health Committee on Un-American

01:18.960 --> 01:26.960
activities, the FBI constantly kept not less than one and frequently two agents stationed

01:26.960 --> 01:32.960
in the fire rooms in which they kept their files going to them just to get the names out

01:32.960 --> 01:35.960
of them which they might add into their file.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.960
In case we had discovered something which they had overlooked and because the name is

01:40.960 --> 01:45.960
in the file, there's not necessarily proof of them to be a bad American.

01:45.960 --> 01:50.960
It's an indication that it deserves a little further exploration than it is.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.960
Would you give me just a moment to ask me to demonstrate to instruct you to get Colonel Ringman

01:57.960 --> 02:00.960
card for me now so I can have it when I examine them.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.960
I'll be glad to ask you.

02:06.960 --> 02:13.960
Now, I think I was in the un-American activity file room two or three times and all the

02:13.960 --> 02:14.960
years I've done there.

02:14.960 --> 02:20.960
But my guess would be if our files are unlikely files of the un-American activities committee.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.960
If there is no derogatory information, there's probably no card and no file.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.960
There's to be some about Colonel Ringman so we can file it.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.960
Yes, all I will ask is chair to have a rest.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.960
Lieutenant Maca-C, do you have somebody look to the files and see if they do have a spark or if they do have a file?

02:36.960 --> 02:39.960
I'm sure if they do have, it can be made available to us.

02:39.960 --> 02:45.960
Mr. Chairman, last day I was the very surprised to find that a file had been opened on...

02:45.960 --> 02:48.960
Senator Ringman is the firm that the name's X is negative.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.960
I will text, but that's the right thing.

02:51.960 --> 02:57.960
But I'd be very surprised to find any file open on a man whether it was no derogatory information.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.960
Is that connection Mr. Welp?

02:59.960 --> 03:09.960
The chair one day when he was on the House Committee of the Un-American Activities suggested to our committee that we established a good housekeeping name,

03:09.960 --> 03:17.960
just for people about whom questions have been raised and on whom we were unable to find any suspension of it.

03:17.960 --> 03:22.960
In the main we abandoned the idea because it's might can raise some time.

03:22.960 --> 03:28.960
An indication of innocence which is not justified because no field investigation has been held.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.960
In a few cases I do know in the House file they have put in the files,

03:33.960 --> 03:38.960
letters from Thunder Creek and Congressman and some investigating vacancies,

03:38.960 --> 03:43.960
indicating that there are some good qualities and good features about an investigation

03:43.960 --> 03:46.960
and the offset some of the derogatory information.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.960
I have in mind a prominent citizen of New York,

03:49.960 --> 03:53.960
whom I did that very thing about two years ago.

03:53.960 --> 04:01.960
Due to the fact that a member of his family with a similar name had frequently found his way correctly into the address files

04:01.960 --> 04:06.960
and put in a letter saying that that did not indicate that there was anything at risk for this individual.

04:06.960 --> 04:13.960
But by and large there is no such thing as I know of any place in Washington as a sort of a good housekeeping label

04:13.960 --> 04:18.960
where you'll list the good Americans or the Americans to get some charges or not make.

04:18.960 --> 04:25.960
Now if the Senator can't find in the file, anything on Mr. Ringwear or the regulatory nature or the commended regulatory nature,

04:25.960 --> 04:30.960
I hope you will put it simply in a state that I am reasonably certain that there was,

04:30.960 --> 04:35.960
because they would not open up a file having found nothing of the derogatory nature.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.960
If you will have somebody who is unrested with the file who make a text or that we will know,

04:39.960 --> 04:41.960
then that's certainly not.

04:42.960 --> 04:51.960
Senator McCarthy stated that Senator Jackson or I had moved one time to have a few checks made of all potential employees.

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
I think that's the right.

04:52.960 --> 04:58.960
I know I made that motion back in the days when Senator Hui was a member of the chairman of the committee,

04:58.960 --> 04:59.960
and I was a minority member.

04:59.960 --> 05:07.960
As the motion prevailed then, and I believe I recall Senator Jackson making it after he came on the committee some years later.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.960
And the motion carries both times.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.960
One of the things that I hope may come from is industries from the hearing of this time,

05:14.960 --> 05:19.960
is the little bit of relationship of a practical relationship,

05:19.960 --> 05:25.960
a relationship that's blended with our ideologies to turn between the FBI and our committee.

05:25.960 --> 05:30.960
But if we should develop a working range that seems impossible at present time,

05:30.960 --> 05:36.960
whereby the FBI had the authority to make a complete field text of all of our staff members,

05:37.960 --> 05:39.960
I certainly would favor it.

05:39.960 --> 05:49.960
About a year ago, I wrote this day yesterday at the Hoover and told him that since I realized anybody in the communist-caating business was all with that text,

05:49.960 --> 05:55.960
I would have been treated if he'd make a field text of the ten young people working in my office.

05:55.960 --> 06:03.960
And I received back a very polite letter saying that under the authority of the FBI they had no authority

06:03.960 --> 06:07.960
to make that kind of text for an individual senator or for a committee.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.960
I do think that we might get some attention.

06:10.960 --> 06:15.960
The committee's in a legislative picture, so that the FBI would have the authority,

06:15.960 --> 06:18.960
I'm sure they would be very happy to cooperate in that connection.

06:18.960 --> 06:23.960
I wonder if the chair would make it very clear for the benefit of our blood-winged public that

06:23.960 --> 06:32.960
is not the FBI that accuses this field of investigation about it entirely up to the Chinese general.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.960
Mr. Hoover would of course conduct that from industry.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.960
That is correct. It's not the fall of the FBI and I don't think it's the fall of the attorney general,

06:40.960 --> 06:47.960
but basically, half of the FBI's created a film primarily as an executive agent.

06:47.960 --> 06:54.960
And one of the difficulties of this coordination between the refugees and the judiciary is that

06:54.960 --> 06:59.960
there is some question which can literally not be raised about the desirability of the propire.

06:59.960 --> 07:06.960
And executive agency making a text of the staff of the legislator's members that comes to question.

07:06.960 --> 07:14.960
So it isn't easy, and there's no fault with anybody in the fact that the attorney general is a fugitive of the city.

07:14.960 --> 07:21.960
The FBI has been doing this. We have not developed a workable topic which is too deceptive for the profession.

07:21.960 --> 07:28.960
I mean, as better the chair than I am, I just think it would be extremely important if we could make an arrangement

07:28.960 --> 07:37.960
that our investigative agency could have a full field investigation of all employees if it would be a very benefit.

07:37.960 --> 07:44.960
And I think that some of the agencies would be much freer about giving us information than they do for us now.

07:44.960 --> 07:50.960
I'd like to add that when he had the responsibility of conducting this hearing or investigation,

07:50.960 --> 07:57.960
so I would like to confirm him. He called the FBI and asked Mr. Hoover whether he should recommend the Mississippi Census.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.960
But, gentlemen, a group of staff members care as a part of the system.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.960
And I just want to tell you a few minutes and do time I have to go.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.960
I'm sorry. Can I know that?

08:07.960 --> 08:09.960
That's all you have to for. You may not.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.960
You may leave as you may leave as you want to yet.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.960
There are columnists of Hoover asking if he could recommend an investigative committee.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.960
Mr. Hoover was very sympathetic with the approach to the study.

08:20.960 --> 08:25.960
He had a follow-up with the justice rule that he had followed with the House Committee of the American Activities,

08:25.960 --> 08:32.960
with the General Committee and with our committee, and refrain from making specific recommendations.

08:33.960 --> 08:39.960
Mr. Hoover, we do have a family of retests, so it's been a minute. I'll end the slide.

08:39.960 --> 08:43.960
The family says until the whistle turns.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.960
Dr. Herzl-Tram and the Clarke A.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.960
Reach, reach.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
The radio will come back to the organ.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.960
The chair of the board will come back to the organ.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.960
The committee will come to the organ please.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.960
The committee will take their seats.

09:07.960 --> 09:12.960
I'll just don't ensure the same as it was when we reached out.

09:12.960 --> 09:19.960
And so we all now have to reiterate the testimony, administration, and the correct.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.960
When I apologize for the terrible, or the roughly asking for a recess,

09:24.960 --> 09:32.960
I had refused a message of the chair for my secretary, and I felt it was just a position important for my...

09:32.960 --> 09:35.960
I did want to take care of three minutes off.

09:35.960 --> 09:39.960
Well, we had to have a mid-afternoon recess anyhow now. We had had it.

09:39.960 --> 09:44.960
The time keep provided the chair he just had 26 seconds left to be timed.

09:44.960 --> 09:51.960
So I will yield that 26 minutes, 26 seconds, and call on Senator Jack.

09:52.960 --> 10:01.960
Senator McCarty, I look to the darkness that you handed me.

10:01.960 --> 10:11.960
The sign plan outline in connection with the study that he made regarding psychological warfare.

10:11.960 --> 10:16.960
I think you believe, I think you stated that it was the bloodless type of warfare.

10:17.960 --> 10:23.960
I understand that as a one document he sent to the State Department on the land,

10:23.960 --> 10:29.960
any misdeeds, and I have not read it, so that if you want to cross the enemy on that, just a great way to plan it.

10:29.960 --> 10:30.960
I have not read it.

10:30.960 --> 10:37.960
Well, I just asked Stuart, in fact I had gone all the way through it, with straight answers.

10:37.960 --> 10:44.960
And I noticed that if you're going to answer me, if you're going to question me on that, I would want to copy you.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.960
Well, I can read to you from that directive.

10:49.960 --> 10:53.960
No, I would want to copy of any documents, but do you have an extra copy of this?

10:53.960 --> 10:56.960
No, I have no extra copy. I gave you the only copy of this in the file.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.960
It was submitted to me, and it's really an amazing document.

10:59.960 --> 11:04.960
I think we ought to have a copy made immediately.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.960
You sent it to me, and of course we're going to send them.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.960
I did not have an opportunity to read it except during the...

11:11.960 --> 11:16.960
Would you be able to do root if you have a copy made?

11:16.960 --> 11:20.960
In the other case, you may have a way.

11:20.960 --> 11:25.960
Well, you say that if I read just full item by item, you can...

11:25.960 --> 11:29.960
I was not on to the examiner on documents, but does not read.

11:29.960 --> 11:33.960
Unless I have a document to call me.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.960
I'll be glad to have this one.

11:35.960 --> 11:40.960
I'll take it down and have a copy of it.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.960
I'll have a slide for a while to make the call.

11:43.960 --> 11:48.960
If you write them all you can, so I can see your copy, too.

11:48.960 --> 11:58.960
I'll re-writ the front of a copy, too, that phase of the inquiry.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.960
So that the copies are back to me.

12:02.960 --> 12:07.960
In the Army of Bill of particular,

12:07.960 --> 12:12.960
charge eight, and I read it to you.

12:12.960 --> 12:17.960
I'll wait again until I get the Bill of particular...

12:17.960 --> 12:19.960
...uh...

12:19.960 --> 12:22.960
...I'm just going to go in there.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.960
Charge eight, Bill of the Army.

12:29.960 --> 12:33.960
Honor above November 6th, send the McCarthy, Mr. Colman, Mr. Car.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.960
Talk to Indu and persuade Secretary Steven the Nitter Adams.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.960
The reign for the assignment of five times in New York City.

12:42.960 --> 12:49.960
The study and report evidence, if any, of pro-communist leanings in West Point textbook.

12:49.960 --> 12:53.960
Is that allegation to or for?

12:53.960 --> 13:01.960
We're burning out to an assignment, Mr. Steven, as a matter of fact,

13:01.960 --> 13:07.960
that he doesn't have to call any such attention for the department of the car.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.960
Now please turn to allegation 18.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.960
18, Mr. Steven.

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
Ready?

13:20.960 --> 13:22.960
Right.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.960
Honor above December 10th, 1953,

13:25.960 --> 13:30.960
Penitenti McCarthy and Mr. Car, talk to obtain a special assignment for five times.

13:30.960 --> 13:35.960
In New York City for the purpose of studying textbooks at West Point,

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
is that allegation through or for?

13:37.960 --> 13:39.960
For.

13:39.960 --> 13:44.960
Honor above January 14th, 2020.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
Excuse me, I beg your pardon.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
Charge number 25.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.960
Right.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.960
Honor above January 14th, 1954,

13:59.960 --> 14:07.960
Penitenti McCarthy directly requested Secretary Steven to cause private signs to be assigned to the New York City area,

14:07.960 --> 14:11.960
epic conclusion of his tour of duty at Camp Bors New York.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.960
Is that allegation true or for?

14:13.960 --> 14:17.960
Allegation 28.

14:17.960 --> 14:23.960
Honor above January 20th, 1954.

14:23.960 --> 14:29.960
Penitenti McCarthy, repressive Mr. Adams to obtain a special assignment for private sign in New York.

14:29.960 --> 14:36.960
And suggested that Mr. Cohn would continue to harass the Army unless the demand was exceeded to.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.960
Is that allegation true or for?

14:39.960 --> 14:47.960
Well, let's Chairman, that's all the questions that this time I'll wait until the copy of the document comes down.

14:47.960 --> 14:59.960
And if I may, let's Chairman, at the last ten minutes, I'd ask you if you were safe upon me,

14:59.960 --> 15:05.960
the target made by Secretary Steven Smith-Watt.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.960
Yes.

15:08.960 --> 15:18.960
What you answered was the charge that you had used the investigating committee of the Tennyson Water Doors,

15:18.960 --> 15:22.960
the cure or attempted to cure a reference for Steven Smith-Watt.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.960
I was all yours.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.960
You answered that was both.

15:26.960 --> 15:34.960
I think that's been proven by the monitored phone call from a testimony in the prison for the military.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.960
I like this. I might say if I can take this one second.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.960
I'm just going to send it back.

15:40.960 --> 15:44.960
I want to put it in the front of the car for a while, it's the most bread-right-the-burdy.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.960
But it's not, so we must proceed, I think.

15:48.960 --> 15:59.960
You will agree with me that if the charges are not proven, that I'm responsible activists and committees.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.960
The target has been charged with what is made by Steven Smith-Watt and not Steven Smith-Watt.

16:03.960 --> 16:10.960
That's a very serious, not in a safe but non-conquering way.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.960
That's been proven.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.960
Very serious.

16:13.960 --> 16:22.960
The military is harder, I think we should say in fairness to Secretary Steven Smith in the monitoring phone call.

16:22.960 --> 16:27.960
I'm at the time, I believe once we call the news, we call them the columns.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.960
Number calls from Mr. Smith-Watt.

16:29.960 --> 16:35.960
Mr. Steven Smith made it very clear that he felt there was nothing to this.

16:35.960 --> 16:47.960
What induced him is in the age of March, and he felt there was nothing to this and the eleventh from the formal, very vicious charge of the file.

16:47.960 --> 16:55.960
And induced him to the content of the file, or if he knew there would be files, I don't know.

16:55.960 --> 17:09.960
The senator, in order to the record of the complete, what is your answer to this charge that will take down the law at home?

17:09.960 --> 17:20.960
I use this position as a member of the staff of the committee in order to secure the appropriate treatment in the half of the public charge.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.960
I'll give him my own answer.

17:22.960 --> 17:28.960
I'll get a reply from a boy told me, I'll be able to meet with the hergier.

17:28.960 --> 17:35.960
I am firmly convinced that it's just in just some details of the column that there's absolutely nothing to it.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.960
And I'm guessing that's an action from her father.

17:39.960 --> 17:52.960
If they could point their finger to something improper to draw it this, if they could point their finger to some investigation that he induced us to start to put on him start.

17:52.960 --> 18:04.960
From what the should not have been called, something is a little improper, then I would be a little more curious about these charges.

18:04.960 --> 18:10.960
The email I recall, and I said in the stratum found that there's a lot of anything wrong with it, that's a wrong.

18:10.960 --> 18:30.960
The only act that he could put his finger on was that Mr. Cohn had failed to get me to call on an investigation to show why the members of the old loyalty board had cleared people's come to trick us to working with the radar laboratories.

18:30.960 --> 18:35.960
Roy never tried to get me to call at all, if he had a sort of a month special.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.960
On that line, yes.

18:37.960 --> 18:46.960
As David Charnier security commissioner in the Army, I'll be able to assign to a position in the yard.

18:46.960 --> 18:51.960
Would you have followed all the hearings that were thought-moments?

18:51.960 --> 18:57.960
The science situation would have in no way affected our investigation.

18:57.960 --> 19:05.960
May I say that I am very happy now that the science is a private.

19:05.960 --> 19:10.960
Well, maybe he may have liked it to be listening.

19:10.960 --> 19:14.960
It shows that he got no special consideration with any kind.

19:14.960 --> 19:24.960
The only special consideration with Dave Charnier got taken all the other of all the other purchases was that he was allowed to work.

19:24.960 --> 19:30.960
And he's off-hours instead of engaged in recreation.

19:30.960 --> 19:38.960
He'll condemn that David Charnier has been discriminated against because of his former connections with it tonight.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.960
I wasn't wanting to pass them that.

19:41.960 --> 19:45.960
I read a story and they wasn't even papers.

19:45.960 --> 19:58.960
I don't want to be an authority for their velocity, which they say that he was scheduled for some special tool and intelligence.

19:58.960 --> 20:05.960
They said the White House intervened and kept him from getting that particular training.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.960
I frankly can't believe the White House would intervene.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.960
I don't know how over.

20:11.960 --> 20:16.960
When the dark came up to your potter, the meeting was January 21st.

20:16.960 --> 20:23.960
It was the machinery of the Southern Russians for these two charges to be made.

20:23.960 --> 20:33.960
I think the President being very, very badly advised has decreased that no one can tell what happened in the meeting.

20:33.960 --> 20:48.960
Then we have the Good Thunder of Missouri, Thunder of Simonton, who got the top Democrat advisor to advise our product committee to apply.

20:48.960 --> 20:55.960
And Thunder of Simonton decided not to take the stand.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.960
I'm not going to put it on for the last.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.960
The man I take now 30 seconds to make one thing clear, Mr. Cameron, if I may.

21:01.960 --> 21:16.960
I would like to make it clear that my appearing on the stand should be no problem in the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years for a four-thing Thunder of his go-peer.

21:16.960 --> 21:22.960
I wanted clear that I appear here upon my own volition.

21:22.960 --> 21:27.960
If I had been subpoenaed, frankly, I would not have appeared.

21:27.960 --> 21:32.960
I think that under the Constitution, you cannot force Thunder of his.

21:32.960 --> 21:42.960
Intestifying. I think it could be made very clear in the record of this time that this should not be a precedent for forcing a Thunder.

21:42.960 --> 21:49.960
Sometimes in the future to appear, but that reason I may say to the Thunder of Missouri.

21:49.960 --> 21:56.960
I have no intention of attempting to force him to testify.

21:56.960 --> 22:04.960
I wish he would, but if he decides not to, he may be right, I may be wrong.

22:04.960 --> 22:09.960
I have no particular.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.960
And the Thunder.

22:12.960 --> 22:20.960
The enemy's lucky.

22:20.960 --> 22:26.960
Mr. Collins got you, the one he got, the Secretary's even though not over 27.

22:26.960 --> 22:33.960
He's both gone about getting a two-week follow-up, a five-in-kind after his induction.

22:33.960 --> 22:45.960
Mr. Collins told me that he discussed with Stephen, not getting a follow-up, but getting temporary duty with the committee in order to clean up his work.

22:45.960 --> 22:54.960
If you tell Mr. Collins, if you thought five-in-kind, what not to be three separately for many of the American boy who is back is four-wheeled freedom now.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.960
You'll be on it.

22:57.960 --> 23:10.960
Mr. Collins told you that he spoke to Secretary Stephen Spachine about having Mr. Jones and the CIA, and that he would appreciate Mr. Stephen's withdrawal to Alan Dulles about it.

23:10.960 --> 23:21.960
A very small Mr. Collins told me that Mr. Stephen was brought up originally and that the first time Mr. Collins agreed to it.

23:21.960 --> 23:43.960
And then later, as I recall, inspecting him wrongly, the late later Mr. Collins suggests that he should not do that because we were at that time conducting a preliminary investigation of the threat of the CIA and the Dundet Defense Declaration now.

23:43.960 --> 23:48.960
We just checked with Mike. He's gone to get the facts right.

23:52.960 --> 23:53.960
Second Monday.

24:09.960 --> 24:20.960
Well, all I can tell you about Mr. Smith's coming to me is that Mr. Collins did just discuss with me the fact that he had talked to Stephen about a fellow or not.

24:21.960 --> 24:27.960
Mr. Smith is not a trained, which is an experience that our committee is investigating terminus.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.960
It might not be as done as an CIA, they just tested.

24:31.960 --> 24:49.960
And Mr. Collins brought up the question of whether or not that would be wise and viewed as fact that we were currently still as a today conducting a preliminary investigation of what looked to be.

24:49.960 --> 24:56.960
It might look like a very, very dangerous situation in the CIA.

24:56.960 --> 25:16.960
I might add, I know you agree with me that. I hope it's wrong if there is any such infiltration, terminus, and because of very large majority of our military budget based on analysis of foreign military efforts, that's $29.5 billion, I think 10th version I think it was.

25:16.960 --> 25:41.960
I think the question is, from the time he's been to the year of CREDIP, when we brought this matter up, some time ago, the question of whether or not we should have a public investigation, I think you really, individuals who suggest that we shouldn't get into a public hospital unless we knew we just pulled our cooperation from the executive branch.

25:41.960 --> 25:48.960
I believe before I'd announced the report back, my Democrat friend was at the committee.

25:48.960 --> 25:52.960
I thank you.

25:52.960 --> 25:59.960
Madam Attorney, the good tell Mr. Collins, you didn't think I'd beg you for it, and I read that question before.

25:59.960 --> 26:19.960
When, if you first learned that five of the time was going to have a two week furlough after each induction, I couldn't give you the day if I know that the law is the only thing he was going to be inducted in, I think that he was giving two weeks to finish his work for the committee.

26:19.960 --> 26:27.960
On November 7th, you spoke to Secretary Stevenson that you're not an answer, not to put China in service and to sign him back to the committee.

26:27.960 --> 26:33.960
I think that for the monitoring's role was so.

26:33.960 --> 26:39.960
You said at that time that you're not that there was nothing indispensable about it.

26:39.960 --> 26:48.960
I thought he was a good man, but not in the front, no one was in the front, I think even the son of the Missouri is not in the front.

26:49.960 --> 26:58.960
If you were telling Secretary Steven to that time, or you're not saying that, if you were telling him the fact that you saw it, the truth is there was nothing indispensable about Mr. Johnson.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.960
The letter of that approach, I feel was known as an accomplice.

27:02.960 --> 27:07.960
Do you ever tell Mr. Collins to stop acting for such a weekend passes for Mr. Johnson?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.960
No.

27:10.960 --> 27:16.960
Did you ever suggest to Secretary Steven that he should revolt the orders, making special arrangements for private times we can leave?

27:16.960 --> 27:19.960
No.

27:19.960 --> 27:26.960
On September 7th, didn't you tell Secretary Stevenson that this was one of the few things you had seen with the phone completely unreasonable about?

27:26.960 --> 27:28.960
I think there was no November 7th.

27:28.960 --> 27:29.960
I beg your pardon.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.960
It isn't about November 7th.

27:31.960 --> 27:42.960
I just got to his statement of the day before last, I think he got to take his discussion of the day before with the conversation of 7th.

27:42.960 --> 27:53.960
I first told Bob Steven that the throwing away difference, that I felt that the news re-dirt man we have, Donald Barclay, could write the report.

27:53.960 --> 27:58.960
And if we were not reasonable, they would try every weekend.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.960
Roy differs.

28:00.960 --> 28:07.960
He felt that no one else could write the report except the man who had been working on a full time.

28:07.960 --> 28:15.960
And I've got to admit, this was one of the times when Roy was right.

28:15.960 --> 28:21.960
Did you tell Mr. Collins that he was being unreasonable about private time?

28:21.960 --> 28:27.960
I don't think I used the word unreadable.

28:27.960 --> 28:31.960
Didn't you order Mr. Collins to put being unreasonable about private time?

28:31.960 --> 28:32.960
No.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.960
Because I didn't think he was unreasonable.

28:34.960 --> 28:40.960
At no time, you didn't order him to teach his repress or withdraw his repress for special weekend passes.

28:40.960 --> 28:41.960
Is that right?

28:41.960 --> 28:44.960
Well, but let's get this data from me.

28:44.960 --> 28:54.960
When you talk about special weekend passes, we're talking about his right to work, use to the play, when he was not in training.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.960
I don't think that any sexual favor for a private.

28:57.960 --> 29:03.960
Well, I know that Mr. Chappin did say I think Roy takes me and let him come back for weekend to something so as girls won't get too long to him.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.960
Maybe if they take his hero, I'll be one who want to come back.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.960
Well, I'm here, so that's not an issue, man.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.960
The last little before Dave was down a fortice.

29:13.960 --> 29:21.960
He wasn't a gore at private time keeping his girls to be as long as the Miss Ergen committee did with you.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.960
No, I was not.

29:24.960 --> 29:31.960
Now you heard Mr. Collins have to fire repeatedly that the only purpose of his request to leave was so that Mr. Chann could do committee work.

29:31.960 --> 29:32.960
Right?

29:32.960 --> 29:34.960
Yes.

29:35.960 --> 29:44.960
When you talk to Secretary Stevens, which were you interested in, the work of the committee, or the girl getting along?

29:44.960 --> 29:50.960
Under this might seem humorous, but neither.

29:50.960 --> 29:56.960
I felt the bomb Stevens would make him a sight.

29:57.960 --> 30:10.960
If he were to assign Mr. Chann to temporary duty with the committee, after he were inducted, you'll find that's made very clear in that phone, monochrome call.

30:10.960 --> 30:15.960
I felt it would be bad for the committee, bad for the secretary.

30:15.960 --> 30:21.960
I just just thought that Mr. Chann would be the tone and they agreed with me.

30:21.960 --> 30:30.960
But you know the grade that it would be, would not be just a file that would affect the weekend factors for a soldier so he could see his girlfriend, right?

30:30.960 --> 30:35.960
I don't think he's done any of those weekend things in girlfriends.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.960
Every soldier has a personal or weekend bathroom.

30:39.960 --> 30:50.960
I think you'll find that there's time even on those weekends of the average, drafting and getting to work and take for example who you're in.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.960
You'll find that.
