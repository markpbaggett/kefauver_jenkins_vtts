WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
before the new Congress in the...

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
If you wouldn't, if you'd use your stopwood net,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
a special batch of foretold, you'd see a girlfriend,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
why do you have such famous and high-quote,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
for all you say?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Well, that's kind of, you know, you know,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
the best, the complete way to position

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
through Mark along with the faithful best.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
He should be a general working out of the world or...

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
You've heard me...

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
You know how high the discussion moves.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You've heard me talk to the secretary.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
You know that if someone took down everything we've said,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
and six months later, a report of that has...

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Something said, no, seriousness, if it wasn't.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Look, for example, I have reviewed

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
as that too, but maybe your campaign manager,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
obviously, you knew Ireland.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm not going to be your campaign manager.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
You don't want me to be your campaign manager.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
And things like that, the president just rudely later, I mean nothing.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Now that you ran the committee, not going to any of you.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I think I did.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
You know whether John, if he'd been curled from big loans,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
too many came back a weekend.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
I don't know anything about John's private life.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I know that he did a lot of work.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
I know that he's been a great writer.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I know that he did a lot of work on the committee report.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Did you take private time?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I think he did.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I think he did.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
We have more work on those weekends than the average individual

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
will do working all week long.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Before the next senator begins,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
please come in.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Mr. President, please.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
No, sir.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
You might be testing up a wonderful opportunity.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And the wealth of it is over there.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Have you already known for now?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
For do it, can you produce the card on Colonel Ringler?

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Yes, I told the Francis Men who's down the office.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
And she says that there is no file on Ringler.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
There's no file open on him.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And no card?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
No card, no file.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And no name of any kind?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Pardon?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
And no name?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
No, just only...

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I thought there was no file on Ringler.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
We only open a file where there's no information to justify it.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
What was this story we were told about his thinking that the committee activities were a witch hunt?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Where did that come from?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It came from a report that we received.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Who received them?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Mr. Cohn, we received them.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Now where he got us?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
If he does, it's...

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Ask him, please.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
No, don't tell him that I'm not going to tell you.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm asking you only to tell you.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
No, I don't.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Mr....

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, I will give you the last tell you before.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I am after time.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You'll get the name.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
No person will get the confidential information.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, do you think?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I don't think so.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I don't think so.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
You want to stand on that?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I'm not.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
You want to stand on...

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Are you willing to ask Mr. Cohn where he got this information about Cohn with Ringler?

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I think I'm working on Mr. Cohn as a fan of him.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
You don't have to make this clear, Mr. Cohn.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
If I ask you, I don't mind asking, but if I do,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I will not give you the name of any man who gave the Roy a confidential information.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Well, then you think that informer on Colonel Ringler's

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
was of the type whose name must be protected, is that right?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Well, let me talk to Roy from that.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Right, I wish you were.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I want us to badly make way for you.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Thank you.

04:10.000 --> 04:20.000
Mr. Rell, the information came from people in Mr. Ringler's name.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I would not make their name public at this time.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
One of them named John?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
I would not give you the name of the individual.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
Well, Mr. or Senator McCarthy, if you should make out a card on Colonel Ringler,

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
would you put on us that his decorations include the Legion of Maris there?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Mr. Rell, please.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Yes, sir Noah, if you make out a card, would you put it on?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Mr. Rell, please.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Yes, sir Noah.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Mr. Rell, please.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.400
Mr. Rivera's got the card.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.400
You put it on.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.000
Mr. Ross, you�커 is brought with us here, and you know we go there at night.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Mr. Ross, they are on the drum nation.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I happened to see their sign.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Thanks for coming.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.780
Do you want us round to return it to the

05:15.780 --> 05:17.040
frenty, Mr. Ross, too?

05:17.040 --> 05:19.040
Yeah, Mr. Ross.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.040
I have answered that question, did you had that to answer that question?

05:22.040 --> 05:24.040
I have correct idea.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.040
I have to say yes.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.040
Mr. Ross, are you ready?

05:28.040 --> 05:29.860
Will you tell me, isn't that the

05:29.860 --> 05:35.040
Ross, or is this committee conducting with them?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.040
No, can I answer?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
Sir?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
No, can I answer?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
You're not going to answer?

05:40.040 --> 05:42.040
I've been telling me I answered.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.040
Yes.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.040
I'll put it to you again.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.040
Isn't this the Ross, or is it information?

05:47.040 --> 05:52.040
If a man wearing the United States uniform with a rank of colonel says that this committee

05:52.040 --> 05:55.040
is conducting with them?

05:55.040 --> 06:00.040
I'm sure, well, actually, the Texas made a name, the Texas made a name, the Texas was

06:00.040 --> 06:01.040
the very best committee.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.040
It's on nothing of a derogatory nature.

06:03.040 --> 06:08.040
We were impressed with the fact that Mr. Ringler apparently was a good soldier.

06:08.040 --> 06:12.040
It's on nothing in his record to him to get otherwise.

06:12.040 --> 06:16.040
For that reason, we did not open any file on him.

06:16.040 --> 06:24.440
We felt the plotter was dead and dropped until your witness was a new brought his

06:24.440 --> 06:25.440
name back down to the picture.

06:25.440 --> 06:34.440
The plotter, I'm in front of the report which we heard about his thing, until the witch

06:34.440 --> 06:37.440
hunt, have him drop.

06:37.440 --> 06:46.440
His other record indicates that there's nothing about him which is indicated by the George

06:46.440 --> 06:47.440
Communism.

06:47.440 --> 06:52.440
Well, then, would you like now to set the record straight there and die with bow to your

06:52.440 --> 06:55.440
hero, the man who has nothing to do with dying a tooth?

06:55.440 --> 06:56.440
Your the man can help.

06:56.440 --> 07:02.440
Would you like to set the record straight and respect the colonel Ringler and say there's

07:02.440 --> 07:06.440
nothing against him, nothing at all?

07:06.440 --> 07:15.440
Mr. Wilson, I can tell you that we have no information about any derogatory nature against

07:15.440 --> 07:16.440
him.

07:16.440 --> 07:22.440
For that reason, we didn't even bother to open a file on him.

07:22.440 --> 07:26.440
There are two capable of a simple, affirmative kind.

07:26.440 --> 07:33.440
This can't just say a kind word now about Turtle Ringler.

07:33.440 --> 07:38.440
Now, Mr. Wilson, you go ahead and find out what he's going to do.

07:38.440 --> 07:45.440
Now, Mr. Wilson, you go ahead and find out what he's going to act if you like.

07:45.440 --> 07:55.440
I have told you about time that we have no information about the derogatory nature of

07:55.440 --> 08:02.440
us, Mr. Ringler, that after a name tacked, we were convinced that he's a good soldier.

08:02.440 --> 08:09.440
We've got no information other than that.

08:09.440 --> 08:16.440
Well, that's all I can give you if you want to speak to us for another 10 minutes or

08:16.440 --> 08:17.440
a year.

08:17.440 --> 08:24.440
Would you mind if I stayed it for the record in my smaller than yours, his other decorations?

08:24.440 --> 08:28.440
Do I mind if I stay for the record, his other decorations?

08:28.440 --> 08:31.440
Mr. Wilson, I don't care what you do.

08:31.440 --> 08:38.440
His other decorations include the old fleet, Puckstress and the Legion of Barrett, the

08:38.440 --> 08:45.440
Bronze Fire Medal, the two old fleet, Puckstress and the Bronze Fire Medal, and the combat

08:45.440 --> 08:49.440
infantrymen badge.

08:49.440 --> 08:57.440
Senator, you have interested me and I am not criticizing you for it.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.440
I'm not thinking.

08:58.440 --> 09:04.440
But you have interested me in the fact that there is actually no FBI checks on your

09:04.440 --> 09:05.440
staff.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.440
I'm the censor.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.440
I do not blame you for that.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.440
You understand that?

09:09.440 --> 09:10.440
Don't you send it?

09:10.440 --> 09:11.440
What are your questions?

09:11.440 --> 09:20.440
My question is, do you understand I do not blame you for having no FBI checks on your staff?

09:20.440 --> 09:24.440
Well, you can hardly, because I've asked for such a fact in the Attorney General's

09:24.440 --> 09:26.440
but at this moment he cannot give it.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.440
That's right.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.440
I think that's unfortunate and you do too.

09:30.440 --> 09:35.440
Yes, I think it would be a good thing if we could work together to receive you whereby

09:35.440 --> 09:41.440
we would have a full deal of investigation of all investigators on the staff.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.440
I hope that can be worked out some time with you.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.440
How big is the staff?

09:45.440 --> 09:52.440
We've got, I love to get the exact number.

09:52.440 --> 10:05.440
Full of 25 and putting the minority council.

10:05.440 --> 10:15.440
Now, is there anything done about their clearance except to make the case name exactly

10:15.440 --> 10:16.440
at this time?

10:16.440 --> 10:24.440
Well, before I hire anyone I try to get a complete picture of his background and then we get

10:24.440 --> 10:27.440
the last thing after the I name check.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.440
We had hoped to get a full deal of investigation.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.440
But I'm unable to do that.

10:33.440 --> 10:40.440
I realize, don't you see that there are people that you have described have the custody of

10:40.440 --> 10:44.440
the FBI, copies of FBI documents, my confidential.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.440
I don't know.

10:46.440 --> 10:51.440
Well, didn't we have a new room, something called a two-and-a-quarter paid document that had

10:51.440 --> 10:54.440
the top of a confidential?

10:54.440 --> 10:56.440
That was a...

10:56.440 --> 10:59.440
My question is that we have such a document in this room.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.440
We've got a new room.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.440
We looked into my answer, yes.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.440
And I'd be happy if you would also listen to my question.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.440
I heard your question.

11:09.440 --> 11:20.440
We had a two-and-a-half paid document that contained the information excerpts from a 15-page

11:20.440 --> 11:27.440
document which according to my best judgment contained no security information.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.440
There had been deleted from that.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.440
The name was of all informants as I recall.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.440
There's nothing in it that's shown, you can get a technique.

11:37.440 --> 11:45.440
That document showed, principally, that the FBI was sending reports to Army intelligence,

11:45.440 --> 11:49.440
indicating to anyone who could add two and two.

11:49.440 --> 11:54.440
That there was an extremely dangerous situation at Fort Monmouth.

11:54.440 --> 11:59.440
And that was only a one of the series of documents that you're well.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.440
Now, that's the final time concern.

12:02.440 --> 12:07.440
That document could be spread on the front pages of every paper in the country.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.440
And would you know damage whatsoever?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.440
I think it's doing a lot of good.

12:13.440 --> 12:21.440
I think it would give one small picture of the efficiency of our FBI

12:22.440 --> 12:29.440
and how they do try to alert the various departments when they find

12:29.440 --> 12:34.440
potential sabotages in our organization.

12:34.440 --> 12:46.440
I'd like to revert now to the McCarthy to align the questioning we were pursuing before

12:47.440 --> 12:50.440
the 10 minutes before the last one which I had.

12:50.440 --> 12:57.440
If we devote a time earlier to the status of the record on name checks and field investigations by the FBI.

12:57.440 --> 13:02.440
I was asking you about the Bureau of Cooperation, which had insisted for a while

13:02.440 --> 13:09.440
halfway between you and your associates and the members of the Army and the citizens

13:09.440 --> 13:12.440
of the Fort Monmouth situation.

13:12.440 --> 13:17.440
I refer to the death life in case of the General Services Administration under the

13:17.440 --> 13:22.440
previous chairman, the late Senator Hui, where we worked out a splendid cooperative arrangement

13:22.440 --> 13:24.440
and a successful investigation.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.440
And you brought up the one of the government's training office.

13:27.440 --> 13:37.440
I asked you then to pinpoint the incident or incident by which this formula of cooperation began to fall apart.

13:37.440 --> 13:44.440
By recall your earlier testimony, you said it was largely to the participants, the first, the

13:44.440 --> 13:50.440
progress situation, which we're not going to go into investigation except you have pointed

13:50.440 --> 13:56.440
out that your inability to get the information you desired concerning who is responsible for the

13:56.440 --> 14:01.440
progress promotion and the alleged preferential treatment for progress was one of the incidents

14:01.440 --> 14:03.440
that were in the process.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.440
We now have that information.

14:06.440 --> 14:12.440
We think we have it in the field envelope that Council Jenkins put under his pillow by night

14:12.440 --> 14:17.440
and fastened in the pocket with a face he'd been by day and is still under the charge of this committee

14:17.440 --> 14:23.440
to protect until we can have an executive committee meeting to determine what this position to make.

14:23.440 --> 14:29.440
Now the other incident I think you said was the fact that when you just entered the area

14:29.440 --> 14:36.440
how who is responsible for the failure directed for the man must be wanted to get the loyalty for

14:36.440 --> 14:42.440
members to testify and if you're inability to get them developed with serious irritations

14:42.440 --> 14:47.440
which helps to break up the era of cooperation, that's correct.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.440
So we have those two specific items, are there other items?

14:50.440 --> 14:57.440
No, I think those two are the principal items we get.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.440
I think those two are the principal items.

15:00.440 --> 15:07.440
Telling from the past to the distant end is there any reason that you can think of why your committee

15:07.440 --> 15:14.440
might not be able to resume a formula of cooperation including whatever investigation needs to be made

15:14.440 --> 15:22.440
for the man must or any other investigation involving allegations of commonings and invitations

15:22.440 --> 15:24.440
into the art?

15:24.440 --> 15:31.440
Mr. Chairman, I invited we can find a formula for meeting the difficulties growing out of the

15:31.440 --> 15:34.440
loyal importance that you have.

15:34.440 --> 15:39.440
Mr. Chairman must defend entirely upon the executive branch.

15:39.440 --> 15:43.440
I think the position that the American people are entitled to all the information,

15:43.440 --> 15:49.440
the information was still not from any way in danger of the natural security.

15:49.440 --> 15:58.440
I think if the investigators or the executive branch will agree with that for no difficulty at all.

15:58.440 --> 16:02.440
However, Mr. Chairman, I am not encouraged.

16:02.440 --> 16:07.440
I am afraid, I think 30 seconds will show you what is in developing.

16:07.440 --> 16:16.440
I have for example a directive that goes beyond the presidential directive.

16:16.440 --> 16:21.440
I assume this is the sort of information which I should not get also.

16:21.440 --> 16:31.440
This effective date, March 26, 1954, this provides how you can keep things that,

16:31.440 --> 16:39.440
with here on the FOA, let's be foreign aid programs, even if it does not come with

16:39.440 --> 16:43.440
them the presidential secrecy order.

16:43.440 --> 16:48.440
They talk about it, it's about its protective device.

16:48.440 --> 17:00.440
The protective device is that where the department feels that they cannot say something secret confidential.

17:01.440 --> 17:07.440
I'll take this under the presidential order and keep it from the public that they have a new device.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.440
This is no presidential order you understand.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.440
I assume the president knows nothing about this.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.440
The new stamp now is official use only.

17:17.440 --> 17:24.440
And here are some of the material that will be stamped for official use only in the first kept in the Congress.

17:24.440 --> 17:31.440
The May-Divide One paragraph from this is determined information pertaining to administrative,

17:31.440 --> 17:40.440
organizations, personnel, fiscal or operating policies.

17:40.440 --> 17:51.440
Policies, procedures and plans for a temporary protection prior to firm establishment is in the public interest.

17:52.440 --> 17:58.440
In other words, you find now instead of heading toward more cooperation with the committee.

17:58.440 --> 18:10.440
And I strongly, at the hands of my Democrats, this is especially because I think this is not a party of a matter of Republican or Democrat policy.

18:10.440 --> 18:18.440
You have here an agent base in a practice frame that anything having to do with fiscal policies,

18:19.440 --> 18:30.440
that means money policy, operating policy, proceeding, etc. before it becomes a firm policy, will be stamped for official use only.

18:30.440 --> 18:41.440
Mr. Chairman, this is the most dangerous trend, I can say this is an indication of the most dangerous trend.

18:41.440 --> 18:52.440
If this continues, why it will mean that the Congress will operate completely in the dark for many ideas of what's going on.

18:52.440 --> 19:04.440
I am a member of your trust and we can work out, we should work out a program whereby congressional committees can get information,

19:05.440 --> 19:13.440
but you know a number one, in dangerous national security, number two, which does not give the names of informants,

19:13.440 --> 19:21.440
or investigative agencies, number three, which does not disclose investigative techniques.

19:21.440 --> 19:28.440
Other than that, the American people should know exactly what's going on, if they don't, if they don't,

19:29.440 --> 19:35.440
Mr. Chairman, this Republic might not have had too long to live.

19:35.440 --> 19:40.440
There are no signs of every number one, that's documents you have just read, no way, it involves the Army.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.440
There's a no way involved, Mr. Chairman.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.440
It is not a White House directly.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.440
It is not a White House directly, I really remind you of that.

19:48.440 --> 19:52.440
I really mention this to show you the trend for secrecy, Mr. Chairman.

19:53.440 --> 20:02.440
We are also investigating that, but this is because we have an investigating, Maverick is doing the FOI.

20:02.440 --> 20:11.440
I'd like to point out to the President of the Wisconsin that one fellow doesn't make a summer and one document is not necessarily a doubt we can't.

20:11.440 --> 20:19.440
Furthermore, the President of the Wisconsin, the President of the Arkansas, Mr. McClellan, the President of the Illinois, and the Berkston,

20:20.440 --> 20:23.440
the Chairman of this Committee are all members of the Appropriations Committee.

20:23.440 --> 20:29.440
I'm sure we would speak as one voice in insisting that there be no validity whatsoever,

20:29.440 --> 20:33.440
so the kind of documents that you now have because in our Appropriations Committee,

20:33.440 --> 20:40.440
certainly we have to have access to the financial facts, because we're passing on FOI or any similar program.

20:41.440 --> 20:47.440
I would like to, without saying I'm due, I would like to point out to Chairman,

20:47.440 --> 20:54.440
that this is the sort of information which I have in the reclassing that butter and boilies give us.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.440
This is the President's information.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.440
I'm sure in prior, that does not deal with classified information.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.440
I'm sure I understand that that is simply just the deduels of the...

21:02.440 --> 21:09.440
Information of public business, which the public has much right to have as the bureaucrats running that particular division of the government.

21:09.440 --> 21:12.440
You know, the facts except they are giving in a new classification now.

21:12.440 --> 21:16.440
But it is not classified as security information, certainly,

21:16.440 --> 21:18.440
but it's being done with the public must.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.440
Absolutely, but it is a device to keep it from the Congress.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.440
I think the device will fail.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.440
I hope so.

21:24.440 --> 21:30.440
I made a chair chair into something else now dealing with these Fort Monmouths, practically.

21:30.440 --> 21:37.440
Did it at any time you indicate to Mr. John Adams, or to anybody else in the Army,

21:37.440 --> 21:43.440
that you had in mind issuing some custody, which they could prepare,

21:43.440 --> 21:48.440
for you to make available to the press after your survey of the installation of Fort Monmouths?

21:48.440 --> 21:56.440
No, but I told Mr. John that being done could work out a press release.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.440
But it would be acceptable, I would issue it.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.440
I didn't accept any custody.

22:02.440 --> 22:07.440
This was not necessarily an idea in germinating in the mind of Mr. John Adams.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.440
It's all just a germinated look out of the mind.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.440
He conveyed it with the tone with the tone and the letter to me.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.440
I told him I would not issue the type of press release they had,

22:16.440 --> 22:23.440
but if they could issue a press release, pressing up the savings and praising up that amount.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.440
It is, we can take this step by which we got to this facility.

22:26.440 --> 22:30.440
The first idea then you tell us, is germinating in the mind of John Adams.

22:30.440 --> 22:34.440
He thought that a press release might be issued at Fort Monmouth,

22:34.440 --> 22:39.440
indicating a happy relationship to just be in between the committee and the Army.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.440
Is that correct?

22:40.440 --> 22:42.440
The idea came from Monmouth.

22:42.440 --> 22:46.440
Nothing essentially wrong with that idea.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.440
You know, for example, if you didn't like throwing something up,

22:49.440 --> 22:51.440
the idea was not necessarily that.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.440
The idea of a press release, something wrong about it.

22:54.440 --> 22:59.440
Senator Walker is aiding the time people by pounding the rickwicks

22:59.440 --> 23:01.440
and the back to get it my time is up.

23:01.440 --> 23:05.440
So it's up and we recognize the next benefit is that it is germinated.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.440
It's germinated. I wonder if any time we hear a question.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.440
Nothing wrong with the idea of the press release.

23:10.440 --> 23:16.440
I am really objective to the idea of indicating we saw all of the contents hearing him.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.440
That is correct.

23:17.440 --> 23:21.440
On this germ, I wonder if copies have been made now.

23:21.440 --> 23:26.440
The full-call shine plan outline which Senator McCarthy gave me.

23:26.440 --> 23:32.440
As an example of the background and study that he had made that is Mr. Shine

23:32.440 --> 23:34.440
in the field of psychological warfare.

23:34.440 --> 23:39.440
I wonder if we could have time of Senator McCarthy to look at the document.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.440
He has tried to write an example.

23:41.440 --> 23:46.440
I would deliver it to you.

23:46.440 --> 23:49.440
I don't want it all to my time.

23:49.440 --> 23:55.440
I am out. Mr. Chairman, we will get ten minutes before we discern

23:55.440 --> 23:58.440
if you want to take that ten minute reading the document.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.440
I will do it.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.440
I don't think it takes that long to end it.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.440
Senator Jackson's termed question.

24:16.440 --> 24:21.440
Senator McCarthy and he is after Senator.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.440
Here is another question.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.440
Hurry.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.440
Yes.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.440
Oh, Mr. Welfth.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.440
Mr. Welfth.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.440
Oh, pardon me.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.440
I was warning that there were seven different copies.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.440
Several copies of this.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.440
I had this time.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.440
Because if you find that one, that's all I'm sorry.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.440
That's what you should.

24:39.440 --> 24:44.440
And that's sure that the two valuable documents.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.440
Thank you.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.440
Thank you.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.440
Thank you.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.440
Thank you.

24:53.440 --> 24:58.440
In the last round of questioning, Senator Jackson started the question.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.440
Senator McCarthy on the content of this pamphlet which, uh,

25:01.440 --> 25:03.440
derived with you, David Chine, wrote for us.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.440
The other committee members too.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.440
Senator McCarthy said it did not.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.440
Now, I'm about to be manned.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.440
That's not the rest of it.

25:13.440 --> 25:20.440
Senator McCarthy said it did not wait to be questioned in the content of this document.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.440
Until he had a copy of it, and the Jackson said very well and sent it.

25:23.440 --> 25:28.440
Bruce Young was out of the committee room to make a copy of this document.

25:28.440 --> 25:34.440
And the broad effect into the committee room prior to the term which Senator Jackson now has the question.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.440
Senator McCarthy.

25:35.440 --> 25:39.440
Now, copy to this being passed around the committee table.

25:39.440 --> 25:45.440
This is the document which Mr. Chine wrote prior to his going with the McCarthy committee.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.440
Yeah.

25:46.440 --> 25:47.440
Go.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.440
Now, we'll get to that.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.440
Okay.

26:01.440 --> 26:05.440
Senator McCarthy is now reading the document again as Mr. Well.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.440
I think that went so personally, you know, to direct this.

26:09.440 --> 26:13.440
I'm back in Sunday's actions to go in and to make sure that it will be difficult.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.440
If it's happy, he did just to get an identifier.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.440
And I think he'd be finding a reason to get it.

26:17.440 --> 26:22.440
Well, Senator, you know, I just not, uh, introduce this document in evidence.

26:22.440 --> 26:23.440
No.

26:23.440 --> 26:27.440
This is the first time I had a chance to see it was introduced by you.

26:27.440 --> 26:33.440
As an example of the study that Mr. Chine had made in the field of psychoanalysis.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.440
I've not introduced them.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.440
I mentioned it yet.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.440
Well, I think it ought to be introduced to never.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.440
And I mentioned it yet.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.440
It's a little bit of a silly take apart from you asked for it.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.440
And I think you're entitled to it.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.440
Now, you'll know the subject's strategy.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.440
This, uh, opposite top, rather, the Chine Plan I first mentioned.

26:47.440 --> 26:52.440
This was a plan of long-range strategy for immediate execution.

26:52.440 --> 26:56.440
Then, the, uh, you're finally reading something different from mine.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.440
The first one?

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
Mine says, right, fair, was fair.

26:59.440 --> 27:02.440
Now, no, all the Chine Plan outline, the first sentence in the document.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.440
Oh, I beg your pardon.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.440
This is the plan of long-range strategy for immediate execution.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.440
Then he goes down under strategy.

27:09.440 --> 27:16.440
He says that the draft's roots approach is basic.

27:16.440 --> 27:23.440
We must create a dimmin form, or a Association of Democratic Parties on the basis of mutual cooperation,

27:23.440 --> 27:29.440
free of the charge of American imperialism, democracy must be full globally.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.440
Now, isn't that worth dimmin form pretty close to common form?

27:32.440 --> 27:36.440
I'm some of these people around and we're going to get mixed up.

27:36.440 --> 27:40.440
Uh, here, here, here.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.440
I just asked the question.

27:42.440 --> 27:45.440
Isn't dimmin form pretty close to common forms?

27:45.440 --> 27:48.440
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this İgid.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.440
There's nothing to it, even the mostly approach to communist, unless we do the whole thing.

27:51.440 --> 27:54.440
Well, I, I just, let's, difficult to bear, Mr. Jackson.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.440
I just asked the question, let's, let's, let's read the answer.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.440
Let's not take it out of the context.

28:00.440 --> 28:04.440
He says, he says, on his strategy, you picked out part of it.

28:04.440 --> 28:09.440
And I have no objective to what you picked out except he says, fight fireless fire.

28:09.440 --> 28:16.440
That is an inspire native leaders everywhere to express democracy in every field of social action

28:16.440 --> 28:22.440
and develop democratic groups and parties as soon as I've been trying to lead democratic parties.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.440
I'm going to have to look at it.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.440
You remember, Senator, at that point, you remember, Senator,

28:26.440 --> 28:31.440
when we had the voice hearings, we expressed our recollection now that Mr. Shine

28:31.440 --> 28:36.440
and the point was made, I think, by a number that the communist used the word democracy freely

28:36.440 --> 28:42.440
and some of the people in the voice program were condemned for using the word democracy.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.440
I don't see any who do this, who condemned you to do this.

28:45.440 --> 28:50.440
No, but isn't it true that the communist have used the word democracy to exploit it for their own use?

28:50.440 --> 28:51.440
Right?

28:51.440 --> 28:54.440
You're like, good man, you run for office, I'm going to leave that slave.

28:54.440 --> 29:01.440
Now, Senator, I'm just, you remember very well in the hearings and connection with the activities of the last American death.

29:01.440 --> 29:06.440
That's quite a point was made of the use of the word democratic and democracy by the common.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.440
Isn't that true?

29:07.440 --> 29:10.440
I mean, the records will bear that out.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.440
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.440
All right, let's go on, too.

29:14.440 --> 29:23.440
Now, down on sexy, he has used all instruments and concepts and enlighten and form the spirit of men.

29:24.440 --> 29:27.440
Now, he's got a list of various items.

29:27.440 --> 29:30.440
He's got religious suits all-famous.

29:30.440 --> 29:35.440
Many have, B, he has higher clerks, he has four letters.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.440
He's got to infiltrate the clerks.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.440
What, even him?

29:38.440 --> 29:39.440
I don't know.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.440
I mean, this is actually a month ago.

29:41.440 --> 29:46.440
This is a judgment, you know, you know, he's talking here about pricing communism.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.440
He says, use all religious groups to fight communism.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.440
All right.

29:50.440 --> 29:57.440
You and I could agree that they religious groups are besties strong, this is fighting communism.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.440
We don't dispute about that.

29:58.440 --> 30:03.440
Now, look at the separation of churches in Spain to be forced or against it.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.440
What is that?

30:05.440 --> 30:11.440
This is a document that already puts the plan into action.

30:11.440 --> 30:18.440
Now, in Europe, one part of the church, a Lutheran church leaves in church and state.

30:18.440 --> 30:23.440
So, does the Catholic church in Europe be forced or is it going in there and up to it?

30:23.440 --> 30:24.440
I don't know.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.440
These are the questions.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.440
Yes.

30:27.440 --> 30:30.440
This is a document that's all set to go.

30:30.440 --> 30:31.440
This is the plan.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.440
I've found a figure that's out.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.440
This is the first plan I have seen.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.440
This is what indicates that he is forced.
