00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
Through the mail on the afternoon of July 9th, the first copy came by writing page from the

00:09.440 --> 00:10.440
Senate.

00:10.440 --> 00:17.080
Did anyone from the McCarthy Committee contact you on the following day?

00:17.080 --> 00:22.400
That is, July 9th, 53.

00:22.400 --> 00:28.640
I believe that the only contact it was made at that time was made by me directly, let

00:28.640 --> 00:31.240
the McCarthy Committee myself.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.240
Are you initiated by contact?

00:33.240 --> 00:34.240
Yes, sir.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.240
Do you need it, you talk?

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
Talk to Mr. Collins.

00:36.240 --> 00:43.440
Talk to everything was said by Mr. Collins on the occasion with reference to change.

00:43.440 --> 00:49.520
In order to clarify my conversation, I believe I should give for the record the actions

00:49.520 --> 00:52.520
that I took that morning.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.720
In order to explain my conversation with Mr. Collins.

00:55.720 --> 00:56.720
We will do so, General.

00:56.720 --> 00:57.720
Yes, sir.

00:57.720 --> 01:04.720
Upon my return to the Pentagon on the evening of July 8th, it was late and it was too late

01:04.720 --> 01:07.720
for me to take in action on this case.

01:07.720 --> 01:14.220
The next morning, after the receipt of the biographical data, I then called the acting

01:14.220 --> 01:18.080
chief of transportation, but here's General Paul Young.

01:18.080 --> 01:23.720
I asked him without giving him any names of the people involved in this case, whether

01:23.720 --> 01:30.720
or not an individual who had served for a year or approximately a year as a ship doctor,

01:30.720 --> 01:37.920
junior ship doctor, and the Army Transport Service in 1946 and 1947, and who was otherwise

01:37.920 --> 01:43.720
physically and mentally qualified for a commission, whether or not an individual with those

01:43.720 --> 01:50.720
particularly qualifications, but could be given a direct commission and the officer's

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
request.

01:51.720 --> 01:57.720
Now and now, after looking into that matter, I called me back and informed me that it

01:57.720 --> 02:02.700
appeared that an individual with those qualifications could properly be commissioned and the

02:02.700 --> 02:07.720
result of the transportation could properly be, yes, very well.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.720
What the unit received?

02:08.720 --> 02:14.720
My next step then, because, very frankly, because I considered it my duty because the importance

02:14.720 --> 02:22.720
of this particular case was for me to consult with General John E. Paul, who was then

02:22.720 --> 02:25.720
Vice Chief of Staff of the Department of the Army.

02:25.720 --> 02:31.720
On that particular day, I believe that General Watten College, who was Chief of Staff,

02:31.720 --> 02:32.720
was absent from watching.

02:32.720 --> 02:39.720
So I felt it my duty to report to General Paul, this specific case, to make my recommendations

02:39.720 --> 02:46.720
to General Paul, and to receive this approval or this approval of those recommendations.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.720
Paul, thank you double-edged.

02:49.720 --> 02:59.720
I reported personally to General Paul the essence of my conversation with Senator McCarthy

02:59.720 --> 03:01.720
and Mr. Cohen on the preceding day.

03:02.720 --> 03:08.720
I also reported to him that I had discussed the matter that morning with General Yao without

03:08.720 --> 03:15.720
mentioning any names, and a general Yao did a so-and-mute apparently an individual with

03:15.720 --> 03:19.720
those qualifications, quite the received information.

03:19.720 --> 03:25.720
I then recommended to General Paul that I processed the case in accordance with the then current

03:25.720 --> 03:26.720
Army regulations.

03:27.720 --> 03:33.720
General Paul gave me a specific instructions that the case was to be processed in time in accordance

03:33.720 --> 03:36.720
with the then current Army regulations.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.720
I also asked General Paul because of the importance of the case, is whether or not he desired

03:41.720 --> 03:44.720
me to inform the Secretary of the Army of this case.

03:44.720 --> 03:50.720
General Paul informed me that he desired me to show informed secretary, and I did that.

03:50.720 --> 03:55.720
I do not believe I did it on that actual day, because I believe Mr. Stevens was also out of town

03:55.720 --> 03:56.720
to take a day.

03:56.720 --> 04:06.720
After these conversations, I then called Mr. Cohen and requested that Mr. Stein be sent

04:06.720 --> 04:13.720
over to the Pentagon building as soon as possible so that we could begin processing him for

04:13.720 --> 04:15.720
a possible commission.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.720
Was that done?

04:17.720 --> 04:18.720
Yes, sir it was.

04:19.720 --> 04:25.720
Do you have any personal knowledge of what occurred when Mr. Stein appeared for the purposes

04:25.720 --> 04:26.720
of the process?

04:26.720 --> 04:29.720
Yes, we relate that please.

04:29.720 --> 04:38.720
From a consultation of all available records in the department, and to my own personal recollection

04:38.720 --> 04:45.720
of the case, on afternoon of Wednesday 15 July, what was the process?

04:45.720 --> 04:52.720
I was told to my one of the members of my staff, the first me that he had received a telephone

04:52.720 --> 04:55.720
call from Mr. Stein.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.720
I believe he's the record straight I should insert.

04:59.720 --> 05:04.720
The prior to that time, I'm sure they had my conversation with Mr. John.

05:04.720 --> 05:11.720
Young and General Paul, I have informed three members of my personal staff of this request

05:11.720 --> 05:18.720
recommendation in order that they might be able to act, and then to prevent that I did not

05:18.720 --> 05:21.720
happen to be in the office when Mr. Stein came in.

05:21.720 --> 05:29.720
Those members were kind of well-seated things, whereas then my deputy, Colonel John P. Mayer,

05:29.720 --> 05:35.720
who was then the executive officer of the office of legislative liaison, and also Lieutenant

05:35.720 --> 05:39.720
Colonel F. J. Brammerman, who was the assistant executive officer.

05:39.720 --> 05:48.720
Now, to return to the July 15, on afternoon of July 15, Colonel Brammerman reported me that

05:48.720 --> 05:54.720
he had received a call from Mr. Stein, who stated, you know, fact that he desired to come over

05:54.720 --> 05:59.720
to the Pentagon not afternoon and hold up his chance.

05:59.720 --> 06:06.720
I am stuck at Compton when Mr. Stein is what's the significance of the statement, hold up his hand.

06:06.720 --> 06:10.720
The mayor has had no evidence of the statement was to get the hold up his hand meant to be sworn

06:10.720 --> 06:14.720
in as a result of all of that afternoon.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.720
There it is.

06:18.720 --> 06:22.720
You guys have been away from the Pentagon, Brutus.

06:22.720 --> 06:26.720
As soon as he was very quick, I continue to trust him, saying, and they trust him, the

06:26.720 --> 06:29.720
Christmas you know, so they're not.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.720
We will allow him to say, he's an element.

06:32.720 --> 06:38.720
I think that obviously the chair must be lenient to a certain extent, a lot of years later.

06:38.720 --> 06:42.720
And the other, I know they don't call it a quote, rude.

06:42.720 --> 06:48.720
On the other hand, this government's Iranian purpose is put in the right way, of course,

06:48.720 --> 06:54.720
where I believe the individual's purpose should be available, 60% of the world will be sworn.

06:54.720 --> 07:01.720
And I make that point because they generalize the figure of state, because they are the time.

07:01.720 --> 07:09.720
Reading the first statement, the minute officially under the 24-hour rule in which yesterday had that before,

07:09.720 --> 07:14.720
that statement included some testimony which was not correct.

07:14.720 --> 07:21.720
We decided to inform one among ourselves, and tentatively that in such circumstances,

07:21.720 --> 07:26.720
we would try to give as much reasonable out of food as we could so that each party to the dispute,

07:26.720 --> 07:31.720
and to present his case in his best light, provided the witnesses would give the available

07:31.720 --> 07:34.720
to give direct testimony, if they were to find.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
And that rule will hold it.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.720
The big mass sentence, the two of us, the two of us, the two of us, agreed that they were being taught

07:39.720 --> 07:45.720
about Mr. Jenkins to present their complete taste, and let's see, did at times, a lot of years later,

07:45.720 --> 07:50.720
testimony, but my roommate thought he was the first testimony of any importance that's in him,

07:50.720 --> 07:54.720
but then the witness feels available, depending on the individual.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.720
I won't be done, I'm not as.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.720
I think that's a good point.

07:58.720 --> 08:03.720
The very experienced attorney and counsel, the first reaction to Mr. Jenkins yesterday

08:03.720 --> 08:08.720
upon the meeting of the state, that we eliminate everything that was not direct testimony,

08:08.720 --> 08:13.720
and he said perhaps in the interest of illuminating the hearings and expediting them,

08:13.720 --> 08:17.720
we should give some out of it to provide the witnesses who are available.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.720
We're proceeding on that, but I think that's a good one.

08:19.720 --> 08:25.720
And if those witnesses are not available, Mr. Chairman, and if they are not produced as witnesses,

08:25.720 --> 08:28.720
certainly will not be dismissed upon their statements.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.720
Very good, Mr. President.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.720
Now, generally, we've received with your statement.

08:33.720 --> 08:40.720
I am still receiving this message from Donald Brown, and I am struck with Donald Feng and Donald Brown.

08:40.720 --> 08:46.720
So, Frances, Mr. Schein, that afternoon, is there any testimony that's in the picture?

08:46.720 --> 08:48.720
I'm sorry, Mr. Macdonald.

08:48.720 --> 08:59.720
A little question is, after receiving this telephone message from the time Donald Brown,

08:59.720 --> 09:07.720
and I instructed Donald Feng, Donald Brown, and to process Mr. Schein strictly important for the regulations,

09:07.720 --> 09:11.720
when he came over to the office that afternoon.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.720
I was informed that afternoon of Mr. Schein this time.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.720
I know that he was in office.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.720
I know that he started filling out his application for a commission,

09:21.720 --> 09:28.720
and I have seen the official record of the physical examination that he took that afternoon.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.720
There seemed to be considerable difficulty that afternoon.

09:32.720 --> 09:38.720
There was considerable difficulty that afternoon, getting Mr. Schein, fill out a full application.

09:38.720 --> 09:47.720
Donald Feng reported to me that Mr. Schein seemed to have a attitude of taste and impatience.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.720
I then personally spoke to Mr. Schein.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.720
Twenty-twenty-one of the sentences I'm sorry about.

09:53.720 --> 09:58.720
What I want to know about Donald Feng is going to be a witness to corroborate that statement.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.720
I do not know.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.720
I don't believe it.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.720
I don't believe Mr. Schein on the text.

10:04.720 --> 10:09.720
I personally would be popular unless Donald Feng is going to be at a back of up.

10:09.720 --> 10:14.720
And I will also ensure we have to screen the point of order unless the claim is made available to it.

10:14.720 --> 10:19.720
It would call for an opinion of this witness to what someone else told him.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.720
Thank you.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.720
He's far from it.

10:21.720 --> 10:27.720
Mr. Chairman, I am informed that Colonel Feng is in and happy and in the way available.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.720
You can be made available on the statement, Mr. Schein.

10:32.720 --> 10:39.720
I will save Dan Mitchell's voice from Colonel Feng, which I understand he will be asked to testify about later.

10:39.720 --> 10:47.720
I then personally saw Mr. Schein and explained to him the necessity for filling out.

10:47.720 --> 10:54.720
I have identified the records, the gentlemen, Mr. Ribbard's last but just told.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.720
Mr. Feng Claire is associated with Mr. Wilk.

10:59.720 --> 11:06.720
I also met Mr. Wilk and Mr. Sincer, who is a member of the council.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.720
The message is that Steven's out in the town.

11:10.720 --> 11:11.720
Perfect.

11:13.720 --> 11:24.720
I then saw Mr. Schein very quickly that afternoon and explained to him the necessity for going through the full process of apricot flying for a commission under a zone personal signature.

11:25.720 --> 11:30.720
And receiving an necessary physical examination and process.

11:30.720 --> 11:38.720
I then, the person of a mother appointment on Capitol Hill did not follow the case for the rest of the afternoon.

11:38.720 --> 11:45.720
When I returned to my office at approximately 530-426 that evening, Mr. Schein had left.

11:45.720 --> 11:51.720
He left with us an application that was not completely filled out.

11:52.720 --> 12:11.720
On the next day, Thursday, July 16th, it was necessary to get a hold of him, Mr. Schein, to have him fill in some of the data that was not complete in this particular necessary application for a commission.

12:12.720 --> 12:30.720
Further that day, as I recall to the best of my ability, it was also necessary for me to send the application over to the Capitol to Mr. Cohn to request him to send it to Mr. Schein for his final piece of information.

12:30.720 --> 12:43.720
That application was sent to Mr. Schein to Mr. Cohn and his return, either late that evening or the next morning, early, by Mr. Cohn's office to me.

12:43.720 --> 12:49.720
That brings us up to Friday, July 17th.

12:49.720 --> 12:57.720
On that day, the Edison General Army started processing Mr. Cohn's application for isolation.

12:58.720 --> 13:09.720
Because of his previous service in the New York Army Transwar service, it was first sent to the Transformation Corps of the Army.

13:10.720 --> 13:15.720
The application was found by the Transformation Corps of the Army.

13:15.720 --> 13:27.720
That Mr. Schein was not qualified under the then-content regulations for a direct commission in the reserve for the Transformation Corps,

13:27.720 --> 13:38.720
because this actual service in 1946 was not in what we would normally term with the capacity of a junior ship's officer,

13:38.720 --> 13:46.720
that is an officer having navigational responsibility for the ship that was more I can make position of a person.

13:47.720 --> 13:57.720
The commission was also thoroughly processed by the Office of the Program Module General because of Mr. Schein's investigative background.

13:57.720 --> 14:04.720
That's published found that he was not qualified under the then-content regulations.

14:04.720 --> 14:17.720
Likewise, because of his investigative background, I had an informal inquiry made in the Office of the Chief of Psychological Warfare.

14:17.720 --> 14:31.720
I was informed that he was not qualified for that because one of the three direct witnesses to the commission and the Office of Psychological Warfare is three years of plan I'll show you his frames, but Mr. Schein did not have.

14:32.720 --> 14:52.720
During this period and up until end of the month of July, I was told numerous calls from Mr. Cohen, urging speed in this case and urging a favorable result as shown as possible.

14:52.720 --> 14:58.720
How many telephone calls would you estimate you received, General?

14:59.720 --> 15:05.720
I could only make an estimate, Mr. Jenkins, because of course I did not keep a record of those telephone calls.

15:05.720 --> 15:10.720
But I would say that at times I received two and three telephone calls a day.

15:10.720 --> 15:22.720
There were other days, of course, on which I received either one or no telephone calls, but I would say consistently throughout that third, possibly an average of two telephone calls.

15:22.720 --> 15:38.720
When you state a game, what period that embraced an embrace that carried from approximately 17 July until the end of the month, approximately 30 or 31 July.

15:38.720 --> 15:46.720
In this connection, I also received two telephone calls directly from Mr. Cohen, on the same security.

15:47.720 --> 15:59.720
On from the third day, you received an image during that period, that is middle of July to the latter part of July, some two or three calls from the senator.

15:59.720 --> 16:05.720
Of the same General Tenor as I understood it, was I understood it.

16:05.720 --> 16:15.720
Those movements would call from you, or they would call from you, standard, purgary, and statutory, for space, and its sex.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.720
Go ahead.

16:20.720 --> 16:31.720
From the big Mahogany panel caucus room in the Senate office building in Washington, mutual has been bringing you special coverage of the congressional hearings in senator Joseph Arma Karthi's dispute with double army officials.

16:31.720 --> 16:40.720
The hearings are being conducted before the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations, with Senator Carly-Mod of South Dakota presiding as the temporary chairman.

16:40.720 --> 16:54.720
The only witness thus far has been Major General Miles Weber, former the Army Liaison, officer with Congress, who testified to the efforts of Senator McCarthy and Roy M. Cohen to obtain an Army commission for G. David Shye.

16:54.720 --> 17:01.720
Neutral your network for news will be back with more on the spot coverage of these hearings this afternoon over many of these stations.

17:01.720 --> 17:06.720
And at 10.30 tonight, Eastern Standard Time over many of these stations is special.

17:10.720 --> 17:20.720
During the entire processing of this case, at the same time, I notified Mr. Kohn of one additional process.

17:20.720 --> 17:39.720
At that time in July of 1953, the commanding generals of the six top-notch Army carriers in which the United States is alive had authority on their own to award direct commissions for specialists to fill existing vacancies in their own.

17:39.720 --> 18:08.720
I conferred with the technical people in the office of the I.C. and General about this possibility and on the 23rd of July when I was informed that the application for commission that had been processed by the department had been denied, I then started the machinery rolling to have Mr. Shye considered for a direct commission to fill a specific position.

18:08.720 --> 18:29.720
By the commanding general first Army, as Governor's Island New York, the President of New York State, the actual processing of that application was sent by the I.C. and General through to the commanding general first Army.

18:29.720 --> 18:53.720
My office kept in touch with this processing by telephone. During the between the period 23, 24 July and the end of the month, Mr. Shye's application was considered thoroughly by Board of Officers appointed specifically for that purpose by the commanding general first Army.

18:53.720 --> 19:13.720
That Board found that Mr. Shye was not qualified to fill any specialist vacancy that existed in the first Army at that time. I received that information as I recall it on either the 29th or 3th July. I'm not exactly sure of which date.

19:13.720 --> 19:39.720
I then telephoned that information to Mr. Cohn as soon as I received it. About that time either just before or just after I sent Mr. Cohn this information, I was asked by him by telephone to inquire as to the possibility of obtaining a commission for Mr. Shye in the department of the Air Force or the Department of the Navy.

19:40.720 --> 19:57.720
In response to that request, I telephoned first to make the general Robert E. L.E. for that time, but Director of Legislative Liaison of the Department of the Air Force. In my conversation with Joe Eaten, I did not use any names.

19:58.720 --> 20:06.720
I merely asked Joe Eaten. I stated in, of course, he knew that I was in the Legislative Liaison.

20:07.720 --> 20:16.720
But, and he knew that my request came from members of Congress. I did state to him that I had a specific request from the Senate.

20:16.720 --> 20:30.720
To determine whether or not an individual with the following qualifications could be given a direct commission in the Department of the Air Force, and I then outlined Mr. Shye in qualifications as they have been affronting specifically to the Department of the Army.

20:31.720 --> 20:39.720
Joe Eaten replied that at that time, the Department of the Air Force was not giving any direct reserved commission to any time.

20:40.720 --> 20:58.720
I then endeared to reach Admiral Iron None, who was then Judge Advocate's General of the Navy. I was not able to reach him, and I then talked to Commander James Carns, the Executive Officer of the Legislative Division Officer of the Judge Advocate's General of the Navy.

20:59.720 --> 21:08.720
Again, in my conversation with Commander Carns, I gave no names. I merely outlined the qualifications of the individuals.

21:08.720 --> 21:29.720
Commander Carns, after doing some checking, as I recall, it followed me back and stated that the Navy's requirements for direct commissions in the Navy reserved for at that time were substantially the same as those of the Army, and he emphasized the fact that one of the Navy's specific requirements was fire military service.

21:30.720 --> 21:35.720
I then informed Mr. Carns of the results of those two conversations.

21:36.720 --> 21:47.720
General, is that now the end of your connection with the so-called efforts at the mature preference of treatment for shame?

21:50.720 --> 21:54.720
There was one other episode in which I was...

21:56.720 --> 21:59.720
Yes, I was directly connected. Is it material to the issue?

21:59.720 --> 22:05.720
No, sir, I do not believe it. Let's stop there. Now, General, I want to make myself clear.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.720
I do not represent Mr. Adams, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Hensel.

22:12.720 --> 22:17.720
Nor do I represent the Senator and the members of his staff, but I represent this committee.

22:18.720 --> 22:28.720
And it now becomes my duty to, certainly to the extent that I've been covered, and another of the committee may determine the weight to be given your time.

22:29.720 --> 22:38.720
I'm a testimony of the cross-examining you. General, we very...

22:42.720 --> 22:56.720
You in your position with the Army received many telephone calls from many senators, congressmen, administrative officials and others,

22:57.720 --> 23:03.720
with reference to inductees, dressees or those about to become so, did you not?

23:04.720 --> 23:17.720
Yes, Mr. Jaggins, I did. And that has been a common practice. I would say since the time to which your memory run as not to the congee, isn't it?

23:17.720 --> 23:26.720
Yes, sir. So that these telephone calls and conversations from Senator McCarthy will discuss the him first.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.720
We're not unusual, Willie.

23:30.720 --> 23:38.720
No, sir, telephone calls from senators were not on me. Did you at any time feel that Senator McCarthy was high-pressuring you?

23:39.720 --> 23:45.720
No, sir. I can't say that I felt that he was high-pressuring me to a great extent.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.720
I'm sure that he wanted a favorable answer, I could tell.

23:49.720 --> 23:54.720
In you of the tremendously important work in which Senator McCarthy was then engaged, didn't you?

23:55.720 --> 24:00.720
I certainly did. And that was the investigation of communists and of the...

24:01.720 --> 24:09.720
The infiltration of communists in industries, in the air every bench of the government as well as in the army.

24:10.720 --> 24:21.720
That was my understanding. And generally you would regard that as work, then which there could possibly be no more important work insofar as the security of the nation is concerned.

24:22.720 --> 24:29.720
But you not? I certainly didn't get it. But it would have top billing and top priority over everything else. That's correct, didn't it?

24:30.720 --> 24:34.720
I have to be very frank, sir. I'm under oath. I can't say over everything now.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.720
It would be very, very, very hard.

24:37.720 --> 24:42.720
There's Indians ever on the part of an individual group of individuals.

24:42.720 --> 24:54.720
It's occurred to you as being more important and especially at this particular time than that of the tracking down and fading out of communists,

24:54.720 --> 25:00.720
communists, so those with communistic leanings, whether they be in the army, are anywhere else in this country.

25:01.720 --> 25:05.720
Certainly not to my knowledge. And that was the work that Senator McCarthy was doing, wasn't it?

25:06.720 --> 25:11.720
Yes, sir. And that was the work that he told you that G. David Shine was doing, wasn't it? That's correct.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.720
I am so in a value, ladies.

25:15.720 --> 25:29.720
As he is a telephone call and contacts from Senator McCarthy, to you, with respect to G. David Shine, one would have to, and I'm sure you they had taken the consideration.

25:30.720 --> 25:37.720
Not only the individual, but the character and the importance of the work in which he was then engaged. That's correct, isn't it?

25:37.720 --> 25:42.720
I certainly did. And you were told in you knew. Rather you were told.

25:43.720 --> 26:06.720
By both Senator McCarthy and Mr. Gold, that Shine was an expert trained investigator, with a background of experience, possessing a peculiar knowledge of what constituted a communist.

26:07.720 --> 26:13.720
And the means and best methods available of detecting a communist. They told you that, didn't they?

26:14.720 --> 26:31.720
Yes, sir, they did. Now, Senator, you have spoken of numerous calls from Senator McCarthy and numerous others from Mr. Gold, taking in the consideration.

26:32.720 --> 26:38.720
The value work in which they told you Shine was advised was engaged.

26:39.720 --> 27:00.720
I believe you say that you did not regard the efforts of Senator McCarthy as being him, proper, in any respect, in his efforts to get some, shall we say, preferential treatment for Shine so that he could,

27:01.720 --> 27:29.720
insisting, ganging on this investigative work of the senator, is that right? I believe Mr. Jenkins, I said that I did not consider that Senator McCarthy's telephone calls to me were out of the normal amount of, now I don't say normal, out of the experience that I had before, in cases of this kind.

27:29.720 --> 27:41.720
I don't believe I said anything. What about Mr. Cohn? I felt that Mr. Cohn was persistently after me, sir, that's the feeling that I had, ordering this performance.

27:42.720 --> 27:53.720
Did you feel that Mr. Cohn's efforts on behalf of this boy, engaged in this particular line of endeavor along with Mr. Cohn in the senator?

27:53.720 --> 28:22.720
Were you in proper? I felt this, Mr. Jenkins, I felt that in view of the position of the committee staff, that I was being put under definite pressure because I know that there is a specific proviso whereby an individual who is considered to be sufficiently involved in this.

28:23.720 --> 28:33.720
And it's important for the national safety health and interest that he should remain on his then current duty, that individual can be exempted from selective service.

28:34.720 --> 28:48.720
Do you know whether or not any application had been made by Shine with this selective service board to be exempt or deferred on the count of this vital work in which he was engaged? I do not.

28:49.720 --> 29:05.720
Now, General, you know the character of work being carried on at Port Monmouth, do you not? Do you know of it? I know of it, yes.

29:06.720 --> 29:13.720
Did you know that at that time, that is July 53 and perhaps before that time?

29:14.720 --> 29:29.720
The McCarthy Investigating Committee was laying the groundwork for an investigation of communist infiltration of Port Monmouth. I did not, July of 1933 now.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.720
You later learned that fact, did you not?

29:31.720 --> 29:53.720
And you later learned that as a result of the senator's efforts together with that of his staff, at least 33 civilian employees at Port Monmouth were either fad or suspended because of their communist leanings or background.

29:53.720 --> 30:07.720
That's too easy. I know that a number of, number of approximating 33 I believe Mr. Jenkins were suspended. I frankly do not know the details of the reasons for their suspension.

30:07.720 --> 30:16.720
Do you know that G David Shine participated in the investigation of Port Monmouth? It's my understanding that he did.

30:16.720 --> 30:37.720
Port Monmouth is the very site upon which the defenses against both the atomic and the hydrogen bombs are planned and laid. Is that correct? It is the signal core of the Army.

30:37.720 --> 30:49.720
It is the signal core of research and development activity, which is vital to the activities. And there is located the radar installation.

30:49.720 --> 30:58.720
And the study of electronic devices so that there certainly was...

30:58.720 --> 31:08.720
The report, the championship interpret the night until say yes or no or qualify a answer, but a shake of the head who are not in the head is hard for the reporter to be quite in here.

31:14.720 --> 31:25.720
So that it was vital to the interests and the safety and the security of the nation. That there are wall places, beans.

31:25.720 --> 31:37.720
No employee or no member of the Army at Port Monmouth, who was a doubtful security reason. That's correct. That certainly has Mr. Jenkins.

31:37.720 --> 32:06.720
And that is the character work that was carried on by the senator, the members of his staff including Shine and with the results that 33 questionable civilian employees were discharged after sending.

32:07.720 --> 32:16.720
That's correct. Of my own personal knowledge. That's no matter of general knowledge isn't a general revert.
