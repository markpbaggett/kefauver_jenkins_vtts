00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
They sent them across a subcommittee and investigated for months.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
As a matter of general knowledge, also, that various people were suspended.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Yes, that's for months. I don't believe it. As a matter of general knowledge,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
it's the reasons why those individuals were suspended.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Generally, if only one was suspended, you would not minimize the importance

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
and the result of that investigation. One would be one who many would not.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
One certainly, one, a, a, a, supposedly person would be far too much.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
I now turn the witness over to the chairman of the Public Library's examination.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you, Council Jenkins and I may I say that you have progressively and successfully asked most of the questions that I had in mind.

00:53.000 --> 01:02.000
I do have one or two. Did Mr. Carp at any time, General Weber, you just need with you in behalf of Mr. Shine.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Not with me personally. I mean with you personally. No, sir.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
If it was my fault, I believe I don't want to get into the hairspray field, but I believe that there's a possibility of a farce to my state.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
But to your personal knowledge, my personal knowledge, you do not call me.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
The calls in were always made by Mr. Cohn and Senator McFariff.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
That's correct. Do you know of your personal knowledge? The date that Mr. Shine was inducted into the Army.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
Not the exact date, Mr. Chairman. I know of my personal knowledge that he was inducted fairly in November of 1953.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Richard, it's not me. Call. You're mentioning any telephone calls after about the end of July.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
That is correct. I would not. I would not. I'm reason why the call starts at the end of July until the end of October.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Did you have a transfer when you still on the same position?

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
Between the end of July and the first of October, I remained as chief of legislative liaison.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I was actually assigned at the Office of Legislative Liaison during October.

02:17.000 --> 02:27.000
But the last call that you received from either Senator McFariff or Mr. Cohn, on the Shine matter was approximately the last part of July. That is correct.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
Just one final question I think in order to bring your testimony directly into the...

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
...perly of the hearings. Let me ask you the question first from the stand for Senator McFariff and then from the stand for Mr. Cohn.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I will not ask it from the stand for Mr. Cohn since he did not call you.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Did you consider any of the calls or conversations that you had with Senator McFariff?

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
To come under the heading of using improper means to induce or intimidate you to give Mr. Shine a commission?

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
No, sir. I was not intimidated or anything like that.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
Let me ask you the same question concerning Mr. Cohn that you consider any of his calls or conversations.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
It could be of a nature that comprises improper effort to induce or intimidate you to give Mr. Cohn a commission.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
None of Mr. Cohn's calls to me were a backslash.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
Under the rules of the committee, we're going to proceed with a maximum of 10 minutes without interruptions.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
What does the matter have to do with Mr. Cohn?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Are not the terms to call calls to me were a backslash?

03:40.000 --> 03:50.000
Under the rules of the subcommittee, each of the members of the committee and the council for the respectivized as a maximum of 10 minutes of questioning.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Mr. Carolyn Alphard and Senator McFariff.

03:54.000 --> 04:12.000
General Rebo, your first contact with Senator McFariff is on July 8th that his request that which time you came to his office and was there informed of what his purpose was and the conference was.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Yes, Senator.

04:14.000 --> 04:35.000
There was nothing unusual out of the ordinary in any respect that a senator might call you or call any of the representative of the Army or any of the branch of the service to ascertain if an applicant might receive a direct commission.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Nothing unusual, sir.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
In other words, that is frequently done.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yes, sir.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
And they are frequently granted where the applicant can qualify.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
That is correct.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Not so much so now as they were during World War II limits earlier.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
That is correct.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
They are quite limited in number now.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I believe is that correct?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Very limited. Direct commission to very limited.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Very limited.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
Senator McFariff will only have with you some two or three more contacts and that was by telephone.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Did he and your presence are at any time that you learned from him?

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
That he had directed our instructed Mr. Cohn to pursue this matter with you.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
During my first conversation with Senator McFariff and Mr. Cohn,

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
the senator requested me to keep Mr. Cohn fully posted on the progress of this case.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Then I interpreted that as being also instructions for Mr. Cohn to follow up with me.

05:41.000 --> 05:55.000
Now then that is what I wanted to try to determine whether Mr. Cohn in his contacts with you and in his telephone call was acting in his individual capacity as a friend.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
We will assume Mr. Shine or if he was acting as a member of the committee staff,

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
thus representing the committee or undertaking to represent the committee,

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
or was he acting as the personal representative of the chairman?

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
From your experience, from what occurred, please tell us how you so interpreted his contacts with you.

06:19.000 --> 06:29.000
I interpreted his contacts with me as being the result of that conversation which I've just described in the presence of the senator.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
In other words, that he was acting with the senators and structure.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
He was acting under the instructions of Senator McFariff.

06:39.000 --> 06:48.000
Did you understand that those instructions were to carry with it the force of the committee that the committee has such?

06:49.000 --> 06:59.000
Was seeking the appointment for that it was simply senator McFariffy seeking the appointment for one of his staff members?

06:59.000 --> 07:09.000
I felt that it was entirely a matter of Senator McFariffy and the committee did not enter specifically into the case this fall.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
I wanted to get this record clear and since the first contact was made with you,

07:14.000 --> 07:24.000
I wanted to get it in its proper perspective as to whether the committee was involved in seeking a direct commission from Mr. Shine,

07:24.000 --> 07:38.000
or if this whole proceedings was one instituted by the chairman of the committee as a senator and in his individual rights to seek a commission for a member of his staff.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Is that the way you interpreted it?

07:40.000 --> 07:49.000
I interpreted it as being a matter initiated by Senator McFariffy, so I know of no committee action as such.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
You didn't admit that any time getting any impression that the committee was seeking such action?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
No, sir. I cannot say that I didn't.

07:56.000 --> 08:05.000
Nothing was said to you by either Senator McFariffy or Mr. Cohn to indicate that the committee had an special interest in it or was initiating the action.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
No, Senator McFariff.

08:07.000 --> 08:18.000
Now, I am a semifacalman from their own as I understand you, you interpreted his actions and his contacts with you as carrying out the instructions of Senator McFariffy.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
Why did you interpret his actions as being out of his own personal interest?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
I interpreted his actions both ways.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
As being both, representing Senator McFariffy and of his own personal interest.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Yes, sir.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
Did you interpret it as being of his own personal interest because of the language and conversations that he had with you about it?

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
No, sir. Not because of the language, but because of the frequency.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
Because of the frequency, was there anything unusual about the frequency with which you was contacted that is out of the ordinary in cases of this character?

08:55.000 --> 09:08.000
Yes, sir. I received a great money more for the calls than I normally did in similar cases that came through to the individual secretaries of members of Congress or through committee, individuals who are on committee staff.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Have you had calls yet or for?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
No, I want to get an answer there.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Members of the committee staff, yet or for.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
Call you with respect to direct or applications for direct commissions and interventions of the service.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I cannot recall any other.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
I cannot recall exact instances, but I believe it's fair enough to say that I have received requests for that call.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
That you have received requests, sir.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Ah, sir.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I just have a minute.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
I used both five leaves and you want to give that impression.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
I got that impression and I want you to clear it up if I'm an error.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
You gave the impression that Mr. Scott, when he came down to the Pentagon to the purpose of holding up his hand and you asked him to do that.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
You gave the impression that Mr. Scott was an application that he was reluctant to do it and left without sending it out in full.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So what did you give you?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
All of the accurate information you needed to do.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Do you mean to leave that impression? Is that correct or am I an error?

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
The impression I intended to leave was kind of a car if he was.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I mean, excuse me, kind of a problem with this.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
That Mr. Shawn felt when he came to the Pentagon building that his business of filling out applications

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
and going through a routine processing was of no real importance.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
In other words, did he give the same time as he was?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Was any written memorandum exchanged on this matter at any time?

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
I noticed it all these where telephone conversations or personal conversations.

10:44.000 --> 10:53.000
Is there any data, letters written memorandum covering this matter that was then occupied your attention in July of 1953?

10:53.000 --> 11:07.000
No written matters by me, Senator Dersian, except a brief pencil series of notes, which I made when I first went to the McCarthy's office.

11:08.000 --> 11:16.000
And then, of course, the biographical sketch, which Mr. Cohen sent me on the morning of 9 July.

11:16.000 --> 11:28.000
And then, actually, the actual processing of the application was all enlightening and with the proper forwarding data throughout the official challenges department of the Army et cetera.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
That is all in right.

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
We call anybody else besides the Senator or Mr. Cohen who discussed this matter with you by that I mean members of the Committee staff.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
No, sir.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
It's a part you recall only the Senator and Mr. Cohen discussed this with you.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh, yes, Senator Dersian.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
And one other question, was all this conversation carried on in good temper and with restraint?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Yes, in silence.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That's all.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
Senator Jackson, what's the general measure?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Follow-on-on.

12:02.000 --> 12:11.000
Question, that you were answering in response to Senator McCollum's question at the conclusion of his interrogation.

12:11.000 --> 12:19.000
What was the reaction of Mr. Shine to fulfilling out of the forms?

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
The Jew was he reluctant to fill it out or he wanted to fill it out that day and be sworn in.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
I didn't quite get the import of your testimony.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
He, of that, Lee, understands an opinion solely.

12:33.000 --> 12:46.000
He, of that, himself, that the business is filling out forms and going through with the processing was an unnecessary routine step.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Did he take the form within then?

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
No, he left the form with us the first time.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
What is on his planet that he fill out in higher form?

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
He filled out a large, considerable portion of it.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
However, he left gaps in the form.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
What gaps?

13:10.000 --> 13:24.000
The only one that I remember distinctly now was the gaps in turning as the service with the Army Transport Service.

13:24.000 --> 13:31.000
When did you learn of the Committee investigation at Fort Mama?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
When did that start?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Your knowledge, if you know.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
In September of 1953.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
In September of October of 1954, not exactly certain.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
When it was September of 1953.

13:46.000 --> 13:59.000
Did you know of an investigation going on at Fort Mama's by the Committee at the time of the conversations that you had with the various people in connection with this application for a commission by Mr. Shine?

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
There was no investigation to my knowledge showing on that talk.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
From the fire of the mission.

14:08.000 --> 14:16.000
General Reber, how long did you serve as Chief of the Layers on Division for the Army of the Capitol Hill?

14:16.000 --> 14:23.000
I served as Chief of the Senate of Fire for three years and more months.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
I served as Deputy for approximately seven years prior that.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
So you've been here about ten years in the Layers on Division, is that correct?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes sir.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
In your tell of the Committee.

14:38.000 --> 14:52.000
Approximately how many members of Congress have asked, made similar requests for commissions for persons either constituents or friends that they might have?

14:52.000 --> 15:04.000
Senator, Senator Potter, I couldn't possibly estimate the total number of cases that I've been asked to look into with reference to things like the mission in the past ten years.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
It would be just a very rough sketch.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
But it was a sizable number.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
It was a sizable number.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It was a part of the...

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
Your duty is in responsible days to service that request.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I know requests are not... are not in proper.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
Well, if I remember, some reports from a citizen in the hometown or a parent.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
All the individuals themselves are that correct.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
That's correct.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I'll get in a reber.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
I... I'll bring you a cut down this question.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
But...

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Not that you've stated that...

15:45.000 --> 15:53.000
That neither Senator McCartney or Mr. Cole intimidated you or threatened you in any way.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That's correct, Senator Potter.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Neither by words or by actions.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
That is correct.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
You stated, however, that the frequency of Mr. Cole and Saul.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
You felt was unusual prior to that.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
I do, sir. I've based that on my ten years of experience.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
It was... it wasn't the normal.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It was more than normal, actually.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
It was more than normal.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
Did you report this actually to any superior officer or one of the officers of the secretary of the Army?

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
I reported the request for a commission as I stated to both General Hall and to the secretary of the Army.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
I made no report on the number of telephone calls or breaks things like that.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
That's something that I personally was responsible for.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
General River isn't a normal procedure for a person who is seeking a commission.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
So, if you appear before a board of officers, that is correct.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Did Mr. Shines appear before such a board?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
He appeared before a board of officers in New York.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
He did not appear before a board of officers here in Washington because, as I understand it,

17:06.000 --> 17:17.000
there was no necessity for a fairing for that board because he did not possess the necessary qualifications of experience and background of big commission here in Washington.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
In other words, he was deemed ineligible because of lack of qualifications without the excessive form of a board.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
That is correct, General.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
I think it might be well if you would explain to the committee,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
the body of the United States Army Transportation Service.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Is that a part of our military branch?

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
Yes, sir. That is one of the seven technical services of the Department of the Army

17:44.000 --> 17:57.000
that is charged with the mission of providing the necessary transportation of all times that the Army needs conduct its missions both in peace and work time.

17:57.000 --> 18:08.000
Of course, acquiring the necessary supplies and attrarying the necessary personnel and carrying on the necessary research and development in the transportation fee.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
Did Mr. Shines serve as a military man?

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
I didn't quite understand the question.

18:17.000 --> 18:26.000
Did Mr. Shines, when he served as a understand with the United States Army Transportation Service, did he serve as a military man?

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
No, sir. He did not. He was not in the Army.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
And that was one of the bases for which he wasn't qualified for commission, is that correct?

18:37.000 --> 18:45.000
I believe that the basis was more that he was not, what I would call a junior ship officer.

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
In other words, a ship officer who has drawn through the necessary schooling to permit him to navigate ships.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
I believe that was yet unnotable. Exporter not failed, sir.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Fireback, please. That's my understanding.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Thank you. That's all I'm sure.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
The Federal Assignments in the Missouri.

19:02.000 --> 19:12.000
General Reba, do I understand from you, sir, that all possible steps you knew of were taken in an effort to get Mr. Shines in a commission?

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
All possible steps that I knew of, yes, sir.

19:16.000 --> 19:25.000
My second question. You know on what date before my investigation started, I don't know the exact answer.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Will you submit that for the record? I start me shouting. I have no further questions.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Yes.

19:30.000 --> 19:38.000
Point of order. General Reba cannot submit that day. If the only man that can submit that day is the chairman of the committee myself.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
That will be glad to submit that day. We did not inform General Reba from that investigation started.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
General Reba may do his best in the chairman of Mr. Midhysi. I hope they judge.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
I'll let him in. Let him in. Let him in. Let him in. Let him in. Let him in.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
Mr. Chairman, may I ask that my authority, but he will submit that day to the committee.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
If the central head done with the committee will turn, you would know the date.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
The candidate is the voice act of item.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
I would like to say one thing on that. I'm not sure.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Are you in any new questions?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You have time. I'm going to be.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I'm at the right.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
General Reba may be talking.

20:18.000 --> 20:33.000
Senator, voice act of item. General Reba, your best and only indicates the two next four of possibilities available to you in an effort to get favorable action on the application of Mr. Shire.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
That still is intact in my test monitor.

20:36.000 --> 20:48.000
Would you be a guilty agent in other cases with our applications for a commission in which you knew there was an interest on a part of the member of the party?

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
Yes, sir. I think I would. I don't believe Frank Bay that I would have moved by this fact.

20:54.000 --> 21:01.000
First, I was saying great, but it's all about me.

21:02.000 --> 21:11.000
I don't require any particular interest, but I have a plan that during my congressional service and trying to get a commission for something that you would have planned.

21:11.000 --> 21:28.000
It would appear to me that our usage has become very diligent in your efforts to be accommodating in my favor at least to get favorable action on this particular application.

21:28.000 --> 21:36.000
I tried to process the thing as rapidly as I possibly could under the then current regulations of the party on.

21:36.000 --> 21:46.000
You can further see the various services and explored all possible approaches in order to get some action on this commission.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
I did it about my following.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
That's all.

21:52.000 --> 22:02.000
Under the rules established by the committee after the committee members have each asked the questions that they carried out of a 10-minute rule, counsel for each side of the dispute.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
May I have 10 minutes to interrogate the witness?

22:05.000 --> 22:16.000
Insofar as the chairman is able to determine when the witness appears to be a witness supporting the position of Mr. Steves and Tensville and Adams.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
We will ask the counsel for the army to proceed first.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
And whenever the witness appears to be somebody supporting the position of Senator McCarthy and the two associates, we shall ask them to proceed first.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Mr. Welch or Mr. Sinclair or both you have 10 minutes between you.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
I think Mr. Chairman, I have about three questions for the general.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
Mr. Welch, we can't hear you. We'll have to get some microphones.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I hope I will become a minister.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
You'll have to speak in the same microphone so you'll have to kind of huddle together.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Mr. Welch, let us now try a test remark. Am I doing all right?

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Very hard to hear if you could put on your hands.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
I must have a soft voice. Well, I do now.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
General Reva, I think I have three questions to ask you.

23:05.000 --> 23:16.000
Are you acutely aware of Mr. Cohn's position as counsel for this committee and the course of your conversations and contacts with him?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I wish Mr. Welch.

23:18.000 --> 23:28.000
Did that position occupied by Mr. Cohn increase or diminish the interest with which you pursued the problem?

23:28.000 --> 23:38.000
The best of my ability, I feel it at increased speed.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
And one more question, sir.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
Disregarding the word improper, influence or pressure.

23:48.000 --> 23:57.000
Do you recall any instance comparable to this in which you were put under greater pressure?

23:57.000 --> 24:09.000
The best of my recollection, I recall of no instance under which I was put under greater pressure.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
That's all.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
Senator McCarthy or Mr. Cohn, or both you have ten minutes to come.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Yes, sir.

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
Mr. Cohn, I don't really know what you're going to ask you.

24:27.000 --> 24:35.000
The son of hers, I don't want to embarrass them because I think they're accustomed to their magic.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
It's a big of proper motives.

24:37.000 --> 24:45.000
But roughly how many requests have you received from this committee?

24:45.000 --> 24:55.000
I've been assigned for assignments or information as to the rights of men in the military.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
The United States, I don't want you to name the censor, but it's roughly how many else?

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
Yes, sir.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Senator, may I insist that you name the Senate?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
The Elton number.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
May it not be embarrassing to the senator for Mark himself?

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
Yes, sir.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
I hope the citizens tell me in just a minute.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Mr. Cohn, I hope this is not shown against my ten minutes.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
If the senator has won't have the senator's name, they can ask other names.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I will not ask other names.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I merely want to get the general picture.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
If I thought there had been improper conduct in the part of the members of this committee, I would ask they be named.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
No indication of the wrongs or any improper conduct.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I'm just trying to get the general picture.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Do you have my question?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Question of many times that members of this committee.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Requested information between you and how to process an application for a commission.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
How to process, for example, a friendship release.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
What you would call consideration for a man in the military.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
The senator, I would like to be able to answer that question specifically.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I will have to answer it this way.

26:09.000 --> 26:17.000
I got approximately a thousand cases in my office a week.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
Over ten years, that's a lot of cases.

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
I know that I received many, many requests for information of all kinds from members of this subcommittee.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
In some cases, you were successful.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
Were there requests for a commission in having the case process so the commission is granted.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
That is correct.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
In this case of private shine, you're still a private, you are not successful, right?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I was not successful, sir.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
Now, I wonder if the report here would read back the first question asked of General Reiber.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
I think you want to correct his answer.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
The first question asked by Council Jenkins.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
It's the very first question.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Will you be able to pass it?

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
If not, I think I can repeat that.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
He's a graduate of the Council said in this time.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
Let me see if I can take the time of the report.

27:15.000 --> 27:23.000
Mr. Reiber, you said that as of July, you're appointed with Mr. Carr, Mr. Cohn and with her.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
I would like to refresh your recollection.

27:27.000 --> 27:36.000
On July 8th, Mr. Carr was not with the committee, Mr. Carr was handed the FBI subversive group in New York.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
That's the correct title for the party.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
Did you know him when he was said of that FBI subversive group in New York?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I did not, sir.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
You did not.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
So then you were mistaken. You said you knew what your current is.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
I was mistaken in that respect, yes, sir. I admit that crime.

27:55.000 --> 28:01.000
Actually, the first time Mr. Carr was in September when you occurred to the witness before this committee, is that not correct?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
That is correct.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
So that you did not know him until September when you occurred to the witness before this committee?

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
I believe I'm sure I received telephone calls from the fire in that state center, but I do not know the date of those calls.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
About the very request from the committee.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Anything you have to do with Mr. Shrine?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
No.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Nothing improper about the request.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
We are not requesting this information.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Requests for information for the committee.

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
You admit that the statement that you saw that Mr. Carr had come back to someone with your staff.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
Now that you know that about Mr. Shrine, now that you know Mr. Carr was not with the committee on July 8th,

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
came with the committee something after that.

28:47.000 --> 28:54.000
The still-side of Mr. Carr contacted members of your staff and its soul, and went to know about what your base left.

28:54.000 --> 29:02.000
I base that statement on a member random, which is in the files of my office.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
And the other member with you?

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I do not, but I can produce it, sir.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Who's the member of the maid by?

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
The fact that I'm an F.J. Femmon, I believe.

29:13.000 --> 29:23.000
Now, you said that you thought that Mr. Carr had used up to get your words,

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
pressure, or something that affect because the number of calls, but they asked you this for getting them at the number of calls.

29:29.000 --> 29:36.000
Well, is there anything anyone in the visual call, which was different from the calls that you got normal like in the hill?

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
From the members of the staff of the various centers of the committee.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
To be absolutely fine, sir, I believe there was this difference.

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
A large number of the calls that I get, or got from the hill, nearly requested information.

29:54.000 --> 30:01.000
These specific calls were impressing me with the necessity for speed and for favorable action.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
But it was that difference.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
Did you ever get any requests before for favorable action?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
I did.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
You did.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
So, there's very different from Mr. Cohn's request and the other request you got?

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
There was no difference between Mr. Cohn's request and the other request of the type.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
That type, there are two mentioned.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
However, those, that type of request was only a very small part of the total number of requests that I received.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Then we get down to the number of calls Mr. Cohn has made.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
He will question you about the number of calls.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
You see the number of calls.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
I asked you what was the power for the calls.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
What are the average number of calls you received?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Then you won't be successful.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
I'll try to answer that question as it's about my brother.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
So, I don't understand.

30:55.000 --> 31:02.000
But, I think you mean how many calls would I get in an average case?

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
I would say, are there any case of a commission?

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
I would probably not get more than four of five calls,

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
unless they were tremendous interest in that particular commission.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
In any case, the time has to vary.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
We will go around on the table again and we'll come back to you and Mr. Cohn's request.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
Does the council have further questions to ask us?

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
Yes, I think if proper to ask this question, I do not believe it has been asked.

31:34.000 --> 31:43.000
Does the army have and did it have as of 1953 priorities?

31:43.000 --> 31:52.000
An agency set up for the purpose of investigating the infiltration of Communists in the army?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Absolutely, it's a question.
