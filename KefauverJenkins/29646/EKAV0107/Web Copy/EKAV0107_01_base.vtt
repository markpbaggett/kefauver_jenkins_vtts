WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

00:08.400 --> 00:13.960
Today we are very happy to have on this program, and I'm very proud to be able to introduce

00:13.960 --> 00:20.800
to all of you that distinguished Attorney General of the United States Robert Kennedy.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.680
And I want to say in that connection that I think that Mr. Kennedy is making a excellent

00:25.680 --> 00:26.680
attorney general.

00:26.680 --> 00:30.440
I was proud to just put him.

00:30.440 --> 00:35.800
I don't want to say too many things to embarrass him here in his presence, but as all of

00:35.800 --> 00:42.560
you know, he is 35 years old and is the youngest attorney general that we've had in more

00:42.560 --> 00:44.360
than 100 years.

00:44.360 --> 00:47.800
I don't know what happened to that fellow Bob that was younger than you.

00:47.800 --> 00:48.800
I don't know as to go.

00:48.800 --> 00:54.480
But then the event I think that Attorney General Kennedy is surrounding himself with very

00:54.480 --> 01:01.840
able assistance that he is going to be a determined and active and courageous Attorney General.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.400
And I think we'll be mighty proud of the record that he is going to make or that he is

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
making.

01:07.400 --> 01:14.000
We have a special interest in one person and your immediate staff, Mr. Attorney General,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.400
and that's John Seagal Taylor.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.640
John was the Assistant City Editor of the National Tennessee, and how did you get mixed up

01:20.640 --> 01:21.640
with John?

01:21.640 --> 01:26.520
We were investigating some three years ago, I guess, Senator.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.200
We were, I was Counselor of the Senate Records Committee, and we were investigating a situation

01:30.200 --> 01:37.000
down in Tennessee involving some corruption in dishonesty and involving a judge in Tennessee.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.080
And John Seagal Taylor was the one that first brought it to our attention as well as followed

01:42.080 --> 01:45.240
shortly afterwards by a number of your other citizens there.

01:45.240 --> 01:51.560
And we made an investigation, held some hearings, and he was very instrumental in uncovering

01:51.560 --> 01:54.240
information which was ultimately revealed at our hearings.

01:54.240 --> 02:00.800
And then later on, you know, your legislature picked it up and the judge was impeached.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.800
And I think that each covered that and was very helpful to them also.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.720
So I got to know him then, and he worked in the campaign with us.

02:09.720 --> 02:14.400
He was my administrative assistant, and when I was out speaking in the country, he was

02:14.400 --> 02:15.920
really running the whole campaign.

02:15.920 --> 02:21.560
So I was pointing to this position, I asked him if he'd come and be my assistant here.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.760
So I think that I'm very fortunate in having him.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.040
Well, we all think that John is a very able man.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.440
I know he's working awfully hard.

02:27.440 --> 02:34.360
Well, I want to say, our folks, that I think the new program, our president Kennedy, is getting

02:34.360 --> 02:35.360
started off fine.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.360
There's a lot of activity.

02:36.360 --> 02:41.520
There are many plans to do many things that are necessary, such as the area redevelopment

02:41.520 --> 02:42.520
bill.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.720
He's gotten food out to the needy.

02:43.720 --> 02:48.800
We have programs that will soon be before the Senate in connection with raising the minimum

02:48.800 --> 02:55.600
wage and extending the coverage assistance to the aged and medical assistance.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.400
So the things are really humming in Washington.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.520
Of course, there's a lot of confusion and difficulty in the transition from one administration

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
to another.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.720
And more of a sometime, how president Kennedy stands all of the strain that must be placed

03:07.720 --> 03:11.760
upon him during this very difficult time.

03:11.760 --> 03:15.920
Bob, I know you see your brother, John, very often.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.920
How's it feeling?

03:16.920 --> 03:18.400
Well, I think very well.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.840
As I believe you know, Senator, I don't think there's anything that is more difficult than

03:22.840 --> 03:25.800
an arduous campaign.

03:25.800 --> 03:31.120
You went through the campaign in Wisconsin, I believe four years ago, and we went through

03:31.120 --> 03:32.120
it just a year ago.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.960
And I don't think anything could be as tough as that.

03:33.960 --> 03:39.920
And then the campaign, New Hampshire, and traveling all around the country making as many

03:39.920 --> 03:46.320
as 20 or 22 speeches a day and sleeping four or five hours, that this actually is less

03:46.320 --> 03:50.280
difficult physically than that kind of an operation.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.280
And then?

03:51.280 --> 03:53.880
You mean being president is less difficult than all this campaign?

03:53.880 --> 03:54.880
Certainly physically.

03:54.880 --> 04:00.160
They're all traveling and all that strain of making speeches continuously.

04:00.160 --> 04:06.600
So I think that he's getting extremely healthy and in very good position to make some of

04:06.600 --> 04:07.600
these decisions.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.320
I think health makes a big difference if you're healthy.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.000
You can meet these problems and difficulties much easier.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.280
And I've never seen his health better than it's been over the period of the last year or

04:17.280 --> 04:18.280
so.

04:18.280 --> 04:23.280
And as I say, I think that it's not a great deal difference than what he's been through

04:23.280 --> 04:24.280
in the past.

04:24.280 --> 04:30.120
Well, I must say that when Senator Gore and I went down to see him last week at Common,

04:30.120 --> 04:35.240
President Jackson's portrait was put back up in the conference room that he certainly

04:35.240 --> 04:43.240
looked well and very keen and interested and anxious to get all of the ideas he could.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.440
That's a wonderful picture, I think.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.640
Yes, I think it is.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.720
It should have been up on the wall all the time.

04:48.720 --> 04:56.080
I have a very interesting letter that I obtained at an auction some years ago of President

04:56.080 --> 05:02.960
Jackson that he wrote just before the battle in New Orleans to his wife telling about the

05:02.960 --> 05:07.080
positions of the British and he anticipated for the future.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.680
Well, that's a very precious letter.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.200
Yes, and a very touching letter too.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
Very touching.

05:12.200 --> 05:16.240
On any time that you don't have some precious place to keep it, I know the Hermitage would

05:16.240 --> 05:19.360
be glad to have it on there among our precious documents.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
Thank you.

05:20.360 --> 05:24.920
We have a state library that has a collection of Andrew Jackson's letters and papers.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.880
No doubt you've seen it down.

05:26.880 --> 05:27.880
I did.

05:27.880 --> 05:31.160
I visited there and I visited the Hermitage.

05:31.160 --> 05:37.680
I've got a also that was a very important momento to me.

05:37.680 --> 05:44.680
A gable letter was sent by the governor which is taken from the desk of President Jackson

05:44.680 --> 05:48.320
when he was the living in Nashville, Tennessee.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.000
I believe governor Beeper Dallings has brought that up to Washington.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
He was very nice.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.480
I have that on my desk at the Attorney General's Office.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.400
Do you ever have to use it to keep your associates in order?

05:57.400 --> 06:00.720
John Sikinsol occasionally, but other than him, no.

06:00.760 --> 06:05.360
I noticed in the paper that you're a wonderful assistant, Byron, Wizard of White.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.360
Yeah.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.840
Probably a little too nervous and has gone to the hospital.

06:08.840 --> 06:09.840
I knew that.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.840
Well, he said some difficulty with it.

06:11.840 --> 06:12.840
It's alright, but there.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.760
Well, he's a wonderful fellow.

06:14.760 --> 06:20.240
The one thing I think about you and your outstanding brother and all of the candidates

06:20.240 --> 06:26.560
you have, the tremendous energy and interest in the power to relax, which is of what anyone

06:26.560 --> 06:28.040
in public office needs.

06:28.760 --> 06:32.840
Well, do you mind if I, we talk a little bit about how things are going?

06:32.840 --> 06:36.360
How do you feel that the new program is going generally, the new frontier?

06:36.360 --> 06:39.720
Well, I think that we're making a good deal of progress, Senator.

06:39.720 --> 06:47.400
I think, of course, it's early, Tony Ben, I think it's 40 days since the inauguration.

06:47.400 --> 06:53.920
I think that President Shone by the various programs that he's offered, that he feels

06:53.920 --> 06:58.240
it's necessary and essential that the country move again in many areas.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.320
And here and the United States and our relationship with other countries.

07:02.320 --> 07:09.320
And he's trying to take some steps to get some of these programs, excepted by Congress

07:09.320 --> 07:11.360
and accepted by the American people.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.960
And I think that there's some good deal of progress as being made.

07:13.960 --> 07:19.400
Of course, I think that we all, everybody, appreciate the fact that before, great many

07:19.400 --> 07:23.280
things can be done, that cabinet members have to have hearings before the committees

07:23.280 --> 07:24.680
and they have to be confirmed.

07:24.680 --> 07:29.880
And I believe that all the cabinet members, and practically all of the people who have

07:29.880 --> 07:33.480
to come before the Senate to be confirmed have been confirmed.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.480
Correct, yes.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.080
And I don't believe today that any of them have been turned down.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
Now, there.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.080
Which speaks might well for the people who are being selected.

07:41.080 --> 07:48.640
Well, now Mr. Tony General, or Bob, if I may call you that, tell us, I have a feeling

07:48.640 --> 07:56.240
that the Attorney General, if the Department of Justice, is really humming and the things

07:56.240 --> 08:00.320
are growing and everybody is working hard with the determination to enforce the law and

08:00.320 --> 08:02.480
to improve the enforcement of the law.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.040
Tell us something about your plans.

08:05.040 --> 08:10.880
How about in the antitrust field where we had a shocking experience recently, finding

08:10.880 --> 08:17.600
the some officials in the electrical manufacturing industry, a fixing crisis, talking things

08:17.600 --> 08:24.400
over, violating the law, and now some of them have been sent to penal institution upon

08:24.400 --> 08:26.000
their plea of guilty.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.800
What about that?

08:27.800 --> 08:32.320
Well, there are going to be a number of cases that are going to arise out of those cases,

08:32.320 --> 08:33.320
Senator.

08:33.320 --> 08:40.520
And you were well aware, because I think that was first initially developed by your committee,

08:40.520 --> 08:45.120
the facts that which ultimately led up to their indictment and their conviction.

08:45.120 --> 08:51.920
There were sales, for instance, to TBA, where we're shown that the sales were handled through

08:51.920 --> 08:56.600
rig bidding, the contract is getting together amongst themselves and determining what the

08:56.600 --> 08:59.440
prices should be, who should get the bid.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.400
The government is now going to take action.

09:01.400 --> 09:10.080
I would think within about six weeks to try to collect damages from the electrocouponies

09:10.080 --> 09:12.760
and the areas in which they were defrauded.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.360
One of the major areas will be in the TBA, but there will be a number of other government

09:16.360 --> 09:21.360
agencies whose contracts will be studied to determine whether we can also bring some

09:21.360 --> 09:24.480
action at the federal level.

09:24.480 --> 09:29.720
We will continue to be working in this whole area of price fixing.

09:29.720 --> 09:34.360
I think it has a very important effect on local community.

09:34.360 --> 09:39.880
This last electrocoupon case had a nationwide effect, but there are many other similar cases

09:39.880 --> 09:44.400
which have an effect on a state or on a particular city or in a community.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.840
We are investigating a number of those.

09:46.840 --> 09:52.000
I might say that we're extremely appreciative of the help and cooperation and the very

09:52.000 --> 09:57.440
important leads that we have received from your committee because I think that that kind

09:57.440 --> 10:01.000
of information that you've given to the executive branch of the government has been almost

10:01.000 --> 10:05.120
essential for us to proceed in these areas.

10:05.120 --> 10:11.240
I hope that you and TBA will continue in your hearing so that the two branches of the

10:11.240 --> 10:13.080
government can work together in this matter.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
Thank you, Bob.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.720
I've been the chairman of the Antitrust and Monopoly subcommittee for a number of years

10:18.720 --> 10:25.640
and never had we received better cooperation or more sympathetic attitude from anyone than

10:25.640 --> 10:27.620
we have from you as the U.L.

10:27.620 --> 10:28.620
Attorney General.

10:28.620 --> 10:34.240
We did find it bids out to the TBA, even though the companies might be in different parts

10:34.240 --> 10:39.360
of the United States have different labor costs, even though they were secret bids that

10:39.360 --> 10:43.960
strangely they were identical and that they were so often they would be a rotation

10:43.960 --> 10:46.840
so as to give the bid to some particular company.

10:46.840 --> 10:51.360
I think the public ought to understand that this is very destructive of our free enterprise

10:51.360 --> 10:52.360
system.

10:52.360 --> 10:57.200
It's a kind of thing that we cannot tolerate and we're going to work out along with you

10:57.200 --> 10:59.400
and further investigations.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.080
But this might be going on in other lines of industry.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.280
I suppose that you and we will be looking at this.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.280
Yes.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.280
Yes.

11:07.280 --> 11:13.880
You made a great record as General Counsel or Chief Counsel of the Senate Records Committee

11:13.880 --> 11:17.040
headed up by Senator John McCluller in the Barkham South.

11:17.040 --> 11:23.320
I admired your courage and your energy and thoroughness and carrying out the work of

11:23.320 --> 11:24.320
that committee.

11:24.320 --> 11:30.720
I've been very pleased to know about your attitude and your determination to do something

11:30.720 --> 11:37.320
to try to rid the nation of the at least check or stop where we can influence the criminal

11:37.320 --> 11:38.320
element.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.840
But you tell us something about that, Mr. Attorney General?

11:40.840 --> 11:47.080
Well, I think that the situation since 1950 when you first developed these matters has

11:47.080 --> 11:49.120
become even more critical.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.120
I agree with you.

11:51.120 --> 11:56.400
I think that the necessary and essential of the executive branch of the government step

11:56.400 --> 11:59.520
in with a forceful program.

11:59.520 --> 12:06.380
I think rising the steps that will be taken, rising out of the conference that you and

12:06.380 --> 12:11.480
Senator Colin and Jay Edgar Hoover, the FBI and I had the Department of Justice several

12:11.480 --> 12:15.000
weeks ago, that there will be important steps taken.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.480
I don't think that this problem will be solved overnight as both of us recognize.

12:19.480 --> 12:26.760
But I think we can take certain steps which will make a major difference in many areas

12:26.760 --> 12:29.600
of the United States to stamp out organized crime.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.920
Well, I know something about your plans and I'm certain that great benefits will come

12:33.920 --> 12:34.920
from it.

12:34.920 --> 12:40.120
I know that people all over the country who are interested in stamping out organized crime

12:40.120 --> 12:43.360
better law enforcement are going to be encouraged.

12:43.360 --> 12:48.000
And after all, the activity of people at the local level is accounts very, very much

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
doesn't it?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Certainly does.

12:50.000 --> 12:58.000
Well, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Kennedy has been down to Tennessee on many occasions.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.520
I know that many of you have met him and seen him.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.320
I know you will follow his career with a great deal of interest.

13:05.320 --> 13:09.720
And let me say again that I think when the history of this administration has written,

13:09.720 --> 13:14.560
I think that we will all record that he has been one of the great attorney generals

13:14.560 --> 13:16.040
in the history of our nation.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.040
We thank you very much, Bob.

13:18.040 --> 13:18.960
Thank you very much.

13:18.960 --> 13:19.960
I'll see you again soon.

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
Thanks, sir.

13:20.960 --> 13:21.720
That's all for now.
