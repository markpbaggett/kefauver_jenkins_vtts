WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I'm here for the not assuming the so-stack season.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
So later in that, now you know what I've got to go with me,

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
you're a liar.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Assuming that they did, let's just say it's kind of a McCarthy.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
You've got proper conducts on the party

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
with Chief Council of Articles.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
So there's no doubt in your mind for you, England.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Let me say this, Mr. Jenkins.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
If I had been invited down as Mr. Coleman then,

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
to waste a day, then I excluded from the laboratory

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
as the cabinet for working in.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I would have used language, I think, much, much stronger

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
than I need to strive here.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
And I don't care what he said.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I don't care what he said about time.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
It was a growth in self.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
It was completely in comfort.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
It was unheard of to invite some of the victims

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
from the administrative system, some of the children

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
from the administrative system, some of the parties

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
from the administrative system, my Chief Council,

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
down the physical laboratories, and then tell them

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
that they could not go in with them.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Now, I don't know what language he is.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
I didn't hear him say he declared one, the Army.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I feel sure he didn't, he isn't the candidate, he didn't.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
But no matter what language he is, no matter how strong it was,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I was there two weeks for the occasion.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
So you're out of town approved.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Any language that needs to come out of these

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
on the conditions for the mamas, I'm out for which way.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I know what they are.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't ratify or prove anything with the Jenkins.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I say you had a fantastic situation.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And if those people were barred from the laboratories

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
after being invited down there,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
where they didn't use strong language,

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
I think it is not a subject for sanatorium investigations.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
The goal is that he said senator on medication

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
and addition to the things that I have incorporated

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
in my hypothetical question,

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
that I have been afraid for classified information.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
I have access to FBI files when I want them.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
You're doing this just came by as me,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
leaving investigate the heck out of you.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Some of you weren't so drugged,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
fighting words of threatening words,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
if Mr. Corn did use them.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Mr. Jenkins, I will not speculate.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Not any words of what I'm using.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
But if he did use them,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
you say his eyes are coming from there,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
that you've tried to mismauld or misaffect him.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Mr. Jenkins, the investigation

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
has nothing to do with the kissing bars before.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Mr. Ardysn, I'm sorry.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm sorry.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
What is it you're doing?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I will not mind my feelings.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I will not speculate.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I will not ratify.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I will not talk about.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I will not speculate.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Not any language used by those people

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
who were barred from the plan.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Did you ever decide senator?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Did you understand this repeat?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Did you ever think of any kind?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Reprimand Mr. Corn.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
So anything you might have said

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
or done on that investigation for months?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
No, sir.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
No recording on the topic?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
No, sir.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
No, sir.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
No, sir.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
No, sir.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
No, sir.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I did not.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
You heard all about it, sir.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
You did not.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
You knew all about it before the day, had you?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
No, I talked to him about it.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yes, sir.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I never told you what he said.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
No.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
He didn't know me yet.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
He had remained not a statement.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And the state of the man's home is a gentleman

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
that said, no, the state of the man.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Senator, when you went to wash your hands,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
bring your gifts before the lunchpate,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Mr. Adams and Mr. Corn were there,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
and both of them followed you,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
since there was room that they did not have had a dime.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And Mr. Corn told you, then,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
and I think I had enough to make that so freely, didn't it?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I think I asked Mr. Adams and Mr. Corn to command the left thing.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
And Senator, I ask you to didn't the fact

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
that that's the incident on Mr. Corn's offer

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
some medication,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
where responsible for you is easy

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
to make the person believe

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
that you had gone at him, had this got.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
No, no, Mr. Duncan.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
That nothing you do with it?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Definitely not.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I think I'm a little bit...

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Mr. Duncan, the act plan,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
the, the menu of the act,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
she showed that I was telling,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I don't have it here.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
What I saw, it's four, one month before I went there,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I didn't think I was calling off an investigation.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I made a clear over and over and over

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
that I would not call off the investigation.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Number one, and number two,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I pointed out to Mr. Adams,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
and I think he agreed to see him,

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm not sure,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
but it would look that as silly as we thought him in your graph.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Only showing that I told what I had seen

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
before I got in the Fort Mama,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
and we had a very fun bit of discussion,

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
we gave it.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I told him to Adam that

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
I was very much impressed by the cooperation

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
with the law firm of giving,

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
and there was much in this

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
thoughts released that I had

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
could disfelt that I wasn't handling the menu of that

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
release.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Thank you, Mr. G. G.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
here, the Secretary of the Army,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I apologize to Mr. Cohn on that occasion.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
No, I don't.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Did you learn that day,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
the Secretary actually did that in the presence

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
of approximately 25 people?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Did I do that?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
I thought you were nothing?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I don't think I learned that day,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I think so on the way back,

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
yes.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Roy, or someone told me that the other

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
politicized?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
It is a politicized.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
The Secretary, old enough position,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
my father,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I'm Senator,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
guilty of nothing though that,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
as far as you could see,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
call for an apology on the part

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
of a man in that high position

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
to your chief counsel,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
where he is,

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
so what was it?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Mr. Johnson and the Secretary,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
I think, and I didn't hear it personally,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
I think it was more of an explanation,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
he had failed to get the

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
clearance for the people

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
who invited down the fort

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
monument, or someone had failed.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I think he was very much embarrassed

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
by a fact,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
by the fact that two centers

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
had no set of assistance

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
for bars and the plants

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
after invited down,

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Mr. Cohn was.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I think somebody who saw

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
that it was an apology,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
as it was recited to me,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I would call it more

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
an explanation,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
that he was embarrassed by it,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
he felt the situation

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
should never have occurred,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
and that he hoped

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
it was a whole thing

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
that he forgot to be

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
gone as it was.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
And Senator, he was

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
taken as a serve

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
over the conduct

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
and the words of your chief counsel.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Well, I think he was,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I think he was more disturbed

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
than Mr. Jenkins

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
over the situation.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
He and I talked about it

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
inside the laboratory.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
He said that he was

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
quoting him,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
flattering the devil and the eat,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
that someone failed

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
to get clearance

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
for all those who were

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
brought down,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
and he talked to me,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
that he made the wrong decision,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and he should have allowed

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
them to come in,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
because after all,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
there was nothing,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
of any really toxic

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
of nature that we saw.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
So, what happened?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Well, with the six-year-old

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
the army,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
who really made us,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
he called it a

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
toxic intelligence

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
there as to

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
who would have heard

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
in this day,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
highly-spinigal plant,

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
excelling your chief counsel,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
your chief counsel

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
while your city

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
did make some statements,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
your special man,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
who were willing to be

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
believed,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
and which I say

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
is that a good one

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
of the knives on Mr. Gold.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Can you take it

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
with war,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
war on the army,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
the head cleanse,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
the head cleanse,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
did he had access to FBI files,

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
did they investigate the

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Hick out of the army,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
and Senator Zahn

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
has sent us the situation

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
while that for what

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
the security has done

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
or omitted his days

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
to which allow Mr. Gold

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
to go on that plan.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
He publicly and in

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
his gentlemanry and humble way,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
he either explained

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
or to use Mr. Adams' words

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
of public eyes

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
and to this good day

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Senator McKibbie,

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
who are you?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Mr. Kohn or any member

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
of your staff has ever

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
stepped one word

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
to the thick-gathered army,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
in the thinking you were

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
a great person

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
to display your pepper.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Now, that's the

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
thumb and substance

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
of the occurrence

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
of October 20th.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Do you want to tell

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
them something?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
So, Mr. Jenkins,

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
there's a son of a rano

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
of the Secretary of Span,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
there's no recite

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
and fight of someone

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
that he regretted very much,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
that he hoped it would be

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
forgotten.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
And I think it's

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
heard forgotten by Mr. Kohn,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
by Mr. Rainbow,

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
by Mr. Jones,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I think it's been

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
planned.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Now, matter of Mr. Jenkins,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
in my opinion,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
of no importance at all,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
to the case of a mistake

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
having been made,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
an oversight,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
an explanation,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
some irritations,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
and once the explanation was

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
made, I think

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
that everyone

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
could be drunk

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
with their work was.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
The health care of the

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
workers is making

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
very, very much

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
a share of electric

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
station in the parliament,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
committee,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
so that the Christ

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
and the associates

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
with the Lord,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Mr. Sinclair,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
and the staff of the

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
committee will reassemble

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
the rooms,

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
bring the eyes of the

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
entitlements,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
the Italian Richardson

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
and the Mamonin

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
and the Panapar.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Thank you very much.
