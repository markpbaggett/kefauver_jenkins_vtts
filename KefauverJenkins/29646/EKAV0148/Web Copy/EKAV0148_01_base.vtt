00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm not familiar with any such thing.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Have you been told that, sir?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
No, I haven't been told.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Have you discussed that with Mr. Adams?

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
If I discussed that with Mr. Adams,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
yes, I discussed with Mooshra,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
I fact that he went to the hall of the Senate,

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
and that's correct.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Why, I know that he did.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I know that he was a criminal.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
I know that he called on some, but I wasn't there.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
And I don't know what the conversation was.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Did he call on them, sir, to stop the issuance of the fetus

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
of members of the royalty board, which is only a summary?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
I think you are there, Mr. Adams, sir.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, sir, I'm as bad as an authorities.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
If I'm wrong, and anyway, I have to limit your question

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
just to whether the secretary knows anything about that.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
He wasn't respected, but you're my only interest,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
or maybe I didn't make it clear.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
He's directed to the secretary of knowledge,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
and whether Mr. Adams told it on his return

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
that he, Mr. Adams, had communicated with various members

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
of the subcommittee and had tried to stop the issuance

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
of subpoenares to members of the royalty board,

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
which we have come.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I don't know of anything about that.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm sure that we were working within the limits

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
of the presidential executive orders

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
that covered this situation regarding the loyalty boards.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Mrs. Steven, I would like to leave this topic here

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
if I could only get an answer to this question.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
When you came back from the far east,

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
did Mr. Adams tell you that he had communicated

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
with various members of the subcommittee

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
in an attempt to stop the issuance of subpoenares

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
to members of the Pentagon of the Army,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
royalty board, which it quickly,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
and I know that he told me that he called on the members up here

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
and had something to do with the loyalty board,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
but I don't know exactly what was said, Mr. Steven.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Don't you know that the purpose of those visits

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
by Mr. Adams was to stop the issuance of subpoenares

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
to members of the royalty board?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Did he tell you that, sir?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I know that we have these presidential directors

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
that we have to operate within,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
and I would take it, Mr. Colman,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
that what you were asked in front of me,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
however he came in conflict with one of those directors.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Sir, if I might say it just once more,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
and if I don't make it clear, please tell me

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
and I'll try to rephrase the question.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
I would like to know if on your return from the far east,

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Mr. Adams told you that he had communicated

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
with various members of this subcommittee

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
and asked their help to stop the issuance of subpoenares

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
to members of your royalty board, which it is.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
He told me substantially along that line, yes.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Your answer is yes, that is all I said.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
He told me that he was loyal,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
did he? I'm sorry, sir.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I'll trust him there.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I would like this concerns council,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I would like to ask these questions.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Did he also tell you that he had informed certain senators

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
that if we issued those subpoenas,

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
they would issue a report charging Mr. Colman was conned.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
He did not.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Didn't he tell you, Mr. Adams,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
that funny contact of certain senators?

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
He told them that if subpoenas were issued,

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
last, your department,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
would issue a report charging Mr. Colman's part.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
He did not.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
When did you first learn the effect

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
that such a warning for a statement

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
had been made by Mr. Adams or anyone else?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't know anything about it any more.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
You mean you never heard it?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
It's like the one that you first hear the report.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I might ask you to pass on others to order that.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
When did you first hear the report?

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Or the allegation that Mr. Adams had made the statement

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
that if we issued subpoenas for those

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
who had cleared men with communist background,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
that if we did that, there would be issued a report

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
that charged Colman what you made.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I never heard any, we never heard any such statement.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
We finished emanating from your department

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
to the effect that you were so psyched.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Alleged Mr. Andreak, Mr. Colman's part.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I never heard any such statement.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
You never did.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I'll say.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Did you ever come to me and complain about

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
any of the alleged Mr. Andreak, Mr. Colman's part?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Did I ever come to you?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yes.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
And complain about Mr. Colman?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I think you were well aware of what our attitude

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
was with respect to the price of Mr. Colman's putting on us.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Mr. Stevens, are you just answering my question with you?

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Did you ever complain to me?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Have any of Mr. Condor or any pressure

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
in the part of Mr. Colman?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Mr. Adams did repeatedly.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Well, now, you're telling me what Mr. Adams said.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
Did you, I'm asking you, did you, Robert T. Stevens,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
ever complain to me about any of this conduct

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
in the part of my chief counsel?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I complained to you about some things

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
when you kept trying to get Sean to sign the New York,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
for example, Senator.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
No, I think you should answer this question, Mr. Secretary.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
There's been considerable complaints that you've been kept

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
on the witness stand too long.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
That junior captain, Mr. K,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
that is, I'm sure his question is very simple,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
and we certainly will give him all more expeditiously

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
if you will answer his question.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
And that is, did you personally ever complain

05:51.000 --> 06:01.000
to Senator McCarthy about Mr. Colman and Mr. Colman's

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
alleged efforts to get preference from treatment for shy?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I did not personally do that,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
and I've heard from Senator for the reason

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
that most of the pressure was coming on Mr. Adams

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
from Mr. Colman. Mr. Adams was there for the one

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
that complained.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Did you not, I'm sorry, we had been in the gut.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Did you not repeatedly praise Mr. Colman to me?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That was sir, I don't recall that.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Don't you recall ever praising Mr. Colman?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I do not.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Never say anything good about him.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I won't say I never said anything to the bottom,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
but I don't recall going out of my way to praise him.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Didn't you repeatedly praise Mr. Colman to me?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I do not recall ever having done that.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Mr. Stevens, as you know Mr. Colman,

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
as a background of having taken large parts

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
in the prosecution of the Rosenberg case,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Rosenberg was executed.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And when you're running in case,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
the case of the second string communist,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
as you know very well, he was the attorney

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
who presented the case before the grand jury

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
with six bulls 39 communist in the UN.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Mr. Chairman, may I suggest that the senator

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
may ask those questions instead of making statements of facts?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Look at all the facts, I'll tell you where are you

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
aware of those facts.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Yes, I know about some of those facts, you mean?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And there's no question in your mind

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
when you were talking to me.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I'm very assertive.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Just like that.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
When you were talking to me in various occasions,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
did we not discuss Mr. Colman's background?

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And did you not tell me that you felt press?

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I was extremely lucky to be able to persuade Mr. Colman

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
to come with a commission.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Senator McCarthy, I'm also interested in the military right.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
This is the other people.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
They say may I suggest that you answer these questions please?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I have this flagging interrupting.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And I hope you know that.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
But when you do answer his questions directly,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
he goes to another question and we are to that extent

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
nearly in this investigation.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Now, if you will do that, then you can make a statement

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
of explanation after it.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Well, the priority is also not to run the contract.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
We'll be in defecation.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
When you were talking to me on various occasions,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
did we not discuss Mr. Colman's background?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
And did you not tell me that you felt that I was extremely lucky

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
to have been able to persuade Mr. Colman to come to the committee?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I have no recollection of any such statement.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Senator McCarthy.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
You don't recognize this.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
You say you have no recollection of any such statement.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Do you recollect Mr. Stevens

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
and the presence of witnesses discussing with me Mr. Colman's record

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
of fighting communism and indicating.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
I can't quote you verbatim indicating that you felt that I was extremely lucky

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
to have secured the services of Mr. Colman.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Do you recall that?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
No, I don't.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I've already testified that I don't.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Another day you made the statement,

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
an answer to the leaves of Mr. Jenkins' question.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
The asked whether or not you held a grudge or prejudice

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
and what were you against Mr. Colman,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
you set out to try not answering that question.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
That's right.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I wonder if you want to have the record stand.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
You don't want to answer.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, they're not.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You hold personal animosity,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
personal heart feelings toward this young man.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Well, I don't see any reason at this point to change the question.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
The answer I'm asking, you know, I'm not answering any questions.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
That's up to you.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm going to turn the questioning back to Mr. Colman.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Mr. Steve Owen.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Why are some time left, Senator?

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
I mean, for the time he for how much time he left.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
The court of McCarthy.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
30 seconds.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
30 seconds.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I can't.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I can need to take a new topic,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
not to see the secretary.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Sorry, I didn't take a second.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Let me ask you a few five-kilometre seconds.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I think Mr. Colman took 12-10 minutes.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Let me ask you this with the secretary.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
The other day, you're being questioned about a full conversation

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
meant from Mr. Adams to you and regard to General Law,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
and the officer at Fort Monmouth.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
And the question about the subject of that conversation.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
At that time, Mr. Wilson, I think,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
and not Mr. Wilson, Mr. Jenkins,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
and I think rightly so,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
give you an opportunity to refresh your recollection

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
by talking to Mr. Adams who is behind you.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
At that time,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
so that you could tell Lee Committee about this telephone conversation.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
You refused to discuss the matter with Mr. Adams at that time.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I was very much surprised to hear the fact that you said

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
that all this array around you is for the purpose of giving you information.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Let me ask you, Mr. Miller,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
time has expired, and so we'll have to.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
We'll be right back.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Mr. Jenkins.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Any questions?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Mr. Secretary,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
just a few questions, please.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
Do I understand now that when you return from the Orient,

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
you went to certain members of this committee.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I believe the record shows the Republican members

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
and the Democratic members were not present.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Now, is that correct?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Mr. Chairman, more of the sake of accuracy

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
the Democrats were not members of the committee at that time.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Did you go to certain members of this subcommittee at that time as Secretary?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
There are two Lebanon occasions.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I did, and I thought,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
did you go to the members of the subcommittee,

12:20.000 --> 12:31.000
or did Mr. Adams go with respect to Senator MacArthur's expressed intention or threat,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
what I would desire to call it,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
to have subpoenaed before his committee,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
certain members of the Lawy of the Board,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
was that you were Mr. Adams.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
That was Mr. Adams.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And Mr. Adams told you about that visit

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
with certain members of the subcommittee,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
did you not, as we understand it?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
That's correct, isn't it?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yes, sir.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
Mr. Secretary,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
was the purpose of that visit by Mr. Adams.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I expressed to you, Mr. Adams,

13:04.000 --> 13:12.000
to get members of the subcommittee to prevail upon Senator MacArthur not to pursue his about intention

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
of having members of the Lawy of the Board subpoenaed as I understand it, Mr. Jenkins.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
With the existing laws, directives and executive orders governing the making available

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
of information and membership and law reports,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
and that sort of thing,

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
he went there for the purpose of explaining that to the senators

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
in order that we do not subpoena something that we didn't think we could move it for fun.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
To the law, in short, you did not vote.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Members of the Lawy of the Board,

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
the Lawy of the Board, subpoenaed to a pre-before-the-McCardi Committee,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
is that right, Mr. Stephen?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yes, that's correct.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And in line with the law, as I understand it,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
land with the law, or with a directives.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
That's right.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And that was the only reason.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Absolutely.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Well, Mr. Stephen,

14:07.000 --> 14:16.000
did Mr. Adams ever innovate to you that at that time he made an statement to any member of the subcommittee

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
that if that were done,

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
that he was a member of the Lawy of the Board, submitted before the MacArthur Committee,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
he would issue a smear on Roy Cole, no sir.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Is this the first time you ever heard of such a thing as that?

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
It's certainly the first time I've ever heard anything so vividly put as all this has been put.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Well, now, do you tell us, and I don't know,

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
do you tell us that it was a violation of the law?

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
A violation of a presidential directive, or a directive for the Secretary of Defense,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
to have subpoenaed before Senator MacArthur's Committee,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
any member of the Lawy of the Board,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
to ascertain why he had cleared,

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
I've what the Senator refers to as a Fifth Amendment Communist.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Well, Mr. Jenkins, I'm not a lawyer,

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
but my understanding of the law was that that would not be an accordance with the existing law,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
directives, and executive orders.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
And you say that it was the exact reason, and for that reason the law,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
that we, the University of Amsterdam,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
was born in Senator MacArthur,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
to bring before him a member of the Lawy of the Board.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Is that right?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
That's right.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
So, I have passed.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Chair, any other questions?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Senator MacArthur?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
Yes, for the sake of accuracy.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
Do you understand the date about which Senate of MacArthur or Mr. Kohn

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
was inquiring with respect to your conversations with members of the Senate,

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
or members of this Committee, with respect to your legs,

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
that imp members of the Law of the Board were subpoenaed,

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
you would issue a smear statement on Mr. Kohn.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
What date was that?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Well, I was on the far east.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
So, when were you in the far east, and when did you get back?

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
I left on the 17th of January, and came back on the 3rd of February.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Then you were not here on the 19th,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
when it was the 21st along the Air January.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Did I say somewhere or January?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
If I said somewhere, if something makes sense.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Let's get a straight out.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I'll tell you this there.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
I was away from 17th of January, to the 3rd of February in the far east.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
All right, that gets straight.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That's all, Mr. Chairman.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I just want to get to that.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Any direction of any members of the Committee, right?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Any direction of any members of the Committee?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Just one question.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
I understood your testimony in response to the Court.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm going to respond to the questions put by the Council, Mr. Jenkins.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
That you felt that on the fight,

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
apparently, from counsel that you could not give the names of the people on the wildly reviewed boy

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
who make them available for testimony.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
That was my understanding.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
Well, then, then later, I was going to agree that this luncheon that you would make them available,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
that the luncheon on February 24th,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
you know, so that wasn't the only one that you can luncheon, not the dinner.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
That wasn't discussed that day as I recall, Senator Jackson.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So I understood that there was an agreement.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Was there not an agreement later to make the names of these people available?

17:25.000 --> 17:34.000
The agreement, as of February 24th, was that after the inspected General's report was complete,

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
that the names of the military personnel who had been connected with the arrest case

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
would be made available to the committee.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
And that, well, not, that would not violate any executive order.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
No, right, would not.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
They would have to, in appearing before the committee, Senator Jackson.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
They would have to testify within the limits of existing executive orders and presidential directives.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
But you're a remake fall-off pilot, and the United States, right?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
That's all.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Senator Simon-Jun?

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
Mr. Haryam, I have no questions, but I'd like to find out if you'd like to make a suggestion.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
You're probably, this is the end of the eighth day, you're going into the ninth day.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm sure you're handling these questions better than I could after eight days, listening to them better.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
Nevertheless, if I may suggest, if you'll answer yes or no,

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
and if you have something additional, let's you would like to say,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I think the hearings would go forward faster.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I'll be glad to try to do that, Senator Simon-Jun.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
All I have to say is that, Mr. Wells?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Nothing, sir.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Mr. Cohn or Senator MacArthur?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I think Mr. Cohn was.

18:47.000 --> 18:54.000
But, to Steven, his nut was not the situation concerning members of the loyal people or the identical

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
to the situation concerning the people who gave special treatments to Perez,

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
in other words, that they must on the law of the year before the committee.

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
And having a year, they may then invoke a presidential directive as to certain questions.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Well, now you're a lawyer and you're giving me, apparently, the answer.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
I would have thought there was some difference, Senator Cohn.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
And I'm sure, Mr. Secretary, you're perfectly free to consult with Mr. Wells,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
and if your counsel wants you, I'm sure it can give you more confidence advice under the night.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
But I would like to agree with you that the fact is exactly the same

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
because I think that will become very important here.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
But I wouldn't think it was the same because the loyalty board is a board

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
and the names that I have agreed to supply to this committee from an Inspector General Report

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
are individual officers operating an individual capacity not as a loyalty board.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Well, sir, I must take to the loyal people at the end.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Can you, with advice of your counsel, cite to me any regulation

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
which gives immunity from the fee to members of a loyal people?

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
Any presidential directive, regulating or anything else,

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
which says that a member of the loyal people need not physically appear

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
before a Senate committee.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
I say that there is no such in this country, and if there is one, I would like to be in white.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Well, we have the right to submit a memorandum to you on the morning

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
and give you the benefit of whatever regulations there are today.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And the month of Mr. J.K. could say about that.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
I'm not a lawyer. I can't close up here in first office.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
As the chair understands it, Mr. Welch and Mr. Sinclair are not necessarily authority.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Authorities on the work department procedure.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
They're here in a special capacity for this hearing.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You might want to consult with a regular counsel.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
The chair will say you may have until the more money to prepare such a memorandum.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
I would ask you to have them present.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And maybe you could put it in the same memorandum, Stephen.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Whether it's not the fact that there is nobody in the United States of America,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
who is immune, and he's citizen of the country who is immune from mis-suppene,

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
to appear, except the President of the United States.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
And maybe they could cover that in the same memorandum.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Chair, I believe you said probably all Mr. Stephen's could competently testify

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
to his advice and counsel as insurvised a warrior part.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Very well. We just do them correct.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
And any event, sir, we do have it as your testimony today.

21:16.000 --> 21:24.000
That Mr. Adams told you when you returned from the pargue that he had gone to various members of this subcommittee

21:24.000 --> 21:32.000
and asked them to prevail upon Senator McCawdy not to subpoena members of this loyalty blog,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
which according to the Senator had cleared comments.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
That's about the way I understood it from Mr. Adams.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
Yes, sir. Now, Mr. Steve, is it not a fact, sir, that in October,

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
a member of the loyalty blog has been subpoenaed by this committee and had appeared

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
without any legal objection as to his appearance having been raised?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I don't know, perhaps that's so.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Did you ever hear the name Sherrod East?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Sherrod East.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Doesn't ring a bell.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Would it, could I refresh your recollection, sir, by telling you,

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
he was a member of your screening blog and that he appeared before our committee

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
in executive session in October of 1953 and testified without any legal objection

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
being exposed as to his physical appearance?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Well, that's your time, he's up, good, odd.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
If I knew about it, that's my mod.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
But, sir, I suggest I spoke to you on the telephone about that from your home.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
You may have.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Could you refresh?

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I don't want to press your on this if you have no recollection.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
Could you refresh your recollection on that olden night, sir?

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
And, probably, I mean, whether or not you telephone me on two things,

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
whether or not you are aware of the fact that Sherrod East, a member of this very

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
saying screening board, had appeared before our committee in October of 1953

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
without any legal objection.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
There was objection, sir, but not legal objection.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
That is physical appearance and whether or not you and I discussed that on the telephone

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
the night of his appearance.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Would you run supply with a copy of the transcript, too, so I could look like it?

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I think that's already been supplied, your office, but we will be happy to supply.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
We will be happy to supply an additional copy.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I think it was October night.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Week ontober night.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Do we have a copy of that here, right?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
We will be very happy to supply a copy of that, dear counsel, sir.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
In fact.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
And then I answer you by the chance to refresh your recollection.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
My question to you, sir, will be if it was proper to do this in October

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
or in January.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
Now, Mr. Stevens, is it not salts, sir, that the security screening board I will throw

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
at that and open up a new topic here, which we think is a considerable importance?

23:41.000 --> 23:48.000
Will you agree with us, sir, that before this committee began its course of

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
the signal call.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Surely, sir.

23:52.000 --> 24:02.000
Before you go into another topic, should I have the Secretary tell me who told you that under

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
the law or presidential regulation members of the loyalty board should not answer to a

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
statement that we should not have a single member of the law or the government.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
The law or presidential regulation members of the loyalty board should not answer to a

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
subpoena.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Who tonight is your friend?

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
Well, I think quite a number of people have discussed quite widely within the department

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
of the Army.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Name one or two would you?

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
Well, I'd say that the judge has a good general's office, but certainly being a thing like

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
that.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I did.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
One.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I'd say that John Martin has no say of the systems within it.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
Mr. Secretary, he has a few specific questions whether or not the judge had the good general's

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
office was or was not in all that end.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
So, a bag.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
Well, I got my advice from a lot of different sources, Mr. Jenkins.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm sure that you answered.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
You haven't answered the question.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
Did or not the judge had good general's opposite bag, you whether or not it was a valid

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
even presidential directive or the law to have subpoena before the McCarthy Committee and

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
member of the law early forward.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
Now, that's a specific question the senator asked and I have repeated it.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
And why would say that they did?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
You say they did.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
And I think that's the direct rancher's center.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Who in the judge has a good general?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I can't give you the name.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Was it done in writing or verbally?

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
I think it was done verbally, although there have been many memorandum written on this whole

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
subject within the department of the army and the department of defense.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
In other words, when we're in a room, we're written to you on this subject of other non-members

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
of the government.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
No, not necessarily the name, but on the whole subject of security that's been a very big and

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
very wide subject until an awful lot of work done by an awful lot of people.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I'm interested in that.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
Speaking of the whole subject of security, it has not been established that Mr. Adams did come

25:56.000 --> 26:05.000
to the centers and tried to induce them to, in turn, either prevail upon me or vote me

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
down, so I could not issue subpoenas to the members of the loyalty board.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
I believe you have stated, not for so many words.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
I believe you have stated that the reason for that was that you felt that having a peer

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
would be a violation of either the law or some presidential directive.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
That was fine.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
I thought that's restricted ourselves and that subject not to the whole people to secure it.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
Have you gotten a memorandum from any of the legal lengths over in the Pentagon?

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
So what's my answer to you?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I'd have to look it up, Senator.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I don't have any here.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
You don't know.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
No, sir.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Do you know who Mr. Adams and so I've asked you?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I think he probably did.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Because he probably did.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah?

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
Now, I think we have to matter up with the Attorney General.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Let's get this...

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
A press to answer clearly my ink.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
I am not speaking now about their rights of someone in the military or any other branch of the government.

27:08.000 --> 27:16.000
If you refuse to answer a certain question, if an answer would violate a rule on everything they were operating,

27:16.000 --> 27:25.000
I am speaking now of the rights of any lean government, any military department, to refuse to honor a subpoena.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
And just say, I will not stop.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
And do I understand that Mr. Adams was here at the end of the table?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Advise you.

27:33.000 --> 27:39.000
That members of the Supreme Board were immune from a subpoena.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Did not have to answer a subpoena under the law.

27:42.000 --> 27:51.000
Now, I wouldn't go that far, but I know that it was a matter of suspicion important, so that while I was in the faries, the matter was taken up with the Attorney General.

27:51.000 --> 27:59.000
Right. Now, before you went to the faries, you met with me and asked me not to call the members of the loyalty board, and said you were turning to do?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I don't recall that.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
Mr. Stevens, didn't you call me up and asked me to meet you over the chair of the irons?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Did we spend about two hours at the heart for that purpose?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Not for that purpose.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Did we discuss that when we were there?

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't recall having discussed that. I remember a number of items that were discussed, but I don't remember that one.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
Did you and I discuss this particular question that we're discussing today?

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
Namely, that you have no authority to order anyone not to appear.

28:27.000 --> 28:36.000
Last they had to answer the subpoena, but when they were before the committee, then they could refuse to answer any question which would violate any order.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
No such conversation with the Caroline before I left for the faries.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
The only place, Mr. Stevens.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
No, sir, I did not.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
You don't recall the weavers discussed it.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I don't recall it.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
I know.

28:47.000 --> 28:54.000
Not certain that I'd think a long time before I'd say that a member of the department of army would not answer a subpoena.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
That's a very serious matter. I would think that would have to answer it.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
The moment your secretary, don't you think that I haven't been chairman of the committee?

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Regardless whether you like or dislike the way I was acting as a chairman.

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
If you felt that we had no power to subpoena members of this whole screening board,

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
that then you should have told me and told me the grounds for that we could have discussed it.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
The matter was taken up with the attorney general.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
It's not in the car, they.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
That's quite the thing for me.

29:23.000 --> 29:31.000
And did the attorney general advise you to prevent members of the screening or loyalty board preparing?

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
I don't know, I was not here, they're not the swell, I was away.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Have you found out since?

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Have I found out since?

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
No, I don't have any first-hand information on that.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
I think maybe Mr. Adams will, but he doesn't.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Good. Good you find out, sir.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Well, do you hear it?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Sure.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
I wonder if you had to.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
Would you search your files and let them know?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Yes, sir.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Now, I'll be in for you this.

30:01.000 --> 30:11.000
Upon your return from the far east, did you ever like that?

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
I believe it has been stated here that at the time you were contacting the Republican members of the committee,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
that the Democrats were not on the committee of that time.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Displace the facts that they were not on the committee.

30:22.000 --> 30:30.000
The administrative items, the contracts, that the Democrats have discussed the full matter with, the shyened matter with.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
You'll have to ask Mr. Adams who we contacted.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I know you saw some members of the committee.

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
Did he tell you that the contacts of the Democrats were not on the committee of that time?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
You'll remember, David.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
He told me the senator that he had contacted the members of this committee, but I don't remember who.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Well, did he tell you, which is I could...

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I can tell you what I did in the way of contacting them.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
I only know now how to transfer them to each of me.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
Well, I think that that is Mr. Adams, that's why I'm at the 2012's.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I told you, not what he did.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
He was your support and that I assume you were forced to.

31:03.000 --> 31:11.000
At the first minute, he told you that the pilot he was trying to keep me from issuing subpoenas for the screening board.

31:11.000 --> 31:19.000
The pilot he was doing that, he also contacted the Democrats' members, but previously they were not on the committee of that time.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Now he didn't tell me that.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
He didn't tell you that. He didn't talk to you about that at home.

31:23.000 --> 31:30.000
The first time has expired, but the chair reminds the members of the committee that our meeting is at 5 o'clock and 3'5'7.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
I think you know the list of invited guests. We'll meet that until 10'30 tomorrow.

31:38.000 --> 31:45.000
And so we come to the end of the 8th day of testimony in these hearings with the end, don't wear a sight.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
In fact, the witness still on the stand is Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens,

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
the first of the six principals in this affair to testify.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
This raid, the hearings quit drag on for weeks.

31:58.000 --> 32:07.000
Today we've heard more concern and more talk from the members of the committee about the slowness of the hearings, the almost endless repetition.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
But seemingly, no one has found a way yet to overcommon it and speed up the process.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
However, the committees, the principals and their attorneys are meeting in an executive session in a few minutes now.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Within the next half hour and a half.

32:22.000 --> 32:33.000
And at this closed door meeting, some sort of urgent steps will be sought to prevent the hearings from dragging on to the utter exhaustion of everyone.

32:35.000 --> 32:49.000
Today, when Secretary Stevens was on the stand, he denied ever heard, having heard anything, about a threat allegedly made to Roy M. Cohn, Senator McCarthy's committee counsel.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
By his, Stevens counsel, John G. Adams.

32:54.000 --> 33:03.000
Senator McCarthy alleged that Adams threatened to have Cohn charged with misconduct if Cohn attempted to subpoena for the committee.

33:03.000 --> 33:12.000
Certain witnesses to tell why various alleged verses that Fort Markman were given loyalty clearances.
