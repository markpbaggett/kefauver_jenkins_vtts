WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
He was done by studying my notes.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
By studying notes to me.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Final of the director of legislative liaison.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
By interviewing me.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
By interviewing other officials.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
By interviewing Mr. Steven.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
And by attempting to put together

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
into the chronicle for you received.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
That doesn't matter.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
This time, had or not, your relationship with Mr. Cohns.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Throw the theory that you were having no more communication.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Froming.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Well.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Mr. Cohn was on vacation in Florida.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
During that week, accepting for the day,

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
which it seemed to me as though he had come back on about Monday the 19th.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
And the time we're talking about us now is the 23rd.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
And from the 23rd of January until about Lincoln's birthday or Valentine's Day,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
one of those days in February, I had no further conversation with him until I initiated a call with two of him.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
To act the way I hadn't seen him.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I would ask you what you call him as we understand.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
That's right.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
And along about the 22nd of February.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
No sir, I think around the 12th of January.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
The 12th to the 14th of February.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And the purpose of that was to sign that from Mr. Cohn,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
why you had no call from him.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
That's right.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
That's right.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Now let's you whether or not honor about February 5th.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
You call Mr. Cohns.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
The calls to you.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yes I guess.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Well, it's not again.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, I have not seen one call from him.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, I think that's much qualified.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
The call that sends him a kindly department.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I am not sure what's to me.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I don't think it was.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
He called Send him a kindly.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Iowa's president Send him a kindly cookie on the phone.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I got it off.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Send him a kindly completed conversation.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
What did you call him as Mr. Cohns key on the fifth?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yes, that I did.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I called.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Why did you do that?

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Well, during the previous week, Mr. Cohns had encouraged me on a number of occasions.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
The talk to Cohns.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
He had pointed out to me that the Send him a kindly was not by now very angry with the Army

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
or the beginning to the ease.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
This was the time of the correct incident, which occurred on the first chamberman.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm sad.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Please tell us a minute.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
What Mr. Cohns you told you are said to you on the fifth day of February.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
On the fifth of February, I call Mr. Cohns to be at very long conversation.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
My record indicates he talked to 49 minutes.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I read to him a first draft.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
So they let her wish I had prepared.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
There's nobody that could get approval, which we were contemplating,

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
which I was going to submit to the secretary for forwarding Send him a kindly and respond

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
to his inquiry with the Department of Direct.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
That draft incidentally was never sent to the sentry office.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And back to his practically extract.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
But in any of that, we had a considerable conversation on that matter.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Then the subject of Shine came up.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
Mr. Cohns, he pointed out to me that Shine was an outboard and he had been a camp board.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Since about first of February.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
And that there was a course 95, which was ready to start very shortly.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
And that Shine wanted to get into it.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
That would be the CID school.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
And the list there ordinarily aren't entitled to go until the second age leads to the basis.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And Shine was in the first year.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
And he suggested that I get Shine's sign to that course 95.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And he said, I will move in.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
And I'll be able to, I put up the exact word.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
I don't see if I can't withdraw this document's pressure on the Army that someone's been in the front.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
I'll leave the list.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
And I was in the telephone conference.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Communication regularly was with cars during this occasion.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And he kept urging me again.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
He talked for it at the call scheme.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
He pointed out that he was in the call scheme.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
He said, they should be controlled about something.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
He isn't controlled to get mad.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
And he said, he's got a great deal of influence with Senators.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And he said, do you want to talk to him?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
You want to talk to him.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
So, as the number time he was gone, as it is this time, he was on a long schedule out in the West.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
And many nights, everybody in the South Dakota in the South, in the Pacific, and some facing Texas, in the Pacific area, about ten or so days.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
So I called to call to you again on this level, and said, everybody.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
On this occasion, we talked for a long time again.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Mr. David again, Mr. Scott, we didn't need that.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
If we were to find Shine before 95, he would rule in and stop this investigation.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I told Mr. Stevens about this call.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
I stated to him that I'd been urged to call to call to him, and I had made the call.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And Mr. Scott, he had made this offer.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Mr. Stevens made this as an instruction for me.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
And that instruction was to see through it that Shine completed with eight weeks of face-to-face before anything happened to him.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
And eight weeks, this was positively preclude in the mattering course 95.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Mr. Stevens was sufficiently concerned about this, so that a few hours after he issued the instruction to me,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
to see that this was done, he issued the statement instruction to a day.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
And so that the instruction reached for the NL people to two sources.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
On the 16th of February, I talked to Mr. Scott to see again.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
They are not too cold, and are too cold.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
I telephone him again on the same source of persuasion that he should talk to the call.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
I asked you when and not on the 16th of February, you talked to Mr. Scott to fight.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I did, sir.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
I talked to him for the first time, at 13 minutes when my interphone rang from the secretary asked me to come to his office,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
so I terminated him on the station.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
That was red, red early in the day, and a few hours later, I received a return call from Mr. Scott.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Well, what was said in the first conversation by Mr. Scott?

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Well, I do not illuminate between the first and second conversation, I am not sure that I can.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
If you will give me a moment, I'll check and know what you do.

06:03.000 --> 06:13.000
I will be back.

06:13.000 --> 06:23.000
While Mr. Adams is referring to these notes and looking them up, it's our opportunity to return to our studios across the country to permit our patients to identify themselves.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
This is ABC Television Network.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
Tomorrow night, class television theater brings you one of the truly great dramatic hours on television.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
A fine play with a fine cat. Watch for the little camelman on your screen.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
When you see him, you know you can count on an hour of enjoyment, with your favorite players and the featured roles.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Watch class television theater tomorrow night.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
This is Anita Calder reminding you that today's Pepsi-Cola is reducing calories.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Refresh without feeling. How do Pepsi-C?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Well, by Mr. Adams' system, it's the shine would not have had a course 95.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
For that long.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
During one of these conversations, one of the three, the call keeps saying, you just have to use common sense.

07:06.000 --> 07:15.000
He said, just take care of this course 95. I pointed out to him that taking care of not a shine in course 95 would have nothing because the ultimate objective.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
You supired I could say what New York, and if there had to be New York and if there wasn't New York, there would have been a real problem.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
And the call keeps saying, one thing at a time, take care of this course 95.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Take care of that. And I will move you in and out, so you can think about it.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
And you are on the same day to say that he was copy investigation.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
He indicated that he was able to get sent to the McCarthy and to seek the abuse of the army.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
The word is mine of our enemy. He gives copy investigations. He indicated today.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
When the military gave a phone call.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
He said that if you did not assign shine to course 95, it may take two years.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
That is right. That is right.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Is that correct? Yes sir.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Is that the last conversation you ever had with the minister of the County?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Yes sir. I think it is. I have no record of any else.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
The madam's address, he says, tell the committee what occurred in a meeting on February 18th.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
That is a meeting of the committee.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
There is an incident of February 12th before I came to discuss first.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
I called this phone by long distance phone to New York.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I told him that I felt that he had been talking to me.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Some were afraid of that. Why have I not seen you?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
In the pipeline, who would you be dealing with with the committee?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
You would be dealing with the association. You would feel that the association is going on.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I am calling you to the State Council.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
And the government, to the fact that I had gone to the State of Senators,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
would become the hitherto-tension. If he didn't like, I thought that I still had an emergency phone.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
On April 18th, he said to me that he thought that I had been the panel.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
And the public honestly had a room to go in the State of Senators.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
And that's the reason he wasn't seen.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
I did not see him until the 18th February.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
On the 18th February, I was in New York.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
I had received telephone requests there so earlier that I seemed that General Booker appeared for me.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
And that he appeared for me for interrogation.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Matters having to do with the rest of the charge,

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
I went first to cancel my way to New York.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
I called on General Booker. We talked generally about existing regulations,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
the executive order, and the responsibility the government has to pay them.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
And what could not be released to a congressional committee having to do with borrowing, to be united?

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
Now, when I was New York that night, next day,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
there was an open hearing in the morning.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
I think it's the day on which the rest of the public will interrogate.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
And on the afternoon, there was an executive session.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
In the executive session,

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
I picked a gang with an interrogation of intelligence officer that came to me,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
with General Booker, and was interrogated.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I was in charge of the interrogation.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
I had printed it down to the floor of the table so that I would stay near to the officers.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I picked up a record before I was told.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
What I was saying to him is,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
become an executive leader after his question.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
But the janitor asked him a question as to whether or not he had been struck.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Nothing answered certain questions having to do with oil.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
The officer answered in the negative, he said he had not been struck.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
And at that moment, the janitor was about to court at me and I said,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I think it wouldn't stand.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I just did.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
The officer was still on the stand.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
He then ordered me to hand him out.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I think it's a correct word.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
I just stand up, raise my hand and be warned.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
I point out to him that I was there as a guest at the committee.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
I was in a clear room with Secretary of the Army, and I asked him not to be warned.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
He ordered me again.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
I'm a vacationer and I asked him if I could have permission to get instructions from Secretary of the Army.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
He thought for a moment and agreed that I told him.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
He stepped back from the table and walked out of the room for a moment with one of his men.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
He came back into the room and stated that there is no room for that.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Nobody can be in the room excepting with it.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
There were about five Army people with me, all of whom by that room were ordered in the room.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
He said, Comfor can not be present with a court of me from the room.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
And there were five prosecutors there who walked on the road and I know.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
And immediately, Comfor was at a within a few moments.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
General Victor was interrogated with some of his included interrogation of the intelligence officer and then interrogated General Victor.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
And the incident having to do with General Victor was interrogated with him.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Sir, the interrogation I already know was made.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
So I took points to the hearing.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
I approached Arthur. He was addicted from the hearing.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Otherwise, he never knew.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
So I took points that I said, or not he speaks a bit to Com.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I did this.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
I asked Mr. Com, how I could arrange to get some of my audio with the law.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
He said, the thing that I could no longer be present as I am a counsel and I am also being interrogated.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
He said, I have no other option I could do with Mr. Carr or talk to the cops.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And...

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Well, they do not, you talk to Mr. Carr.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I talk to Carr.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I have no other choice.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Unless you were there not that was owner of March the 5th when you talk to Mr. Carr.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Yes, sir.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
I said, I think something went to that.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
There were other occasions when I talked to him.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I talked to Mr. Carr.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
There was an open meeting with his committee in Room 3.5, 7.

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
Sometimes around the 27th or 28th of February went private to the Louis-Saint.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And rather than being to you, we were interrogated.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
I think he's down and remember that meeting.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
And I saw a host of Mr. Cohen with his car on the medication.

13:12.000 --> 13:21.000
He had a phone and we had no matter why, Grinson was about the status of our relationship.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
And I don't think that I saw Mr. Cohen again until I don't think that I saw him again.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I talked to him to him more socially.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
I did see Mr. Carr again in cell phone meetings after the first of March.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
I wanted to do a day meeting and say to the committee with more anxious feelings.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
One day he came up and seen finally on the fourth of March.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
I agreed that I would come up and have lunch with him on the following day.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
It was a successful March.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
And he thought that it would be better if we didn't have a year to do this.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I think that you're going with him down.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
So we agreed that we would go to the go-to lunch at the message of the show and draw some treats.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
And we did have lunch together on that day.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
And on that occasion, on the car, he said that he was making progress.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
He didn't say how, what's the what means.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
And he said that he was a conciliation, not a conciliation, but him.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
And he was in trouble and he was reducing the amount of fire against the committee.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
He was about the substance of it.

14:22.000 --> 14:31.000
And a great part of the luncheon was given over to conversations with Mr. Carr State of the city.

14:31.000 --> 14:40.000
As he had on numerous other occasions, that he felt that I should understand that as long as the flames of the shine,

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
was not satisfactory to Mr. O. and the Army of the Intercontinental Committee of trouble.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
And this was very similar to other conversations we had had.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
The conversation we had on the train, on the November relationship.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
And he said he thought I should understand that.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Mr. Carr, I don't think he told you that almost.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
He was a conciliation.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, he, he constantly emphasized the fact once that he had no personal interest in shine.

15:11.000 --> 15:19.000
But that, he felt that the Army should be aware of the fact that as long as it's a shine,

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
the statement did not suit home that the Army was in trouble with its committee.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
And he had no personal interest in shine.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
He made that clear.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
But if you could give advice to me in a friendly way, if your advice was these,

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
you take care of this matter and you will get some investigation from your next.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
That was just a conversation.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
And that was the position that he consisted of.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
I felt that he was an agent.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
And that he was making these points for me, not necessarily because he's been directed to tell this man this today.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
But that his principle has his attitude and he saw what the matter was doing.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
And I felt that he just had his own pressures.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I just appeared there would have been no car crashers.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Of course you knew Mr. Carr was the director of the committee that you not miss that.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I knew Mr. Carr was the staff director and Mr. Cohn was the chief counsel.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
I met the editor-in-chief, both of you, being ejected from this meeting in New York on January on February 8th.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
And you stated that that time that there were five spectators who were likewise ejected.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Yes, that's correct.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Yes, sir.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Can you identify those five spectators or any of them?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
I cannot identify them.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
I saw one woman who was a mongoose ejected that day in this hearing for the first day.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
She was talking to Mr. Buckley, a member of the committee staff.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I have never seen this in her.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
But I saw her in New York twice when I recognized her face and she was here.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm quite sure of it with her same person.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I do not know who they were.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
There were three women who seemed to be together and two men who seemed to be together several times.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Yes, sir.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
What's enough?

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
We understand that that was the executive hearing.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Yes, but that was not unusual.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
There was usually spectators in the executive hearing.

17:06.000 --> 17:17.000
Mr. Evans, you have read this statement made by Secretary Steven on the opening day.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
That is, this is the statement that you're not.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Yes, sir.

17:21.000 --> 17:31.000
Do you recall that in that statement there is an allegation that the Army that is used and Mr. Stevens received

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
no less than 65 telephone calls from the McCarthy Committee with reference, specific reference.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
The G. David Chien.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I remember that.

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
I met in a dictionary that were 19 personal contacts in which conversations were directed to Chien.

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
Listen, I will ask you whether or not you assist the Secretary in compiling those figures.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I did not say.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
You are your own knowledge.

18:02.000 --> 18:09.000
Know how many calls were placed directly used with reference to Chien or how many calls you made.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Do you wish Chien and Mayne was mentioned?

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Our thumb request was made with reference to Chien.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
I wouldn't have it yesterday, Mr. Jenkins.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
The right state is doing that serious.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
From the 10th of November to the 9th of December, I was speculated that there was a call of a day

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
and at least half of the calls were confirmed signed.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
And I think that that continued through January until the time the Lord of the Lord was made.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
I have not attempted to make such a realistic situation because my call by the money is,

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
and I am not able to isolate which calls as there might have been, you would say,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
there were no references to Chien.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I was patient.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
That is worth very much.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
A matter in my mind, on the occasion of practically every telephone call from Mr. Cohn,

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
I constantly expect it to come up and it's called a day.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Particularly on the call, it seemed my home, which there are 15 of these I have a record

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and probably our others.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
It was a very complex conversation.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I saw my camera on many occasions.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I mean, are you through business?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Yes, sir.

19:22.000 --> 19:31.000
I'm as bad as I have consumed the days in a direct examination of you with respect to the Army's charge

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
of these undue efforts made on behalf of Chien.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Before concluding my direct examination, I want to ask you this one question.

19:40.000 --> 19:48.000
You are well aware of the charges made by Mr. Stevens and by yourself against the Shenatumacardian effect.

19:48.000 --> 19:57.000
In addition to what you have prescribed in response to my direct and specific questions,

19:57.000 --> 20:09.000
are there any other facts you now care to relate to this committee bearing on the charges made by you and Mr. Stevens against the Shenatumacardian and the U.C. Committee?

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't wish by answering you in a negative detail.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
There are no other issues in this presentation because during the course of your interrogation,

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
I'm sure that I will, because there will be other reasons that come to my attention.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
But are there any others you think of at this time?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
There are none that I think of at this time, sir.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
May I address the chance?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Yes.

20:31.000 --> 20:38.000
Chairman, I have been in very good use of that in the direct way, always consuming due entire sessions.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
I now desire, of course, to cross examine the pheasants, but it is practical for 30.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
There is no more than that, sir.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
There is no more to examine these two, but we leave them.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
And then the government got the examination in one of the recent events.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Thank you.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You can reach out to the office.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
It's kind of a lot.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Come on, one.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
If you'd like to have a chairman, Modenao, Committee for Holders.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Next session has Jennifer.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Tomorrow morning.
