WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
By the way, after time worth to get.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.840
All his dreams will even try to do so both he at work.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.200
You will get to meet your car.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.640
How will you get to meet your from Fort Worth?

00:15.400 --> 00:16.200
Like that.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.080
Like how?

00:17.080 --> 00:18.760
Here's how, is that right?

00:18.960 --> 00:19.960
I don't know whenever you can.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.600
I picked them up a couple of times.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.200
I think it's rather picked them up a couple of times.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.960
Oh, Mr. Cohen, if you go down to Dixon,

00:26.960 --> 00:28.320
pick him up a time or two.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.320
Yes, sir.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.320
And one driver drives back to New York.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.320
Yes, sir.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.320
How far is there?

00:34.320 --> 00:35.320
In Marl?

00:35.320 --> 00:36.320
Yes.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.320
I know, fifty-seven.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.320
Picking how long?

00:39.320 --> 00:41.320
About an hour and a half, right?

00:41.320 --> 00:44.320
Now, I don't think two hours will be enough.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.320
You've been idle enough about the New York

00:48.320 --> 00:50.320
to know what stuff to get that one.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.320
And now what?

00:51.320 --> 00:53.320
I was thinking of that, so it's a feeling ticket to my people.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.320
And then, so that means four hours,

00:56.320 --> 00:58.320
to drive from next to New York to the back.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.320
Is that right?

00:59.320 --> 01:00.320
Yes, sir.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.320
And you didn't do any works in the car?

01:01.320 --> 01:03.320
We were sort of going back in the car.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.320
Oh, and I had no doubt that it.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.320
Now, isn't it the spec?

01:07.320 --> 01:09.320
If you're not guessing,

01:09.320 --> 01:12.320
tell your family, explain it to them.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.320
Okay, go around, but we'll turn to our studio to come.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.320
Wait, am I right?

01:22.320 --> 01:24.320
Don't you hesitate?

01:24.320 --> 01:25.320
Come to the left.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.320
Yes, sir.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.320
Make the call.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.320
Isn't it a fact?

01:30.320 --> 01:32.320
It's like that, all.

01:32.320 --> 01:38.320
Mr. Call Newmarker had a burning ambition

01:38.320 --> 01:44.320
to keep his absence from this to the absolute minimum this is us.

01:44.320 --> 01:50.320
Well, I have an ambition, certainly, so it's supposed to be a rank in which Mr. Teevin's

01:50.320 --> 01:52.320
could work out and I think that's not kept.

01:52.320 --> 02:00.320
However, he was gone much earlier than I thought it was.

02:00.320 --> 02:06.320
Now, I think my, uh, the way we thought it was going to be,

02:06.320 --> 02:10.320
I think it was going to be a very good time.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.320
I think it was going to be a very good time.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.320
I think it was going to be a very good time.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.320
Not so early, though.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.320
No, I think my, uh, the way we thought it was going to be about our probably

02:20.320 --> 02:24.320
would be within the rank of the Secretary Teevin's help and good enough to make one

02:24.320 --> 02:28.320
which he said was not going to say was due to change.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.320
Well, I think time and time will answer Mr. Call Newmarker.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.320
Did you have a real ambition?

02:33.320 --> 02:38.320
If you'd try to find out, perhaps, you'd just come back to the absolute minimum.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.320
Uh, may I have to know?

02:40.320 --> 02:45.320
My answer to it is yes, we did not, uh, one of talking on the rank of Mr. Teevin's

02:45.320 --> 02:49.320
help was proper and which would enable him to go to training at the same time.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.320
Well, it, it, you just couldn't possibly go beyond that range,

02:52.320 --> 02:54.320
but that's the maximum limit.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.320
I would think that's the maximum.

02:55.320 --> 02:59.320
I would think there's a minimum or a maximum, and that was it.

02:59.320 --> 03:04.320
Now, Mr. Call, is it a fact that on the occasion,

03:04.320 --> 03:08.320
so if you would leave, go down and take the muffin, went back to New York,

03:08.320 --> 03:12.320
and then just to work, and throw you on and go back,

03:12.320 --> 03:18.320
that you could at least have had four more hours of honest work with signs.

03:18.320 --> 03:25.320
If you would walk into the room, the general iron already had better side for you.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.320
It's better on a little card on your chairs and going to the...

03:28.320 --> 03:30.320
You know.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.320
You don't think you would have stayed for a...

03:32.320 --> 03:33.320
No, I don't.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.320
Well, would you go with me for five days,

03:36.320 --> 03:39.320
would you say you might have stayed for three hours?

03:39.320 --> 03:40.320
No.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.320
All one hour?

03:42.320 --> 03:45.320
You just think you didn't say anything?

03:45.320 --> 03:48.320
Couldn't have stayed anything by working with you?

03:48.320 --> 03:51.320
No, I think we did it in the most expensive, expensive way.

03:51.320 --> 03:56.320
Honestly, this is called, you want this room for benefit to believe

03:56.320 --> 03:59.320
that you couldn't have stayed for hours of driving.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.320
If you just had to have time on the worst act, that's where you'll have time.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.320
Well, that would have meant I suppose that I had a...

04:07.320 --> 04:10.320
Thanks a lot, there was a lot of material from which we worked.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.320
That's number one.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.320
You could keep it at 6, couldn't you?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.320
That's what I meant.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.320
You could keep it at 6.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.320
I thought it could not.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.320
Where were you keeping?

04:18.320 --> 04:19.320
I kept it in my house.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.320
At your home.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.320
Anything that could be kept at your home,

04:22.320 --> 04:24.320
could be kept locked up in the room at 6.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.320
You could have gone.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.320
No, I wouldn't say so.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
Hey, what's this phone?

04:33.320 --> 04:36.320
No, we worked on the transcripts of the hearing to work from a...

04:37.320 --> 04:39.320
No, we're bound booked there.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.320
We're bound bound.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.320
Fuller loop pamphlets.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.320
We worked from executive session testimony.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.320
And you have to be booked?

04:45.320 --> 04:47.320
Yes, I just have to be.

04:47.320 --> 04:51.320
We worked from a file, from no supply fee tax,

04:51.320 --> 04:54.320
and from file to fee tax.

04:54.320 --> 04:58.320
And if we were to work at 6, we can't, I didn't know what facility they were welcome.

04:58.320 --> 05:02.320
I think down there overnight, I just didn't have any attention to doing that.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.320
But you mean that after didn't work in any way,

05:05.320 --> 05:06.320
anything in it for you?

05:06.320 --> 05:08.320
Certainly the greatest thing for me,

05:08.320 --> 05:10.320
the whole thing was, and the whole thing was,

05:10.320 --> 05:12.320
the whole thing was for me.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.320
They were welcome.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.320
I think not.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.320
I think not there.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.320
I want to go down and say overnight at 4.6.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.320
You're right.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.320
Did you ever try to divide,

05:21.320 --> 05:23.320
of turning you remember land in a distance,

05:23.320 --> 05:27.320
having a either a machine or a sonar

05:27.320 --> 05:28.320
for taking after to a house?

05:28.320 --> 05:29.320
No, so we just...

05:29.320 --> 05:31.320
No matter what ever, what scene was it?

05:31.320 --> 05:33.320
No, I can't say else.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.320
I think we decided three years ago,

05:36.320 --> 05:38.320
and again, that we would not,

05:38.320 --> 05:39.320
for the purpose of the scene,

05:39.320 --> 05:42.320
we would not spend through the mail two days

05:42.320 --> 05:44.320
or if the camp was working properly,

05:44.320 --> 05:47.320
might not have been met.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.320
Now some of the work in New York,

05:49.320 --> 05:50.320
you say, was running your home?

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
Yes, it was.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.320
And some of them here at home?

05:52.320 --> 05:53.320
Yes, most of them are.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.320
Most of them are in New York.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.320
And when you were out there?

05:57.320 --> 05:59.320
I think he worked at his office on a paper trip.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.320
At his office?

06:00.320 --> 06:01.320
Yes, sir.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.320
Were you with him there?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.320
On a case in my wallet, on a case in other places.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.320
Did you have any files there?

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
Yes.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.320
And if you had any files,

06:07.320 --> 06:09.320
then it's time for us to get up.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.320
Yes, we had some there.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.320
Yes.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.320
Well, couldn't those files of the message?

06:13.320 --> 06:16.320
Well, if I am to be honest,

06:16.320 --> 06:19.320
you want to say that we have moved everything down a date,

06:19.320 --> 06:21.320
but I could have moved down a date,

06:21.320 --> 06:22.320
and you say there,

06:22.320 --> 06:24.320
no, I suppose that would have been one way of doing it.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
Was it all?

06:25.320 --> 06:26.320
I didn't do it that way,

06:26.320 --> 06:28.320
and I didn't see any reason why I could have some.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.320
You see the importance of keeping it to sound

06:31.320 --> 06:33.320
that pieces of the minimum, don't you?

06:33.320 --> 06:35.320
No, sir, I don't see the importance of where you put it up.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.320
It involved him, also, with the eighth Sunday.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.320
When he'd be around doing nothing,

06:40.320 --> 06:42.320
and I didn't see anything that would come from me

06:42.320 --> 06:45.320
to go down a little bit before it took.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.320
Did you always work all of every Sunday?

06:48.320 --> 06:51.320
I can't say we always work all of any day, sir.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.320
Did you always work a part of any Sunday?

06:53.320 --> 06:55.320
I think that's true, I think we did.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.320
You always did a part, yes sir.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.320
If you had some files that this year's Shine Home,

06:59.320 --> 07:03.320
then your files are divided as follows.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.320
Part of your home, is that right?

07:05.320 --> 07:06.320
Yes sir.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.320
Part of Shine Home?

07:07.320 --> 07:08.320
Yes sir.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.320
Part of Shine's office.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.320
Yes sir.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.320
Did it strike you, Mr. Cohn,

07:13.320 --> 07:16.320
that that wasn't somewhat awkward

07:16.320 --> 07:18.320
and not too affectionate arrangements?

07:18.320 --> 07:20.320
No, sir, we did the best we could with it.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.320
I understand what we should do if you worked a while

07:22.320 --> 07:25.320
at your home and needed the file that was the Shine Home.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.320
We worked a while at my home and needed something in his home

07:28.320 --> 07:31.320
and go down and get it for the next day.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.320
On my last meet-over-mitch by five minutes.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.320
Five minutes.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.320
And if you wanted something, it is offered.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.320
If it's five minutes, the file's there, then why?

07:39.320 --> 07:41.320
For the same thing.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
A file over test.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
That's it.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.320
That's for me.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.320
Walk it in on it.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.320
On it's hard.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.320
On it's hard.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.320
Walking on it's hard.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.320
If I thought, if I thought,

07:51.320 --> 07:53.320
well it may be somewhat cumbersome,

07:53.320 --> 07:55.320
nothing's about to be filed in the file

07:55.320 --> 07:57.320
and to see each that way, didn't it?

07:57.320 --> 07:59.320
No, sir, there was nothing to come from about the mess.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.320
We got the work done.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.320
I'm here here.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.320
About ten minutes, Mr. Lowe.

08:14.320 --> 08:19.320
Do I hold in my hand, Mr. Fowell,

08:19.320 --> 08:21.320
and if you recognize it from that distance,

08:21.320 --> 08:23.320
the work that was done,

08:23.320 --> 08:26.320
you hold in your hand, you hold in your hand,

08:26.320 --> 08:28.320
sorry, it's least on paper,

08:28.320 --> 08:33.320
staring on the three intern reports with sign health rights,

08:33.320 --> 08:36.320
plus the instructions of the annual recovery property health rights.

08:36.320 --> 08:40.320
There's an explanation of sorts that each of the papers,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.320
I gave it to Mr. Jankin's staff,

08:42.320 --> 08:43.320
and I'll be glad to give it to you.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.320
I don't know how to handle this from this distance.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
I didn't know it was going to be well.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.320
But you probably know it's not.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.320
Can you recognize the documents that I now hold up?

08:53.320 --> 08:54.320
Yes, sir.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.320
What is that document?

08:56.320 --> 09:01.320
That's a preliminary report,

09:01.320 --> 09:06.320
but it became the intern report of the Subcommittee entitled

09:06.320 --> 09:10.320
State Department's information sentence,

09:10.320 --> 09:13.320
but with one of the things done at the beginning.

09:13.320 --> 09:19.320
That had six papers that I turned them over.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.320
What about the insurance?

09:21.320 --> 09:22.320
Who wrote that?

09:22.320 --> 09:23.320
I believe they've signed it.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.320
At what time?

09:24.320 --> 09:25.320
I don't know.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.320
My insurance inductance?

09:27.320 --> 09:29.320
I don't know, it might very well have been written paper that?

09:29.320 --> 09:31.320
No, I can't say that.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.320
The first document I take up is one that he might very well have done

09:35.320 --> 09:38.320
before the inductance.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.320
You recognize this document?

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
Yes, sir.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.320
But it's that.

09:45.320 --> 09:50.320
That's the draft of the local American engineering project

09:50.320 --> 09:53.320
entitled Paper, Subtitle, Paper West,

09:53.320 --> 09:58.320
Paper East, which will prepare for somebody else on the staff

09:58.320 --> 10:01.320
and the whole set, we said the board was having

10:01.320 --> 10:03.320
signed to the job.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.320
That draft was submitted to the Senate of the Mk5C.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.320
He went over it, I think, to find some of his notifications on it.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.320
And some extra form for it.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.320
The every authority, the intern, didn't say that was not found the way he wanted it done.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.320
We then spoke to the gentleman who had written it and he said that

10:18.320 --> 10:21.320
we have been placing an impossible burden on him because he was not

10:21.320 --> 10:24.320
with the committee when the investigation was conducted,

10:24.320 --> 10:28.320
signed, why, signed, knew the facts, let him write the report.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.320
Or, if the draft is signed in the Mk5C,

10:30.320 --> 10:32.320
it's been questioned by gay, black, black, black,

10:32.320 --> 10:34.320
blue, shine, and using that and other things.

10:34.320 --> 10:38.320
He wrote up the draft of that paper West, Paper East, and four.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.320
So, Mr. Doc, you've been through the draft.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
I'll hold in my hand.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.320
I'll hold it down.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.320
It's 19 pages in length.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.320
It's not done by sign at all.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
No, it's not.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.320
That was a document.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.320
What was rejected in the first time?

10:49.320 --> 10:51.320
I'm not even a bank.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.320
I'm not getting much good.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.320
I'm not good.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.320
Good.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.320
Good.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.320
Good.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
Good.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.320
Good.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.320
Good.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.320
Good.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.320
Good.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.320
Good.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.320
Good.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.320
Good.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.320
Good.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.320
Good.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.320
Good.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.320
Good.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.320
The next document that I hold in my hand can be recognized

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
from that distance, Kenneth.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
Yes, sir.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.320
What is that?

11:16.320 --> 11:22.320
That's there is a part of one of the final drafts for the annual

11:22.320 --> 11:24.320
report of this book committee.

11:24.320 --> 11:28.320
This I observed her 23 pages.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
That's only a part.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.320
I think the actual draft has about 75 pages.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.320
What we find in the file that can produce it.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.320
Yes, sir.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.320
I'm not the particular drafts.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.320
See about, I don't know, whatever they are.

11:41.320 --> 11:45.320
And on the front page is some handwriting which I take to be

11:45.320 --> 11:46.320
signed.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.320
Is that right or am I incorrect?

11:47.320 --> 11:48.320
No, you're right, that's right.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.320
Yes.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.320
It's a work of time to inspire and questions at my right.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.320
Any questions at my left?

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
I'll go in my file.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.320
Send it out.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.320
I'm working.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.320
It's strong.

12:01.320 --> 12:06.320
I was thinking about the convenience of working

12:06.320 --> 12:08.320
at 4.00 a.m.

12:08.320 --> 12:14.320
You know, in fifth and fifth you have your own way to work.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.320
To prepare me this.

12:16.320 --> 12:21.320
If the subject of Mr. Stingling's conversation with Mr.

12:21.320 --> 12:25.320
Schaden, far not so much on his first.

12:25.320 --> 12:30.320
The telephone conversation in which he mentioned it, he wanted to use

12:30.320 --> 12:34.320
the lives of his own new totalitarian design, had aventually

12:34.320 --> 12:37.320
distributed, starting with the triminer, finished line to the

12:37.320 --> 12:38.320
tentative column.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.320
So would you have moved your office to the tentative column with?

12:41.320 --> 12:43.320
I would not have started now.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.320
So.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.320
Well, I guess I'm going to begin.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.320
I was telling you this.

12:49.320 --> 12:54.320
I think third time, but you say that the triminer is not prepared

12:54.320 --> 12:55.320
for the first thing.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.320
Is that right?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.320
What he did with this was the well.

12:58.320 --> 13:03.320
He wrote, I think he primarily wrote 304 sections in that time.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.320
He worked on the entire document.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.320
That's right. He was before he landed in the army.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.320
No, I think that was after that.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.320
You mean to say that there are three assault paragraphs in this document

13:14.320 --> 13:21.320
with Ty Hold, Mr. Kine prepared after he went into the Army?

13:21.320 --> 13:25.320
Yes, I think that they're not part of the, so it was divided into sections.

13:25.320 --> 13:30.320
There are two or three sections of real floor, which it occurs to me.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.320
He did.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.320
He worked on it.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.320
Well, a lot of them appear in what I hold here to me.

13:36.320 --> 13:41.320
Yes, I think he probably gets, what you have there is,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.320
it's a numbing of their form of work.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.320
That's pretty close to the one of the final three.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.320
Well, I'd like to know if there were, whether or not Mr. Kone or Mr. Kine

13:51.320 --> 13:54.320
actually wrote any part of what I hold in my hand.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.320
It's not contained.

13:55.320 --> 14:01.320
The assault contains the assault section on the engineering project

14:01.320 --> 14:06.320
on the information panel and the information agency

14:06.320 --> 14:14.320
properly answered which he would yes that if it wasn't the answer to it, I don't know.

14:14.320 --> 14:30.320
If I tell you that I can go over and do not find a man that you mentioned,

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
I can.

14:31.320 --> 14:38.320
I can tell you, you might have a little bit of a story to tell whether that's what it is.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.320
I would have had a little bit of a look at it.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.320
I can't tell you the truth.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.320
I'm out of here.

14:42.320 --> 14:51.320
I might not be picking up in my mind to be true or you come out.

14:51.320 --> 15:05.320
I'm in Council Welk, who's now leading Mr. Kone through a series of questions on the work

17:06.320 --> 17:07.320
of the

17:08.320 --> 17:08.320


17:08.320 --> 17:08.320


17:08.320 --> 17:08.320


17:08.320 --> 17:10.320
whatever it is there, it was a uh...

17:10.320 --> 17:13.320
it's very close to that, with an outline, with uh...

17:13.320 --> 17:20.320
private time and I threw up, originally before we started napping out these still-in-term reports.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.320
When is originally?

17:21.320 --> 17:25.320
I think that will probably, middle November and just November.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.320
Something like that.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.320
When did you really...

17:29.320 --> 17:32.320
Well, in the box you would call your report writing space.

17:32.320 --> 17:38.320
I was told September was the principal month or not and the first-of-the-week event.

17:38.320 --> 17:43.320
November 15th is the first-of-the-week event for I was told to go into the report writing space.

17:43.320 --> 17:47.320
Well, I would say you're right that it was certainly the work that was intensified.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.320
Say, uh...

17:48.320 --> 17:54.320
Wednesday, December and the first-of-week event in January, I think all the reports finally got out in October

17:54.320 --> 17:57.320
on the 24th, 26th of January.

17:57.320 --> 18:08.320
Now I'm just told I hold in my hand the work product of Mr. Stein that was handed by Mr. Horowitz, is that right?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.320
What's the covering?

18:10.320 --> 18:12.320
The covering of the period while it was the fourth day.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.320
Yes, sir.

18:13.320 --> 18:20.320
And after you're having examined it, we find cases 16, 17 and 18,

18:20.320 --> 18:24.320
four and a half pages of one of the documents that Stein accidentally produced.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.320
Is that right?

18:25.320 --> 18:27.320
That's one of the things, sir.

18:29.320 --> 18:34.320
And that's the whole work except for something about written with, not a word.

18:34.320 --> 18:39.320
And something about having done some work on the interim of the annual report.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.320
Well, you said for the particular cases.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.320
Well, that embraces the things worth an agent.

18:46.320 --> 18:51.320
Now, the work on the interim of annual report, you can't put it for it.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.320
Oh, I thought the week had not been passed.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.320
That's right.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.320
However, you do have that, sir.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.320
A, uh...

18:57.320 --> 18:59.320
Just, uh...

18:59.320 --> 19:07.320
One of the final reports of the annual report that Mr. Stein's note and comment for the report, I believe.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.320
Now, I'm in the form of the last few days.

19:11.320 --> 19:15.320
In the thinking of working on these matters, when you have witnessed the Stein,

19:15.320 --> 19:19.320
did you want what you might call after hour?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.320
Do anything to socially with you?

19:21.320 --> 19:23.320
Uh, why are you talking to this person?

19:23.320 --> 19:24.320
Yeah.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.320
Well, I know it's a close talk, but you get out dinner.

19:27.320 --> 19:30.320
The eights and he went to sleep by a minute.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.320
He had dinner at my house with my family and myself.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.320
And I remember the page when we worked.

19:35.320 --> 19:39.320
I think once the flight by, they'd been in with his family and with him.

19:39.320 --> 19:42.320
Uh, I think you don't mean that, but I felt good.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.320
I recall one occasion, while we were trying to fix it,

19:45.320 --> 19:47.320
when we went out on a...

19:47.320 --> 19:54.320
...futtle boat for dinner with the big girls, that was, I believe, in January.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.320
In January, I'm glad it's good.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.320
Uh, we were at dinner at the...

19:58.320 --> 20:03.320
...a host's rally, great host's rally, a great group.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.320
January camp.

20:05.320 --> 20:06.320
What do you think?

20:06.320 --> 20:07.320
January camp.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.320
The book of interest makes you better than mine.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.320
I have, sir.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.320
I even know how to express.

20:11.320 --> 20:14.320
You read $32 to 96 cents for a dinner.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.320
And $6,85 cents for a drink.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.320
That's found all right.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.320
That's found all right?

20:21.320 --> 20:22.320
Yes.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.320
Found a little high.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.320
I think I'm not going with the girl I got out and more.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.320
I know.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.320
I know.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.320
I know.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.320
I know.

20:34.320 --> 20:39.320
I know, Mr. Corn, what we've said on the 9th of December 31st.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.320
Do you?

20:41.320 --> 20:43.320
It's from the 33st.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.320
Oh, do you?

20:45.320 --> 20:46.320
Yeah.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.320
Uh...

20:48.320 --> 20:50.320
I've said nothing, but I know.

20:50.320 --> 20:54.320
Well, then the start sub-tune if you have a $47 and $17,000.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.320
I think you're pregnant.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.320
I think you're pregnant the wrong day.

20:59.320 --> 21:02.320
And they ask you where you were on the 9th of January 3rd.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.320
I thought you did have the wrong day.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.320
How about January 3rd?

21:06.320 --> 21:08.320
January 3rd.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.320
Let's see.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.320
That was a...

21:11.320 --> 21:14.320
Uh...

21:14.320 --> 21:17.320
Oh, the Saturday night.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.320
Saturday night.

21:18.320 --> 21:27.320
The one thing we wanted to have our Christmas dinner was a strike club.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.320
Try and pick a lot of out of the Christmas.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.320
You can.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.320
May I suggest you may have a little bit of today?

21:33.320 --> 21:34.320
Uh...

21:34.320 --> 21:36.320
You might pick a little bit of that, but I was thinking you're wrong.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.320
And you do like what's going on right there, the world's on that weekend?

21:39.320 --> 21:40.320
On that weekend?

21:40.320 --> 21:41.320
Yeah.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.320
I don't know where it was, I know that he was working on that weekend.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.320
I didn't know.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.320
Have you heard of the Christmas Eve last?

21:45.320 --> 21:47.320
No, because I know what work he did.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.320
You have some of the right to play.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.320
Well, if he was working on that weekend.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.320
I'm not working?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.320
Yeah.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.320
I worked with me.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.320
I'm the night at the 31st.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.320
He worked with me.

21:56.320 --> 21:59.320
On the very close.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.320
The afternoon of the 31st.

22:02.320 --> 22:07.320
He worked with me on Saturday, whatever the day was like.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.320
A January 1st.

22:09.320 --> 22:12.320
And I think he worked with me on Sunday.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.320
Far from us.

22:14.320 --> 22:18.320
You know where those wires on December 7th?

22:18.320 --> 22:20.320
On when he went away from the day?

22:20.320 --> 22:21.320
On December 7th?

22:21.320 --> 22:22.320
Yeah.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.320
What was it?

22:23.320 --> 22:24.320
First.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.320
That's the Monday, December 7th.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.320
I'm looking at General Ryan's job here.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.320
It's first on March 1st, 145.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.320
For its effect.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.320
I'm looking at his effect.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.320
That's right.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.320
Were you living?

22:43.320 --> 22:44.320
So far, I was living.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.320
Yeah.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.320
Have the safety transports held?

22:47.320 --> 22:48.320
Yes, I think that's it.

22:48.320 --> 22:53.320
When I remember General Ryan recommended that hotel.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.320
When we saw him the first time.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.320
And I think we went over there on 2 or 3 days.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.320
Now, were you living with us?

23:02.320 --> 23:03.320
On March 8th?

23:03.320 --> 23:04.320
Do you have any matters there?

23:04.320 --> 23:05.320
Yes, I think we have.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.320
Your file?

23:06.320 --> 23:07.320
Partly at your home?

23:07.320 --> 23:08.320
No.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.320
Very unlikely.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.320
No, sir.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.320
Very unlikely.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.320
It stands off.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.320
No, sir.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.320
Very unlikely.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.320
You don't have any files with you?

23:16.320 --> 23:18.320
I think we probably have some papers with us.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.320
Have some papers with you.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.320
I think another staff member with that.

23:21.320 --> 23:25.320
It would appear that there were two at dinner.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.320
Were you one of the two?

23:26.320 --> 23:27.320
Sorry, what might have been so?

23:27.320 --> 23:29.320
I think there was probably one other person.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.320
On December 4th.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.320
I think that's Jim Gilliam.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.320
You know where?

23:34.320 --> 23:35.320
You.

23:35.320 --> 23:40.320
You know where John was one night and I think Frank's another night when we were at the face of time.

23:40.320 --> 23:44.320
I know where you were on the night of December 4th.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.320
I'm just a staff member.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.320
I'm just a staff member.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.320
I don't remember what I had in the store.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.320
Any questions?

23:57.320 --> 23:59.320
Do you remember my rights?

23:59.320 --> 24:01.320
You remember my rights?

24:01.320 --> 24:03.320
You remember my rights?

24:03.320 --> 24:05.320
You remember my rights?

24:05.320 --> 24:06.320
You remember my rights?

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
You remember my rights?

24:07.320 --> 24:08.320
Michaels has been here in the store.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.320
We have another 10 minutes.

24:10.320 --> 24:14.320
May I suggest to you, sir, that you were at the store at 12th.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.320
On that night?

24:15.320 --> 24:16.320
Very probably.

24:16.320 --> 24:20.320
And spent $25 from $75,000, so think.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.320
By the way, I've never been there.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.320
That must be in the spent East Plates, isn't it?

24:25.320 --> 24:31.320
So how many people do I've looked at for a flight flight all in the store?

24:31.320 --> 24:33.320
There's something for the club room.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.320
I'm afraid it's not quite as dramatic.

24:35.320 --> 24:38.320
It might sound as a room where there's no music or dancing.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.320
It's a pretty quiet flight to go in there and get something to eat.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.320
But I couldn't get in.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.320
So that was the call.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.320
Well, I'd take it to television to have a reason to laugh.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.320
Maybe now.

24:50.320 --> 24:57.320
You know where Zayy was on the night of September 3rd?

24:57.320 --> 24:59.320
That's just the night before.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.320
No, I don't.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.320
Were you working?

25:01.320 --> 25:02.320
My very well.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.320
Were you working?

25:04.320 --> 25:07.320
For the Thursday night, and I will work when you work.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.320
Yes.

25:08.320 --> 25:11.320
Were you working at the safety camp hotel?

25:11.320 --> 25:13.320
Yes, I think so.

25:13.320 --> 25:17.320
Did you work your way to $21 from $35,000 or some dinner?

25:17.320 --> 25:20.320
Well, Mr. Wells, the good-time with service that I ate dinner,

25:20.320 --> 25:22.320
you'll find I do that every night in the week.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.320
I have a taste here, but it's quite a story.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.320
It eats your way to $21 from $35,000.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.320
The dinner is unique.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.320
You eat your way to that much, you rich-un.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.320
And it's Mr. Wells along our face, probably.

25:33.320 --> 25:38.320
In just a realistic car, who is not in the loop,

25:38.320 --> 25:41.320
and for you and the Dave Chan, I would like to say,

25:41.320 --> 25:43.320
with the little green paperware,

25:44.320 --> 25:49.320
let's say the date from Holy Pallet Man was Romeo.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.320
On December 1st, you know where you were.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.320
No, I don't.

25:56.320 --> 26:00.320
Would it surprise you to know that it's time with the safety camp hotel?

26:00.320 --> 26:02.320
No, in the store, aren't you?

26:02.320 --> 26:03.320
Were you working?

26:03.320 --> 26:04.320
I was thinking so far.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.320
Were you at work?

26:05.320 --> 26:06.320
Yes, sir.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.320
I think so.

26:07.320 --> 26:10.320
Did you eat your way to $14,000 or $95,000 for the dinner?

26:10.320 --> 26:11.320
$14,000?

26:11.320 --> 26:12.320
Right.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.320
Found funds.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.320
Where were you on November 30th?

26:21.320 --> 26:23.320
See, it's blank on General Lang's.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.320
There's nothing to do.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.320
There was no past routed on that night,

26:26.320 --> 26:31.320
but the record show that Mr. Chan was at the safety camp hotel.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.320
Were you there?

26:32.320 --> 26:35.320
Sorry, Paul Belayo, one of the other safe numbers.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.320
Have it worked?

26:36.320 --> 26:37.320
Yes.

26:37.320 --> 26:40.320
I think so, Mr. Wells, the summer I go about.

26:40.320 --> 26:43.320
I thought, three or four or five occasions.

26:43.320 --> 26:48.320
When we did go to the Jim Julianna bank car myself,

26:48.320 --> 26:51.320
they signed some of the safety training hotel,

26:51.320 --> 26:55.320
which I'd recommend as far as five general joints.

26:55.320 --> 26:58.320
Did you get anything to eat on the floor?

26:58.320 --> 26:59.320
Did you tie?

26:59.320 --> 27:00.320
I throw it once there.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
You tied it once.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.320
Yes.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.320
And what if they sometime wouldn't it?

27:04.320 --> 27:06.320
I mean, since before they say it sometime,

27:06.320 --> 27:07.320
it might have been right now.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.320
And you and Dave could have died into the work,

27:09.320 --> 27:11.320
even harder than you did.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.320
I think the fifth was before General Ryan

27:13.320 --> 27:15.320
had made his function from available.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.320
On the 28th, 29th of November,

27:18.320 --> 27:20.320
when were you with Dave at the state

27:20.320 --> 27:22.320
at the Great Hotel in New York?

27:22.320 --> 27:26.320
I don't recall.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.320
Then you lost the minute work.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.320
It's on that day with him, weren't you?

27:29.320 --> 27:30.320
On the 28th, 29th?

27:30.320 --> 27:31.320
Yes.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.320
For the weekend, there's the yesterday.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.320
Yes, sir.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.320
Now on the 29th, which is what, Sunday?

27:41.320 --> 27:44.320
Did you reach your way through $16 and 48th?

27:44.320 --> 27:46.320
Then for the food at the Great Hotel,

27:46.320 --> 27:48.320
plus 346 for drinks?

27:48.320 --> 27:49.320
That's very well-be.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.320
Mr. Cole, I think in front of you,

27:51.320 --> 27:53.320
because I'm somewhat admired you for it.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.320
I think you do not drink, is that right?

27:55.320 --> 27:58.320
I drink very occasionally, sir.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.320
I heard that you never drank, sir.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.320
And I think it was somewhat in your favor.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.320
On November 28th, where you were

28:05.320 --> 28:08.320
and Mr. Sion at the start point,

28:08.320 --> 28:11.320
Mr. Luff, as far as I know,

28:11.320 --> 28:13.320
and I'm quite sure that Mr. Sion

28:13.320 --> 28:16.320
was not at the start point at any time,

28:16.320 --> 28:18.320
while he was facing the 463.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.320
But then, if you were at the start,

28:20.320 --> 28:22.320
probably you weren't working with you, were I?

28:22.320 --> 28:24.320
I think that would be a very terrible thing.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.320
Where do you support him?

28:25.320 --> 28:26.320
He was heavily working.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.320
On the 9th of November 28th,

28:28.320 --> 28:29.320
when you were at the start,

28:29.320 --> 28:30.320
while I was at the start point,

28:30.320 --> 28:32.320
I thought, sir, you were very probably home at late.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.320
Home at late.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.320
But not at work?

28:34.320 --> 28:36.320
I don't know whether he was or not.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.320
And not at 4.50, you know that, don't you, Franny?

28:39.320 --> 28:41.320
And not at 4.50, you know,

28:41.320 --> 28:42.320
he was not at heart,

28:42.320 --> 28:44.320
except on November 28th, from noon to midnight.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.320
So, it was one of the cases when he was not at 4.50,

28:46.320 --> 28:47.320
I'm sure he was not at 4.50.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.320
And you were totally mild at 4.50.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.320
From noon to midnight,

28:51.320 --> 28:53.320
from noon to November 28th,

28:53.320 --> 28:55.320
to midnight, November 29th,

28:55.320 --> 28:57.320
from lunch and wine to work with him.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.320
Sir, every time he was off, I know he worked.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.320
In addition to the work,

29:02.320 --> 29:05.320
my first meeting was going to do a 40-month of portrait.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.320
On the 28th of November,

29:07.320 --> 29:10.320
it was going to be kept in the modem till the 29th of November,

29:10.320 --> 29:12.320
it's going to be a month to run to work with him.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.320
No, he could eat this in any work,

29:14.320 --> 29:15.320
I'm sure.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.320
The point is pretty positively,

29:16.320 --> 29:18.320
a 40-month of work,

29:18.320 --> 29:19.320
unless you run to work with him.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.320
More so?

29:20.320 --> 29:22.320
And you wouldn't have gone off in the start,

29:22.320 --> 29:24.320
for up with all he would do.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
Well, I,

29:25.320 --> 29:28.320
was afraid I not only worked at I did work.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.320
Left him alone.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.320
Yes sir.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.320
Where did you leave me?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.320
I mean, where did you leave me?

29:32.320 --> 29:33.320
From here to the south.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.320
How did you help?

29:34.320 --> 29:35.320
Yes sir.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.320
For me, I know this sir,

29:37.320 --> 29:39.320
he did not go to the store for a work,

29:39.320 --> 29:40.320
a nice work,

29:40.320 --> 29:42.320
and he's fine while we were taking down a short day.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
He's busy on the flight.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.320
I did.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.320
And, uh,

29:47.320 --> 29:50.320
at times I was about to make a very humble fun thing,

29:50.320 --> 29:52.320
where with nights and nights,

29:52.320 --> 29:53.320
and I was going to run in a pan,

29:53.320 --> 29:54.320
I don't know what to do.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.320
You tell us where did you work all the time?

29:57.320 --> 29:58.320
Yes sir.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.320
All in the moment,

30:01.320 --> 30:04.320
13th until November 15th,

30:04.320 --> 30:06.320
shine with all the Christmas.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.320
Will he with you?

30:08.320 --> 30:10.320
You probably had taken down when he was.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.320
Did you go to side?

30:12.320 --> 30:13.320
Did I go to side with him?

30:13.320 --> 30:14.320
No sir.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.320
You did not.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.320
I'm sure I did not.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.320
How much of that time will he go off?

30:19.320 --> 30:21.320
After hours November 15th,

30:21.320 --> 30:22.320
until 10pm,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.320
what do you work with?

30:24.320 --> 30:26.320
Uh,

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
is that on the 13th?

30:28.320 --> 30:29.320
Yes, I know.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.320
November 13th,

30:30.320 --> 30:31.320
I know I did.

30:31.320 --> 30:35.320
Now,

30:35.320 --> 30:38.320
I just want to go back for a moment,

30:38.320 --> 30:40.320
to leave you a theme,

30:40.320 --> 30:41.320
called,

30:41.320 --> 30:42.320
first.
