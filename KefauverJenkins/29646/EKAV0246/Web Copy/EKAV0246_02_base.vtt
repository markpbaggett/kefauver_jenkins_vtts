00:00.000 --> 00:06.300
You remember, Mr. Stone, that Mr. Shine's private time was entitled to have either

00:06.300 --> 00:08.500
physicists or New Year's all?

00:08.500 --> 00:11.000
I heard some touched the money, but not both.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
I heard some touched the money about that, yes.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
And you were with him on New Year's Eve, or you not?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Yes, at a time a telegram was received.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Nothing.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.500
Did you know about him receiving a telegram?

00:22.500 --> 00:25.000
That was not New Year's Eve, sir. That was in the afternoon.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
In the afternoon, Elvis, the last day of the year.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Yes, that's right.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Very referring to the incident which General Ryan described on the stand about the mix-up

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
and not weekend in the telegram and my phone call down.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
That's right.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Those kinds of rounds?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
That's right.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Yes, that was the year's to know, if you send a thirty-first.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
That's the afternoon.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yes, sir.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
And you telephoned and threatened off to mix-up by saying,

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
, by the time and eye, how did this really work?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes, I called that number.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Well, the answer is yes.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
He got the telegram and he had to be told me it's not in this.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yes.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I called that number, yes.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
And it said, private time and eye, obviously it worked.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I don't think I went in detail about the Italy it worked, sir.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I know.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
So how do you hear that we did work?

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
And the only reason that he was out of that afternoon and night.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
And the next two days as well was because of the threat of somebody business.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
He was the answer yesterday afternoon.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
The answer yesterday, we had a few, many words.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And the fight that he had to have to have to have a few years night.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And he could have sometime knocked off and had a little fun.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Could I, sir?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yes.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Well, I had this situation with the well.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
The only question is, is if I could be surprised if you could knock off.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm trying to say what happened to him.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And have a little fun.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
I had this situation made out of serious illness and my family chose to shortly before that.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I did not tell out I'd stay home on New Year's Eve.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Sorry, wait a minute.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
And I had around all about, I'd say, two or three in the morning.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You'd erupt into your work?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
No, I'd finished working just yet.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
About two or three in the morning, I went out a little friend home for an hour,

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
going to night in home.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Day, with him?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
No, he was not.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Where was he?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
To the home, I thought.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
To the home?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Did you see him, Eddie?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Yes, I did see him, Eddie.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I did see him, my house.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Until what time?

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
I think he left around, um, 1230, something like that.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Where you living at work until then, and from, uh, I'm afraid we were there.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
You guys seem to need almost a bulb and the arm and call of duty to work so late and so on.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
We, uh, on New Year's Eve, we did work on that particular day of the annual report

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
with you happy for you.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
Now, I'm going to call on when you consider what I have gone over with you in your testimony.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
And the work product that I hold in my hand, you may seriously tell it's the bitters,

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
that it was not said before, trying out a forte.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
How long have you come to produce what leaves out here?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Uh, could it be answered?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
No, well, the answer is yes, though.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
So we're not necessarily saying what's the time?

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
It was not up and done and the further answered, you of course have not given any complete fiction.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
Can you tell us whether or not you know so much what's missing, signs on New Year's Eve here to my house?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Was anyone with you?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Anyone with you?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I'll tell you everyone who was there.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Um, I was there.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
I was in 75, but you may have to go with that.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
I was there, two or three friends of mine were there.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I will ask you their names, but they men or women.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
They were, they were a couple, a friend of mine, his wife,

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
there's another friend of mine, man, a date sign,

04:09.000 --> 04:18.000
and there was a young lady who was a friend of Dave Shines who came up later in the evening.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, I'm not asking to identify her.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Well, you know, it's getting already 30, how do you say that?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes, but I'm certainly not going to ask you to identify her and make you wish to.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
No, I don't.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
At first time, you killed her.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I don't know exactly.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Tell us the best you can.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Oh, that's what I can, I would say, it was about, uh, can, something like that.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I have to work through time and experience.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I'll give back to you when you're ready.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You can continue, let's return to our studio.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Come on, come on to my place.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Come on, come on.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Where's my leg?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Thank you.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Now, I put him inside the other, I have to work through.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
You have another 10 minutes.

04:51.000 --> 05:01.000
I want to come back, Mr. Stone, to the item that we were talking about this morning.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
I gathered this summer down a little, that it's early interest to bring with my remodulatory soul.

05:08.000 --> 05:17.000
You about this situation of possible subversive and secure to us, and even spies, the tort mom.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Is that right?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Uh, yes.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
And I think you abused the words to deserve it, that you found it a disturbing situation.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Yes.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
And you had to speak only a sort of a glimpse, that you couldn't get all bigger to us or how little it was.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Good, no, the beginning.

05:36.000 --> 05:45.000
And you probably knew enough about tort mom must have found out quickly enough about tort mom must, to know it was a sensitive place, didn't you?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Uh, yes.

05:46.000 --> 05:56.000
And I'm sure the knowledge that you have was the source, Mr. Stone, to one in your position, of some anxiety for the nation's safety.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
It was one situation among a number of serious situations just as well.

06:03.000 --> 06:14.000
I don't know how many words you have, but I'm sure that was you, a discerning and alarming situation.

06:14.000 --> 06:24.000
So, certainly, it's very enough to meet a one of us, check into it and see how many facts we could check out and stop it as soon as possible.

06:24.000 --> 06:32.000
Well, it was a question of developing these over the thing that we have to do is stop, I didn't.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Stop, I didn't.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Stop the risk.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
The risk of death.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Yes, well, we had to do it and stop the risk.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
That's right.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
You have to keep those protected, get them over, fire or, fire or move them to something.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
That's right, isn't it?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Uh, partly, sir.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That's partly right.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
But it's high in numbers, isn't it?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Well, the thing came up.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
So, you called if I told you now that we have a bad situation at Monmouth, you've got to cure this, cure it by a sundown if you could.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
No, I'm sure I couldn't.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah, but you'd like to if you could.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Uh, so, isn't that right?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
No, the, uh, what I might say.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
You can't be that must be right. It has to be right.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
No, what I might like is there one watch that's going to be done at two different things.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, if you could be God and do anything you wish to cure it by sundown, wouldn't you?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Get that.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
And you wear that alarm about Monmouth.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
I was, uh, it doesn't go that way, Mr. Well, that's it.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm just asking how it does go.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
When you find that our kindness and possible fives in a case like Monmouth, you must be alarmed, aren't you, sir?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Now you've asked me how it goes, aren't I gonna say that?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
No, I didn't ask you how it goes, though.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I said, aren't you alarmed when you find out they're there?

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
So whenever I hear a communist or any place, whenever I hear that people have been failing to act on FVI information about time,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I do think it's alarming.

07:53.000 --> 08:01.000
I want the time you know that and I would like to be able to advise this committee apply people who have the responsibility for getting them out,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
haven't carried out there in time.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
But once you want first of all, this is called an election fair with each other.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
Once you want first of all, this is within your power, is to get them out, isn't it?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I don't know if I do it distinction, it's what I want to come first.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Well, it's very frankly ranked, too rapidly, high, that's it.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Who is a situation which I thought should be developed and which is developed?

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Where did you first meet Secretary Stevens?

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
I first met Secretary Stevens on December 7th, I believe, for a number of twelve, where were you, sir?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
What?

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Where in Washington?

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
I don't remember where I was when I met him, it was in this building, he left there once in a hearing room.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Do you know that he was the new Secretary of the Army?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yes, I did know.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And you must have had high hopes about him, didn't you?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I don't think I gave him so much thought, sir.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
Do you know that anybody who wants the Secretary of the Army can do it all no matter what party is formed, do you know?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Oh, tell me, sir.

09:03.000 --> 09:13.000
And on September 7th, when you met him, you had in your bosom this alarming situation about Monmouth, is that right?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Yes, I know about Monmouth, I know.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
And you said, how about you?

09:18.000 --> 09:27.000
Let's tell, and say, Mr. Secretary, I know something about Monmouth, but don't let me sleep tonight.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't know, sir.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't, as I've said to five of us to watch, I don't know whether I force him to sleep in the bad of dinner or not.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I know that on the 16th, I did.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Whether I force him on the 7th or not, it's something I don't know.

09:39.000 --> 09:50.000
Don't you know that if you have really told him what your fears were and to tell him to give him to any extent, he should have dumped him the next day with sustained him?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
No, sir.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Have you any reason if you then have any reason to doubt him, by the way?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
No, sir.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
All his honor, all his hatred is no, sir.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
And yet, Mr. Claw, you didn't tell him what you knew.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I don't know whether I did or not.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I told him some of the things I knew, sir.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
I don't think I told him everything I knew on the first vacation.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
After the first two or three occasions, I think he had a pretty good idea of what we were working at.

10:19.000 --> 10:34.000
And if you're throwing Tommy one more, every time you learn of a time a list or a spy anywhere, you get your policies to get him out of the past as possible.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Surely we won't come out of this as far as I'm concerned.

10:37.000 --> 10:48.000
Whenever you learn of one, from now on, and you're told I'm a fake of it, when you tell somebody about it or what, just a lot of spurt with great respect,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I work for the committee here.

10:50.000 --> 11:00.000
They know how we go about handling situations of coming into infiltration and saying that the act on FBI information about coming into infiltration.

11:00.000 --> 11:16.000
If they are displeased with the fee, with which I and the people who work with me, proceed out to say a displeased of the order in which we move, I'm sure they will give me appropriate instructions along those lines and I will follow any which they give me.

11:16.000 --> 11:25.000
And there I have my small voice there and say whenever you know about it, first of all, if I'm a minister of fire, please hurt.

11:25.000 --> 11:45.000
When you remember those words, Mr. Welch, I can assure you that as far as I'm concerned, and certainly as far as the chairman of this committee and the members and the members of the staff are concerned, we are a small group, but we proceed as expeditiously as the humanly possible to get our communist and freighters.

11:45.000 --> 11:53.000
And to bring the light, the mechanism by which they have been permitted to remain where they were, but so long a period of time.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
You, that's right away.

11:57.000 --> 12:12.000
Notting that kind of statement, but as you know, it's well-suffered request that the information be given once we know of anyone who must be performing any work for the coming of purpose.

12:12.000 --> 12:27.000
I think we should tell him that he has any law-armed humanly and scripture, and we recommend it to the people who are working at committee.

12:27.000 --> 12:53.000
So then for a number of years, I remember that an organization which has been in new years and years ago, has the legal borough for the coming of purpose, an organization which always brings to the sense of anyone who dares to expose communist.

12:53.000 --> 13:20.000
I certainly assumed that Mr. Welch did not know that the society recommended him as the 50 council for the committee, but he has such a hair and such a great desire to know where anyone who looks fit, who may be serving the coming of cause of the growth.

13:20.000 --> 13:49.000
So we said, it's still your time to reflect that you, Mr. Petrus, who was still in your law-armed day, and you asked to have down here looking over the thick that you classified as two, to the member of the organization, nothing in my name, but named by a very outstanding committee of the Attorney General, I think I spoke with the little bit of the legal borough of the committee.

13:49.000 --> 14:18.000
So they come in the perfect, and he belongs last for a sizable number of years according to Zola and Witten. He belongs to a long after it had been exposed, and the legal arms of the Communist Party, knowing that Mr. Welch, I just thought that I had a duty to respond to your urgent request.

14:19.000 --> 14:44.000
But before it came down, who we know of anyone serving the coming of cause, we let the agency know that we are now letting you know that you are my own dead belongs to this organization for either a three or four years long after he was out of law code.

14:44.000 --> 15:13.000
And I don't think you can find any place anywhere in an organization which has done more to defend the Communist, and I am including the support to defend the Communist, to defend every non-adagent, and to add to the Communist cause, when the man who you originally wanted down here at the right hand, instead of Mr. Petrus, I'm sure.

15:14.000 --> 15:36.000
I have a hesitate to bring that up, but I have a letter for you with your Tony request, Mr. Cohen, here, that he personally, yet every coming of the government before sundown, therefore, we will give you the information about the young man and your own organization.

15:36.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm not asking you this thing, but why you tried to force him on this committee, so that you did the committee know.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
For the unit of you, I remember that coming to the court in Vector Not, I don't know.

15:53.000 --> 16:10.000
So, I assume that it's not Mr. Welk, because I get the impression that while you are slightly unactored, you're close for a laugh, I don't think you have any conception of the danger of the Communist purpose.

16:10.000 --> 16:17.000
I don't think you yourself would ever knowingly aid the Communist cause.

16:17.000 --> 16:26.000
I think you're unknowingly aiding it when you try to blow up your hearing and with your attempting to bring out the facts.

16:27.000 --> 16:39.000
Madam Chair, well, Mr. Chair, you know, as a working issue, you know, in old memory, I've been to a lot of recommendations, and it's a feature of anybody else that's counsel for this committee.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Mr. Welk, I will go over the record of Mr. Chairman Lee.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Mr. Chair, it's the news story on that.

16:45.000 --> 16:53.000
Under these circumstances, I must myself have something opposing a personal privilege.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
I did not know Senator.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Senator, sometimes you say me I have your attention.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Mr. Senator, have you known?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Yes, I have.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Mr. Chairman, one year and twelve.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
No, this time, I want you to listen with both.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Mr. Chairman, I think I'm here with this moment.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Mr. Chairman, we have to send someone to get the news story.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
We have five participants, one of the candidates for an organization.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I will have anything to do with the long group.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Everybody gets the citation.

17:29.000 --> 17:40.000
One of the five patients showing the first vote to the legal arm of the Communist Party and the length of time that he belongs in the fact that he's recommended him to go up.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I think that will be the record, Senator.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
Chair, again, you won't need anything in the record when I've been telling you this.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
Until this moment, Senator, I think I am your reading gauge.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Your cruelty or your recklessness.

17:58.000 --> 18:08.000
That's the sure of the young man who went to the Harvard Law School and came into my firm and is starting what looks to be available to rare with it.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
When I decided to work for this committee, I have given things to all of my rights to be my first participant.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
I said that you picked somebody in the firm to work under you that you would like.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
He told Fred Fisher, and they came down on an afternoon plane.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
That night, when we had taken a little bath, I found it's been what the case is about.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
Fred Fisher and Jim Finkair and I went to dinner together.

18:43.000 --> 18:52.000
I then shared to these two young men, boy, I don't know anything about here except I've always liked you.

18:52.000 --> 19:03.000
But if there's anything funny in the life of either one of you, there would hurt anybody in this case you speak up to it.

19:03.000 --> 19:14.000
Fred Fisher said, Mr. Well, when I was in the law school and for a period of months after, I belonged to the lawyer's guild as a US executive.

19:14.000 --> 19:23.000
Even on, I say I am Secretary of the Young Republicans, Louis G. Newton, with a son of Massachusetts governor.

19:23.000 --> 19:33.000
I have the respect and admiration of my community and I'm sure I have the respect and admiration of the 25 lawyers or so in Hale & Doha.

19:33.000 --> 19:40.000
I said, Fred, I just don't think I'm going to ask you to work on the case.

19:40.000 --> 19:50.000
If I do one of these days, that will come out and go over national television and it will just hurt life's predictions.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
The doll, Senator, I asked him to go back to work.

19:55.000 --> 20:04.000
Little did I dream you could be so reckless and so cool as to do an injury to that laugh.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
It is true he is still with Hale & Doha.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
It is true that he will continue to be with Hale & Doha.

20:13.000 --> 20:24.000
It is I, raised with this day, equally true that I fear he shall always bear a star, needlessly inflicted by you.

20:24.000 --> 20:31.000
If it were in my power to forgive you for your reckless cruelty, I would do so.

20:31.000 --> 20:41.000
I like to think I'm a gentleman, but your forgiveness will last forever.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
We'll have to come from someone other than me.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
This gentleman.

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
I met me at the school and Mr. Wells talked about this being true and reckless.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
He was just bathing, he hasn't bathing Mr. Cohn here for hours.

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
The club being Mr. Cohn before sundown, get out of any department of the government.

21:11.000 --> 21:31.000
Anyone who is serving the coming of time, I just give this man's lecture and I want to say Mr. Wells that he has been labeled long before he became a member of the very first one in 1944.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
I'm not a drop in, so you know he's the most annoying.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Listen Mr. Cohn, not his head at me.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
I just do I think no first linger in Mr. Cohn's nose.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I live to do no first, no?

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
And if I did, I'll make your blood.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Let us not assassinate this lad further.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Mr. Cohn, let's look you up down and down.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
Have you no stamps of future feature have long left?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Have you left?

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
No stamps of future.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Another trick, Mr. Wells.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
I'll be there.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I have another thing Mr. Cohn, I want to point a first over this.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
I like to finish this.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
And I can't hurt you too much.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I like to finish this.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
Mr. Wells here has full of ups and downs.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
He's been talking day after day about the way he wants to get anyone in favor of communism

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
out before it's done now.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
I know Mr. Cohn is rather not a limited.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
I intend to do other.

22:34.000 --> 22:42.000
And Mr. Wells talks about any sense of decency if I claim that he's not the truth.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Another thing I want to know about it.

22:45.000 --> 22:52.000
The disorganization of the name as the...

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
This is what is the name of the formals.

22:58.000 --> 23:07.000
My quote, the formals legal board of the Communist Party is from the organization and controlled

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
union.

23:08.000 --> 23:15.000
And which since the two structures has never failed to rally to the legal defense of the

23:15.000 --> 23:23.000
coming of parties and individual members thereof, including known espionage agents.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Now that is not the language of some from the Catholic.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
That is the language of the Illinois collectivity committees.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And I can join with...

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I can join with many more citations.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
It seems that Mr. Wells is paying so deeply.

23:40.000 --> 23:48.000
He thinks it's improper for me to give the records becoming the first record of the man who

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
he wanted to voice upon this committee.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
But it doesn't pay him at all.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
There's no pain in his chest about the unfowns of tragedy against Mr. Frank Tarr.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
There's no pain there about the attempts to destroy the recordations.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
And the cases now are the way from the unmemory who are working in my committee.

24:15.000 --> 24:24.000
And Mr. Wells, if I have said anything here which is untrue, then tell me, I have heard

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
you and everyone else talk so much about laying the trumps upon the table.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
But when I heard that some people are pointing Mr. Wells out for a long time,

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
you say, now before it's done down, you must get these people out of the government.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
So I just want to have a very clear, very clear that you were not so serious about that

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
and you started directing on this man for the committee.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
And the other thing that Mr. Wells in front of the other is...

24:59.000 --> 25:07.000
I have raised a belief that you did not know about his coming as front record

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
at the time you recommended.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
I don't think you'd have recommended the committee.

25:12.000 --> 25:22.000
If you knew that, I think it's entirely possible you won after he came on the after you recommended.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
But the point is, Macarote, I have to say again that you don't have 28 months of wealth

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
and then your suspicion is harmful for this committee because he has to do his offer.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
All the recommendations that you made and did not recall any of them coming from Mr. Wells.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
And that would include the suspicion.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
Let me ask Mr. Wells, if you're going down the enough to act as your foot.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Mr. McCarty, I will not discuss this further with you.

25:48.000 --> 25:55.000
You have sat within feet of knees and could have asked me about the figures.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
I will not ask Mr. Colton anymore what this is.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
You, Mr. Chairman, if you will, call in their will.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
Are there any questions that comes from the agenda?

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
What other questions can Mr. Colton have?

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
I just want to ask one or two questions.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Here in the piece of Colton, what other questions we have on each desk before,

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
Mr. McCarty, have you seen my afternoon meetings by the...

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
I've just heard Mr. Chairman declare a brief reset.

26:57.000 --> 27:04.000
The ABC television network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarty Army controversy.

27:04.000 --> 27:16.000
There is the general hubbob in Maylay in the committee room that the session breaks up with a brief reset.

27:16.000 --> 27:28.000
There is Senator Joseph McCarty, rising from his seats at the committee table.

27:29.000 --> 27:36.000
As the McCarty and the Washington Post are starting to continue on out to the day ahead.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
The lady now is Mrs. Dallas.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
Those look long when she just walked behind Senator McCarty.

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
Mrs. McCarty comes to chat to Senator for a moment.

27:51.000 --> 27:57.000
Senator McCarty goes to speak to kindly with the chairman of the committee.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
Senator Colton.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
Senator Colton.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
Senator Colton.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
I have a brief reset.

28:16.000 --> 28:24.000
The answer been the session.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
There is Mr. James St. Clair, Associate Compton's Minister of Justice.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Senator Thomas.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
Senator George John.

28:36.000 --> 28:43.000
The meeting of the committee table is Senator Sirkson of Illinois.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Senator Vax, Senator Thomas.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Senator Thomas.

28:55.000 --> 29:01.000
Senator Thomas.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Senator Thomas.

29:04.000 --> 29:12.000
Mr. Grayson, right to the brief summary of what has occurred in this afternoon session.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
Do you have seen perhaps the most dramatic moments of the entire hearing?

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
The question came about in this session.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm just going to talk to Mr. Welch.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
I have suggested there's one of the counsel for this committee.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
A gentleman on his law firm in Baltimore, Mr. Fisher.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
Senator McCarty said that this Mr. Fisher was a member of the Welch firm.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
And he was also a member of a group which was cited as a communist front organization.

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
The election committee and also have been named by the attorney general.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
Mr. McCarty said that this man was employed by Senator Van Mr. Welch and Mr. Welch

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
decided to bring him into this committee, functioning in these hearings where he might have accessed the classified and secret material.

30:15.000 --> 30:22.000
Senator McCarty further went on to say that this organization was illegal ball work of the Communist Party in the United States.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
And that this member of Mr. McCarty, Mr. Welch, is firm.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
Mr. Fisher had belonged to this group after its exposure and citation by the attorney general.

30:33.000 --> 30:42.000
Mr. McCarty went on further to charge that senator that Mr. Welch wanted this gentleman, Mr. Fresh Fisher, to come here.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Rather, Mr. St. Clair is the associate of the Chase.

30:45.000 --> 31:01.000
And then he went on to say that he was completely bored with Mr. Welch's finally request to Mr. Cohn to try to immediately get rid of Communists in various defense establishments and forts in this nation.

31:01.000 --> 31:10.000
Mr. McCarty went on to say that he is quite an actor, that he always plays for a laugh, but the fist was no laughing matter.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
He went on further to discuss the Mr. Fisher case.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Mr. Welch asked for a point of personal privilege.

31:18.000 --> 31:29.000
It was that of him and he said that Mr. McCarty, that his cruelty and recklessness in his case is beyond measure the ask him that he not have a sense of decency.

31:29.000 --> 31:39.000
Whereupon, Senator Mr. Welch said that he has no further questions for the witness and ask the chairman, that is, meaning Mr. Cohn, an ask the chairman to call the next witness.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Fair gunner back now with an air gun.
