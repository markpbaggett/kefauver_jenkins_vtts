WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
And I believe that you admitted that.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
And here's where I see you gave.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
I said that it could.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
But I thought that it couldn't happen.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
And Saint Albert County said that that was not even pensioned.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
We just got through the question of how to handle this poor, malice situation.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Very little of us is in certainty, was planning to look in this situation in industrial plants.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
And that stated for the army.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
And it in fact, for all the best department was very much interested in that subject

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
and had problems connected with it.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Wasn't that Mr. Steer?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
An invitation of your law.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
It was not for I didn't finish.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
To speak to the first customer, touch in his staff from the army to invest in your plants.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
And the word, basically not collective in the army, wasn't that your intention when you stated that?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
It doesn't know if it was not.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
You want me to give you a little back down on it so you're alert?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Did you ever?

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
It'll make us forget.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
I didn't give you a turning to sudden, do you know it's ever to get?

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
That there was a right, you see it.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
You know the departments of the army, our army, our poor star, and the Navy from that occasion.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Did you know how a match that was on one occasion,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
by your attorney, Mr. Adam?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I've heard of it. I never saw it.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
And it was strong, giving the force of a conversation between him and life, all of them.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I've tried them hard.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Did you make an investigation of that?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
An investigation of the matter that surprised your lawyer?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
What's wrong in that?

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
In the presence of my colleagues showing the different departments of the United States armies the different areas?

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
No, I didn't make an investigation about it.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
All right.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Then you deny that what you said to the senator,

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
with respect to investigating industrial plants was decided to get a suspension,

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
or to divide him to some other field of endeavor, in fact, your testimony.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Exactly.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
I believe it can be taken with me.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Thank you Mr. Jenkins, and approximately 90 minutes, right?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
You will have another chance.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I would like to thank you for, thank you.

03:07.000 --> 03:18.000
In my ten minutes, I would like to start Mr. Stevens by reading the first paragraph of your specification data date of April 13th.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
There is a passion for the Army alleges that Senator Joseph Armacardi is chairman of the front of the Subcommittee on Investigations,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
here and after call with Subcommittee United States Senate.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
And his chief council, Roy M. Cole, as well as other members of its staff.

03:33.000 --> 03:42.000
Start by improper means to obtain preferential sheetments for one day with G.S.I. and U.S. Army formally chief consultant of the Subcommittee in that.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
And then it lists the twenty-nine specifications.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
All right now to break down the specific part,

03:53.000 --> 04:12.000
in the five of your own personal knowledge is involved that each of the three to which car call and the type may have played in the specific matter of utilizing in favor of me, in favor of me to obtain preferential sheet.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Let's go for a semester car.

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
Are there any specific occasions for your personal knowledge that Mr. Car uses in favor of me to obtain preferential sheetments for kind of G.A. with chance?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, I indicated it was more.

04:29.000 --> 04:41.000
But in the meetings that Mr. Car attended, that he was, yes, by the surveillance, Mr. Caldus most of the talking.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
However, Mr. Adams had formal meetings that would not the car of ideas.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm personally in the soul we know on the same time as your own personal knowledge.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Yes, I have a disaster with stuff that many of you divide out one by one.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
That's right.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
About these three individuals whether they use the impact for me, so I'm talking now strictly about Mr. Car.

04:59.000 --> 05:10.000
And strictly about your own personal knowledge that any kind of Mr. Car engaged in the impact for me in your opinion to seek preferential sheetments for G.A. with chance?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, not nearly the exact opposite.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
Well, to what extent in my opinion it's very hard to define that the channel and I'm not trying to obey it.

05:20.000 --> 05:29.000
I think my car is a relatively inactive part in the whole situation that we're discussing so far as my personal knowledge is concerned.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
In all these Mr. Car has been charged in this situation with some very serious misbehaving.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
That's for injustice to you and justice to him.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I think our energy should now speak publicly.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Well, he's an impotent yet with a young brother.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, I think that that will know that some of the information that I do.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
In support of my knowledge I say a relatively inactive part.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
As a chair and the chair and the same as Mr. Car, you know you have told me.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I've been meeting him in the past and you've been in the future.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
When he has ready to do something, he's not.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Well, I suppose I think Mr. Car might have a little more active in helping to stop some of the conversations that went on.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
He did not do that.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
But did he do that?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Did he do that?

06:08.000 --> 06:21.000
Well, he was just there and put on the call like these statements and possibly in a mile away, take part of nothing.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
I say more than a pass it for an inactive nature.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
But my personal knowledge is a part of the matter.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, may I say a bit to Steven, but I think you owe us a little bit of Mr. Car.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
He understands the responsibility of your own personal knowledge is to turn you into a dog in the target of impotent.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Or if you specify the way in the target of the key word you have.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, I have to work hard.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Do a little thinking about that, Mr. Chairman.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
You're mentioning it.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I mean, I got a thing right now.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
I'm not saying that.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
But I just want to see cars right now.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I think we can be specific in my business.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
If you think that by the bottom of the bottom of the chart.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm not saying that in a dog.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
As you result of your testimony, I'm trying to find out whether you're in a testimony investigation or I've done.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I will say that that's my purpose.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
In fact, it's far more than any testimony.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm just trying to determine the hard feelings and the information that's not being prepared for it.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Are you all present on that?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Are you trying to give us your privacy?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Your private needs?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Your private business?

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I'm telling you, or I knew it was hard when your own personal opinion just started to change.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
And all, well, I thought I think that's the hard.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
But that's not something that's not something that's not the conversation that's not.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
You didn't do it.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
On the other hand, you said that you tried to determine the failure in the shadow of the sound.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
You didn't say that you were trying to determine the target at all.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I'm saying that in a case of investigation, not in that case.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
If you're not in the target, I'm in the case of the door of that, I will decide.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Is that the opportunity to try to determine the failure in the shadow of the sound?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm saying that you don't need to talk to me about it.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I would say that I say it's hard.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
But it's just because I don't mind my way.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I'll give me a discussion for this fight.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Like, did he do the harm in the sound?

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
He's just not talking to me about the mistake of saying that you don't need to talk to me about it.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Give me a hand.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
This is how I'm doing.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
If you have any questions, I'll give you one more.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
I think you're right. I shouldn't show out of Mr. Cairo's no jurisdiction over my chief counsel, Mr. Kong, not over the camera.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
That's something you may bring up in the subject of examination. I'm not being asked to fight over it.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
I don't suppose that Mr. Ceeber is in the invitation of that information.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm trying to find out I'm justice to Mr. Carthage.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm sure you might be fair.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I do.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I'll just exactly be the extent of the charge you do at all of them.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
From your own personal knowledge, the justice to talk who has said that you charge it, we're sitting here, basically, at the time of the stop.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't look at me on Mr. Kong, they don't need a much of them.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm taking mine apart in the conversation.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
The chairman's time is expired.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
I think I'm okay. I think I'm going to miss the cell after you find it.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
Let's check there one apart and then you have with respect to granting commission to me on it.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
The commission is direct commissions as was requested for Mr. Shine.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
I want to ask the authority.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
I wanted to determine the source of the appeal and the whom it was made and what you did about it.

09:26.000 --> 09:37.000
Assuming that his application at a 7000 copper and he was qualified, who would have made the decision to grant a commission or who made the decision to reject the request?

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't know.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
I don't know.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
I don't know.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
I don't know.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
So I have had that much conference plan I was already ran in direct commission.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Most of that, most of the about his delegated desires, about his delegated to the technical service,

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
that is like the core of engineers or the judge advocate general or the technical core.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, who, who, who, who are physicians, who are qualified and what position can be?

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
The staff are a full of an application for a direct commission and write it.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
The chief of the technical service in my name.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
In your name.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yes.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Do they come to you directly?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
No.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Do you have a recue?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
No.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Do you have a task just in one moment?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
No, sir.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
It's done by somebody under your command or under your direction.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I delegate.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Uh, when they'll make the decision?

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
But if they make a decision rejecting an application for a commission,

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
is it in charge to you for your approval for your review of any action whatsoever?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
No.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, let's tell us exactly what happened in the case of Sean.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Who understood to prosecute the request for a direct commission for?

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Well, no, we were, was first contacted by some of the clients of him.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
He is just near Ramam between the hill over here, between the Congress and the department.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
That's right.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
So he can be the message to someone.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
That's right.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Who?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, he's filled out an application on my staff.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
That's right.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
It was the President General's office that passed that.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yes.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
The General's office process.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
That's right.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
I'm West Bay.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I feel out there.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
That's right.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
And he's still in the office.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Finally there.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yes.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Well, finally there.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
That is just the make out in the billet out.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I think too.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
You know why he didn't fill it out?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Complete as a press time.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
No, sir.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
All right.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
No action on it until he made the second death and completed it.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
That's right.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Now what action was taken on that application, that'd be completed.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
That's what happens.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, it was referred to the technical first.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
In this case, the transportation card.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Who is it?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Who is the technical service now?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Who is it that they had on it?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Who passed all the applications?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
General Yaman's ahead of the booth.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
General Yaman.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Why are you empty?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
He's a chief of transportation.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Is he the one that rejected the application?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
He... he found that...

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I mean, look over the application.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
And being what the... what the...

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
what the qualifications were.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
And what the needs of the service were.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
That they had no high-quality information.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
But I was the technical application.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Who did he give that report to?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
After the urgent general, I was still.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
He reported to the action General asked the gentleman in the application

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
that he wasn't qualified,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
that they had no place for officer in stock.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
All his qualifications, that's right.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Then why, sir?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Did you have the time?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And he had some general...

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
notify General Reemer and he had some...

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
notify them.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Well, when the time was taken up with you, direct.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Either by Senator Mokai, say, by Mr. Shion and Mr. Kohl.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
What did you do there, finishing the private elements direct the mission?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Did you take any action?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Any positive action that I have asked you,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
that application successfully.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
No, the action was turned down by the department of the Army.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
That was the end of it as far as we were concerned.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Did you have the authority if you had wanted to do it?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
As second day of the Army to overrule.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
The action had been taken by your subordinates

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
and turning down the application and ran him of the mission.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I would say that I had the authority to do it.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I couldn't say that you weren't much of an idiot.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
You then can see you're doing that.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
No, you've never done it for anyone else.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
No, therefore you will.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yes, that's right.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
I have a live from my decision with respect to whether an applicant is qualified.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yes, sir.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
So, I will ask you this question.

13:45.000 --> 13:53.000
State whether you did everything you had your subordinates with respect to this application.

13:53.000 --> 14:02.000
I met the Shion for a direct mission that you would do and have done for all of his who have so far everything.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Do you spend as much time or ever one as you have said or listen?

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
I never had one that was in the same possible category as this one.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Why have you placed this one in a different category or ever the other?

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
That's not constant and repeated.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
I have contact in Magdad-Gishan as represented by my family of 65 telephone calls, 19 meetings and so forth.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
I was just a question of a cumulative effect of many, many individual actions.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Let's pull the left foot through the pressure that we run.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Sorry, it's under time.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I just get the stuff.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
There's a transaction.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Right, the time is a learning of pk2 values 10 minutes.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I'm just sure you must go ahead and have every people.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I'll still pay them with a seven.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I'm still favor unlimited debate.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I'll have another try to talk.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I'll have another try to talk.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
This is actually just a few questions.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
First, let's recognize the report on this meeting.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
At which time some members of the group who were there could not gain admission to the top secret laboratory.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
What type of clearance is required to enter that laboratory?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
That would be very complex.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It's that what they call Q clearance.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Now that wouldn't be a Q clearance.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
That would be a Q clearance.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But it wouldn't be a Q clearance.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Now the cemetery is automatically have that clearance.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
I don't think they do have that effect.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
But in any event, some distinction might be made between the cemetery and a member of each path.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
That was my feeling.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Anybody that was elected to Congress was entitled to the laboratory.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Now the party left Washington and went to the first moment.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
And I just assumed that evidently the clearances were not provided for the 40-metre plane.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It was ready.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
Well, we didn't know exactly what our plans for the day would be until we got there.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
And as far as I know, no particular preliminary planning done.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
The result was when we came back to take you to the lab, right, the question of how the clearance we have,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
it doesn't settle the whole business tonight.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Matter of the 44 minutes, and so I made my own spot decision,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
unfortunately, Mr. Kondlin-Lake.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
A way with clearance has to be obtained to an interdisciplinary establishment.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
I'd say that first would have to be made by thousands of people.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
And made on the individual basis, that's right.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That's right.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
So that way it was not made for the day, obviously, they could not do that, because it takes a step there.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
That's right.

16:38.000 --> 16:45.000
The only reason for this question is that the record indicates that your apology is about to matter.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
And I just wondered whether that's backended into your apology, some frustration,

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
that having major trips up there, it was impossible for everyone to go into the lab.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
No, that wasn't it.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
My, I just like the use of that word apology, even though I used it as Mr. Jenkins' retic from the record,

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
I rethought about it, and I feel that it was much more in the nature of an explanation.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
But it wasn't a part of it.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
And it wasn't anything to do with the fact that plans have gotten complicated there.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
Anything I was just sorry that the colonel, anybody else, was the threat.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
You just described it a little while ago, that when General Parkridge was shifted from his position as Chief of G2,

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
there were also other changes in the stance, but you didn't particularize and say how many.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
Well, for example, the Vice Chief is that, and the Chief of Information,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
the mention too that I can think of a whole hand.

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
I've done a lot of other changes to the reticons, but I can't advise, get for you, if you'd like to have them, my senator.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Well, it isn't material, except to indicate whether this is a right self or whether or not,

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or not.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
The Chief of Staff is the organization, but he has the people that he wants,

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
the handle at tremendous jobs in the way that he thinks it should be held.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
Going back for a moment to the application of Mr. Shine for a commission,

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
did you examine the original application and are you familiar with what's in it?

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Now, I'm not personally familiar with that, but an application.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
There has been very little testimony that's gone, with respect to quantification,

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
but if you are not familiar with the application itself and what the events for recital are,

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
mainly the facts, where there would have to be the foundation for consideration,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
for information or for intelligence to take.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
I presume that the question ought to be directed to some other person,

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
so if you have no first answer in the reality with the application.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Question on question.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Now, I haven't studied the application first of all.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
That's all for the moment, Mr. Shine.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
How is that?

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
Uh, the structure is, uh,

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
a working rise to the release of the so-called chronology of events,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
which I think to release on March 11th,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
but gave rise to it here.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I was slightly under the Jackson, but it was, uh,

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
an increasing interest on the part of senators and congressmen on this hill,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
but gave rise to it.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Well, what time, uh,

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
did you reach the so-called breaking point, I mean, in your relationship with,

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
uh, the, uh, chairman of the committee and the staff?

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
I have, uh, listened very carefully to all of the event meeting,

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
telephone calls, and so on that occurred over, uh,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
a period of time dating back to your return to Montana.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
And I'm so happy your return from the party.

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
Uh, about what time did you decide to put down on paper

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
and what was going on and do something about it?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Well, this, uh, this, uh,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
chronology that you referred to was prepared, uh,

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
I would say during the first, uh, week or ten days of March.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Uh, before I try to get out of work,

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
was the breaking point.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
I mean, you, uh,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
had all these meetings and conversations,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
which later, uh, resulted in serious charges.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
What happened?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
What's the place that, uh,

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
made a necessary for you or someone under your direction to, uh,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
send the chronology of the event all right,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
you stay up and slow, and getting up,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
getting up, uh,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
maybe like one of them right there.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
I, I'm sitting over to find the table sign to find out just what went on.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
I mean, what happened was that there were, uh,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
uh, uh, these, the question of, uh,

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Sean, uh, signing at four-sticks,

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
as they come, a matter of some interest to the Congress of the United States.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
And, uh, we have received a fair number of letters in regards to the matter,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
uh, sending over to the several, several weeks.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And we acknowledge those letters,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
and so we will look at under the matter,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
and with the fire information may allow,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
well, the time went by,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
more injuries came in,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
and it finally got to the point,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
where this information has to be made available,

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
to just committee and to other members of the Congress to an environment for it.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, at what point in this, uh, chronology of the event,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
uh, you come to the conclusion that, uh,

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
the request that the man's made a view around fall and reach,

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
uh, has gone beyond the point of, uh, the pride.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
And you know, I will have any ideas.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I will say the best, uh, not, uh,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
began to, uh, to, uh,

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
if the information started to accumulate back during the early, uh,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
period of time, of, uh, Sean effect,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I have filled up in faithingly this time, one-on.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
You had reservations from the very beginning,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
and it was the cumulative sort of thing.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
Well, I, I won't say that I have reservations,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
but it's began to be a pass, uh, uh,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
the, uh, Mr. Sean was, uh,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
private Sean,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
was a, uh, something of a problem to the,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
demanding officer at Fort Dick,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
and it began to be, uh,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
come of the property over a period of time,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and members of the Congress,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
uh, were, uh,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
and was being rumored around that, uh,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
uh, request of an unusual nature

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
who are being made and they have put Mr. Shine,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
to the death of Rhyma Garamon.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Well now,

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
who prepared this, uh,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
technology of the van?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Do I understand that it was a Mr. Brown

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
and Mr. Hempel-Balberts?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
That's right.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Now, uh,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
according to the case of the security,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
the two-ass students of World Report Parts,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
well, 1954, which the Army of your target,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
and the charge is, uh,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
uh, Santa MacArthur and the staff work, uh,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
but it was stated that, uh,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
the report that it's not a report,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
it is John Adams version of the situation,

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
this is coming from,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
I believe, uh, Santa MacArthur and, uh, Mr. Cohen,

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Mr. Caw.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And I, this is the direct vote.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
It is not a report,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
it is John Adams version of the situation.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
There has been issued a press discharge,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
on true version written by a man,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
who has a special interest in the situation.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Well, of course, I think that is completely inaccurate,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
and in itself unfair,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
that statement is not true.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
No, no, no.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Now, uh,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
could you tell a committee?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
A line of them, Mr. Brown,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Mr. Hempel-Balberts prepared this.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
That's right.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Why was it sent to the department of the van?

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
So, they said a pilot wrote the secretary of the van,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
a letter on the subject stated the,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I think it was the eighth of March.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
And he put down some very pointed questions,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
and, uh,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
the secretary of the van,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
wanted to be in a position to answer

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
by the pilot's letter.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I make the analysis.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I don't think I have a suspect there,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
I need to break in,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
but, well, we choose, uh,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
the van in material,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
but it's prepared for your office,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
and the secretary of the van forgives your fault,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
that's what,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
but, excuse me.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Well, I ask the question,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
does the scientist find the experiment,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
the man's question?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Would you ask how the van does the pilot,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
the big inverter,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
is he normally, when the letter is back,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and the secretary of the van is lettering for it?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Relating to the Arnold,

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
when the Arnold,

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
normally prepared that information,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
and forwarded to the secretary,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
and then the secretary of the van,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
the required, uh, covering the information,

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
and then by the arms.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
That, uh, yes,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
that's right, when they happen,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
that in there,

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
that's the normal procedure.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
And that's right,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
and all of our,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
not done,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
but, uh, uh, uh,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
John Adams,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
the department counselor,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
and I think that has already been on fire,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
but, uh, the department is a bachelor,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
and I'm a bachelor.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I'm a family,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
and I only have six months.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Thank you, partner.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Does that tell the time it up?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Thank you, Mrs. Masek.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Yes.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Thank you, Mrs. Masek.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Thank you, Mrs. Masek.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Thank you, Mrs. Masek.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Thank you, Mrs. Masek.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I, I afford the ministry's fire.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Hahaha!

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Hahaha!

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Uh, Mr. Staden,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
can you tell us about Mr. Green,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
whereby we are,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
we've had a task,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
at four, six,

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
to five and a time.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
Uh, let me just,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
continue on,

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
while stating that according to the Army's report,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
on December 6, 1953,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
General Ryan,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
fellow phone minister Adam,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
report, just stated the matter

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
of handling by the time,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
was becoming an speaking-way,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
difficult, sensitive soldier,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
resuming the Pope nearly every night.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Now, on page 11 of your statements,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I please rise,

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
or I'm not having a bureaucrat in the church.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Your code is saying,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
if you total General Ryan,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
that's signed to be made available,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
a final report of the committee staff,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
over a weekend,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
one requires to complete signs,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
work for the committee,

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
and provide that it did not interfere with his claim.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Then, uh,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
the statement of

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
charges,

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
submitted by Senator McCarty,

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
a paragraph 13,

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
of the charges stated by folks,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
to call participation and arrangements

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
to have tried to chime to vote many hours,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
over and above Army training,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
which could otherwise have been sent in a recreation,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
to the completion of vital committee work,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
a request for preferential treatment to five reasons.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
All such arrangements were made

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
with the full concerns of Mr. Stevens.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Thank you.
