WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.300
about the hit the range or whatever it was.

00:06.300 --> 00:18.520
F4 Dick first was it understood that private shines could leave the port at night after the

00:18.520 --> 00:25.520
completion of his training was just weekend or was it any time that somebody requested

00:25.520 --> 00:28.520
his really poor committee work.

00:28.520 --> 00:38.420
I'll start at any time that the committee actually needed him for work providing a

00:38.420 --> 00:44.380
good end of bear with his training and also providing that it was under sound lines

00:44.380 --> 00:49.820
jurisdiction to make it a termination of whether or not it complied with those provisions.

00:49.820 --> 00:57.020
But you see on your statement of charges I believe on page 11 you say that you

00:57.020 --> 01:02.260
told General Ryan that he should be made available on the request of the committee staff

01:02.260 --> 01:03.260
over weekend.

01:03.260 --> 01:10.820
Now I'm not kidding what was the operating arrangement of the port case or who I was

01:10.820 --> 01:15.820
to may not have been a resident of that but I mean what sort of an understanding was

01:15.820 --> 01:21.820
that General operating under I think if the General Ryan followed a bit difficult to

01:21.820 --> 01:22.820
carry out his directive.

01:22.820 --> 01:23.820
That's right.

01:23.820 --> 01:30.720
It was the original arrangement you'll recall from an exact temporary duty for your

01:30.720 --> 01:37.720
committee.

01:37.720 --> 01:52.440
Then that was changed to being available for committee work on board dicts when actually

01:52.440 --> 01:59.440
needed by the committee and providing a good enough bear with his training.

01:59.440 --> 02:06.940
At first that was believed in the nature of weekend but when the question came up the

02:06.940 --> 02:14.240
needed for on an evening during the course of a week was wouldn't he be made available

02:14.240 --> 02:19.440
providing a legitimate committee business and did not interfere with his training.

02:19.440 --> 02:26.440
That's also was permitted subject to General Ryan's view of the individual situation.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.440
You have a final word?

02:29.440 --> 02:37.440
I want to tell the chair that I have something that I consider of extreme importance

02:37.440 --> 02:38.440
regarding this investigation.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.440
If my turn comes up by a message I'm going to take.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
Thank you.

02:43.440 --> 02:50.440
May the chair ask the time he for not to take from Senator Muddly's time to answer your secretary's

02:50.440 --> 02:54.440
statements which are the transmissions he has time to spare nobody else.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.440
I'm sorry, Senator Muddly.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.440
This is Secretary of State.

02:59.440 --> 03:06.440
I would like to say this that I am neither a comfortable for any of the parties in the

03:06.440 --> 03:11.440
Parliament or a dinner, neither am I a devil's advocate in this Parliament.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.440
I would like to ask this one question.

03:15.440 --> 03:24.440
Is it not a fact that there was an arrangement from like full order revenge that was prepared

03:24.440 --> 03:27.440
in your own or in the Parliament?

03:27.440 --> 03:34.440
I would say there was a pile of papers sent at a potter, finding a lot of material which

03:34.440 --> 03:41.440
was done separately put together into this analogy and everything that was in that pile

03:41.440 --> 03:43.440
was available to this committee.

03:43.440 --> 03:52.440
Is it not a fact that certain states would now appear in your statement of the case?

03:52.440 --> 04:02.440
The main available request, the opinion request, that will require to be trying that

04:02.440 --> 04:11.440
the members of Congress receive the chronological order revenge which you have committed.

04:11.440 --> 04:18.440
That may be a social part of us just so out of our house, out of our job.

04:18.440 --> 04:25.440
If you have no knowledge yet to whether that so-called lead came from the Army or the mother's office,

04:25.440 --> 04:32.440
or I can say it, I can only speak to myself and I assure you that it did not come from me.

04:32.440 --> 04:44.440
Have you heard that a lead had been made in the Department of Army concerning the final

04:44.440 --> 04:45.440
of the court of the event?

04:45.440 --> 04:49.440
People or members of the Congress received the report.

04:49.440 --> 04:55.440
Or you may notice the analogy of the final of the matter to the committee,

04:55.440 --> 04:59.440
not as finely-fimilied but in its original form.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.440
And for the repeat that question for me, kind of a personal answer for a lead.

05:04.440 --> 05:10.440
Well, the question is the fact that you knew whether you had any personal knowledge

05:10.440 --> 05:19.440
or the members of your staff, headly, with information through the press prior to the time

05:19.440 --> 05:26.440
that the members of Congress received the final of the court of the event to the final fall.

05:26.440 --> 05:32.440
I know you can now have the information contained in its original form or in the state of mind.

05:32.440 --> 05:38.440
I know of course that there was a original form as you call it, Senator.

05:38.440 --> 05:45.440
And I heard that there were news folks or people who were aware of what was in that.

05:45.440 --> 05:55.440
But I personally didn't have a copy of it and I certainly had nothing to do with any link in connection with it.

05:55.440 --> 06:01.440
I know I did hear a little lesson with a headly, heeched and did you question any of your staff

06:01.440 --> 06:05.440
as to whether they had any information through the press?

06:05.440 --> 06:12.440
I didn't personally question them now, but I didn't know they could watch you say it did leak.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.440
Who saw it or why not? I don't know.

06:14.440 --> 06:22.440
It was more like an open ticket to work with a back and it was more like an open ticket for about a month.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.440
That the army had this position this before.

06:25.440 --> 06:35.440
Based upon the right-matter information that came to my attention, I assumed the retention of other members of Congress,

06:35.440 --> 06:45.440
the basis for my request, if the army had this information, the committee certainly could receive it,

06:45.440 --> 06:48.440
which could take full action to make this happen.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.440
Oh sure, I certainly agree with that.

06:50.440 --> 06:56.440
I know that a number of people saw the report that you were referring to,

06:56.440 --> 07:01.440
and have it at late for my Tuesdays, some newspaper people saw it,

07:01.440 --> 07:05.440
and I would be surprised if the money I had had any copy of it.

07:05.440 --> 07:13.440
Now when there comes here knowledge that the Department of Army, the PPA,

07:13.440 --> 07:23.440
the final logical test of this conversation, it came to my knowledge that my return from the far east on the third of February,

07:23.440 --> 07:28.440
you had no knowledge of the prior to that time. That's correct.

07:28.440 --> 07:36.440
Now if I may switch to another topic, there are many topic zamolace in this box.

07:36.440 --> 07:44.440
There's much to discuss in concerning the numbers of persons without a stop moment,

07:44.440 --> 07:48.440
because they were security risks.

07:48.440 --> 08:03.440
Yes, now how many of the men that were suspended as security risks were suspended without the army having any prior knowledge

08:03.440 --> 08:08.440
of the worst security risks until the Send and the Mafia Committee started investigating.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.440
The first single one, as far as I can recall, in other words,

08:11.440 --> 08:20.440
it's your testimony that the army had a report and they were investigating all the importance

08:20.440 --> 08:26.440
that were later on were separated as security risks.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.440
As far as I know that, it's correct.

08:29.440 --> 08:35.440
I would like to revert to your statement.

08:35.440 --> 08:43.440
I'm interested to get a picture of interest to me, and I would like to ask if one question on here,

08:43.440 --> 08:49.440
your report, of the final article, you bet.

08:49.440 --> 08:55.440
How many other members of the team were requested this report?

08:55.440 --> 09:02.440
I think that there was something like eight or ten, Senator.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.440
Eight or ten members of the team.

09:05.440 --> 09:13.440
I think as long as my name has been brought into the question of asking for a report, I can say this.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.440
Am I the chief of my report?

09:17.440 --> 09:22.440
The only person who found out the report others in my stuff,

09:22.440 --> 09:27.440
was the sender of party, the sender of veterans, and the sender of the Mafia.

09:27.440 --> 09:34.440
So the publication of this report was not found from Iowa.

09:34.440 --> 09:43.440
Now that's the statement, I would interested in the annual statement that every day has 12 points.

09:43.440 --> 09:54.440
So the effort made on behalf of the committee staff to secure a practical statement for it, but you're shy.

09:54.440 --> 10:01.440
I know that efforts were made to relieve Mr. Kine from state duties.

10:01.440 --> 10:08.440
Would you elaborate on that, because it happened one night, in my first 24 hours in the army,

10:08.440 --> 10:13.440
and I was 17 hours on V.D., and I have a little first and one piece of wrong.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.440
The action can be done.

10:16.440 --> 10:21.440
Senator, I can't give you the details of the death zone habit.

10:21.440 --> 10:28.440
General Ryan, however, is available and will testify if you wish him with respect to all of these cases.

10:28.440 --> 10:36.440
I just want to say that I have not been able to follow all of them by their activities of either China or other private.

10:36.440 --> 10:41.440
I have to say that I have to go to the U.S. Army.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.440
We've got a lot of problems we have to do with suit.

10:43.440 --> 10:48.440
But General Ryan, would they like to give us a detail on it?

10:48.440 --> 10:56.440
You know whether the private China was released in KP shooting or not, it's my impression that he was released.

10:56.440 --> 11:05.440
But I'm not sure that I'd rather have General Ryan put the fly on it.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.440
I have a few questions.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.440
A couple of minutes.

11:10.440 --> 11:17.440
The secretary, I have a few questions here.

11:17.440 --> 11:25.440
I understand it's ingest is by the draft board or the records and the organization itself or not under the army.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.440
Is that correct? That's correct.

11:28.440 --> 11:38.440
The point you mentioned that the army at Fort Mon was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with the SPAN at the Fort Mon.

11:38.440 --> 11:42.440
I don't want to take my 10 minutes and having explained that to me.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.440
I would appreciate your making up for the records.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.440
Some details with respect to that situation that you feel the public could know about.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.440
In other words, what was the nature of the relationship?

11:53.440 --> 11:55.440
How were they working with the army? Right Fort Mon?

11:55.440 --> 11:59.440
When you do that for the records, yes, my amethyst is my standard.

11:59.440 --> 12:06.440
I'm in my eye. Fort Mon is that who wrote the SPI I'm doing at the court?

12:06.440 --> 12:08.440
I'd like to ask this question.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.440
You're the head of the army or a general rich way.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.440
I'm not a god.

12:11.440 --> 12:18.440
Usually in civilian control or the military service, I do.

12:18.440 --> 12:30.440
Do you consider that as the function of a secretary to have a department put in the best possible, the most proper position in the Congress and the people with the Congress and the people?

12:30.440 --> 12:32.440
Yes, I do.

12:32.440 --> 12:39.440
Would you consider it proper to do your best to have the army with you ahead in yourself?

12:39.440 --> 12:43.440
To be in the best possible position with this committee?

12:43.440 --> 12:46.440
I'm not sure if I'll repeat it.

12:46.440 --> 12:55.440
Would you consider it proper to do your best to have the army with you ahead in yourself to intern be in the best possible position it can be with this committee?

12:55.440 --> 12:58.440
Well, I want to do the best I can on my own first.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.440
Let's committee on the other committee.

13:00.440 --> 13:09.440
Would your interest in stopping the committee's investigation at Fort Mon was for stopping the public today or who or what?

13:09.440 --> 13:13.440
I would not want to stop the investigation.

13:14.440 --> 13:26.440
I wanted to change the nature of the hearing or at least have the publicity that was given out of come near to reflecting the actual facts from the case of Fort Mon.

13:26.440 --> 13:38.440
Now, Mr. Secretary, if the committee of the Congress with proper authority expresses interest in any particular situation, does not that mean that that particular situation is automatically extradited in the army itself?

13:38.440 --> 13:40.440
Yes, sir.

13:40.440 --> 13:47.440
Now, the next question I'd like to ask Mr. Secretary, as I understand that you did not prepare these charges, is that correct?

13:47.440 --> 13:48.440
That's right.

13:48.440 --> 13:53.440
If you had a preparedness, did our numbers they were signed by your council, Mr. Welch?

13:53.440 --> 13:54.440
That's right.

13:54.440 --> 14:03.440
If you had a preparedness following the pressing of the chairman, would you have left an aim to call out, but I've left an aim with the call out?

14:03.440 --> 14:05.440
No, I don't have one of the three principles.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.440
I don't think so.

14:07.440 --> 14:12.440
Well, I'd like to say that Mr. Bartent is Mr. Secretary. I wasn't very happy about your reply.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.440
So, the question is personally, I don't know if that's in order to say it.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.440
I've gained out there, I'm the lawyer.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.440
Now, I'd like to ask this question.

14:20.440 --> 14:32.440
There was some, I believe you said that Mr. Colme was assigned to New York before November 10th, and then the council said something about Mr. Colme not being in the army until November 10th.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.440
I'm not sure if that's wrong, would you?

14:34.440 --> 14:36.440
I'm not sure if it's right.

14:36.440 --> 14:43.440
The reason of plan was to put him on temporary duty at first time here in New York.

14:43.440 --> 14:48.440
I'm the very few, since that day, which was November 1st.

14:48.440 --> 14:58.440
Shortly thereafter, I've done it in my car to be indicated that he would like to have that temporary duty in New York, Council.

14:58.440 --> 15:13.440
I'm there, Mr. Colme, indicators that as long as the week has moved along a certain amount of time, he thought that time should stay all over the weekend in order to do somebody work.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.440
I was not.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.440
I didn't mean it in a rush, it's finished.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.440
I'd like to ask this question another way.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.440
And at the time, you had a wife.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.440
In the panic I'm dealing with Mr. Shine and the army or whether he not.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.440
He was.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.440
Now my final question is secretary.

15:29.440 --> 15:37.440
Whatever the agreement was with respect to Mr. Shine, why was it made and how it was violated?

15:37.440 --> 15:46.440
In other words, if it was agreed that Mr. Shine should be off every night, then why is the army complaint when he did get off?

15:47.440 --> 15:56.440
If it's not agreed that he should get off, then why did Joe Ryan have to telephone to get permission to get him off?

15:56.440 --> 15:58.440
The same today is some difference there.

15:58.440 --> 16:05.440
Well the agreement was that Mr. Shine was to be available for committee business.

16:05.440 --> 16:09.440
And I do there is thing to be a lot of committee business.

16:10.440 --> 16:24.440
Well I don't wish to pursue it, but if the agreement was that he could be off for committee business and his statement made where he was going to be off for committee business, then why is the violation of an agreement?

16:24.440 --> 16:31.440
Well perhaps that may be involved with the question of what is committee business.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.440
Well who decided that it wasn't committee business?

16:35.440 --> 16:37.440
Who decided it wasn't?

16:38.440 --> 16:43.440
I mean it was a first association, but it was not an association training center.

16:43.440 --> 16:48.440
Of course it was that association that General Ryan had that.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.440
That was probably agreement and the trial and it was his statement made.

16:52.440 --> 16:56.440
At the number of times he was there to get all the opportunity that he was sitting in the deal with his training.

16:56.440 --> 17:00.440
If it did, then he was not supposed to get off for a deal.

17:01.440 --> 17:10.440
In your opinion, General Ryan had been in the field of his training, I would have done a lot of fun because he actually knows.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.440
I have no further questions to share at this time.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.440
I'm going to go check.

17:16.440 --> 17:20.440
Mr. Wells, you now have 10 minutes and see my report.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.440
Thank you very much.

17:23.440 --> 17:30.440
Small amount of money asked only one question which I only have to be dealt with in the form of a space in the Milo.

17:30.440 --> 17:37.440
If there's a fact that it stays into specifications that were drawn and signed by me as your counsel,

17:37.440 --> 17:40.440
we're drawn without your active participation.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.440
That's correct. I'm short note.

17:43.440 --> 17:51.440
Henry, did you learn that Mr. Wells, same player as I worked overtime, and where I had to die from the minds that they were prepared?

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
I thought so much.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.440
I'm just a call.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.440
Mr. Wells, this one minute has been signed by me for a year.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.440
And that's another of my calls.

18:04.440 --> 18:13.440
I have one of those, my country rules, the standards of the training you have under the top job and the federal bureau of Medicaid to come with our commitment.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.440
Now I'm in.

18:18.440 --> 18:31.440
In the specifications by the money, there are here many jobs that in pop and means are used to get a financial treatment.

18:31.440 --> 18:42.440
For Mr. Shaw, my new job is to write a call on October 7, 1963 in that Mr. Shaw on that day tonight, 12.

18:43.440 --> 18:53.440
So as you can do for this way, the secretary of the economy, gives you a sometimes vital assignment and sometimes special treatment.

18:53.440 --> 18:57.440
Now is that charge made by you true or is it false?

18:57.440 --> 19:02.440
And I think in just a minute, the call actually acknowledged at this time.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.440
That's what check for me.

19:13.440 --> 19:25.440
While Secretary Stevens is checking that information, I might say that Senator McCrypton left the questioning over to his subcommittee council,

19:25.440 --> 19:35.440
why Cohen has now returned to the room and they are put together just the secretary of the state and Mr. Sinclair, one of the Army council.

19:36.440 --> 19:55.440
Also, well, Mr. Cohen is a wife I've said before in my mind, but the car was not nearly as active in that conversation as you were.

19:55.440 --> 20:02.440
But he was there and my president took a lesser part in it.

20:02.440 --> 20:12.440
Mr. Stevens, will you tell Senator Munts, please, sir, and the committee, one word that was spoken by Cohen Shaw about Dave Shine on that day?

20:12.440 --> 20:15.440
Our tax call, they call it that word.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.440
He recall that any word was spoken by him about Dave Shine on that day.

20:19.440 --> 20:26.440
I will call that he in a minor way back to us in connection with the statement that you were making.

20:26.440 --> 20:44.440
Mr. Stevens is not a fact that in the series of events, the 34 days before released by the Army, under date of launch, the 11th, 1953, in giving a detailed recital of what took place on November, on October 2nd, he specifically said that

20:44.440 --> 20:51.440
well, the talking about Dave Shine has been done by me and you did not even mention Mr. Carl's name.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.440
So I said that Mr. Carl's name, a minor part, so I said that.

20:54.440 --> 21:04.440
Sir, I'm not, I'm starting to ask now whether Mr. Carl's name is any part, and if he did, I would like to tell you, I would like you to tell us when he just worked hard, he did play.

21:34.440 --> 21:43.440
He sure really is a better student, all of us, and he is a very important student, he wouldn't have had any of his control flow in common,

21:43.440 --> 21:53.440
but those applications, the kinds he pushes, take out of the cabinet, so that, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.440
Mr. Chairman, as you mentioned, he's not had any of that.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.440
Mr. Chairman, Ralph, Ralph, I'm not just Steven, I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.

22:00.440 --> 22:10.440
May I point to Mr. Chairman Ralph, I have a question for an unknown chair, because I was interviewing him with him the other day.

22:10.440 --> 22:16.440
So my fingers will have the information, for me, it's important to do this committee.

22:16.440 --> 22:22.440
I am seeing him again tonight, that will give the chair a report to more and more.

22:22.440 --> 22:26.440
I will be told ten minutes, that's all I have to say.

22:27.440 --> 22:40.440
Well, my recollection remains as I've indicated, namely that Mr. R. Okay, minor parts in this particular discussion.

22:40.440 --> 22:51.440
Mr. Steven, in the only event we now, on a status to serve, you are the only possible witness on your guided to this particular time to say,

22:52.440 --> 22:57.440
are you not the only three people who are present with your self, Mr. Karl and myself?

22:57.440 --> 23:02.440
So they couldn't, on a vital idea, you have a minor in the machine installed in your office to say,

23:02.440 --> 23:04.440
what's your guess date? I do not, I think.

23:04.440 --> 23:10.440
So, the only three people there with your self, my self and Mr. Karl, that right, is for us.

23:10.440 --> 23:20.440
So, if there were any improv conduct by Mr. Karl, if he had used any improv on me to get preferential treatment for private shine or anyone else,

23:20.440 --> 23:24.440
you would be the only one in position to know that other than that, right?

23:24.440 --> 23:33.440
I know, what I mean to say, you would be the only source of information from Mr. R. and the other people drawing up this account of what happens in your office.

23:33.440 --> 23:40.440
On our public deck, and one only three people in the world, that's a very Steven, Karl and Karl were present.

23:40.440 --> 23:46.440
I would now ask you, whether it's not a fact that when you gave a full account of what happened on that day,

23:46.440 --> 23:58.440
in the Army events, number six stated October through 1953, you specifically said that the discussion about shine was stated by Mr. Karl,

23:58.440 --> 24:04.440
and that there is no mention whatsoever of Mr. Frank Karl having participated in that conversation.

24:04.440 --> 24:08.440
Well, certainly that's true, because I wasn't leaving Mr. Karl any part of the conversation.

24:08.440 --> 24:12.440
I am now saying he did that as my own community benefit, as we might like to watch.

24:12.440 --> 24:22.440
Would you tell us any one thing? I cannot tell you. I say you did most of the talking, and Karl got two off the line I referred to as a minor or left or right.

24:22.440 --> 24:26.440
Can you remember one word that Mr. Karl said on the subject of shine?

24:26.440 --> 24:28.440
I say it on my own, my own way.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.440
You may have no control.

24:30.440 --> 24:37.440
Well, certainly Steven, I haven't found a follow-up. Your chemistry is both to Sun for a month and the other summer is...

24:37.440 --> 24:49.440
Mr. Karl was asked about this. You say that Karl backed up Mr. Karl, and you may be back to him up by silent, or back him up by conversation.

24:49.440 --> 24:53.440
If you back him up by conversation, then let's have a conversation.

24:53.440 --> 24:59.440
Well, he first of all, he does nothing to stop him from the conversation.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.440
He's all at the rear left.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.440
From the rear left one.

25:03.440 --> 25:08.440
And second way is to call him with most of the talking as the chronology indicates.

25:08.440 --> 25:18.440
But Mr. Karl, in my recollection, all those get left away, left away, left away, left the same thing.

25:18.440 --> 25:23.440
Look, look, look, look, you're choosing to bring fire to something very serious.

25:23.440 --> 25:27.440
You say that he's got to be improperly influenced here.

25:27.440 --> 25:31.440
Now, if he says something to them proper, we shouldn't know what he said.

25:31.440 --> 25:37.440
If he doesn't say anything to proper, if he can't remember anything improper, then you should tell him.

25:37.440 --> 25:41.440
I think you were trying to give us an honest account.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.440
That's right.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.440
Some of my friends are going to be with us.

25:44.440 --> 25:48.440
And they say, I had myself a 29.

25:48.440 --> 25:51.440
I think it's only fair to do.

25:51.440 --> 25:57.440
To tell our boss, Frank Karl, this is improper.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.440
Well, I can't wait.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.440
You are. You took your doing your job.

26:00.440 --> 26:05.440
You asked me the young man for this charity job because of the improper conduct.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.440
And you can't tell us what it is.

26:07.440 --> 26:13.440
Well, some of the, the part of the army has put in this bill of the secular.

26:13.440 --> 26:19.440
And I think that there will be a little material that will come before the combinatorial bear.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.440
I just mentioned this.

26:21.440 --> 26:25.440
If not your combinatorial yield from out.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.440
You say the army put in the air bill.

26:27.440 --> 26:31.440
Number one, the army did not put in the bill of the secular.

26:31.440 --> 26:35.440
You and Mr. Adams put in the bill of the secular.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.440
Now, we're talking about one classification.

26:39.440 --> 26:43.440
Honorable Mr. Karl, Mr. Cohn, here's to the bill of the secular.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.440
Mr. Karl, Mr. Cohn, here's to the bill of the secular.

26:48.440 --> 26:53.440
The designer about October 2, 1963, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Frank's side,

26:53.440 --> 26:58.440
executive director of the functionality, filed a discussion of the charity plan

26:58.440 --> 27:02.440
for the sum of the political engineering, but also for the support of the military of the army,

27:02.440 --> 27:09.440
to arrange for the assignment of the military shine to oppose them in the New York City area,

27:09.440 --> 27:14.440
upon his induction of the army, on the ground, the logisticist considered his viral,

27:14.440 --> 27:18.440
unbiased, coloned, and the military shine available for consultation.

27:18.440 --> 27:21.440
For the fact that the sub-s militias complete certain work,

27:21.440 --> 27:24.440
with which the law is not signed for many, now,

27:24.440 --> 27:29.440
the only witness out of the Mr. Karl and Mr. Cohn,

27:29.440 --> 27:31.440
who can testify that is yourself,

27:31.440 --> 27:35.440
that's right, this for this classification must be based upon you,

27:35.440 --> 27:39.440
states, and I assume, to your counsel.

27:40.440 --> 27:44.440
Now, just for you, I'm not trying to entrap you at all.

27:44.440 --> 27:51.440
I'm paid, I think it's like a deal with me on that.

27:51.440 --> 27:58.440
I'm paid 226, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Jenkins, perhaps just first.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.440
You look over the floor, and I can't see you, Mr. Cohn, what else?

28:01.440 --> 28:03.440
Insofar, what are you?

28:03.440 --> 28:07.440
Do you mean with respect to David Cyan, Mr. Jenkins?

28:08.440 --> 28:12.440
Did Mr. Karl make any statement of that conference

28:12.440 --> 28:15.440
and did he receive the shine?

28:15.440 --> 28:19.440
Answer, this is on last Friday, Bob.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.440
I do not work once again.

28:21.440 --> 28:25.440
I just become the place of our trial, you know?

28:25.440 --> 28:27.440
Now, I think you should tell us today,

28:27.440 --> 28:30.440
whether you were attempting that testimony,

28:30.440 --> 28:33.440
why you are trying to get so far,

28:34.440 --> 28:38.440
you're gonna lie to the side, what are you putting in the line?

28:38.440 --> 28:40.440
There's something occurred,

28:40.440 --> 28:43.440
you make a change in your mind.

28:43.440 --> 28:47.440
Well, I thought of that, I thought you had one minute,

28:47.440 --> 28:52.440
one minute, I'm gonna go ahead and back before the committee.

28:52.440 --> 28:56.440
You do, Mr. Secretary, it's not, I wonder if I can have the young man here.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.440
You're just moving one side, so I just do this.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.440
242, get down to the floor.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.440
I just say, I know when you were,

29:03.440 --> 29:06.440
when one is holding a memory of fire,

29:06.440 --> 29:11.440
I'm holding mine and my efforts to get all effects before the committee.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.440
I truly heard a lot of things that took over the hall.

29:14.440 --> 29:19.440
The Ractic Dermination, I couldn't recollect any specific time.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.440
I'm not a part of the R&D,

29:21.440 --> 29:24.440
but it's a lot of different now, so I'm going to take a picture.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.440
Can I give you a few?

29:25.440 --> 29:26.440
Yes.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.440
Here is the emotional story of the day.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.440
What a reason was that?

29:30.440 --> 29:32.440
Well, no man was there, right?

29:32.440 --> 29:33.440
You immediately.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.440
Sure, you say the French side, the French side,

29:35.440 --> 29:37.440
the French side, we've ruined you.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.440
You do that very well on the table.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.440
One way, you say the French side,

29:41.440 --> 29:43.440
the French side, the French side,

29:43.440 --> 29:46.440
the French side, you go through the proper.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.440
You see a film on the floor?

29:48.440 --> 29:49.440
And you say you say not.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.440
Maybe you can film it, maybe you can.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.440
You don't know what you think you do it, maybe you can do this, salad.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.440
Now I want to tell you something,

29:56.440 --> 29:58.440
I'm a bit of a joke about my human life,

29:58.440 --> 30:00.440
and I'm a human life, I'm a little bit of yourself.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.440
Ah, Mr. Egg.

30:06.440 --> 30:09.440
Mr. Stevens, I'll ask you this question.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.440
It's so elementary, I thought it was one of my friends.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.440
Right?

30:15.440 --> 30:17.440
Intentioned by...

30:18.440 --> 30:21.440
...the general security line, we've been out there.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.440
Out there?

30:22.440 --> 30:23.440
Did he always...

30:23.440 --> 30:26.440
...just to call over anytime, making his choice?

30:27.440 --> 30:29.440
Send the security out to the youth.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.440
If he's doing my heart,

30:31.440 --> 30:33.440
I'm asking what I've left behind,

30:33.440 --> 30:34.440
I'm asking you to come to my office,

30:34.440 --> 30:35.440
Mr. Stevens.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.440
I'm asking you to come to my office,

30:38.440 --> 30:40.440
I think you should just tune in,

30:40.440 --> 30:43.440
as the air, our latest air,

30:43.440 --> 30:44.440
that's for the monsoon,

30:44.440 --> 30:46.440
all off to the front of the house.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.440
Thank you.
