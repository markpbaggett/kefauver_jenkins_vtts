WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
That's right.

00:02.000 --> 00:08.000
You and I, after we left Mr. Kona outside, went to the laboratory, didn't we?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Yes, sir.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
And then we've tried to go around the wheel again.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Mr. Takeun, I passed on the mishallon.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
I passed.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Thank you.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Are all the funnogies in my left?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Of course.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Good work.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Good work.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Mr. Seaton, as we walked through the laboratories, we discussed what was the most important

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
of the patient's irritation, Mr. Kona, prior to these activities, didn't we?

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
Well, I think I became more aware of Mr. Kona's irritation after I came out of the lab, and I did pour one in.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
And you and I talked to Mr. Kona, not to present about this in place.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
I don't recall if we did, Senator.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Well, then, didn't I find you, Mr. Secretary, that happy to invite it down there, look over the installation.

00:53.000 --> 01:02.000
He being my chief of staff, having been the principal prosecutor in the Rosenberg case, one of the lawyers in the Remington case,

01:02.000 --> 01:12.000
one of the principal lawyers in the prosecution of the 11th Communist, but he had single handedly presented the communist cases to the UN.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
I got a present from pointing out the infiltration of communist and government in the UN from the grand jury,

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
that while he was doing that, he obviously had to have the top moral secret clearance and so far as all justice department records were concerned,

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
and that therefore, it was quite an insult to him to make you stand outside the door, cooling your heels,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
asking him to write it down, to inspect the laboratories, and I told you that I had such a good man mistake,

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
but I said, just forget about a body of the work at all life, and I agreed that it was a mistake to keep him out,

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
and Roy was not carrying his jurisdiction along, and actually by the time one time came around, you and Mr. Korn are ribbing each other,

01:57.000 --> 02:07.000
and as I recall, didn't you tell you that he hoped today would come that he would have the same privileges to get into the laboratories of the security risks that you're suspending we're having,

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
isn't that an orc long question, isn't that substantially a triforizome of the conversation we had with that aspect?

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
My recollection. You want one, and have I give you?

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
Well, you said a great many things that have happened in there that I don't recall having them set at all, and I did not agree that Roy Cohn should have been led in the laboratory.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
And I think that the decision that I made on the spot was a difficult one, and I had no desire to offend anybody,

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
but when I decided that we had led in, the people only rose so that they elected by the people of the United States to the senator to house, I think I made a correct decision.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Mr. David Van Macht, question whether you may have expected this, and I don't think it's a moment.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Ladies and gentlemen, whether or not you interrupt the program, will I bring you a special bulletin from the New Martin Israel?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I think that's a completely important point, is that you have charged here.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Vanera Lignare has been asked for file of the N Gen-Soo.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Vanera Lignare, for the name of the Portus, was conquered by the coming of the Portus surrounding it.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
The French veneer announced the National Assembly, remained a text that's been fell into red hand.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
After 20 hours of struggle against the latest time in its honor, Scott.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
The treatment for one that followed the new promise of the New Martin Israel.

03:14.000 --> 03:24.000
In that, and you look at the reason, in the honor of October 20, 1953, and another occasion's Mr. Cohn made threatening and violent statements of Mr. Adams,

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
another concerning future investigation that has happened to the Army, and excited his insolence over the center of a country,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
releasing the new statement in ten of the derogatory of the Army.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
Now, you still maintain anything that this has to do with private chains, this exclusive of Mr. Cohn from the Laboratories.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Is that correct?

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I contend that the incident at Fort Monmouth was part of a pattern.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And you think that's what you do with private chains?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes, sir.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Uh...

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Now, did you bring this look around for David today?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yes.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
We have a copy of it, Sarah.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Would you hand that up, I wonder?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
What's the answer?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Would you hand that up?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I wonder.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
What's the answer?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Would you hand that up?

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a fact that it has an audit produced by the chair.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
What's the answer?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's just a matter of time.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
That's great.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It has an audit produced by the chair.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
It's just a second one.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Before you do, would you look at him coming while I was pointed?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Hello?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yes, it is.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
And who has been at the field?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
George M. Gallagher.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
First Lieutenant.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
And where is George M. Gallagher located?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, at the time, this was taken.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I was at the...

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
I assume it was at Camp Kilmer.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I...

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm sorry.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
I say at the time, at the day that was taken,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I assume it was taken at Camp Kilmer,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
where a dental flicker at the commanding general.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Would you hand that up for the chair?

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, you're marking on this left hand.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Hmm?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Well, you have to be fine.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Right.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Right.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I'd like to share it, Caroline.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I don't want to go that this time.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I think the chair will recover from it.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
The recovery of the instrument happened at a speed,

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
compared to the foreign testimony of visiting...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
A serious deviation that we got yesterday,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
but we've had so much to be able to eat just as far as I can.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
The Chancellor makes much of a donation to the doctor.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Mr. Steven, the other day, you asked about the Inspector General's report

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
and the case of...

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
I just remember coming to Stolper,

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
have you expected Steven's ID report to be available?

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
The ID report has now been finished under the car seat,

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
and Inspector General is prepared to go over with my answer.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
First, the available opportunity that I had.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
How soon will that be for the Ministry of Education,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
the Ministry of Education for the Chair?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
We don't submit the...

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
We don't submit Inspector General's report.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
We'll give you the...

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Inspector Information that says...

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I have to be able to give you an ID report,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
but we do not submit the report.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Do you say you do not submit Inspector General's report?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I try to...

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
How about the Inspector General's report to you, Susan,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
and David Chan?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I just met him for a long time.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I can tell you his ID report.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I know.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I mean, the Secretary did not receive the report...

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And the Secretary had to answer that.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
That's not an idiot's record.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I'm sure we have not...

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
We have not officially enough.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
In other words, the ID report has been trained on available everything.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
I don't think that the ID final report is available on that.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It's a lot of material it's been used,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
which I think has been made available to committee.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
There was a Inspector General's investigation of Mr. Chan.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
That's right.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Inspector General has camped at Fort Debt.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And...

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Do you know the police request that was mail?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm so request-by-

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
No, sir, I don't know that now.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
No ideas.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I think it was General Ryan, probably.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Was that ID report leaked to anyone?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm Mr. Adam.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
I thought that was the other report you would have leaked to Lieutenant.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I thought it was the other thing that he could cut the file.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
The thing that intrigued me is that Mr. Chan was ordered not to discuss the report.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
So I'm not even telling the committee about the report, the allegations, I think.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
They couldn't tell the committee about the allegations.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And tonight, Chancellor, of course, also.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Can I pick up a pink sheet in New York?

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
And I find that the allegations are contained in that almost verbatim.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
For example, he was charged to walk in front of a jeep for the behind the jeep one time.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Violet and groove.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
But the other thing...

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I think you're understanding the President and the President could do just...

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
You were trying to strike Chan's in before, or to me, and being denied, Chancellor?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
No.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
The night council of the Inspector General has already been interrogating for...

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
That's a testimony of the record to be...

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
I think there's not a lot of other facts that the sheriff is trying all the way right for you.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I'll talk about this.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Mr. Stevens, I am continuing this.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I said a reason I missed this.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Your statements, you don't make the report available.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Mr. Pinkshake in New York, list of the allegations against.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
I say that he had walked in front of a jeep one day to the practice that had been handed.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I don't know, that is the result of our insurance or not.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
It's hopeful that he had shiny shoes downtown, safe towards the shiny himself.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Things like that line.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Can you tell us how, perhaps, I had to give it a report?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Got him the hands of newspapers?

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
I don't know, but I don't know what the safe star that involved or what the paper is you're referring to.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't know, I would imagine that that article probably came out maybe before the IZ before it.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
But even starter, I don't know.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Mr. Stevens, yesterday I handed you a list of seven mains.

09:36.000 --> 09:45.000
I asked him, I asked him, that time they made public because some of those mains made the able to prove that they are particularly common-foil Americans.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
They had been subpoenaed throughout the order to appear because of their communist connections and backgrounds.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
I have been finished by having been fired on the order and I wait for you.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I suppose I can start.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Mr. Stevens, can you stand in the phone?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I'm standing in my right.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
To my left.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
To the left.

10:03.000 --> 10:14.000
Mr. Stevens, can you tell us the fact that you said you wanted to send the nearly part from takeover this matter and investigate?

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Can you tell us what progress has been made and survived the subpoena concern?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I wish you wouldn't demand for this time.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
There was a section on the list that you handed me a letter.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
We'll only click my party.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
And as a six, four were out of the army.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
The four you put their names up with us.

10:31.000 --> 10:40.000
The other two have been under surveillance for two months and investigations while final determination is being made with respect to them.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
When were the four removed?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
After our investigation started.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
A four you asked for the name.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Nice to get the button.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
We had to discuss these a little bit.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
A six or seven, a hundred or seven.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
We discussed all the parts with your...

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
Over a few to time, the question is, where are they removed after the investigation started?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Before I sign, though, they were removed.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Before we had any conversation with your committee on that subject.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Could you give us a statement?

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
I don't have them here, but I'd get them for you.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Use them as they were removed before you had any conversation on that subject.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I don't think that was a statement of five.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
As far as I know, the chair has the secretary to give it to the committee.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And that will answer the question.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
We'll put the men if we may as one of Mr. X, Y, Z.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
But if you have an answer, my friend.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
One more of it.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
You have an answer, my friend.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
You have an answer, my friend.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
The last few other names they were removed after our investigation started.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
You said you thought they were removed before you had any conversation with us in regard to them.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
Now, would you go back to my question, where they were removed after our investigation of the communist infiltration of the Army with the mass?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Oh, yes.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Where they were?

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Before I sign, though, those cases were handled in the matter of our crime,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
prior to receipt of the committee's request for any places to give it to the committee.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Can you tell us, while they are now under suspension, or whether final action has been taken?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Final action on the floor.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
They have been final actions, correct?

12:12.000 --> 12:22.000
Now, Mr. Steven, there was a board called the Loyalty Security Training Board in your office, New South Office, right?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
That's right.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
There were some, how many people?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Some 30 on that, 25 and 30?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Yes, something on that order.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
And normally, how many were sent on any individual case?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Usually, about three.

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
So the demand for any might not come up for three, four, five, six months to be solved if any particular case, doesn't it?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Yes, it depends on now.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
But the amount of work and any time is a hundred.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
And this is the board upon which the Mr. X, we were discussing the other day with Mr. X.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
That's right.

12:56.000 --> 13:05.000
And I know from your, the date you were about, Adam Gailard, that he had sent him while the case was, he passed an average of once every five or six months.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
He's actually normal.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
What you were just saying.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I don't check that out.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm not quite sure.

13:15.000 --> 13:28.000
Mr. Smith, or, uh, Steven, again, I ask David because the fact you brought up the charges, not because I have any special significance to them.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
One of the charges, according to the information, is that Mr. Shane had issues commercially public.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Do you think that has a result of influence by the committee?

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Mostly.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
No, it was that he wore special gloves or mitts.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
He was called, we ever called, or anyone ever called, asked to be allowed to wear a glove that he bought himself, so the fingers separate from this.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I don't know anything about it, Adam.

13:57.000 --> 14:07.000
Uh, another is that, uh, writing back from the firearm brand, and one occasion, again, is the camp, rolled with the driver.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Do you think that's the result of any special pressure on the part of Mr. Cohn?

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Nothing about the tape that you're bringing out.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
So you don't, you certainly don't think it about it, do you?

14:17.000 --> 14:26.000
Brian, as I said, this investigation was determined whether or not Mr. Shane gets special consideration as a result of pressure by the committee.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
I'm not listening to some of the charges, I'm asking whether or not you feel that this was a result of any special consideration on the part of the committee.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
I know nothing about the instances you're talking about.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Have you looked over this?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I've been out talking about 65 telephone calls, 19 e-s.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
What did you think of the improper view of the fact that the effectiveness of the call-up and the middle of the investigation?

14:49.000 --> 14:57.000
Do you think of the improper for him to work evening on reports? Do you think of the improper when certain persons came up?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
And I thought witnesses interviewed Mr. Shane.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
If he did, why don't they both finish something?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Some of the committee would call Mr. Shane and ask you some information.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Do you think of the improper?

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
I think what he was supposed to be doing under the exception that I have outlined, it would not be improper.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Well, you know what he's raiding us when he finished with any...

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Did he finish with a raiding accident or something like that?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I think not.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You know what the raiding was?

15:21.000 --> 15:28.000
No, I don't. I know that this much in general that the raiding at Fort Dex was not particularly good.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It was very much.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
We interrupt the Army McCarty hearing to bring you a bulletin from the DuMont near the room.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Tell us.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Ranero Lignel has announced the fall of the N. Genpul.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
And thus the agony of the N. Genpul has ended in defeat for the Gallant French defenders.

15:47.000 --> 15:55.000
The Red Final has thought, same a few hours after the Communist commander hurled 20,000 men against the French banchaner Don.

15:55.000 --> 16:03.000
The N. Genpul fell after 56 days from the start of the Red Siege of the French abandoned in northwest Indochina.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
There were 56 days of struggle against overwhelming odds against the weather against the poor position.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
The announcement of the Fort Fall came from French banchaner Joseph Lignel in terror.

16:15.000 --> 16:24.000
He told the French National Assembly that the Red took the fort after the French struggled for 20 hours against the latest of the Red Humancy attack.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
A formal announcement also was made by Gond-Gindochina.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
In February, Lignel announced the fall of the N. Genpul.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Do a girlfriend set in the testimony by giving a lawyer your witness.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
Did you consider that unusual for a pilot's hearing?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I don't have any power to help this person.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm curious to know how my teeth are very strong and so they call them these girls.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm good at explaining the special consideration by some of them.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
As long as they did it at the proper time, I've been in a fairly strange way.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
The Fort Fall has been a special consideration by the French and the Red Committee.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Senator, I think that's a...

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
I don't know if they fail.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I don't know if they fail.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
Senator McCarthy, in all fairness to the witnesses, I think it should perhaps have been falsified in which they have...

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
I recall the witness was asked that question.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
There was no testimony of that fact.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
The witness, Mr. Steven, may be replied that he had no knowledge of it.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I think, because, Mr. POLIS, made a remote…

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
Well, General Baker did, however, an admiration to the nibics and those documents benefit the police.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
However, those claims can not分 within calling the defendant.

17:39.000 --> 17:49.000
Not only Abou-Due to some cult Borderball posts, with appearances of those who have been falsified and humiliated by all.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Mr. P. Schmidt, Dr. Officers and The French Pentional Council Court.

17:53.000 --> 18:08.380
The

18:08.380 --> 18:13.240
High

18:14.240 --> 18:16.360
Mr Cohen.

18:18.660 --> 18:23.180
Mr And so

18:29.680 --> 18:33.000
love Across

18:33.800 --> 18:38.300
I

18:42.560 --> 18:43.560
a

18:45.960 --> 18:49.800
we can call on witnesses who contest 좋아요 their own knowledge I hear all much better

18:51.940 --> 18:55.340
secretary I believed you told us now that the telephone calls

18:55.880 --> 18:58.060
monitored by Mr. Lucas were not

18:58.960 --> 19:02.780
that he did not monecke telephone calls from your family and

19:03.000 --> 19:07.280
I believe you said that White House calls were not monocles that's right that's right in other words

19:07.280 --> 19:08.280
for you felt that it was

19:08.480 --> 19:10.480
proper to monitor calls from

19:10.480 --> 19:16.480
People elected to the United States Senate, but it was not proper to monitor calls from people connected with the White House or other

19:16.480 --> 19:18.760
positive executive I essentially left in the back

19:18.760 --> 19:19.520
I just

19:19.520 --> 19:24.560
Felt by the exact pattern of operation that I found when I took over the office I made no change whatsoever

19:24.560 --> 19:31.480
Well, I don't know if my question is this during and I can only ask you about your administration during your administration

19:31.480 --> 19:39.360
Have you thought that it was proper to monitor calls with people elected senators elected by the people to the United States Senate

19:39.360 --> 19:45.360
But that was him proper to monitor calls with people working in the White House or the executive branch

19:46.480 --> 19:49.080
Basically one one has a call from the center

19:49.800 --> 19:50.800
There's something

19:50.800 --> 19:54.360
It's an information me or something of that kind now that's the

19:54.360 --> 19:56.760
I explain very carefully the office

19:57.760 --> 20:02.200
Expodize the work for the center that's the reason Mr. Lopez is on the phone

20:06.360 --> 20:08.360
I have a question

20:10.760 --> 20:12.760
I

20:12.760 --> 20:17.360
Information center you place to me and I have a David or a copy of an I have David of February

20:17.360 --> 20:19.360
2019 54 of General's liquor

20:19.360 --> 20:25.760
Make some requests for me and I was busy and that's the chairman what the request is and he's unable to enlighten me on the

20:50.360 --> 20:52.360
But

20:58.760 --> 21:00.760
He's

21:04.560 --> 21:06.560
The the

21:06.560 --> 21:08.560
The

21:09.760 --> 21:12.560
Glitter is one that has some sort of question

21:13.560 --> 21:17.480
I've asked for previously and when I wanted the council to be what

21:18.480 --> 21:20.480
Be to compare the

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
David

21:22.480 --> 21:24.480
With the

21:24.480 --> 21:27.480
Any major deviation that's

21:30.480 --> 21:32.480
That's the

21:35.480 --> 21:38.480
The

21:38.480 --> 21:39.480
The

21:39.480 --> 21:47.280
That is a committed document that is made such that I move that is be referred to the attorney general along with the sworn

21:47.480 --> 21:49.480
So that the attorney general may

21:49.480 --> 21:53.880
Of the arms that service was in use to come in combat

21:58.480 --> 22:03.880
Not of security clearance I understood in the Senate the first 19 and he's talking about possibility of part

22:05.480 --> 22:09.880
Right and all right, but if it is indicated that there's possible part

22:10.880 --> 22:12.880
triangle

22:15.880 --> 22:16.880
That

22:20.880 --> 22:22.880
Us

22:23.880 --> 22:28.880
Will

22:34.880 --> 22:35.880
On the

22:35.880 --> 22:37.980
kind of

22:37.980 --> 22:39.980
six

22:39.980 --> 22:41.980
alleged communists or seven

22:41.980 --> 22:42.980
referred to by mr. Coney

22:42.980 --> 22:43.980
yesterday

22:43.980 --> 22:45.980
If you could state whether

22:45.980 --> 22:47.980
these people are today

22:47.980 --> 22:49.980
and employees or officers

22:49.980 --> 22:51.980
or graphese or what are they?

22:51.980 --> 22:53.980
They were five

22:53.980 --> 22:55.980
were there there was one officer

22:55.980 --> 22:57.980
and five and less than then

22:57.980 --> 22:59.980
either four or five of which

22:59.980 --> 23:01.980
came from selected search.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.980
So with the rank of the

23:03.980 --> 23:05.980
officer, you know,

23:05.980 --> 23:07.980
first of time, first of

23:07.980 --> 23:09.980
time, what were the other?

23:09.980 --> 23:11.980
The others are as I recall

23:11.980 --> 23:13.980
were all five.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.980
Graphese,

23:15.980 --> 23:17.980
Yes sir.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.980
Senator Smith,

23:19.980 --> 23:21.980
no questions, yes, go out.

23:21.980 --> 23:23.980
All right, I guess my question

23:23.980 --> 23:25.980
is the grephing.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.980
Senator, it's 1238 to 9.

23:27.980 --> 23:29.980
Senator, is it OK to finish or not?

23:29.980 --> 23:31.980
Senator, if he ends,

23:31.980 --> 23:33.980
10 minutes, he does not have to answer that question.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.980
Mr. Welk, I would like to

23:35.980 --> 23:37.980
try and answer that anyway.

23:37.980 --> 23:39.980
I hope you can answer the affirmative.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.980
Mr. Chairman, I

23:41.980 --> 23:43.980
had sincerely hope we were

23:43.980 --> 23:45.980
finished this before noon.

23:45.980 --> 23:47.980
As a chair, it was much time that's been

23:47.980 --> 23:49.980
taken up by others myself.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.980
I'm rightly so.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.980
I'm sure it's right to do that.

23:53.980 --> 23:55.980
I think the

23:55.980 --> 23:57.980
witnesses answers are the lengthening

23:57.980 --> 23:59.980
I, I let have the drafts

23:59.980 --> 24:01.980
at the most 20 minutes of

24:01.980 --> 24:03.980
the drafts.

24:03.980 --> 24:05.980
Senator Cohen has

24:05.980 --> 24:07.980
some.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.980
I think it will explain for another hour

24:09.980 --> 24:11.980
or an hour and a half to be able to finish.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.980
Mr. Chairman,

24:13.980 --> 24:15.980
Mr. Chairman,

24:15.980 --> 24:17.980
is the way our staff party bill has started.

24:17.980 --> 24:19.980
We understand from forum call

24:19.980 --> 24:21.980
it's a preference committee and I'm

24:21.980 --> 24:23.980
moved that we recess this

24:23.980 --> 24:25.980
airing out at 1230 and go to the

24:25.980 --> 24:27.980
store and go to the

24:27.980 --> 24:29.980
store and go to the staff party bill.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.980
The staff party bill has

24:31.980 --> 24:31.980


24:31.980 --> 24:33.980
taken for the benefit of those who

24:33.980 --> 24:35.980
may have come in late.

24:35.980 --> 24:37.980
When we recess today and the

24:37.980 --> 24:39.980
council is both being held

24:39.980 --> 24:41.980
on the staff party bill this afternoon,

24:41.980 --> 24:43.980
we will recess until 1030

24:43.980 --> 24:45.980
Monday morning.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.980
We stand in recess then until 1030

24:47.980 --> 24:49.980
Monday morning.

24:49.980 --> 24:51.980
Mr. Chairman,

24:51.980 --> 24:53.980
thank you very much.

24:53.980 --> 24:55.980
Mr. Chairman,

24:55.980 --> 24:57.980
Mr. Chairman,

24:57.980 --> 24:59.980
we are now at the end of the

24:59.980 --> 25:01.980
army's dispute with Senator McCarthy.

25:01.980 --> 25:03.980
No session is scheduled for the

25:03.980 --> 25:05.980
Saturday afternoon.

25:05.980 --> 25:07.980
Now at 1030,

25:07.980 --> 25:09.980
Eastern Daylight Time Monday morning,

25:09.980 --> 25:11.980
the Duma Television Network,

25:11.980 --> 25:13.980
Department of News and Suffolk Affairs

25:13.980 --> 25:15.980
will resume its coverage of the Senate

25:15.980 --> 25:17.980
permanent investigation subcommittee hearing

25:17.980 --> 25:19.980
from Washington DC.

25:19.980 --> 25:21.980
Thank you very much.
