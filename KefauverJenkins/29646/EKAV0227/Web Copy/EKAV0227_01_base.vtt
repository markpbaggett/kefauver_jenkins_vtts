00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I told a part of the Senate, Brown testimony.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Contestant as well.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
What's next, we'll do it until, uh, sure,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
until the county of the state.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Maybe we can, uh, take this out and go.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Take time out.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
I'll be checking for the...

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
What, what, I got a case.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
How much is that?

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
30.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
How much is that?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
30.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
How much is that?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
30.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
How much is that?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
30.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
How much is that?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
30.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
How much is that?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
30.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
It asks me part of Shine's training.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
And as far as we were concerned,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
he wasn't going to get off on a tenth of January,

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
and I quote.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
That quote.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Continuing.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Presidents of that, Mr. Cone didn't agree with me, by the way.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Presidents of that, he said,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
that some people at Fort Sixth had been cooperative.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
But that Colonel Ringer,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
and Lieutenant Miller, had made things

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
especially difficult for five of Shine,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
and that he and Mr. Cone had a very long memory

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
and was never going to forget the name.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Now, Mr. Cone is quite obvious

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
that Lieutenant Flouc, version of this matter,

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
says that the reason for the dislike of Colonel Ringer,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
the regimental command by memory serves me correct,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
but not that what you have stated,

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
namely that Colonel Ringer bought this as a witch hunt,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
but on the contrary,

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
that it was the fact that he was a regimental commander

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
and was doing things as he stated here,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
that five of Shine did not like.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Now, what is Lieutenant Flouc's statement correct?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Or is it false?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Lieutenant Miller, chairman of the name,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
and I mean, uh, seven,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
training for training for many objections here

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
at any point, so over,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I do believe that one of the basic principles of law

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
is that one with which should not be called upon to evaluate

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
another with this in the testimony,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
so Mr. Cone can be asked about the fact that I,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't think it's up to him to determine whether or not

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
that he is really with us,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
but uh, uh, Treasury,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
he can't tell us yet what does the word mean.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, I'm not there.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
That Sunday, Miss Parkey is not for Mr. Cone or ourselves

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
to determine whether Treasury has been committed.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
This is not a grand jury sitting here,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
it's for obviously for the jury,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
it's sometimes determined who may or may not

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
have been in the proceedings of the military,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
but would you, no, suspect?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I think the point I read is that I think

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
in every court, both the State and the Federal,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
that if there's an offer to, uh,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
and if I may have a few suggestions,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
a test on this, too, I think it's a thing

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
to offer to ask one with us,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
to actually evaluate another with this in the testimony,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I think Mr. Cone can be asked about all of the facts,

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
thoughts, and then,

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
about all of these things,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
but I don't want to break you on,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
but I understand we now have a little call, both,

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
and take stress about this, uh,

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
to take your questions.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
The jury has been gestated,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
as long as it's close to the side of the talk,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
and I just as well have reached that,

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
until it's kind of gotten in the morning,

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
and then get into the role,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
and Mr. Cone, Mr. Chairman,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
and I can rest you for everybody that way,

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
until we're right in the reach there,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
at the time of the talk.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Mr. Cone, you're meeting, uh,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
now, my meeting of the, uh,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I don't think any of the room's pretty far ahead,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
but I'll leave you to the role,

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
for all of the people.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I think all of the committee members know about that,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
but I think it's a lot of work.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I think it's a lot of work.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I think it's a lot of work.
