WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
We can register the mission of the army.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
That's right.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Did you order?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
So you think it goes back to here?

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Oh, Mr. Lee, you're the director of the magazine?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
No, I think Senator McCrathie knew all about it.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
I would say.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
I would like you to have did you ever hear yourself

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
and gain those letters in your memory for a certain amount?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I did not personally, but Senator McCrathie was right there

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
on the occasion of what moment for this all happened.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I believe the son of a fat able,

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
even the last one for a few was enough,

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
but this, I think he's broken this right, that's right.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
You did not fail to understand the mercy

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
of the women's ability to call on them, that's all I say.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
I didn't personally tell them now.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
So the day of an attempt is surely the end of the day,

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
you're the daughter.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes sir.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Did you convey your message to him or your father?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
He was the bestest of his name.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I don't think that I dare to talk about it.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Did you convey him to the commanding of the army?

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
To the citizens, no sir.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Did you convey that information to anyone?

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
I would ask those people within my organization to know about it.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Now, Mr. Secretary, you have told about it.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I would say that you were the first to claim the immense

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
of the war in the memory of the war,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
and that you were the first to claim the war.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
That was on the 17th of November.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
You are tuned to New York City's own station, WNYC.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
You can't just defend it.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
I'll be ready to move right to the 7th Army to the back.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
As you use it in the senior regular war on WNYC,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I don't have a regular plan.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Where are the regular issues?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Every unit has a...

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
This is a unit that I'd say to have force to find

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
and it comes out of what they call a tool.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
You just walk through the work that you do there.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Mr. Secretary, here is your work.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
It's a school paper and this is for me.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
The purpose of it was to cooperate and make it possible for the...

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
For our Mr. President McCarty,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I have to guess the boss and somebody's the blower.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
They had committee business for us and I'd sworn...

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
That was all over the city.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
That's right.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I can't hear you.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
You've just been with me for a long time.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
That's right.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
And that's your power.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
This conversation has been going on between the two Ministers.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
For each of me.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
That's right.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
In your specifications number eight.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Which requires not a long-asserting scope of this month.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Give me a second to that, please.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
And I have to give you a reverse specification, not for eight, in your go-or-sticking.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
We as your press were coupled with our students,

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
the limits are terminated gains of committee on board amount.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
What is the number, sir?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Number eight.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Will you now reach to the committee?

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Your press of a commission's number is 5 against the McCarty's press of a committee.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I know about November 6th, sir. That's the one you may have.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
The committee's number is 8 to be that.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
On to the committee's decision, this is very graduating along.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Members, my team is with the committee.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
On November 6th, 1953, Sir McCarty, Mr. Conan, Mr. Carr,

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
thought to induce and persuade such a serious favor of Mr. Adams,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
to arrange for the assignment of Private Sean in New York today

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
to study and report evidence if any of pro-communist meanings in West Park textbooks.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Mr. Carr and the President are of and with the consent of Senator McCarty and Mr. Carr,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
thought to induce and persuade Secretary Steven to Mr. Adams,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
to arrange to make Private Sean available for some committee work,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
while he was undergoing basic training at Fort Dix New Jersey.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
These requests were coupled with promises,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
reasonable to limit or to terminate such committee's hearings on Fort Mama.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
In other words, that was the consideration they already made.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
In the way of the request of you to the Italian and Italian New Yorkers,

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
the English winner and consideration of your own education of art is used

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
to monitor the importance of the language of the Italian and Italian New Yorkers.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
What are up to living God?

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Turn the rate gain to the committee on Fort Mama is better.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
No, sir, I was correct.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
When it is that not one safe act that they all run into the situation,

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
we'll follow you to the limits of the hearing to the committee on Fort Mama.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Not the hearing, sir, Mr. Jenkins, not the investigation.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
I tried to make it clear that later it's already engaged with the committee on Fort Mama.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
That is the consideration of what you hear, Mr. Steven.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
According to the hearing that I've been compiling about, not the investigation.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
There's not that in the case that you want to be hearing his dissuade areas

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
that you want to be hearing's terminated.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
I just want to justify that I have one of the hearings, Godmunder Control,

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
so they wouldn't have a very bad effect for having both in the public mind and on the Army.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And I think you've heard this in my head.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
You want to be hearing's is for the investigation suspended.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
No, sir, not the investigation.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
No, no, sir, not the investigation, sir.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
The investigation, I said, it should continue on

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
and that I would make progress reports from time to time.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Thank you, sir.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
The fact that you're investigating this investigation number and misuse

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
is that you want to be hearing's limitedly heard on the Navy.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
You do not.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
I said that they hear, I think I used the language,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
but I thought that the Fort Mama's hearings had served their purpose.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
In other words, they pointed the thing up.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
It focused the Army's attention on this matter.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
We're getting into it.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
You want to see investigation can carry on,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
but to let us handle the thing,

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
unless or until we've demonstrated that we couldn't handle it in cleanness situation up.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
This is a white Senator McCarthy,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
our new staff.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Wooder said, the U now view a science science in New York,

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
here we are that you study this context to the West Boyth Effect Group.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
And if you will do that, we will limit or terminate the hearings

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
of our committee of Fort Mama's.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
These little wives, they would have heard of such a consideration

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
that you, if you have not previously asked for it.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
No, I said, I just seem to have difficulty with the Jenkins

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
and trying to make this point clear.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
After the meeting in New York on the 14th of luncheon,

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
I've got the impression that Senator McCarthy and his committee were about ready

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
to turn this investigation, the prosecution of this investigation,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
over to the Army.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
And we're now talking about the 6th of November.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
What I thought was, if they had anything in mind along about the 14th of October,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
apparently investigation over to the Army,

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
but certainly by the 6th of November, that would be true.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Chairman, I have no further questions.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I was in particular at I.R.O.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
This length is very, this is a question of Frank Carr,

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
but I think I should come to order to do so.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
His conduct is to Mr. Carr because part of the reason for asking for specificities

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
on both sides of the defense was so that this committee could know specifically about what

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
that was being charged against each one of the principals

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
so that the principals that in turn respond and reply to the charge.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
When we had General Smith and General Weber here,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I think they both testified in your presence,

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
that they did not consider it human power for members of Congress

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
or individual citizens or friends or relatives of Indo-Kes

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
to request consideration for a committee,

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
but rather they felt that they had the qualifications for a commission.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
Do you share that reaction and express my general's revered and General Smith?

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
I guess part of your life was to be asked for one time,

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
so this merely reading press had a meeting where such a commission would be solicited

09:23.000 --> 09:33.000
would not let take its new opinion comprised on the five Mr. Carr's humanization of impoverry.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, Senator, I'm trying my best,

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
and that one thing I don't want to do is I do not want to be unfair to Mr. Carr or anyone else.

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
I'm sure that's correct. I want to have it exactly the two-file just exactly as it was.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
I cannot recall specific language by Mr. Carr.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
I therefore have to go on my recollection of the meeting in which the conversation

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
with respect to Mr. Sean was definitely led by Mr. Colm

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
and by opinion Mr. Carr in a much lesser way was interested in the same thing.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
You were using your brain to believe that Mr. Carr played a minor part in justice.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
Now, I am sure if we leave it as ambiguous as that,

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
just how would we find out from Mr. Carr when he is a witness?

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
Whether or not he played that minor part that you seem unable to define,

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
and those who think injustice to him and just remember to the point

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
when you discover about a minor part being played,

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
I don't think so far is your testimony, Mr. Carr.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
State that you are not endearing to implicate him as being purely a impoverished.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Mr. Carr and I agree with that completely.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I think I certainly should search my memory

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
for the very limit of my ability, and I can assure you that that's what I'm trying to do

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
because I would dislike the extent to greater to say or do anything,

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
but with the unfair that anybody might Mr. Carr.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Thank you. Because it's almost impossible for this committee to interrogate him

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
about charges until the debate you appreciate.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
Very well, I'm not sure if the secretary of this question should be directed to you

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
and if it should not, you may tell me to whom it should be directed.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
But in your statement on page 152, which you read on the right,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
you said that China had obtained 15 passes from the Pope

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
and the majority of new personnel received only three passes.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
Are you in position to tell us why those 15 passes were procuring

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
to file four and responsible for pressure and what he did at the time of the Pope's pass?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm not personal.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I thought we have what the system will be available.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
You may be the witness to whom I could direct those questions.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I'll say to our audience.

12:03.000 --> 12:14.000
I want to read you now the telegram, which is included in your testimony.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
They did March 12th.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
They did deal with a telegram, which you stated you were seen from the center of my heart.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
On page 161 of the pass, please.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
In view of the news story this morning,

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
meet on and shine with appreciation if you would make it clear to the press.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
At the only time you and I ever discussed the subject of a commission for David's shine was in his presence,

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
at which time I heard that your full year greed that his case had been treated the same as the case of any other draftee,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
and that we agreed that any other handling of the case in view of the investigation of the army

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
would be extremely bad for the committee and the army,

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
and that David's shine was present and fully agreed with us in the matter.

12:56.000 --> 13:05.000
Your only comment in your statement was the important thing to note is that he admits having taken up with me the matter of a commission for shine.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
The chair agrees that that is important.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
He thinks it is also important to know whether or not the statements contained in that telegram are correct or incorrect.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I think that they are incorrect and a lot of part of the telegram.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Will you find out whether the inactivity or the inactivity is working?

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
Because I don't think Senator McCarthy, my fellow recollection of Senator McCarthy,

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
and I would have had a raise for our collection of it,

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
stating that all this business about, like at all being handled, just like everybody else,

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
that part of the telegram is not an importance for this.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
My best degree recollection, he never made such a statement that he would write it.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Otherwise the telegram is correct.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Tell about the wealth.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
The statement to the telegram.

13:54.000 --> 14:03.000
I believe it has the bond to this fact that Senator McCarthy, on at least one occasion, took this out.

14:03.000 --> 14:14.000
He states here, the only time I'm not prepared, definitely wouldn't have any difference in the terms of mine from the only time I've worked at least one.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Well, the last two hours ABC Radio has bring bringing you on the scene coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
direct from the Senate Office Building in Washington.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
At this time due to a prior commitment of the network and many of its affiliate stations,

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
he must leave the hearing for five minutes, after which our live direct coverage of the proceedings will resume.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
Stay tuned for your ABC station for further coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
This program is coming to you from the Senate Office Building in Washington.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
That's right.

14:48.000 --> 15:01.000
Memories that you know need about Fort Manloft and the fact that some of the personnel employed in the defense of the state may have been built in a subversive context.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
May I ask there are some more of most of the six defense devices which are developed in the laboratory at Fort Manloft.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
Ultimately processed or facilitated by a private defense system.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
A lot of it is, yeah, most of us.

15:17.000 --> 15:27.000
So that, if unhappily there are some versus elements in private defense establishments, working out in the preposterous developed at Fort Manloft,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
that would be facing the security of our country in jeopardy.

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
That's right. And that's the point that came up at the luncheon on November 6th when I said this was a problem for the whole defense establishment.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Good. One other question.

15:40.000 --> 15:53.000
And page 245 is about a discussion about the apology or explanation or whatever word most appropriate dismiss your conversation in which you said you tried to calm down as the call.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
From Washington, the mutual network is bringing you on the spot coverage of the McCarthy Army hearing.

15:58.000 --> 16:07.000
Our coverage will continue after this 10 second pause for station identification. This is the mutual broadcasting system.

16:07.000 --> 16:15.000
Seven tell on your dial WOR New York.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Back in Washington and mutual coverage of the McCarthy Army hearing.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens is undergoing cross examination.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
You will do it.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
I think that maybe it helped a little but I think Mr. Colman will feel very comfortable.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
And in the call.

16:39.000 --> 16:48.000
To get this track in proper perspective.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
I've listened to this testimony.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
And according to my recollection of it.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
The assault makes the specific request.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
And different requests request of a different nature.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
For.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
For further treatment for Mr. Sean.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
I want to ask you about these. I'll try to ask you in their chronological order.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
As I remember the testimony.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
I'll ask you to answer and state whether they're true.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
The first request that came to you was for a direct commission in the Army.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Is that correct?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Yes.

17:35.000 --> 17:43.000
The second request was for a direct commission in one of the other branches of the service.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
Is that correct?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
That was another occasion.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I'm trying to think of the chronology of it.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Maybe it would be great.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
The chronology is not over important.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
No, I want that.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
That's correct. Such a request was made.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
The third I have here is a commission in the intelligence service.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
I'm the Mr. Dulles and you said you went over yourself.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Did I secure that for?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That's three.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
And the fourth I have here is that.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
The first thing that he was inducted into the service.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
They wanted him then reassigned to the committee to do committee work.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
Was that a request for a permanent reassignment to the committee?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
The repuscities.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
There were several Chaparreras.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
I have no time for it, but I have a statement.

18:48.000 --> 18:56.000
There was a request for a permanent reassignment to the committee.

18:56.000 --> 19:03.000
There was a request for a permanent reassignment to the committee.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I know that.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
There was a request for a permanent reassignment to the committee.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
There was a request for a permanent reassignment to the new York area.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
What service was he to perform there?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
One for customer.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Check westbound textbooks.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
That is a letter request.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
What was he to do when he was first to be assigned there?

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
When the chairman changes his mind about it and said that he included it, it might not be well to do that.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
What was he to do that's all that first request?

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
That was due to the committee work.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
There was no customer.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
There was no customer.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I'm sure the chair must take it on this.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
There was no customer.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
That is the former chairman.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Ever has.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Mr. Sien, be assigned to the committee.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Ever change his mind.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
The only testimony on that is that when I heard he was assigned to the committee, I requested that he not be assigned to the committee.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
My point is, may I say that the pre-induction period that he was to be assigned there?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Are you testified to someone as that's right?

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
And I think you, later, the information came to you.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
I think to Mr. Colm, that the chairman had changed his mind about that.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
And the audience might not be involved because the press would get old of it and make something out of it.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Didn't you so testify?

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Yes, I learned about that from Mr. Adams.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Well, anyway, you learned a lot.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
You have so testify.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I know it's in the record somewhere.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
All right, that is another request.

20:45.000 --> 20:53.000
Now, the fifth out of here I've been was to be assigned to New York for assigned to West Point to check.

20:53.000 --> 21:00.000
The text books at West Point would respect to any commoners propaganda in that direct.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Yes, sir.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Senator McCollum, I don't like to impose on your ten minutes.

21:04.000 --> 21:14.000
I just wonder if, as a personal favor, you had crossed in the secretary and make it very clear that at no time would I ever request the Mr. Shine be assigned to my committee.

21:14.000 --> 21:22.000
That the only conversation I ever had was when I called him and told him it would be a great mistake to assign a man from a draft of my committee back to the committee.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I don't like to impose on your ten minutes.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I find the board have another committee at the committee.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, I'm not in a secretary test, but I'm asking him a question.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
He can, I assume, undertake to state the facts.

21:36.000 --> 21:50.000
That's all I want I'm trying to get the number, different number of different requests of what may or may not be the first treatment for Mr. Shine.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
I mentioned five of the six of them.

21:56.000 --> 22:10.000
I believe it was you have testified that he wanted special privileges after he was in the service in that he was to be given liberty or be given me.

22:10.000 --> 22:25.000
The general, Lee, granted to other enlisted men and you granted that for committee work, yes, sir.

22:25.000 --> 22:39.000
Now, I thank you, that's fine. If I'm wrong about this, I'd Mr. Shine himself suggested to you that he'd make a good undersecretary or assistant secretary of your committee when you drove you over to camp that one.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
What's that about, yes sir?

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
So it adds up to about seven specific requests.

22:46.000 --> 22:54.000
I identify a one of Mr. Shine's requests to you about how well he could serve you in your office.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
I don't want that charged against anyone else.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
You have no one else involved in that was in his sentry quest.

23:01.000 --> 23:12.000
They ever made all your in his suggestion made to you by either domestic phone or Mr. Carlson and the McCarthy with respect to that that you take him in your office.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Yes sir, Senator McCarthy.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Senator McCarthy, that's all.

23:16.000 --> 23:27.000
So we have a establish here at least, that is the special request for assignments and privileges for Mr. Shine.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
That's quite a word.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I would like to have a deal with this.

23:31.000 --> 23:39.000
I wonder if the secretary would make the record clear as well as I asked for an assistant secretary ship or another secretary ship from Mr. Shine.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Last word I asked you.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I like no switch.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
What he thought was, what is he?

23:46.000 --> 23:55.000
He said that he's to make the guy to make use of what he called Day-Shan special qualifications.

23:55.000 --> 24:12.000
And in that connection he suggested either as a special intelligence, a special assistant to me on matters of communism or as a special assistant to the chief of the top intelligence division of the staff, RG2.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Well that is for a special assistant instead of just an assistant.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Especially the only difference.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
But I didn't get the idea that the companies should be made a assistant secretary at the end.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Well I wanted to clarify.

24:25.000 --> 24:47.000
He wants to be made a special assistant to you by law, the assistant secretary or that correct correct, yet for now I just want to make sure that Mr. Shine also did not be shy in request that he be made a special assistant to you or as an assistant secretary of your, not in a special assistant secretary or a special assistant to me.

24:47.000 --> 24:56.000
So no request was made a due to make an assistant secretary of the art, no request.

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
All of the requests were as special assistants due to perform a specific sacrifice right.

25:02.000 --> 25:12.000
Now that was in connection with his alleged qualifications as a communist investigator.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Is that correct? That's correct.

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
Did you look into his qualifications to determine whether he was suitable to perform that service in your office?

25:22.000 --> 25:29.000
No, I thought that no young man of draft age should be brought into my office as a special assistant month, any fact.

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
So you did not undertake to inquire into his qualifications, not for that purpose no sir, not for that purpose.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Now let me ask you.

25:38.000 --> 25:45.000
Getting very back to my form of questioning, the other 10 minutes period that I had.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
You did have you to have the authority if you want to do it.

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
To all who the supporters, to whom the applications are referred,

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
he has been rejected application for an act of commission as secretary of the art.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
And you want to exercise it.

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
To all who the assistant and the water is special of a direct commission right into you know.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
I'm sure I have a lot of power, Senator.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
You do have that power.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
That's my, that's the way I am a candidate, so that I could do it.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
But the academic would make it because I never would do it.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
You never would have it.

26:29.000 --> 26:37.000
If you had done it in this case, you would make that really satisfy my answer request.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Well, I've part of one answer.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
The implementation is here.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
You just want to make sure.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
The implementation is here.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
You were trying to buy all this committee from the university.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
They are now here.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
That is true.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
You did have the authority to buy this commission and all the remaining indian.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Yes sir.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
You refused to go that far.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
You did not give me that.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I am your authority in the indian grocery.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And that is your request.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
All of the industrial solutions with them and the many more of these.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
What you are trying to do is to make the implementation of the entire administration request.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
You did have the power to buy.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
What do you receive?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Yes sir.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
I did have the right.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I'll just drive around in the column.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Let's turn the phone over.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
In this time, the time is expired.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
I'll just do fireworks.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Mr. Chairman, I want to report to you.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I think that first is completely improper and unfair.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
The implication is that this chairman could have involved all the other citizens.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
That this chairman's federal government has involved all this investigation.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
But if you can make whatever you want from the university, you should escape.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
And he has been passionate about it.

27:51.000 --> 27:57.000
And he is the repaid of the power of the university and I have given this question.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
If that power of the power was a part of the implementation of the forces that it can ask,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
he gave it to you.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
If you still want me to be proud of that, that might have satisfied my situation.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, can I have a hand as expired?

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Mr. Chairman, report to order.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Take this final order.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
I just want to point out that the implication there is that this chairman could have been involved all.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
There's no evidence this chairman would ever have been involved all thanks to the hearing.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
And no more involved involved any hearing.

28:24.000 --> 28:32.000
Mr. Chairman, the chair of the audience, if they are here at the Guest and the Committee,

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
and there will be no manifestations of approval or disapproval.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
That is the first violation that we have had from the audience.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
I am not going to ask this time that the officers who move from the room, those participating.

28:45.000 --> 28:52.000
But I am going to ask hereafter without further instructions from the chair, those violating our standing order,

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
the officers who kindly correspondingly remove them from the room.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
The senator, Mr. Chairman, here at Point of Riding to Up.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I believe it is the point of order.

29:03.000 --> 29:11.000
It is that it's 4.40 pm and I am a strong believer in union hours from my work in the court.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
Maybe a chair today that's a request of the county's done the committee,

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
who is not going around and able to second stop.

29:19.000 --> 29:25.000
He had suggestions that each member of the committee to give an institution 10 minutes.

29:25.000 --> 29:33.000
Overruled by the committee, why, of course, your point of order from the state would like to give those of the actions of our committee,

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
the same opportunity of those of the senate, I bow to that. Thank you.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Thank you, sir.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
We will try as well out as we will, including in your 10 minutes, and as we start, we will be done.

29:45.000 --> 30:04.000
I assume that the passes were granted to the private shone,

30:04.000 --> 30:10.000
that they were in writing from day to day, very likely signed by his immediate commanding officer.

30:10.000 --> 30:18.000
I think they were. Was there any formal memorandum to the common dance I had?

30:18.000 --> 30:28.000
4th, suggesting that he be given passes day after day to carry on to the assignment.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
No, sir. There is nothing in writing then to cover that matter.

30:32.000 --> 30:39.000
No, sir. Was there anything in writing with respect to assignment to a kitchen priest, do you?

30:39.000 --> 30:50.000
I, as does that say, Senator, I really don't know. I just haven't been able to follow all of the details of the private shone and other private general lion.

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
I'm sure we have learned to those thoughts, but I just can't do so, because I don't have the information.

30:56.000 --> 31:03.000
But in surprise, you and General Ryan, and Senator, there is no written memoranda covering a weekend passes,

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
non-assignment to KP, do the amount sort of being dealt.
