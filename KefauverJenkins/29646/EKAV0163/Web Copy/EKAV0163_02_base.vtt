WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
Well, one, I think, to expedite the loyalty for the team, and number two, whether he

00:06.600 --> 00:10.200
given an order, not to make a report until the committee and concluded it serious.

00:10.200 --> 00:14.400
And if you'll ask those two separate questions, then I think the technical can proceed.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.900
All right, President, did you give an order to expedite the 35 cases?

00:18.900 --> 00:21.400
That includes the nine of and reinstated the question, does that understand?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.400
No, I didn't give such an order.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.400
I wanted to take its usual court, Senator.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.800
Now, in respect to the nine, I want to make it clear that the reason that they were

00:29.800 --> 00:36.500
restored the non-centred sensitivity was that we were unable to find sufficient charges

00:36.500 --> 00:38.000
to bring charges against them.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.200
So pending further investigation to see whether charges could be made against these

00:42.200 --> 00:45.200
people, they were restored to non-centred jobs.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.200
Time.

00:46.200 --> 00:54.200
Now, how about the one that Washington was asked to reinstate to a reduced-win reinstate

00:54.200 --> 00:57.200
in that conversation with Mr. Adams?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.200
Well, as we had mentioned, I didn't know Adams about that.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.200
Well, as Mr. Adams told you about that.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.200
I don't think all that's touching the matter with him.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.200
And because we're getting away from the other questions, we hear and can testify about the telephone call.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.200
We'll get back to that moment, but Mr. Chairman, I have to ask you another question.

01:13.200 --> 01:19.200
Did you ever give an order, or do you know the order was ever given by anyone else in authority,

01:19.200 --> 01:26.200
to hold up the final deductions of the 35 cases until after the hearing had been completed?

01:26.200 --> 01:29.200
I never gave a question order to the senator, and I don't believe anybody else did.

01:29.200 --> 01:34.200
I like, I like also, if I made a straight-now one point with respect to the element of the car.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.200
You've referred here to a ten month.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.200
Actually, most of these suspension took place in the month of October.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.200
And the mileage was actually talking about six months and not ten months.

01:44.200 --> 01:50.200
Now, you said you didn't think that the order had been given, and you referred to the question order and you didn't get never.

01:50.200 --> 01:56.200
Now, Mr. Steven's the other day, Mr. Cohn was trusting you in some detail about a conversation,

01:56.200 --> 02:04.200
which you had written, Mr. Adam, while Mr. Cohn and I were present in the room.

02:04.200 --> 02:12.200
You couldn't recall that conversation with our call at the time, just had to do with the request that General Watson

02:12.200 --> 02:15.200
reinstate certain cases had been suspended.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.200
Have you talked to Mr. Adam for a question or recollection on that?

02:18.200 --> 02:20.200
No, I haven't.

02:20.200 --> 02:24.200
I let Mr. Cohn think over the question, I feel right.

02:24.200 --> 02:31.200
Mr. Secretary, was General Watson ever given a direction not to prefer charges against these nine people?

02:31.200 --> 02:33.200
Not far as I know.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.200
If I may turn, not as far as I know.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.200
Well, if you haven't made any inquiry about that after the testimony in this room the other day,

02:39.200 --> 02:45.200
no, not after the inquiry, after the question in the room the other day, I've specified as I'd greater length about Fort Monmouth

02:45.200 --> 02:47.200
all the way through these last 13 days.

02:47.200 --> 02:52.200
Yes, sir, and I thought I'd, if you could just request an answer, do I have any kind of advice from the Senate that I know?

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
No, I did not.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.200
It's my point, sir.

02:54.200 --> 03:00.200
General, I never answered with this to do it, but I think my General Watson's day, in which General Watson's meeting,

03:00.200 --> 03:06.200
that Mr. Adam had told him over the phone that he thought he, Mr. Adam, thought General Watson

03:06.200 --> 03:11.200
had already been released, certain security risks, and that Mr. that General Watson refused to do this,

03:11.200 --> 03:15.200
is that I will not take the responsibility, much to Secretary say to respond to those.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.200
After you heard that very serious charge, didn't you take that matter up with Mr. Adam?

03:19.200 --> 03:23.200
I, I, I, I know, the suspect with him, I thought you were talking about testimony last Friday.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.200
But I haven't had any lengthy discussion, Mr. Adam's about it.

03:26.200 --> 03:32.200
I'm unfamiliar with the, what was said on the phone, and I think it seems to me that Mr. Monmouth was Adam talking to the

03:32.200 --> 03:35.200
Washington on the phone, those were the two men that all the suspects were by the men on the back.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.200
Yes sir, but I don't know what they are.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.200
Yes sir, but Mr. Ones, I am the suspect.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.200
A question is in the counsel.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.200
I pay it.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.200
The sheriff has to send him a phone.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.200
And the sender is in my right?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
And the sender is in my left?

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
Yes.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
The sheriff's in my left?

03:49.200 --> 03:50.200
No, sir.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.200
The sheriff's in the secretary.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.200
Mr. Adam's legal counsel, the nut sir.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.200
That's right.

03:54.200 --> 03:59.200
I would not instruct him by him to write the man, the General, the minister, the way that I am.

03:59.200 --> 04:04.200
The minister, the reinstated security risk, wouldn't that be a very serious matter?

04:04.200 --> 04:10.200
So I would call no conversation with Mr. Adam about that point, but he can testify on it, that's what he says about it.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
I don't know about it.

04:11.200 --> 04:17.200
My question to you, law, after you saw produced here by Mr. James, a written memorandum,

04:17.200 --> 04:24.200
misplaced by General Lawson, making this girl that Mr. Adam had telephoned to him in November,

04:24.200 --> 04:29.200
and airs General Lawson's a reinstated security risk, and that General Lawson had refused,

04:29.200 --> 04:32.200
and said, let the secretary take responsibility.

04:32.200 --> 04:37.200
How do you not inquire of Mr. Adam concerning that conversation?

04:37.200 --> 04:40.200
I don't think I've had any secretary of touch on Mr. Adam's about it.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.200
I think it will be a important point on Mr. Adam's testimony.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
Well, sir, it might be a very important point.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200
We should get to New York.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.200
All right, then, I told Mr. Adam about it.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.200
No, no, no.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.200
I told him.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.200
It would be very much appreciated if we could get an answer to that question.

04:52.200 --> 04:57.200
Now, and I wish you would also feel concerned, as well as not, these nine people,

04:57.200 --> 05:02.200
these nine people have been restored to duty despite the regulatory information and the communist activity,

05:02.200 --> 05:07.200
as a result of any instruction given by anyone in your office, the General Lawson.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.200
I'll try to find out.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.200
Very well done.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.200
Now,

05:10.200 --> 05:11.200
ah.

05:16.200 --> 05:22.200
Mr. Secretary, as we were concluding on Friday, I was asking you about these monitored telephone conversations,

05:22.200 --> 05:31.200
and I believe we were interrupted just at a point where it installed a committee that you did monitor conversations between yourself and members of Congress,

05:31.200 --> 05:34.200
but not between yourself and people over at the White House.

05:34.200 --> 05:40.200
I think he said the reason was that people in the Congress might want information and things of that matter.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
Is that correct?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.200
I think that's what I said, yeah.

05:42.200 --> 05:47.200
Well, would it not be equally true, sir, that people in the White House would want the same size of information,

05:47.200 --> 05:51.200
and that's the reason he would apply to them just as well as members of Congress?

05:51.200 --> 05:53.200
No, I don't like a spot for science.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.200
But you tell us what the difference with these are.

05:54.200 --> 05:58.200
Well, it's a fairly clear question of arguments, and not relevant.

05:58.200 --> 06:01.200
He says that he did not monitor telephone calls to the White House.

06:01.200 --> 06:06.200
All this, I think, is purely repetition, repetition, and there's been none over many, many times.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.200
I hope Mr. Gorn will try to get another study to do this.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.200
Mr. Secretary, as you might remember, I was interrogating the executive session,

06:11.200 --> 06:14.200
concerning the exact agenda of the Secretary's monitoring.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.200
If I can't...

06:15.200 --> 06:16.200
Sir, I suppose the point of writing is very well.

06:16.200 --> 06:23.200
The question directly to the Secretary is to which calls are and which calls are not monitors, are appropriate.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
It is not appropriate to ask him for his reasons.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.200
After why he monitors some...

06:27.200 --> 06:31.200
Mike, Mike, that's not Mr. Chairman, has some bearing on the issue here.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.200
I can't see that there was a barrier to monitor telephone calls.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.200
I can't see that there wasn't a much of a barrier to bring it out by questioning.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.200
I don't see how that would have any bearing on it.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.200
I'm trying to leave this term to the medicine bearing on the question,

06:42.200 --> 06:45.200
but I know if the monocard calls will be received in heaven.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.200
So one of the important matters to determine what an assault calls,

06:48.200 --> 06:50.200
and the guy to this matter, are monitoring.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.200
Chair, as hell, we have a right to interrogate our Secretary.

06:53.200 --> 06:58.200
Yes, to which calls were monitored and which were not so that the whole committee can know exactly.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.200
Our sense is the monitoring business of play.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.200
Mr. Secretary, the government's question to ask him is to his reasons.

07:04.200 --> 07:08.200
Mr. Freeman, are there any other exceptions that you can't make at this time?

07:09.200 --> 07:12.200
No, I think I've justified on that. It's a complete blank.

07:12.200 --> 07:16.200
The whole process has been described in the records, not once, but I think at least twice.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.200
Yes, and we've had different testimony. I might suggest that.

07:18.200 --> 07:27.200
The net of it is that telephone conversations were monitored with the exception of family calls and close calls of close personal friends.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.200
And the White House and the White House.

07:29.200 --> 07:37.200
Yes, sir. And was this monitoring without the consent of the party at the other end in violation of the letter or the spirit of a defense department?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.200
Directly by which you were banned objection.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.200
For a conclusion of law.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
Correct, sir. When do you want to?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.200
Yes, the question called for a conclusion of law.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.200
Oh, I don't think it's a...

07:47.200 --> 07:51.200
Mr. Wilk, the chair of the commission was eroded by the consent of the lady. What was the question?

07:51.200 --> 07:53.200
Mr. Daniel, here's the question.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
I heard it as well.

07:54.200 --> 08:01.200
The question was whether or not, as I recall, the monitoring of these telephone calls is described in the 16th.

08:02.200 --> 08:10.200
While Violet is either directly or indirectly or in the matter of the spirit, are they directly prohibiting the monitoring of calls?

08:10.200 --> 08:13.200
Is that correct? Exactly correct. And I have to direct it in my hand.

08:13.200 --> 08:20.200
Mr. Chairman, I do not think that's called for a question of law. Mr. Wilk said directly.

08:20.200 --> 08:28.200
He had asked him whether or not it was the violation of a law. That is certainly correct, but the secretary knows the importance of a directive.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.200
Well, also it involves that there are communications acts.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.200
In that regard, what can or cannot be done about putting...

08:34.200 --> 08:36.200
Well, that will not be the question. The question...

08:36.200 --> 08:38.200
You and I have been trying to decide that question.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.200
By any many days, I agree.

08:40.200 --> 08:40.200


08:40.200 --> 08:46.200
The matter of communication act, but the question is that there was whether or not it was violated directly.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.200
That is the monitoring of calls.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.200
Once again, is that a matter of construction of a written document that's for the committee rather than the witness?

08:52.200 --> 08:55.200
I think Mr. Wilk, the secretary of the army was...

08:55.200 --> 08:58.200
With the law of the spirit and the meaning of a directive.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.200
I'm sure of it. That's a great...

09:00.200 --> 09:02.200
I think it's about the presence of the sheriff.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.200
As the whole of the defense and the property are not having any good effect.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.200
You will certainly have 50% of the attention.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.200
And you will have a chance.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.200
Far behind all of those violations of nothing.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
Or I will be known.

09:12.200 --> 09:17.200
You're just as the monitoring of the statement that you know of no defense of law of the directive.

09:17.200 --> 09:22.200
Saving in fear, certainly, that there shall be no recoits of a conversation

09:22.200 --> 09:25.200
without the consent of the other party who's under faith.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.200
Like, is that spirit only?

09:27.200 --> 09:32.200
Sir, I'd like you to look at the directive and tell me whether they're creating this directive.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.200
You think you are a thing or a disobeying the directive?

09:34.200 --> 09:39.200
The secretary of defense is having an eavesdropper on the line without notifying the party at the other.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.200
Mr. Collins, there was any directive at that time.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.200
And if we're known to me, I would certainly never do anything in the way of the directive.

09:45.200 --> 09:49.200
I'm by certain that there's no such directive out.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.200
Go ahead.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.200
I think that's what I have to request.

09:57.200 --> 10:02.200
This memorandum is the title of it is, use the telephone recording device.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.200
Yes sir.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.200
I use no telephone recording device.

10:05.200 --> 10:11.200
Mr. Steven, my question was the spirit of this directive and I direct your attention to the last paragraph of the directive.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.200
A sentence which is understores.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
I'm sorry, the last paragraph of the first page.

10:15.200 --> 10:19.200
A sentence which is understores and is directed by the secretary of defense.

10:19.200 --> 10:24.200
And I ask you to tell us whether or not that does not need to anybody reading plain English.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.200
That's the statement.

10:25.200 --> 10:31.200
The question now is whether or not the monitoring of these calls by the spirit of a directive.

10:31.200 --> 10:37.200
Apparently, the secretary now is asking you to enter this spiritual realm.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.200
And I don't think you're obsessed with the ought to be required to do it.

10:40.200 --> 10:45.200
I held it against Mr. Wales, the little one I told that I thought Mr. Cornwood,

10:45.200 --> 10:47.200
that last time whether or not it was by the lady of a directive.

10:47.200 --> 10:52.200
All of it, but I don't think the secretary already called upon to censure things spiritually.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.200
And I am now the first man.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.200
I now hold up the question as stated in the comments.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.200
Mr. Chairman, come.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
This is how fast.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.200
30, you have an executive meeting for 130.

11:02.200 --> 11:07.200
And I suggest the secretary of defense to set it to documents before we move.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.200
I move.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
We read that.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.200
Two documents.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
Two documents.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.200
One 30, and second is very many of them in the room.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.200
Three two seven.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.200
Three five seven.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.200
Three five seven.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.200
And the secretary of defense is asking Mr. Welch and Mr. Steven, Mr. S. O.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.200
And the secretary is negotiating to be present.

11:24.200 --> 11:30.200
You have Dr. Chairman, not announced that there's so many of us holding this next session.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.200
Public session at 230 is this afternoon.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.200
There will of course be an executive session in room 357 at 130,

11:37.200 --> 11:41.200
which is a whole question of expediting the hearings or cutting down a number of witnesses.

11:41.200 --> 11:48.200
The testify will be explored.

11:48.200 --> 12:08.200
The latest starting because the executive session has just concluded.

12:08.200 --> 12:16.200
And we had a little while for the reporter to type out a new version of a new motion,

12:16.200 --> 12:20.200
which Senator Durston has advised the chair he would like to discuss at this time.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.200
Senator Durston, good evening, you.

12:23.200 --> 12:29.200
I would like to suggest to the committee that the name of the man is from up here.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.200
Today is very important.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.200
The lady is alive.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.200
She's celebrating her 30th anniversary.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.200
She's center of the FBI.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.200
I think we all agree that she's on a tremendous outstanding job.

12:37.200 --> 12:41.200
I just wonder if it would not be an order for the committee as a committee.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
To request her admiration,

12:43.200 --> 12:46.200
to the graduates of the Americans, they are your hoover.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.200
If we could do that as a committee.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.200
Without a bet, all members of the committee was joining,

12:52.200 --> 12:55.200
expressing their appreciation and approval of the great Americans whom we all admire.

12:55.200 --> 13:00.200
To the committee, to the transmitters to the director of the FBI by Councilor Wenders.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.200
I'm sure he must be following the newspapers.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.200
I think he will get it in the paper, which will be for him.

13:05.200 --> 13:10.200
Senator, I'm sure that Mr. Wilson comes in for the Army what a joy in these publications.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.200
May I join all of them?

13:11.200 --> 13:14.200
You certainly made this a good gesture.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.200
Up to now, we're still proceeding unanimously.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.200
Senator.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.200
Mr. Chairman, I'm sensible and the fact that since I'm here to suggest to this morning

13:23.200 --> 13:28.200
that some new suggestions and new ideas have occurred,

13:28.200 --> 13:31.200
which have been incorporated in the draft,

13:31.200 --> 13:34.200
that is, therefore, the members of the committee at the present time.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.200
I thought, perhaps, under the circumstances that if we could make an arrangement

13:38.200 --> 13:40.200
whereby it's just and that's at tomorrow morning,

13:40.200 --> 13:43.200
as first order of business in the committee session,

13:43.200 --> 13:46.200
this can be offered as a formal motion and that we can get a vote on it,

13:46.200 --> 13:49.200
assuming that I can get a second for the motion.

13:49.200 --> 13:56.200
And I trust one of the members of the committee will do the honor of agreeing to second this tomorrow morning.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.200
Mr. Chairman, I suppose the second is tomorrow morning.

14:00.200 --> 14:04.200
I'm sure it will take a few hours to do this and then the time is better to make a motion.

14:04.200 --> 14:09.200
The second is certainly will have to find a footed after the event has been added to the opportunity.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.200
While we've got the opportunity, most of the time it's not going to be read.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.200
He's not making any changes.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.200
He's going to make a motion tomorrow morning.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.200
I'm trying to share with Mr. Chairman that's the right answer.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.200
But that's the purpose, and I think that, yes.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.200
That's a public information that's traveling, I think there should be read,

14:20.200 --> 14:24.200
so that all parties and interests and everyone else is fully advised

14:24.200 --> 14:26.200
of the text of this proposal.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.200
And it reads and follows, and this will be a motion that will be made

14:30.200 --> 14:35.200
as the first order of business tomorrow morning for a formal vote by the committee in public session.

14:35.200 --> 14:41.200
I move that the testimony and secretary Stevens be concluded on the adoption of this motion.

14:41.200 --> 14:48.200
That Senator McCartney, the general call for testimony and for direct and cross-determination.

14:48.200 --> 14:54.200
That on the conclusion of Senator McCartney's testimony, the public hearing is legally set.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.200
That committee counseled the instances to lay the charges and testimony,

14:58.200 --> 15:02.200
and interview all witnesses suggested by anybody concerned,

15:02.200 --> 15:06.200
as well as any other witnesses from the chairman of the council being necessary,

15:06.200 --> 15:11.200
and then report a resume of the statements of all witnesses and any other fact

15:11.200 --> 15:14.200
brought to the attention of council to the subcommittee.

15:14.200 --> 15:19.200
Which subcommittee shall then determine whether further public hearing to the next session?

15:19.200 --> 15:22.200
That after concluding on the testimony by Senator McCartney,

15:22.200 --> 15:27.200
the regular subcommittee shall resume its normal functions under the rules of the Senate,

15:27.200 --> 15:31.200
with respect to any matter is not related to the pending controversy.

15:31.200 --> 15:36.200
And that subcommittee counsel concludes his survey and makes his report to the subcommittee

15:36.200 --> 15:39.200
not later than June 10, 1954.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.200
I doubt whether this needs any elaboration on my thoughts as to chairman.

15:43.200 --> 15:48.200
If done in the interest of the expedition and I think the public well-being,

15:48.200 --> 15:53.200
and I continue to call that one of this matter is considered tomorrow morning formally

15:53.200 --> 15:56.200
as a motion that he will today.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.200
I'll be pretty nervous, but I'd like to be heard before you proceed with the...

16:00.200 --> 16:04.200
Why do you have to express the channel? I think it's going to be a problem.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.200
To advise with Chair and others who may be innocent,

16:07.200 --> 16:10.200
but I shall oppose this motion.

16:10.200 --> 16:14.200
I shall offer a substitute.

16:15.200 --> 16:21.200
This motion I have not yet prepared to substitute, but since it's the offered in the morning,

16:21.200 --> 16:26.200
this motion is that by its author and those who may support it,

16:26.200 --> 16:29.200
is designed to shorten the hearing.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.200
In my opinion, it will have just the opposite effect.

16:34.200 --> 16:39.200
It will delay and hold on, may guarantee, within definitely.

16:39.200 --> 16:45.200
I shall oppose it primarily upon the ground in addition to that.

16:45.200 --> 16:51.200
That is, the lines are right, all printable to this controversy,

16:51.200 --> 17:03.200
some who are accused of having the opportunity to testify in a kick in open and public hearing.

17:03.200 --> 17:09.200
When it seems the charges may be exempt, it also denies them the opportunity

17:09.200 --> 17:17.200
to appear and support by testimony the charges they have made against us.

17:17.200 --> 17:22.200
Let's just tell this motion that will not be revised.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.200
It will only be deemed then further debate,

17:26.200 --> 17:31.200
made a termination of violations before this country, and I repeat again.

17:31.200 --> 17:35.200
There are no more serious charges.

17:35.200 --> 17:40.200
There are no charges pending against commoners in any segment of this government.

17:40.200 --> 17:47.200
There are more importance to the security of this country than the charges now pending against the Secretary of the Army,

17:47.200 --> 17:56.200
that he is humbling commoners, and that he is attempting blackmail in order to cause legitimate hearing

17:56.200 --> 18:01.200
of a regular committee of the United States Senate that he suspended,

18:01.200 --> 18:07.200
and charges that he is holding as hostage, a private in the Army,

18:07.200 --> 18:11.200
in order to compel the discontinuing of the investigations,

18:11.200 --> 18:14.200
our commoners in subversiveness and government,

18:14.200 --> 18:17.200
let the chairman of these charges are through.

18:17.200 --> 18:23.200
There is no more importance work for this or any other committee to do in the Congress,

18:23.200 --> 18:30.200
and to find out the truth of these charges, so that a corporate action may be immediately taken.

18:30.200 --> 18:35.200
The Secretary of the Army is trying to discuss the general outline of the substantive motion

18:35.200 --> 18:38.200
so that we can have all the information before it is for study.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.200
So, Councils, are very distanced and also thinking about that to be...

18:42.200 --> 18:45.200
Well, Mr. Chairman, am I wanting to be in general right now without...

18:45.200 --> 18:49.200
Yes, I'll read it here, leaving out the time. It's very simple.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.200
Shall we write it in a problem we buy the sum?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.200
So, this will be the...

18:55.200 --> 18:58.200
In subversiveness, the subsecretes motion,

18:58.200 --> 19:03.200
that after each of the principles to this controversy,

19:03.200 --> 19:07.200
as witnesses have testified in chief,

19:07.200 --> 19:11.200
that each senator has, and this is subject to change,

19:11.200 --> 19:16.200
one house for emphasis, six, ten minutes to be,

19:16.200 --> 19:19.200
for interrogation of the witness,

19:19.200 --> 19:23.200
and that each principle side, or their attorneys,

19:23.200 --> 19:28.200
have four hours each for question instead, principle, and witness.

19:28.200 --> 19:34.200
But all such time has expired, the witness shall then be excused.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.200
The Chairman, I just want to make a very brief one.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.200
Mr. Chairman, this does not affect the...

19:44.200 --> 19:47.200
...the president rule that keeps Councils out,

19:47.200 --> 19:51.200
and then is the question without time limitation,

19:51.200 --> 19:53.200
and then is the question.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.200
Chairman, I really want to make a brief observation at this time,

19:57.200 --> 20:01.200
because I do believe that it is most important,

20:01.200 --> 20:06.200
that comment he made so that all of us can have an opportunity

20:06.200 --> 20:09.200
to think this matter over carefully,

20:09.200 --> 20:14.200
when we meet tomorrow morning to vote on the motion by,

20:14.200 --> 20:16.200
or the Secretary of the Senate of Illinois,

20:16.200 --> 20:21.200
and my distinguished colleague from Arkansas's substitute motion.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.200
I think that any change that has to be made in the rules,

20:25.200 --> 20:28.200
should have as obvious subjective,

20:28.200 --> 20:31.200
simple justice and fair play,

20:31.200 --> 20:34.200
to all principles to this controversy.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.200
I think it's understandable to the man in the street,

20:37.200 --> 20:41.200
that when charges have been made in public against people,

20:41.200 --> 20:46.200
those individuals have the right to refuse and publish.

20:46.200 --> 20:51.200
The right to face the accusers, face the face,

20:51.200 --> 20:54.200
is elementary justice in this country,

20:54.200 --> 20:58.200
and from our British forebears for generations.

20:58.200 --> 21:02.200
And I don't believe that we can substitute that objective,

21:03.200 --> 21:09.200
but by providing an alternate means whereby that alleged objective

21:09.200 --> 21:14.200
will be achieved over a typewriter interviewing witnesses.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.200
Now, in the motion mentioned,

21:16.200 --> 21:19.200
is made about interviewing witnesses.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.200
All I can say is that the witnesses,

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
principles to this controversy of all,

21:25.200 --> 21:27.200
have already been interviewed,

21:27.200 --> 21:29.200
I take it that the motion ought to be reworded

21:30.200 --> 21:35.200
to provide for the re-interview of what I sincerely believe

21:35.200 --> 21:39.200
that the substitute motion offered by Senator McClellan

21:39.200 --> 21:41.200
goes to the heart of this problem.

21:41.200 --> 21:48.200
And that is to cut down unnecessary time on irrelevant issues.

21:48.200 --> 21:52.200
Let us not cut down the principles to this controversy

21:52.200 --> 21:55.200
and ask the right to be heard.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.200
The right to a fair hearing.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.200
There's something that I think we all understand

22:00.200 --> 22:05.200
as an indispensable part of any kind of rules of their place.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.200
Any other senator is there to be heard

22:07.200 --> 22:10.200
on the subject matter before we proceed with the interviewing

22:10.200 --> 22:14.200
of the witnesses to the chairman of the assembly?

22:14.200 --> 22:17.200
I have a very short comment to make.

22:17.200 --> 22:24.200
First, to me, the logic, and the reasoning behind the substitute amendment,

22:24.200 --> 22:30.200
other distinguished senior senator from Arkansas, is unanswerable.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.200
As a Jackson said,

22:33.200 --> 22:40.200
that every public servant has the right to answer any charges made against him.

22:40.200 --> 22:45.200
Every principle in this case happens to be a public servant.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.200
I'd like to add one simple thought to that,

22:48.200 --> 22:51.200
to anybody who expects to be of any use

22:51.200 --> 22:54.200
in the service of their country in the future.

22:54.200 --> 23:00.200
He not only has the right, he has the duty.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.200
Any other senator is coming to start with the shared rules

23:03.200 --> 23:05.200
that he should not call on in principle,

23:05.200 --> 23:07.200
though that counsel at this time to express themselves,

23:07.200 --> 23:08.200
but he will do so.

23:08.200 --> 23:11.200
Tomorrow morning, before any goes to take it.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.200
In fairness to Mr. Stevens, for example, he has not seen this motion

23:15.200 --> 23:17.200
until he came to the committee meeting without a meeting.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.200
He could have admitted to Hensel.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.200
None of the principles I'm sure have heard the substitute's motion made

23:21.200 --> 23:25.200
because Senator McCullough and the office for the first time here today.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.200
That's correct.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.200
However, you will listen to any other members of the committee

23:29.200 --> 23:32.200
if they want to express themselves on this point.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.200
And the part.

23:34.200 --> 23:39.200
I think that Senator Dirkens was wise and postponed in action

23:39.200 --> 23:42.200
on this resolution until tomorrow.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.200
That's all important,

23:45.200 --> 23:48.200
that Mr. Stevens and members of his team,

23:48.200 --> 23:51.200
an opportunity to recover the resolution

23:51.200 --> 23:53.200
and all the resolution,

23:53.200 --> 23:56.200
the substitute resolution will be offered by Senator McCullough.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.200
It's not easy.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.200
There's no easy solution to this problem.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.200
We've been the first piece today,

24:04.200 --> 24:07.200
and the first witness is still on the same.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.200
And I would just, I can well appreciate the.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.200
The resolution that the secretary of law, Mr. Stevens, has been hungry.

24:16.200 --> 24:21.200
During this 13-day break.

24:21.200 --> 24:25.200
Now I have taken 15 days for Mr. Stevens.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.200
He's still on the same.

24:27.200 --> 24:34.200
I can't say where Mr. Adams or Senator McRatham and Mr. Colman and Mr. Car,

24:34.200 --> 24:37.200
would be expected to be also standing in the last time,

24:38.200 --> 24:40.200
then the 13-day.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.200
So my simple risk of taking.

24:42.200 --> 24:47.200
The secretary of law can do a hearing of an addition to a month.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.200
Now I'm convinced that there's a great deal of reputation in the hearing.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.200
And I hope that the whole can be eliminated.

24:54.200 --> 24:59.200
And I'm hopeful that with other witnesses that are then invited by either side,

24:59.200 --> 25:04.200
there will be a constant reputation of the testing order that has been given to folks.

25:04.200 --> 25:07.200
I do think however, that all will pass.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.200
Not to fall out.

25:09.200 --> 25:13.200
In this case, therefore I hope that,

25:13.200 --> 25:18.200
whatever device we use to expedite the speed up the hearing,

25:18.200 --> 25:25.200
no way eliminated the full and impartial furnace to it.

25:25.200 --> 25:30.200
I, if anybody has any panacea for bringing us about,

25:30.200 --> 25:35.200
I know one number, but to me, I'd be more passionate to receive this home.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.200
The question you have in you, right?

25:39.200 --> 25:42.200
I can't avoid that, I can't say.

25:42.200 --> 25:46.200
The chair believes, Mr. Secretary,

25:46.200 --> 25:51.200
that if we engage the principles in this discussion,

25:51.200 --> 25:53.200
now we may protect it for some time,

25:53.200 --> 25:55.200
because obviously if I recognize you for that purpose,

25:55.200 --> 25:57.200
and I will, if you insist,

25:57.200 --> 26:01.200
I'll have to recognize some of the McCarthy and Mr. Barnes,

26:01.200 --> 26:03.200
and be the hope of the chair,

26:03.200 --> 26:07.200
that all principles and all council would make no precipice at this time,

26:07.200 --> 26:10.200
on either of these suggestions in the hope,

26:10.200 --> 26:13.200
that during the opportunity of courted you,

26:13.200 --> 26:16.200
throughout the evening you could consult with your council,

26:16.200 --> 26:21.200
perhaps to consult under the leadership of our council with each other,

26:21.200 --> 26:24.200
in an effort to determine whether either of these suggestions

26:24.200 --> 26:29.200
or a modification of them or a combination of them, some way.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.200
Of course, I'll get to the director with that in the chair.
