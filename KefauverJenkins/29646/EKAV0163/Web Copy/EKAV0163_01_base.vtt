WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
between the time for

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
empathy and inflection

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
inspection on January 3

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
and assign the

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
fifth

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
judge with issues on

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
federal exec and the

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
government to add them to

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
anything that's happened.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
The judge will not

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
be fluttered or

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
insurgented to

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
have been used

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
to keep within the

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
framework of that rule.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I will now

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
ask Mr. Stevens

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
what reference to the

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
correct date, whether or

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
not Mr.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Adams had any

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
participation in the

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
honorable discharge of

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
major corrects, specifically

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
on February 1, 1954.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
I don't know.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Mr. Adams can touch

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
five on that.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Well, now, Mr.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Stanton, I

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
can't admit that.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Mr. Stevens has been

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
telling the judge that

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
you asked the secretary

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
whether he knows

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
or any connection,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
if he says no.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
That's as far as he's

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
involved with his

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
freedom in coming.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Mr. Beckett, I might

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
be worried this way.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Mr. Secretary, you

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
told us on last Friday that

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
the Infected General has

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
submitted to you final

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
a completely thought

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
as the remains of those

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
responsible for every

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
step in the handling

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
and the mith handling of

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
the case of this

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
instrument, I mean, it's

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
made.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Was that so, sir?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
No, you put a lot of

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
words in my mouth in that

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
statement that I did not

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
make on the correct

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
or just would you please

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
correct me, sir?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yes, sir.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
What I said was,

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
actually, he was

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
part of the Infected

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
General was now

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
ready.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I had to add at this

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
time, and I don't

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
recall that I said it

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
last Friday, but I had

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
now that I have not had

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
some opportunities to go

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
through this report.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
It's a very

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
aluminum document.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I'm going to go through it

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
at the first possible

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
time.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I stated, after

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
meeting on the 24th of

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
February, that I

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
worked in due course

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
when after the Infected

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
General's report had

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
been submitted, to

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
provide the names that

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
you talked about.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I have made public

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
a letter on

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
February 16th dealing

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
with the toll matter.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm prepared to submit

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
those names to the

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Council for this

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
committee.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Just as soon as I have

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
gotten a chance that

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
long enough away from the

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
committee to have a

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
chance to go over the

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
report myself, but I'm

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
not yet have a chance to

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
do.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Mr. Chairman, I might say

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I think the Secretary

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
knows, on the emphasis, we

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
play sign, if there are

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
any left.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
We, the great

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
important, Mr.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Sergeant, I might say

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
that the address is

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
to you, Mr. Secretary.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Sorry, I just need

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
to submit the name

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
just as soon as

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
you have the chance to

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
submit the name

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
just as soon as you

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
have the chance to go over

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
the report myself.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
I'm prepared to submit the

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
name just as soon as you have

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
the chance to go over the

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
report myself.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Mr. Chairman, what they

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
are?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Mr. Secretary, is it not

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
so that on the basis of

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
the basis of the basis of

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
meeting, you have had

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
with Senator McCarthy and

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
members of the committee.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
On the basis of the

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
basis of the letter and

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
telegram, which Senator

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
McCarthy has sent to you, on

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
the basis of the

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
specifications we filed in

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
this case.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
And on the basis of your

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
questioning, up to now, you

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
have had every reason to

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
know just how much

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
important we attach to

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
the misunderstanding of the

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
case.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Mr. Chairman, I

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
think that this is not

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
a bad statement.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
That's why I know you

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
had been telling about it.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
All right.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Then to help us along with

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
your approach examination

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
and try to wind us up

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
there, would it not have

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
been possible for you over

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
the weekend to look at that

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
report so you could answer

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
those questions for us this

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
morning?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Can say we'll go about what

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
have been possible.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Chairman,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I can't conclude the

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
examination until I have

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
an examination in the

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Secretary and Mrs.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Secretary.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
That's a very, very

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
very aluminum report.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
It's done effect a

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
long time for me to go

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
through it.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I have made commitment to

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
submit the name to the

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Council for the Committee

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
and will do so at the

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
earliest possible moment.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And I will, when I've

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
in my touch the money is

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
finished, I will say

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Mr. Chairman, I'll try to

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
get out that report just

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
as quickly as I can,

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
and present with my other

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
duties under the

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Department.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Mr. Chairman, I will be

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
much out of this

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
investigation.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
You obviously cannot

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
interrogate the

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Secretary successfully

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
out of the report,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
but she is not red

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
in the bottom.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I suggest Mr. Chairman,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
and I hope the Secretary

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
and his family are

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
out.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
What has been prepared on these

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
names because he knows how

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
much important we are

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
in this case.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I think we're in

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
total about all events.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
He says he has not read the

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
report, and if he has not

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
read the report, I don't

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
see how we can answer any

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
questions.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
He has agreed to submit

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
to the hearings and the

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
names.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
After the name has been

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
submitted, right?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
The committee can

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
advise the committee to

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
the next best step.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
We will be in

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
the next one.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Mr. Chairman, I know from

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
the charge to the

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Mr. Adams, who is the

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
one that's named in

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
the tonight's news of the

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
press matter.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
How we dispose of this by

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
putting Mr. Adams on

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
this.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Mr. Sieben was named

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
to the Senate.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Why not?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
We respectfully

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
grow your attention to

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
allegation number 26.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Mr. Sieben, Adams and

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Associate have been quick

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
to publish and re-week

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
a report calculated to

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
smear the investigated

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
and exposure of

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
communist infiltration.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
But the

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
vice collapse of much

04:46.000 --> 04:46.000


04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
he even had an

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
approach.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Had yes to produce, for

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
the American public, the

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
long-term policy for

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
naming those officials

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
built serving under

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
that for our

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
responsibility for the

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
rise in the arms of a

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
communist insurer against

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
his country.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
And it's on the basis of

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Mr. Sieben's direct

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
participation in

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
acknowledge this case that

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
we speak to

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
interrogation.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
And when we're

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
at the point

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
out of the charge to

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
41, the president

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
is going to be

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
charged in 41 on

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
charge 41 or

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
charge 41.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
He stayed

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
honored before February

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
16, 1954.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Mr. Adams

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
advised that he had on

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
prior cases that if the

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
investigation continues, he

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
expected to be

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
acutely embarrassed

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
over the first date.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
No follow-up action has

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
been taken by him.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm not reading the

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
balance is not

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
necessary.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
But in your charges, it's

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
primarily on the press matter

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
as the

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
gens mister Adams.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I just call

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
the age of his

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
head and his

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
actions, according to

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
one charge, and

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Mr. Cohen

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
come another.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I think both of my

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
distinguished

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
judges are correct.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Well, in charge

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
45, do you refer to him?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I was just

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
bloody six.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
The last paragraph

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
in the presentation

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
of the judgment.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
The very last paragraph

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
in the

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
interview.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yes, but you do not

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
name the press case.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
You refer to individual

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
communist, but in paragraph

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
46, you make no

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
reference.

06:07.000 --> 06:07.000


06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
interdependent

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
incidental would

06:09.000 --> 06:09.000


06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
be a very

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
good example.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
But in the

06:13.000 --> 06:13.000


06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
nature, it's

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
correct.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
And if you continue

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
reading, sir, I think you

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
will find, although I

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
agree with you, Mr. Adam

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
certainly had a part.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
You don't make the

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
point.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
You don't.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
I just am reading the

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
point language of his.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
You try to

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
mispronounce the

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
atoms, but I don't get

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
them.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
We have to

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
specifically find names

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
during the

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
web page, beginning with

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
the first full paragraph.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Now, the

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Vedic has

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
been to me that there

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
was a

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
lot of things that

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
were happening at the

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
moment.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
In paragraph

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
57, he has not read

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
the point.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
He is

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
getting information

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
further than the fact that

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
the time being that he

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
will submit to us

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
quickly as possible.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
We will definitely

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
assume that he will

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
be before the hearings are

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
over.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
The main

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
just has been

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
replied.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
So the

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
statement was

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
the chairman.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
The good point

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
is that you understand

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
of course you cannot

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
preclude up from getting

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
the information.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I am merely avoiding

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
looking at that report

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
sometime you have

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
got to read it.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I have no such

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
intention of avoiding

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
anything.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
How many days that's the

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
report going on your

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
office?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I think I touched

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
about last Friday.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I think it was finished

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
about Thursday or Friday.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Now, who has been

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
ordered to examine that

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
report can give you a

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
resume on a report on

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
it if anyone?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I see the

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Inspector General and

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
the

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Secretary of the Army.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Let's be a

07:36.000 --> 07:36.000


07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Secretary's name.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
His name is

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Nope.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Am I LPLM?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
And have you been

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
working on that

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
since Friday?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I don't know.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Will

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
you order him to work

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
in my children's

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
children's?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
No, I did not.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
He has a lot of

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
other duties to

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
perform and important ones.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Well, I must

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
put you to say that

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
you have been promising

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
over a period of months

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
that sometimes I am

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
in some place.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
You will give us the

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
names of those who are

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
responsible for the

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
growth of the handling

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
of this coming

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
of the state.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Now, can you tell us

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
when, what

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
today, what

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
week you can come in here

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
and tell us whether

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
or not he was

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
John Adams, who it

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
was, who was responsible

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
number one for the change

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
in duty order.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
When he was

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
destined to go to

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Yokohama, he

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
requested to be kept

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
in the United States.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
And

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
it's not as

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
done as a result of the

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
American

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
military.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
It is

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
actually the

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
I.G. report.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Does the

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Inspector General

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
play that for so

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
way?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
I haven't

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
expected that.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I haven't

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
expected that.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, you know that he

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
was asked for a question

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
about whether or not

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
coming to help you

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
and get your change in

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
duty order.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
He said, I

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
recutate his

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
hands on the ground.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
It might

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
incriminate me.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
That's all the truth.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Did you know

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
that?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
No, I didn't

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
know that.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
It is not

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
the case.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
The

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
United States

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
has been

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
asked to investigate this case.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
It might

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
have been recommended to

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
the Department of

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Justice.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Mr.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Stevens, you know that

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
the matter is

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
formed.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
The American

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Red Cross investigates

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
every case.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
The American Red Cross

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
is not responsible for

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
the change in duty order.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
They make an

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
investigation to

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
the Middle

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Report.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Many of the cases, the

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
young men, the

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
numerous

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
military, the

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
military, the

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
military, the

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
military.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I know that it is

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
just this.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Will

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
you talk about this

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
time, Mr.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Well?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I am

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
just about the

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
investigation.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I am trying to find

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
out Mr.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Stevens from this

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
land.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
A lot of

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
anything he

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
knows about the

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
report.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
If he has

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
discovered

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
after this time,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
who is

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
responsible?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
If not, why

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
does

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
he think of a

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
vast array of

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
granted

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
confidence, young men

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
behind him?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Perhaps

10:01.000 --> 10:01.000


10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
better than

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
one of that good.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
To go over

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
and read the

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
report and come back

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
and say, Mr.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Secretary, it is

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
John Jones, who

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
has speech

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Smith to the

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Milligrae.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
That

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
shouldn't take

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
weeks and weeks.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
The

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
U.B.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
has to be

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
on the start

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
and this is how

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
it leads.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
If the

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
secretary gives

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
the committee some

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
of the

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
members of the

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
committee, he

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
says, well, I think that

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
depends very

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
largely on how long I

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
continue to testify.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Would he be

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
responsible to have

10:34.000 --> 10:34.000


10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
secretary?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
If I am

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
going to

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
study, if I am

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
going to work, I

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
will have to go over

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
this report myself.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
And I have told you, and I

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
respect, I will submit the

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
name to the council for the

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
committee, as soon as I am

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
able to go over the

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
report.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
And when I am able to

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
go over, I will

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
depend on how long I

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
continue to testify.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
There are

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
so many issues

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
along this report.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
I don't know that I am

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
a

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
patient, but I am

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
very, very

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
a little

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
minestocked.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Well, roughly,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
120,000.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
I say only

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
guessing, but I have to

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
fold it.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
It might be

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
500 to take a

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
number.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Well, you've got a

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
great number of

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
age behind you, and I need

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
them, and I need them

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
to think the report.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I don't know.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Could you ask

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
if the

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Adam is

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
anyone to think?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Why don't we let

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Mr. Adam testify on

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
it himself?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't think I have

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
because I haven't

11:24.000 --> 11:24.000


11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
myself, Senator.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Have you

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
discussed with Mr.

11:27.000 --> 11:27.000


11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
request of

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
whether or not

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
he took

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
some part in the

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Southern Honorable

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Disparage of this

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Communist

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Officer?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I don't think

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
all that in

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
conversation.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm not at all.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
I'd like to remind

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
you that I was in the

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
forest, and that's

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
back here.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I think I'm

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
very happy to be

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
here.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
It's just a

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
little bit of a

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
little bit of a

11:51.000 --> 11:52.500
little bedroom in

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
bags and that's back

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
toARE.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.300
Have the rest

11:56.300 --> 11:57.000
hours without the

11:57.000 --> 11:57.500
arms, is it?

11:57.500 --> 11:59.500
Yes, the

11:59.500 --> 12:01.380
body types

12:01.380 --> 12:02.980
of testimony on痕

12:02.980 --> 12:03.500
are.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.000
Adam just

12:06.000 --> 12:06.980
concerns the

12:07.000 --> 12:08.980
earlier days.

12:08.980 --> 12:09.980
Do you turn the

12:09.980 --> 12:09.980


12:09.980 --> 12:10.640
would submit mo

12:10.640 --> 12:11.980
around this is

12:11.980 --> 12:15.000
the предala

12:15.000 --> 12:17.720
ad

12:18.720 --> 12:19.720
your letter to me

12:19.720 --> 12:20.720
stated I think

12:20.720 --> 12:21.720
February 1.

12:21.720 --> 12:22.720
When you said

12:22.720 --> 12:23.720
that you're going to

12:23.720 --> 12:24.720
report when you're

12:24.720 --> 12:24.720


12:24.720 --> 12:25.720
a four-year

12:25.720 --> 12:26.720
I got I got your

12:26.720 --> 12:27.720
letter and

12:27.720 --> 12:28.720
read that on the way

12:28.720 --> 12:29.720
back.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.720
How did you get my

12:31.720 --> 12:32.720
letter when you

12:32.720 --> 12:33.720
snuffed up on your way

12:33.720 --> 12:34.720
near?

12:34.720 --> 12:35.720
I got it because

12:35.720 --> 12:36.720
it's my office thought

12:36.720 --> 12:37.720
about some of

12:37.720 --> 12:38.720
a briefcase full of

12:38.720 --> 12:39.720
very important

12:39.720 --> 12:40.720
matters.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.720
It's

12:41.720 --> 12:42.720
happening one of the

12:42.720 --> 12:43.720
items.

12:43.720 --> 12:44.720
Your letter was

12:44.720 --> 12:45.720
there.

12:45.720 --> 12:46.720
Actually, because

12:46.720 --> 12:46.720


12:46.720 --> 12:47.720
I didn't have much

12:47.720 --> 12:48.720
time to

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
do any work on it on

12:49.720 --> 12:50.720
the plane coming back.

12:50.720 --> 12:51.720
But the paper that I

12:51.720 --> 12:53.720
was thinking about,

12:53.720 --> 12:54.720
what's your

12:54.720 --> 12:55.720
letter?

12:55.720 --> 12:57.720
February 2nd,

12:57.720 --> 12:58.720
the

12:58.720 --> 12:59.720
beginning February 2nd,

12:59.720 --> 13:00.720
and what they have

13:00.720 --> 13:01.720
did to me, have you

13:01.720 --> 13:02.720
discussed

13:02.720 --> 13:03.720
this matter with Mr.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.720
Adam?

13:04.720 --> 13:05.720
The

13:05.720 --> 13:06.720
press case?

13:06.720 --> 13:07.720
Yes.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
Did you discuss

13:08.720 --> 13:09.720
with him the

13:09.720 --> 13:10.720
question of rule

13:10.720 --> 13:11.720
is responsible for

13:11.720 --> 13:12.720
the sudden

13:12.720 --> 13:13.720
honorable

13:13.720 --> 13:14.720
dissident

13:14.720 --> 13:16.720
and the

13:16.720 --> 13:17.720
press case?

13:17.720 --> 13:18.720
Yes.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
I don't think

13:19.720 --> 13:20.720
I think Mr. Adam

13:20.720 --> 13:21.720
will testify on that.

13:21.720 --> 13:22.720
You don't

13:22.720 --> 13:23.720
become

13:23.720 --> 13:24.720
the spy whether or

13:24.720 --> 13:25.720
not he had anything

13:25.720 --> 13:26.720
to do with it?

13:26.720 --> 13:27.720
No,

13:27.720 --> 13:28.720
I wasn't here.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
It's time.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.720
I don't know.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.720
Are you in the

13:31.720 --> 13:32.720
worry?

13:32.720 --> 13:33.720
Yes.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.720
But you've been

13:34.720 --> 13:35.720
back here since

13:35.720 --> 13:36.720
February 2nd.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
The question is, did

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
you discuss with Mr.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
Adam?

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
Illegally, this very

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
important

13:41.720 --> 13:42.720
charge.

13:42.720 --> 13:43.720
The charge that he

13:43.720 --> 13:44.720
had been back here since

13:44.720 --> 13:45.720
its

13:45.720 --> 13:45.720


13:45.720 --> 13:46.720
this

13:46.720 --> 13:47.720
and then

13:47.720 --> 13:48.720
the

13:48.720 --> 13:49.720
communists and the

13:49.720 --> 13:50.720
jurisdiction of the

13:50.720 --> 13:51.720
armed

13:51.720 --> 13:52.720
jurisdiction of the

13:52.720 --> 13:53.720
court.

13:53.720 --> 13:54.720
So did you discuss

13:54.720 --> 13:55.720
that?

13:55.720 --> 13:56.720
I just

13:56.720 --> 13:57.720
discussed the

13:57.720 --> 13:58.720
letter of

13:58.720 --> 13:59.720
February 16th, but that

13:59.720 --> 14:00.720
worked out in

14:00.720 --> 14:01.720
the county

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
of Macarpene.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.720
That's

14:04.720 --> 14:06.720
that, but

14:06.720 --> 14:08.720
of course, was

14:08.720 --> 14:10.720
done out of it.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.720
You have

14:11.720 --> 14:18.720
been

14:18.720 --> 14:18.720


14:18.720 --> 14:18.720


14:18.720 --> 14:19.720
position.

14:19.720 --> 14:20.720
And the

14:20.720 --> 14:21.720
honour of this

14:21.720 --> 14:21.720


14:21.720 --> 14:22.720
parade.

14:22.720 --> 14:23.720
I've

14:23.720 --> 14:24.720
testified.

14:24.720 --> 14:25.720
I did not know.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.720
And I

14:26.720 --> 14:27.720
repeated.

14:27.720 --> 14:28.720
I understand that.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.720
I'm

14:29.720 --> 14:30.720
not asking.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.720
I'm not asking.

14:31.720 --> 14:32.720
I'm asking.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.720
I'm not asking.

14:34.720 --> 14:35.720
I'm not asking.

14:35.720 --> 14:36.720
Now I understand that you

14:36.720 --> 14:37.720
now have before you

14:37.720 --> 14:38.720
the report of the

14:38.720 --> 14:39.720
instructor general with

14:39.720 --> 14:41.720
the

14:41.720 --> 14:42.720
instructor general.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.720
Where is the

14:43.720 --> 14:44.720
instructor general?

14:44.720 --> 14:45.720
Where is the

14:45.720 --> 14:46.720
available

14:46.720 --> 14:47.720
to you, Mr.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
секsage?

14:48.720 --> 14:49.720
Yes.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.720
He

14:50.720 --> 14:51.720
is here in Washington

14:51.720 --> 14:52.720
and he is here at

14:52.720 --> 14:52.720


14:52.720 --> 14:53.720
department.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.720
Has

14:54.720 --> 14:55.720
an office in the

14:55.720 --> 14:56.720
panic.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.720
Is that correct?

14:57.720 --> 14:58.720
Now I believe you stated

14:58.720 --> 14:59.720
that perhaps it's

14:59.720 --> 15:00.720
a 500-page document.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.720
The

15:01.720 --> 15:02.720
plan is a son of

15:02.720 --> 15:03.720
the

15:03.720 --> 15:04.720
area.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
The

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
democratization is

15:06.720 --> 15:07.720
warning to

15:07.720 --> 15:09.720
the

15:09.720 --> 15:10.720
instructor general.

15:10.720 --> 15:11.720
Then you

15:11.720 --> 15:12.720
not.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.720
Now I am

15:13.720 --> 15:14.720
I'm

15:14.720 --> 15:15.720
I'm

15:15.720 --> 15:16.720
I'm

15:16.720 --> 15:17.720
I'm

15:17.720 --> 15:18.720
I'm

15:18.720 --> 15:19.720
I'm

15:19.720 --> 15:20.720
I'm

15:20.720 --> 15:21.720
I'm

15:21.720 --> 15:22.720
I'm

15:22.720 --> 15:23.720
I'm

15:23.720 --> 15:24.720
I'm

15:24.720 --> 15:25.720
I'm

15:25.720 --> 15:26.720
I'm

15:26.720 --> 15:27.720
I'm

publicly the

information is

16:15.720 --> 16:16.720
whether or not

16:16.720 --> 16:17.720
miss the

16:17.720 --> 16:18.720
item that

16:18.720 --> 16:19.720
didn't do with it.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.720
Well, I'm

16:20.720 --> 16:21.720
just making a suggestion

16:21.720 --> 16:22.720
and asking

16:22.720 --> 16:23.720
is that in the

16:23.720 --> 16:24.720
industry's

16:24.720 --> 16:25.720
feet?

16:25.720 --> 16:26.720
If it occurred to me

16:26.720 --> 16:27.720
that that would be a way

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
out of the

16:28.720 --> 16:29.720
solution to the

16:29.720 --> 16:30.720
process.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.720
Can you do it or not?

16:31.720 --> 16:32.720
I can do that

16:32.720 --> 16:33.720
but I think

16:33.720 --> 16:34.720
the mayor doesn't

16:34.720 --> 16:35.720
know it.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.720
Does not

16:36.720 --> 16:37.720
preclude

16:37.720 --> 16:38.720
you also

16:38.720 --> 16:39.720
giving your

16:39.720 --> 16:40.720
knowledge,

16:40.720 --> 16:41.720
are the senator

16:41.720 --> 16:42.720
from asking you

16:42.720 --> 16:43.720
about your knowledge?

16:43.720 --> 16:44.720
That's no

16:44.720 --> 16:45.720
criticism.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.720
You merely

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
have statement of fact.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.720
Now, can we

16:48.720 --> 16:49.720
lead it

16:49.720 --> 16:50.720
and change

16:50.720 --> 16:51.720
with this afternoon?

16:51.720 --> 16:52.720
Bring that

16:52.720 --> 16:53.720
information so

16:53.720 --> 16:54.720
we can

16:54.720 --> 16:54.720


16:54.720 --> 16:55.720
point of

16:55.720 --> 16:55.720


16:55.720 --> 16:56.720
sure I can

16:56.720 --> 16:56.720


16:56.720 --> 16:57.720
to say

16:57.720 --> 16:58.720
if you

16:58.720 --> 16:59.720
should bring it

16:59.720 --> 17:00.720
into the

17:00.720 --> 17:01.720
morning I make

17:01.720 --> 17:02.720
Mr. Jenkins, I

17:02.720 --> 17:03.720
want to

17:03.720 --> 17:04.720
just come

17:04.720 --> 17:05.720
any one.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.720
Just

17:06.720 --> 17:06.720


17:06.720 --> 17:07.720
can.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.720
Mr. Chairman,

17:08.720 --> 17:09.720
may

17:09.720 --> 17:10.720
that

17:10.720 --> 17:11.720
so I can get it.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.720
While other

17:12.720 --> 17:13.720
senators are being

17:13.720 --> 17:14.720
asked about that, we

17:14.720 --> 17:15.720
do question the

17:15.720 --> 17:16.720
secretary.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
Let's return to our

17:17.720 --> 17:18.720
studio to trust the

17:18.720 --> 17:19.720
country to permit our

17:19.720 --> 17:20.720
station to identify

17:20.720 --> 17:21.720
themselves.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.720
This is the

17:22.720 --> 17:23.720
ABC

17:23.720 --> 17:24.720
television network.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.720
Miami was

17:25.720 --> 17:26.720
national headquarters

17:26.720 --> 17:27.720
for the mob until

17:27.720 --> 17:28.720
the police drove

17:28.720 --> 17:29.720
out the

17:29.720 --> 17:30.720
beger.

17:30.720 --> 17:31.720
Mash the

17:31.720 --> 17:32.720
big shots into the

17:32.720 --> 17:33.720
seat.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.720
See the Miami

17:34.720 --> 17:35.720
story, starting

17:35.720 --> 17:36.720
tiny

17:36.720 --> 17:37.720
the paramount

17:37.720 --> 17:38.720
theatre time

17:38.720 --> 17:39.720
square.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.720
I don't

18:10.720 --> 18:11.720
think

18:11.720 --> 18:12.720
that the

18:12.720 --> 18:13.720
administration

18:13.720 --> 18:14.720
would want

18:14.720 --> 18:15.720
to act without

18:15.720 --> 18:16.720
the hearings.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.720
That's the part

18:17.720 --> 18:18.720
is directly involved

18:18.720 --> 18:19.720
in these

18:19.720 --> 18:20.720
things.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.720
Mr.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.720
Adams is

18:22.720 --> 18:23.720
present.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.720
You

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
can get it

18:25.720 --> 18:26.720
that's

18:26.720 --> 18:27.720
worth if you want

18:27.720 --> 18:28.720
it.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.720
I don't think

18:29.720 --> 18:30.720
that the

18:30.720 --> 18:31.720
administration has

18:31.720 --> 18:32.720
been

18:32.720 --> 18:33.720
reporting for it

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
either.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
It might not

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
have the name

18:36.720 --> 18:37.720
to be released.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.000
This is

18:39.000 --> 18:39.000


18:39.000 --> 18:39.720
For Russia, the

18:39.720 --> 18:39.720


18:39.720 --> 18:40.720
side percent is

18:40.720 --> 18:41.520
shared that the fact

18:41.520 --> 18:44.920
already

18:44.920 --> 18:45.920
not be proved

18:45.920 --> 18:46.920
정을

18:46.920 --> 18:47.240
there is

18:47.240 --> 18:47.640
a

18:47.640 --> 18:48.840
15 August

18:48.840 --> 18:49.600
unless

18:49.600 --> 18:53.440
we

18:53.440 --> 18:54.960
cook

18:54.960 --> 18:55.720
something

18:55.720 --> 18:56.720
complicated.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.720
Yes.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.720
Yes.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.720
It too

18:59.720 --> 19:00.720
well.

19:00.720 --> 19:01.720
Mr.

19:01.720 --> 19:05.200
Dakota

19:05.200 --> 19:06.000
Benjamin

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
right.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
I think we have an excellent

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
suggestion.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I would like to expand on that

19:10.000 --> 19:14.300
but to Secretary-NC if you could get this information over the moon or

19:14.300 --> 19:14.800
or

19:14.800 --> 19:15.800
quarter more

19:15.800 --> 19:16.800
morning.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.800
As you, who

19:17.800 --> 19:18.800
undoubtedly

19:18.800 --> 19:19.800
recall, there was an order

19:19.800 --> 19:20.800
that giving an honorable

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
discharge from

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
Mr.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.800
Pratt that order was

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
fine

19:24.800 --> 19:25.800
early in January.

19:25.800 --> 19:26.800
As you

19:26.800 --> 19:27.800
now

19:27.800 --> 19:28.800
now

19:28.800 --> 19:29.800
they will recall from the

19:29.800 --> 19:30.800
testimony

19:30.800 --> 19:30.800


19:30.800 --> 19:31.800
identified that he was going to take the full 90 days.

19:31.800 --> 19:32.800
Staying

19:32.800 --> 19:33.800
as long as he could, which is a bloody amount

19:33.800 --> 19:34.800
sometimes

19:34.800 --> 19:34.800


19:34.800 --> 19:35.800
early

19:35.800 --> 19:41.800
as you will recall, I wrote to you the letter which you said you got in California.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.600
Asking that you take action with Pratt

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
and

19:44.600 --> 19:47.600
have a court

19:47.600 --> 19:48.600
marshal

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
of

19:49.600 --> 19:52.600
his conduct on becoming an officer and reducing the cell

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
television

19:53.600 --> 19:56.600
coming to leadership school forming coming to spells

19:56.600 --> 19:58.200
at the army base holding meetings in

19:58.200 --> 19:59.200
Calisota

19:59.200 --> 20:02.800
as you will recall

20:02.800 --> 20:05.000
before you got back to the United States

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
immediately after the public

20:07.000 --> 20:09.800
Mr. Pratt got an honorable discharge.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.000
Now, I would like to have you

20:11.000 --> 20:12.200
to apply to the committee.

20:12.200 --> 20:16.200
Number one, the question for Mr. Adams had anything to do

20:16.200 --> 20:19.900
with that sudden removal of Pratt from the military

20:19.900 --> 20:21.400
or if not

20:21.400 --> 20:23.000
who did

20:23.000 --> 20:25.400
who was the activating force

20:25.400 --> 20:26.600
in removing this man

20:26.600 --> 20:28.600
the jurisdiction of the army

20:28.600 --> 20:30.800
before you could be turned from the parties.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.600
Now, I

20:31.600 --> 20:32.600
want that

20:32.600 --> 20:35.000
from the infectious general's report

20:35.000 --> 20:38.400
there be nothing classified with security information involved in that

20:38.400 --> 20:39.600
but there they

20:39.600 --> 20:40.600
I

20:40.600 --> 20:43.800
I wouldn't think so but I don't know how to survive.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.800
Well, could you do this?

20:45.800 --> 20:48.600
Could you ask one of your idiots there you don't need them all now

20:48.600 --> 20:49.600
again

20:49.600 --> 20:52.000
to get on the phone call some of you

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
designated

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and ask him a purchase of that information

20:55.000 --> 20:57.600
shouldn't take any more than five or ten minutes.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.400
It will take more than that senator.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.400
I'm sorry.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.800
The recommendation is counsel.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.800
We have a much better program for getting that because

21:04.800 --> 21:06.400
he is going to have to infect the general's

21:06.400 --> 21:08.400
to look to the report to give him the information I can

21:08.400 --> 21:09.800
to do much more quickly than

21:09.800 --> 21:12.000
having anybody search the 5008-$1.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I don't know just about it.

21:13.000 --> 21:13.400
So you're

21:13.400 --> 21:15.000
proceed with other questions.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.800
And I'm sure the secretary of the state

21:16.800 --> 21:18.800
he would talk to the inspector general

21:18.800 --> 21:21.000
to just say this new meeting with him later when I said

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I didn't say it.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.600
I was going to talk with him just to see him as I possibly can.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.800
How long it will take me to get the exact information

21:26.800 --> 21:29.200
that he wants I cannot forecast with this moment.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.000
I just don't know.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.800
I want to supply as much as I can.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.200
The secretary as soon as possible is too indefinite

21:35.200 --> 21:38.800
in your language because as soon as possible has meant

21:38.800 --> 21:41.000
four months five months fixed on the plan.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.600
I ask you the simple question.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.200
When will you talk to the inspector general in accordance

21:46.200 --> 21:48.200
with the defendant's suggestion?

21:48.200 --> 21:49.600
Can you do that this noon?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.200
You'll be tied up this noon and you do this evening?

21:52.200 --> 21:54.200
When can you do that?

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
I think I can.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
Do it this evening.

21:56.200 --> 21:56.400
All right.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.800
So this morning you should be able to give a sudden

21:58.800 --> 21:59.800
something like that.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.000
I can't commit myself to tomorrow morning because

22:02.000 --> 22:04.400
it is a very large job that I'm giving you here.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.600
And I want you to quickly go to the time when you will

22:07.600 --> 22:10.200
ask the inspector general for this information.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.000
He has said he was asking this evening

22:12.000 --> 22:13.200
for five state of context.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.400
You will ask him to do it.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
Yes.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.800
All right.

22:16.800 --> 22:21.000
Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cohen has some further questions

22:21.000 --> 22:23.200
after you.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.400
Mr. Secretary, obviously people

22:25.400 --> 22:29.600
have offended at what month of the 35 people.

22:29.600 --> 22:33.400
As any one single case ending before a lawyer

22:33.400 --> 22:38.000
was finally resolved to this date.

22:38.000 --> 22:38.800
I don't think so.

22:38.800 --> 22:39.600
I don't believe it.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.800
I think that there must be pretty nearer.

22:41.800 --> 22:42.300
That's right.

22:42.300 --> 22:43.800
But I haven't seen any of the law once.

22:43.800 --> 22:49.800
I mean, once again, sir, these suspensions

22:49.800 --> 22:52.400
are carried beginning on the 19th of August.

22:52.400 --> 22:57.000
33 is a 35 occurred by the 30th of October.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.200
I believe some nine of these people

22:59.200 --> 23:01.200
have been restored to some type of duty.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.900
Although you say nonsense, happened

23:02.900 --> 23:04.900
at the still out of four months.

23:04.900 --> 23:08.100
Now, 33 is extended by October 30.

23:08.100 --> 23:12.800
This is now the middle of May.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.200
Don't you take a little too much time

23:14.200 --> 23:18.600
if it's taken without any adjudication on any one single case?

23:18.600 --> 23:22.000
Mr. Cohen, we're trying to do a good job

23:22.000 --> 23:23.900
and to give all of these people a chance

23:23.900 --> 23:27.200
to the fairly hurt and good old American way.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.100
And I think that in these cases,

23:31.100 --> 23:35.200
where strictly way the people are suspended

23:35.200 --> 23:38.600
and convey of no possible time to the government,

23:38.600 --> 23:40.800
that it's better to go a little more slowly

23:40.800 --> 23:43.100
and get the right answer, that is to show fast

23:43.100 --> 23:44.600
and maybe get the wrong answer.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.900
Mr. Cohen, you're going to have to show it.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.900
Mr. Cohen, you said that there's a new responsible

23:48.900 --> 23:51.600
hearing to government because of this long delay

23:51.700 --> 23:55.500
if you want to hear them in a good old American way.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.300
If they are innocent, my friend,

23:57.300 --> 23:58.400
some of them will be able to prove

23:58.400 --> 24:01.600
that they are not that security-risk.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.300
You're doing rather grave injustice to the individual,

24:04.300 --> 24:06.400
are you not?

24:06.400 --> 24:08.300
I want to remind you of how he means that.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.600
I don't think I understand.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.700
But I would remind you of this

24:10.700 --> 24:12.000
some of those who are suspended

24:12.000 --> 24:13.800
are called for our committee.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.500
As a result of their testimony before the committee,

24:16.500 --> 24:20.700
they apparently convinced you, they convinced me,

24:20.700 --> 24:21.900
and the other is sitting in the committee,

24:21.900 --> 24:27.400
that these individuals had satisfactorily explained

24:27.400 --> 24:30.400
their communist connection.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.800
And if they had been communist and finally

24:32.800 --> 24:35.600
at the police reform, they were reinstated.

24:35.600 --> 24:39.300
They were only out some of them weeks to weeks.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.100
Now, I just ask you this question.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.900
Some of those individuals who have been suspended

24:43.900 --> 24:47.900
have an out nine-hand run.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.900
And is that the usual timeline

24:50.900 --> 24:53.100
in handling a suspension case?

24:53.100 --> 24:55.600
Isn't there some way of speeding it up?

24:55.600 --> 24:57.600
We would like to speed it up as much as we can

24:57.600 --> 25:00.400
and confess them for showing justice to the individuals.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.400
Was there any order that...

25:02.400 --> 25:04.700
I'm sorry.

25:04.700 --> 25:11.400
I'm not sure that I get precisely what Senator has in mind,

25:11.400 --> 25:16.400
but if I do, it seems to me, may I see it?

25:18.900 --> 25:20.800
Am I correct, Jim?

25:20.800 --> 25:24.000
That my country's committee is taking credit

25:24.000 --> 25:28.500
for getting suspension to some 30 or 35 employees

25:28.500 --> 25:30.300
with Fort Monmouth.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.300
Is that correct, Senator?

25:32.300 --> 25:36.600
Mr.... Mr. Ascension, let me answer that in this way.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.100
I'm not taking credit for it.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.800
We know that they were all suspended

25:39.800 --> 25:41.300
after our investigation started.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.300
They were out.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.400
Some of them were suspended after they appeared

25:43.400 --> 25:45.000
before the committee, the day they appeared

25:45.000 --> 25:46.900
before the committee, some of the day after.

25:46.900 --> 25:49.500
Now, while they were in us,

25:49.500 --> 25:50.800
they would have been suspended otherwise.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.600
I don't know.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.200
There was no indication that they would be

25:53.200 --> 25:56.000
just one other thing, Mr. Zengen.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.900
The only testimony we will have on last will be Mr. Zewashm

25:58.900 --> 26:00.700
who is the commanding officer.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.800
He has testified, and I understand will testify

26:03.800 --> 26:06.900
that the suspension would not have been possible

26:06.900 --> 26:08.800
had our investigation not been conducted.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.200
So my part is this.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.600
Apparently, the McCarthy Investigating Committee

26:14.600 --> 26:18.500
is taking credit for either bringing about the suspension

26:18.500 --> 26:21.000
or for security risks.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.500
Yes, in 30 odds, criticizing Senator...

26:26.500 --> 26:28.500
...sexy statements.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.700
We're not reinstating those suspension.

26:30.700 --> 26:31.700
Now...

26:31.700 --> 26:33.700
That's just a matter of...

26:33.700 --> 26:36.700
I just want to know whether I'm right about that or not.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.700
Mr. Ascension, I point of order, Mr. Chairman.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.700
Point of order.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.800
Mr. Zengen, I want to suggest that you listen

26:43.800 --> 26:46.200
to the questions that will work closely.

26:46.200 --> 26:50.200
I pointed out that of the 35 suspension undoubtedly

26:50.200 --> 26:53.000
some of them might be able to prove

26:53.000 --> 26:55.700
that they were not bad security risks.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.600
And when that proof was entered, obviously they would be reinstated.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.900
And your statement, until I was taking credit for the suspension

27:01.900 --> 27:06.600
and criticizing for not reinstating them is ridiculous.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.900
It is not quite serimatory, Dr. Zengen.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.500
I pointed out also that some of these suspended individuals

27:13.500 --> 27:15.900
were called before the committee.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.700
The committee put them under oath.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.800
It did not take us nine months to find out

27:20.800 --> 27:24.000
that the charges against them would not stand out.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
As a result of our hearings, not only were individuals suspended,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
but some of those who were suspended

27:31.000 --> 27:33.100
had the opportunity to put under oath,

27:33.100 --> 27:35.500
be thoroughly cross-examined.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.000
They convinced the Secretary that they should go back to work.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
They're put back to work.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.900
I am criticizing if you can call it criticism.

27:42.900 --> 27:46.300
The Secretary for waiting nine months

27:46.300 --> 27:49.900
and doing nothing about getting a final adjudication

27:49.900 --> 27:51.400
in any of these cases.

27:51.400 --> 27:55.700
Either they are communists, communists sympathizers,

27:55.700 --> 28:00.400
dangerous in that work, or they can explain their background.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.400
There's no reason that it should be dragged on

28:02.400 --> 28:03.600
the last of the hearings over.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.400
I'd like to ask the Secretary,

28:05.400 --> 28:10.400
as you told the oil here at the screening board

28:10.400 --> 28:14.400
to expedite these cases,

28:14.400 --> 28:16.400
or has there been an order that there

28:16.400 --> 28:19.400
be no final adjudication to have these hearings runs?

28:19.400 --> 28:20.900
There's been no such order.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.900
There's been an order tonight.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.900
Mr. Chairman, before the Secretary of the Justice,

28:24.900 --> 28:28.900
I'd rather think I have a right thing than Democratic.

28:28.900 --> 28:29.900
You may and then may as well

28:29.900 --> 28:31.900
adjust the further interrogatories

28:31.900 --> 28:34.900
between the Council and Senator McCartney

28:34.900 --> 28:36.900
suspended after that until Senator McCartney

28:36.900 --> 28:39.900
is testifying as to which the Secretary of the House.

28:39.900 --> 28:42.400
I again ask the question.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.400
Is not Senator McCartney?

28:44.400 --> 28:48.400
Did he not in his charges criticize the Secretary?

28:48.400 --> 28:50.900
For being too slow and removing the birthdays

28:50.900 --> 28:53.900
or in suspending the birthdays?

28:53.900 --> 28:56.900
And is he not now criticizing the Secretary

28:56.900 --> 28:59.600
by his very line of cross-examination

28:59.600 --> 29:03.200
for not reinstating the alleged subversives

29:03.200 --> 29:07.400
that were suspended as a result of the McCartney investigation?

29:07.400 --> 29:09.400
I have to say that question and all the parties

29:09.400 --> 29:10.900
have to take it into the Army.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.400
Mr. Chairman,

29:13.400 --> 29:15.400
and I've got anybody say any questions?

29:15.400 --> 29:17.900
It's a thing that's very clear by now

29:17.900 --> 29:21.900
that we have point of the else that there were no suspensions

29:21.900 --> 29:24.400
until we started the investigation.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.400
But as of now, there's been no final adjudication

29:27.400 --> 29:30.400
even though the 9 have been reinstated.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.900
I would like to know why the 9 have been reinstated

29:33.900 --> 29:35.400
with no final adjudication.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.900
I would like to know why there has been no final adjudication

29:38.900 --> 29:40.400
on the others.

29:40.400 --> 29:44.400
And the credit doesn't count to listen to this carefully.

29:44.400 --> 29:49.400
It's two-fold number one, the failure to remove.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.400
Communists, security risks,

29:52.400 --> 29:55.400
from the top secret radar laboratory,

29:55.400 --> 29:58.400
and having removed them under pressure from the committee,

29:58.400 --> 30:03.400
the failure to take any action to finally arrive

30:03.400 --> 30:06.400
at an ultimate decision.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
The commanding officer of the radar laboratory

30:08.400 --> 30:12.400
is entitled to know what the final decision these cases are.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.400
The individuals are entitled to know.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.400
This committee is entitled to know.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.400
So the cynicism of a two-fold,

30:18.400 --> 30:23.400
a two-fold, complete lack of interest in the case.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.400
I have a question before the secretary.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.400
I'm just fine.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.400
I just suggest that the chief is concerned

30:31.400 --> 30:33.400
with the procedure whereby the defendant

30:33.400 --> 30:37.400
with constant on his time asks questions of the secretary.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.400
And especially to the councilman,

30:39.400 --> 30:41.400
he's referring his questions to the McCarthy

30:41.400 --> 30:44.400
and Joe Sendin McCarthy's under oath to sign his doing.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.400
I'm chairman.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.400
I'm trying to show all parties.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.400
I want to make this statement.

30:50.400 --> 30:54.400
If Senator McCarthy has questioned his ziz,

30:54.400 --> 30:57.400
whether or not the 9 of these suspended risks

30:57.400 --> 30:59.400
have been reinstated,

30:59.400 --> 31:02.400
and whether or not any final adjudication has been made

31:02.400 --> 31:04.400
with respect to the guilty or innocent,

31:04.400 --> 31:06.400
certainly he's got to write that question on.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
He said he was asking a question about whether or not

31:08.400 --> 31:10.400
a final adjudication has been made

31:10.400 --> 31:12.400
with respect to those who had not been reinstated.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.400
The question included all the questions.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
I'm going to continue with his questions of the secretary.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.400
I think the secretary is right.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.400
Can I go into the secretary's head?

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
He's fighting to understand.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.400
Thank you.
