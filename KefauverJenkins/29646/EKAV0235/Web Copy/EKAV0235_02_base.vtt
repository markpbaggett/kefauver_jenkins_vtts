00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I have brought two ideas in my head.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
One is this.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
The main thing I'm concerned about since nothing else can appear to be done.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
Since we are in the middle of this green gear, we would like him around for a while.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I was talking to Renfold.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
And he said he could be forward for a couple of weeks.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
And I'm thinking of this.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
He I hate playing a game.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I didn't give any of it to the thought.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
I didn't give one word to him, which changes the meaning of no sense.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
It's not right this year, but that's right sir.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Students.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
No, I haven't given any of the details of the cause of this.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
More or less, I'm not a student.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
You were a day, but it was a game.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Come on.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
For a while anyway, if my life is a game, I'll be back.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Because we're going into the shop over the air with such intensity.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Give night of autumn days and tomorrow now.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'll talk to Joan.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I'll talk to Renfold.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I'll be with the police.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
The police.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
The police.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
The police.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
The police.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
The police.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
The police.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
The police.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
The police.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
The police.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
You want me to talk to Gavin Gover?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I think I might do it.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Come on.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I would appreciate that.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
If the police just started on the screen, if you were talking to him in the summer,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
tell him who has been talking to you in the summer.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
And we have this summer's here and how there's this...

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
over in their place.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I would appreciate that.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
But no, I'm going.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Are you going to be in New York today?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Come on.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm going to be in New York today, and I'm on Thursday.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Come on.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
If anything develops to that, I haven't thought about how to call you.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Our main problem is the sly of the board.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
Joan is going to make a statement in Milwaukee on that using the use of a screen of an object to use.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
He has five things in which he has gotten the transcripts.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
In which they reverse the expressions of pretty bad people.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
He's just sitting up to the closing himself.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And this guy is in Milwaukee.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
He's in New York and we're here.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And he's going to make that enough.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
But that does not propose a shoe job.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
When you jump and talk and have some of me know of these two generals.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Mr. Lucas, have I not directly read the book,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
the monitors can't read it?

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
That's what I have had North Carolina on with the North Carolina in here.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
So, South Carolina.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Where is that Mr. Lucas in the eye?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
It's the second room to where it's at.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
You have North Carolina.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Yes, I'm so-to-Harmist Lucas.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And I'm the day he's being there North Carolina.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Who's that exception was he directly made into the record Mr. Lucas?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes sir.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
So, do they not be in the house?

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
They both have a big room.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I think the 15th floor is from North Carolina.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, there he is.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Now, Mr. Lucas, some Christians didn't raise about that.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I didn't harm them here.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
But there's used our construction show,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
being the North Carolina.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yes sir.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Both, nine days to the show.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
We've been going in a few weeks.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
The way they didn't raise the roofy house,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
bending the leading ring wheel.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
She's going in a few weeks.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Okay, okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We can reach the North Carolina.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Close.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Chair, right to the main council.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Let's do this.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
We'll do all the research.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Mr. Lucas,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
the state will be not to have a monitor telephone call,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
8020, October 1953.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes sir.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Is that the next learning succession, Mr. Internalogy,

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
ordered?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yes sir.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
And you have a monitor telephone call personally.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes sir.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
And you have a correct copy of the transcription

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
before you miss Lucas.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Yes sir.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Can you follow me as I read this piece?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes sir.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
28 October 1953.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yes sir.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
28 October 1956.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Can you please, Roy Combe,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
return secretary of students call.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Second Army.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Are you going to Louisville?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Roy Combe, no.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
The weather has...

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
So it's an APD.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I think it is.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm not sure it's not clear.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
That's good.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I've heard them speak about it.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Second Army, Roy, two things.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
First of all,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
the weather was all very close to first thing this morning.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Roy Combe was nice of you, secretary of the Army.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Only 30, 15 years I tried along with it.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Two trains they didn't think anybody that is eligible for the drive.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Only if it takes somebody.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
They try to get them to spend and expensive number of years in the business.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Because they don't seem they can train them and have them move there

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
to maybe a couple of years.

05:25.000 --> 05:33.000
So 30, 30, all not to go to him on this because of the policy of not taking people eligible for the drive.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
This seems to be worn out by a fellow that was working over there

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
and he doesn't seem the same with my daughter.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
He was a nice young girl and he was drafted not out of land.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
Roy Combe, how about this meal of sticking up somebody once in a museum?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Is there any question of not wanting to train him

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
if they are not going to pay you for the training, the army?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Now they just are not going to stay in there all as far as life.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So on the question of the figure,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
I can probably be a better job on rent than he could.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Now on the furlough business,

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
it is really difficult to give the time a question to trying to do they are new to things.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I think I got this and said,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
shape that if they were in the next week,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
I think I can put him on temporary duty as first-time.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I can explain my glory.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I've got to take a stone and say,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
what I am going to do in this series.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I've got to go.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I'm going to use you in order to go on the way.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
If you've slept with me for a change to carry on on this army thing for another two weeks,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I can do the removal of it. Roy Combe,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
there will be something in I appreciate that a lot.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
When will we have to decide on that security army?

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
That is up to you and it all depends on what the best part of it is.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Roy Combe,

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
I was able to bring the thing to you and then the only thing I have stayed almost with Albert,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
what he talked to you first,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
and I don't know when I can get to him.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Second-time.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
I wish you all the best whenever he was sworn in.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
We're not at the same duty for a tiny story,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
so he could continue with you from the next couple weeks.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
All I want you to do is let me know in time so I can get to him so he doesn't get starved up.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Roy Combe,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I can't tell you how much we appreciate the devil you've gone through on this thing.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
It will only make your head ache we have.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
We have more than one headache.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Second-time army said it in my situation that is true.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Roy Combe,

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
we talked to Joe and as a matter of fact, we are trying to boost and rearrange it

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
as far as his work is concerned anyway.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
And now we're going to a couple of days how tricky not only is.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Frank is sitting with me right here now to get the army.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I will see him South Carolina one day but I will be right.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I will be back here tiny Saturday and Sunday.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Roy Combe,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I will vote you over the meeting and I appreciate it very much.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
How is everything else?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Have you had a chance to talk to Brown?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Take a learning yes.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Roy Combe, how about the generals?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Take a learning.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I know you always need strong men to get right.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
If I had to make a good stone of opinion on it I would say and please don't hold me to it.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
I would say I was much right and not hard to spell it.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Right, I know who to call to the work he is now in.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
But,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
folks,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
only you question my princess stone.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I am trying to make available.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Roy Combe,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
you took your time and think about that.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
I noticed a couple of papers made something about the law and the boards and misses the situation.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I told you what Joe was going to say on this.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Just like all the pockets saying don't worry about it.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Just think about it.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
You know what you want to say to the Army right?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
The Suicide?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Was that they're not ready correctly for your service?

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
And do you have a final monitor telephone call?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
The permission is just to put it on the phone.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yes sir.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Between the school and the security army I think it is a stirrup.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Was that the same thing?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
What made history?

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Two November 1953.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
The board meeting is Mr. Patten.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Did you say two November to your service?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
The board meeting is Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Mr. Combe,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
as I have said,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
one sentence be...

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
The needy doubt leave is one sentence.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Being the sentence,

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
the hearing where I am indicating Roy Combe.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
One sentence to one of the other sentence.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
One sentence to one of the other sentence.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Come up.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Mr. beginnings.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
You see we can't identify it at this table.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
We haven't had any composure yet.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Mr. Chairman,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Come up.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Come up.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
The celle.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
Give us HKσει donkeys to see where he comes from.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.040
For里曼利き.

11:14.380 --> 11:17.540
Takes second rope and right south.

11:48.280 --> 11:53.160
He includes the sentence with tasty takeoff to one words

11:53.160 --> 11:56.340
of objection but will lead the person.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.340
I see you in a minute.

12:11.140 --> 12:16.240
The students are being used to these days when the last one in the state is November 2, 1950.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.240
Yes sir, I'm of your view.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.240
Yes sir, my view.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.240
And you have a correct copybook for you.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.240
Yes, correct.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.240
Yes sir.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.240
And I will read the sentence and that you will compare it to Mr. Lucas.

12:28.240 --> 12:36.240
Monday, June, November 19, 1953, 1146, say, in Roy Cone's phone, the second case, Steven.

12:36.240 --> 12:40.240
Roy Cone, how did all those stories come out?

12:40.240 --> 12:43.240
Secondary of the Army as well as the people's bar.

12:43.240 --> 12:48.240
Roy Cone, I raised him about it.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.240
But they say they would statement it out.

12:51.240 --> 12:59.240
But to make sure the thing goes with the people are going to write a military long

12:59.240 --> 13:00.240
a claim.

13:00.240 --> 13:07.240
Now I have ripped out one of the name of an aunt, your first, and the slightly changed

13:07.240 --> 13:09.240
the meaning of another word.

13:09.240 --> 13:14.240
Yes sir, which does not change the meaning of the context of this transcriptions.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.240
It's not right Mr. Lucas, that's right Mr. Lucas.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.240
I will send you an advanced copy.

13:20.240 --> 13:24.240
I've seen the photo of those statements from Outwears.

13:24.240 --> 13:28.240
I think that is in shape and he has got everything that I've provided.

13:28.240 --> 13:34.240
Nothing is going to have money everything until you have a chance to talk to Joe about that.

13:34.240 --> 13:38.240
I was wondering if there was anything we were supposed to do on base case.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.240
Like a day in the Army.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.240
Not a thing.

13:42.240 --> 13:47.240
I thought through these the other day I immediately got in touch with the office here.

13:47.240 --> 13:53.240
And had arrangements made so he would be detached from these with the first Army.

13:53.240 --> 13:56.240
I don't know of anything for the day to be done.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.240
Is it tomorrow?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.240
He goes in.

13:59.240 --> 14:03.240
If it looks as if the thing isn't working as it should.

14:03.240 --> 14:06.240
I should be notified at once.

14:06.240 --> 14:10.240
And here you should call the office here right away.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.240
The office will know how to get a hold of me.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.240
And there will no option.

14:15.240 --> 14:19.240
So if anything should go wrong, get in touch with me immediately.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.240
Raise the place of gold.

14:21.240 --> 14:26.240
The icon reports a 39 white hall at the induction station.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.240
I think it is a criminal Hamilton if the induction station there.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.240
So give the Army.

14:32.240 --> 14:36.240
It will be also a phrase just there.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.240
How to guarantee you that.

14:40.240 --> 14:44.240
It will be also the phrase he gets there.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.240
I'll guarantee you that.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.240
I'll start it tonight when I talk to you.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.240
And now we check on that right now.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.240
I come to the foot also in Friday morning.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.240
What time?

14:55.240 --> 14:56.240
Roy Cohn live in the clock.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.240
Sector of the Army.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.240
Boys have lunch with me again.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.240
Friday.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.240
We got ready for a chemistry.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.240
Yes sir.

15:02.240 --> 15:06.240
The Russians read all of the manager's telephone calls now.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.240
Writing between the Cohn and the Sector of the Army.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.240
Yes sir.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.240
I'll move to the Christians back.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.240
Let's change.

15:13.240 --> 15:22.240
This last call you had is dated November 2nd, 1953.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.240
And you may have no other calls.

15:25.240 --> 15:28.240
From then until the further date.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.240
That's correct.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.240
That's correct.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.240
But that's not what Mr. Cohn.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.240
I mean that Mr. Cohn.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.240
That's correct sir.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.240
I have a question from the missal.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.240
I'll send it back.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.240
Mr. Lucas.

15:43.240 --> 15:52.240
Are you sensitive to indelicate language that comes over the telephone?

15:52.240 --> 15:53.240
Yes sir.

15:53.240 --> 16:03.240
What do you do about language that is so explosive and is civiling it almost now to telephone one?

16:04.240 --> 16:07.240
When you've monitored calls.

16:07.240 --> 16:10.240
Well I don't think I've run into that gesture.

16:10.240 --> 16:16.240
But the Wagner every day for vanity I just write with it.

16:16.240 --> 16:24.240
Is there a ordinary kind of profanity and an extraordinary kind?

16:24.240 --> 16:29.240
Well, it's very explosive.

16:29.240 --> 16:33.240
I don't think that's the way it is.

16:33.240 --> 16:37.240
Well, somebody gets unduly explosive over the telephone.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.240
Do you think no to it?

16:39.240 --> 16:43.240
It's the say that you record it.

16:43.240 --> 16:47.240
Well, it's just working with a standard gesture.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.240
I don't plan on a student.

16:50.240 --> 16:55.240
I'm just wondering when somebody gets unduly and take over the telephone.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.240
The emphasis goes down to know what the word is after it's first.

16:59.240 --> 17:04.240
Well, the reason that you're asking is this.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.240
Oh, enough that you're responsible at all.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.240
But there's a lot of testimony in this investigation.

17:10.240 --> 17:17.240
To the effect of strong impact and bite to collective and profane language.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.240
Or huge indications.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.240
And so I've listened to the attempted range.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.240
So these telephone calls ready to record.

17:25.240 --> 17:30.240
And I expect as a matter of fact, on the basis of some allegations,

17:30.240 --> 17:35.240
that there would be some bite to collective and strong language I haven't discovered.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.240
So I wondered what you do with it, as they left it out.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.240
Well, sir, you said they had been uttered over the telephone.

17:42.240 --> 17:46.240
It would have been included in the transcription, is that so?

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
Yes, sir.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.240
There's a lot of evidence.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.240
There was a matter of emphasis on the subject matter.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.240
I would have looked it down.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
Very well.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.240
Turn around.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.240
Turn around.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.240
Turn around.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.240
Turn around.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.240
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Schumkart.

18:06.240 --> 18:11.240
Mr. Luka, I assure you what the force to be an officer, now my end of it,

18:11.240 --> 18:18.240
dated the 19th of October 1953 and asked you to identify it.

18:18.240 --> 18:23.240
This is an office member, and I'm too, the secretary from myself,

18:23.240 --> 18:26.240
dated 19 October 1953.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.240
And without lying into it further, at the moment,

18:29.240 --> 18:33.240
I say, Mr. Chairman, that there was not time as long as the next copy's up.

18:33.240 --> 18:38.240
But I do wish to offer denabitance and have the witness testify about it.

18:39.240 --> 18:44.240
It's very short, and I think we can deal with it without any discomfort on the part of the committee

18:44.240 --> 18:46.240
by not having copies before.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.240
This won't come.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.240
We have eight copies.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.240
Good.

18:58.240 --> 19:11.240
Mr. Luka, did you make out the office member and him that you have before you to which I have attracted your attention?

19:11.240 --> 19:13.240
Yes, sir.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.240
On what date on the 19th of October and what year?

19:17.240 --> 19:19.240
1953.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.240
To whom is the member and the director to the secretary?

19:22.240 --> 19:24.240
And from whom is it?

19:24.240 --> 19:25.240
Jack Luka.

19:25.240 --> 19:29.240
And there's the words to the secretary appear at the top of it.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.240
Opposite a date?

19:31.240 --> 19:32.240
Yes, sir.

19:32.240 --> 19:37.240
And from Jack Luka, the thumb being printed and the words Jack Luka's been in tight?

19:37.240 --> 19:38.240
Yes, sir.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.240
And then the end of that is the word subject with a colon.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.240
Is that right?

19:41.240 --> 19:42.240
Yes, sir.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.240
And then some typing.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.240
Did you type that?

19:44.240 --> 19:45.240
Yes, sir.

19:45.240 --> 19:48.240
Will you read to the committee what your type says?

19:48.240 --> 19:53.240
David Shahn, phoned from New York, and would like a return call.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.240
Is that the completion of random?

19:56.240 --> 19:59.240
Well, sir, there's some more.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.240
There's some typing down the lower left hand corner.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.240
Would you be good enough to read that?

20:04.240 --> 20:10.240
This says OPER for operator 398, NYC.

20:10.240 --> 20:15.240
Murray Hill, and then I type 8-0110.

20:15.240 --> 20:20.240
And I cross that out and pencil underneath I wrote in pencil 8-0115.

20:20.240 --> 20:24.240
Do you know when you wrote in pencil 8-0115?

20:24.240 --> 20:31.240
It would have been shortly after typing up the note.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.240
I don't know whether it would have been on the 19th, 20th, or 21st.

20:35.240 --> 20:40.240
Now, secretary Stevens actually in Washington on the 19th of October?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.240
Yes, sir.

20:41.240 --> 20:49.240
Did you call his attention to the fact that he had had a telephone call from Dave Shahn on that day?

20:49.240 --> 20:55.240
Well, sir, by the means of this note, did he take the call on the 19th of October?

20:55.240 --> 20:56.240
Yes, sir.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.240
And there's a consequence of that.

20:58.240 --> 21:03.240
Did you call this number on him until he's attention to the second time?

21:03.240 --> 21:09.240
I don't remember whether I did better or not, so probably we simply have left it on his desk

21:09.240 --> 21:15.240
where he keeps such notes, and I may or may not have called it to his attention personally.

21:15.240 --> 21:19.240
In any event, there's a telephone call dealt with a second time.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.240
There's a telephone call from Dave Shahn.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.240
Yes, sir.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.240
And on what date was that?

21:24.240 --> 21:27.240
On 21 October, 1953.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.240
Now, that was fought two days later.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.240
Yes, sir.

21:30.240 --> 21:37.240
Would the call operate a three, nine, eight, ordinarily hold the board over a two-day period?

21:37.240 --> 21:38.240
No, sir.

21:38.240 --> 21:43.240
As a consequence, on the 20th, did Mr. Stevens actually take the call?

21:44.240 --> 21:46.240
Physically, they took the call to Shahn.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.240
Yes, sir.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.240
And talked to him.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.240
What, sir?

21:49.240 --> 21:55.240
And that call is the one where your notes are now being photographed to be censored here in the room.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.240
Is that right?

21:56.240 --> 21:57.240
Yes, sir.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.240
That's all, Mr. Stevens.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.240
Madam, the car is going to be caught.

22:01.240 --> 22:10.240
Mr. Chairman, I don't have what you'd call a person to witness when I'm referring to the permits of ideas by ten minutes.

22:11.240 --> 22:17.240
To grant a point that's left before the bill of the time, one of the circumstances.

22:17.240 --> 22:21.240
Chair, I'd like to suggest that since we have one more set of monitoring calls,

22:21.240 --> 22:25.240
we'd like to have them all and the wrecking is close together as possible.

22:25.240 --> 22:28.240
And I appreciate if you would defer to the next ten minutes,

22:28.240 --> 22:31.240
that to be up to the meeting with Mr. Carls calls.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.240
I...

22:33.240 --> 22:37.240
The one very much, I'd be very early in over ten minutes.

22:40.240 --> 22:44.240
I'm going to go to the chair, you can get the head, you can try and you can get the conor of the age.

22:44.240 --> 22:50.240
And talk to him over the day, and waiting on morning to get the thin nothing's claimed to be up to.

22:50.240 --> 22:54.240
Once the chair feels, or another ten to fifteen minutes, I'm not going to make way of this,

22:54.240 --> 22:58.240
but once the chair feels very strongly about this, I will do this.

22:58.240 --> 23:02.240
Once the chair does, I would like to go ahead and be picking about five minutes.

23:02.240 --> 23:07.240
Maybe a little more impermanent for the chair, this way for folks to be able to take more than five minutes.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.240
That's what the chair is worried about.

23:10.240 --> 23:14.240
I've been invited to hear how long will it take for the car to go?

23:14.240 --> 23:17.240
30 minutes.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.240
How long will the car call think about it?

23:20.240 --> 23:24.240
About thirty minutes, he thinks.

23:24.240 --> 23:28.240
He's afraid the car will take longer than that, he'll precipitate one now.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.240
Mr. Chair, against going a better judgment, I feel climate is very important,

23:32.240 --> 23:35.240
I want one of these weapons that's subpoenaed as an afternoon,

23:35.240 --> 23:38.240
I want things to be the start of them immediately.

23:38.240 --> 23:45.240
However, I'm going to overrule my own better, my own judgment,

23:45.240 --> 23:49.240
and the visits to the chair, and I perhaps will remind the chair of it sometime,

23:49.240 --> 23:52.240
and I'm sure I'm going to make plenty of my asses him to.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.240
Thank you very much, Mr. Cruz, to make a decision.

23:55.240 --> 23:59.240
Yeah, but may I hand you the ability to open my eyes a little bit?

24:00.240 --> 24:06.240
And Mr. Prowett will lead into the record of the car call.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.240
Mr. Prowett, a moment with Kennedy.

24:14.240 --> 24:17.240
Mr. Wilson, listen to me, please, ask one question.

24:17.240 --> 24:23.240
Could I have understood that, if there's any attempt to run the great deal of time

24:23.240 --> 24:28.240
and cost examining on the car call that, before we end tonight,

24:28.240 --> 24:31.240
that I will have the opportunity to do hand-button you now?

24:31.240 --> 24:35.240
I'm probably too sure to get around to the 10 minute rules before the end of the day.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.240
Thanks, thank you.

24:36.240 --> 24:40.240
Mr. Lucas, the Chief Monitor, to the call.

24:40.240 --> 24:46.240
February 25, 1954, between Mr. Adams and Mr. Carr.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.240
Yes, sir.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.240
Do you have a prescription of the monitoring before you?

24:52.240 --> 24:53.240
Yes, sir.

24:53.240 --> 24:56.240
When you follow me as I read it, Gaser.

24:56.240 --> 25:04.240
That call is dated February 25, 1954, and the time is what?

25:04.240 --> 25:08.240
538, that's what they say, Mr. President, right, sir.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.240
I'm sorry, but one second.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.240
One second.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.240
One second.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.240
The Lucas monitor is small.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.240
He's so fast, sir.

25:17.240 --> 25:22.240
I thought we would solve, I don't know how much importance it will or not have.

25:22.240 --> 25:27.240
But I thought that we would solve up and Mr. Howard's office when this came in that I missed the land.

25:27.240 --> 25:34.240
Mr. Adams office spent the monitoring and not Mr. Lucas, but Mr. Adams was down on another floor.

25:34.240 --> 25:38.240
And Mr. Lucas did not monitor Mr. Adams call.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.240
Thank you, sir.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.240
I don't trust your information.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.240
Can we also look for a make-the-twenty-one?

25:45.240 --> 25:50.240
Mr. Charles, Mr. Lucas just testified under oath that he might have a call.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.240
Now, right, Mr. Lucas?

25:51.240 --> 25:52.240
That is correct, sir.

25:52.240 --> 25:57.240
So if you have any doubt about that in cross-examination, the example, can you get me that?

25:57.240 --> 26:00.240
Mr. Chairman, just so the record will be straight.

26:00.240 --> 26:09.240
Well, I might have a children that may be very no-�-o between Mr. Carl and Adam's monitors.

26:09.240 --> 26:15.240
Until the day after Mr. Adams came to my apartment, that's all.

26:15.240 --> 26:24.240
I think what it is after the last day luncheon, after which the American officer, Stephen's blew up the best.

26:25.240 --> 26:34.240
The rest is a late time that the calls in Mr. Carl and Adam's were first monitored.

26:34.240 --> 26:39.240
Many calls were having Mr. Carl and Adam's before that.

26:39.240 --> 26:44.240
I thank the children for this, the single calls.

26:44.240 --> 26:48.240
It would appear that you may find the great deal of self-serving materials.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.240
And I think the record should be very clear in that.

26:51.240 --> 26:56.240
The American officer, Mr. Chairman, share the words to you as the reality of something that you can tell us.

26:56.240 --> 27:02.240
It's about a bring-out by cross-examination with Mr. Lucas, because that last time he can ask Mr. Lucas specifically

27:02.240 --> 27:05.240
to the authenticity of their convictions along their lines.

27:05.240 --> 27:09.240
Well, Mr. Chairman, printed it in Microsoft Clear just 10 seconds.

27:09.240 --> 27:14.240
I am not trusting you to look at the authenticity of the calls.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.240
I am merely want to make this point to go to the attorney.

27:17.240 --> 27:25.240
The file Mr. Carl and Mr. Adam were dealing over the telephone day after day after day during the experience.

27:25.240 --> 27:38.240
There was no eavesdropping order until the day after Mr. Stephen's met with some jurisdictions, some to father, and some to McCartor.

27:38.240 --> 27:43.240
And it was after that when the whole matter blew up.

27:43.240 --> 27:56.240
It appears that the witnesses would not appear that then for some reason we thought the phone calls would be Mr. Adam and Mr. Carl were ordered to be dropped out.

27:56.240 --> 28:03.240
I mention that to show that under the ordinary legal rules we would not be admissible.

28:03.240 --> 28:09.240
I am gone to self-serving phone calls which are carded in order of any job.

28:09.240 --> 28:21.240
However, I talk to this over with Mr. Carl and he and I agreed that regardless of how unfair this proposition might be, regardless of the purpose of it,

28:21.240 --> 28:33.240
regardless of the fact that the eavesdropping started the day after the conference with Mr. Stephen's that nevertheless Mr. Carl should agree to have them put in.

28:33.240 --> 28:41.240
So at this time there is no objection there being put in. I merely want to make that clear for the benefit of all of the sound here's called.

28:41.240 --> 28:44.240
Hello Mr. Carl and I continue to have the day.

28:44.240 --> 28:48.240
Yes, we give Mr. Dave the first call. Mr. Lucas correct me if I'm wrong.

28:48.240 --> 28:57.240
This call is dated February 25, 1954. Time flies 38 p.m.

28:57.240 --> 29:01.240
John Adams returned call of flight call.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.240
Yes sir, it's correct.

29:04.240 --> 29:10.240
Carl, what a ruthless call. Adams yes, what is cooking.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.240
Carl nothing.

29:12.240 --> 29:19.240
There has been a rumor floating around that any more says Mr. Stephen is that right John?

29:19.240 --> 29:21.240
Is there anything to that?

29:22.240 --> 29:37.240
Because of this moment I can't say I don't know it is a little out of my ordinary thing with two patients only because of the fact that I have been absorbed today on other matters.

29:37.240 --> 29:42.240
As I am sure you would understand Carl I sure can.

29:42.240 --> 29:50.240
Would anybody know that through it being a position to say yes or no or say to that?

29:50.240 --> 29:59.240
Adams let me thank for a minute. The school is right back to the trouble we had in New York when I got rejected from the year.

29:59.240 --> 30:09.240
What are you able to tell about a security case from the current regulations? Carl of course. Adams could we change you back then?

30:09.240 --> 30:21.240
When we did it at Monday I guess we couldn't. Carl, at Monday you were very careful not to give any numbers or names. However the numbers came out.

30:21.240 --> 30:35.240
Adams the situation is deteriorated since those friend days. Carl I wouldn't say deteriorated. Adams it is an understatement. Carl it is a little bit out of the end.

30:35.240 --> 30:46.240
Adams I have reason to believe that not to worry is mean directing with me. Carl I choose first of list. Adams yes. Carl I don't know John.

30:46.240 --> 30:51.240
I know one thing to do is can I wish to help him?

30:51.240 --> 31:02.240
Yes. I wish you you have taken my advice that Friday night when I talk to you about telling students about two days.

31:02.240 --> 31:12.240
Let's call him on that circuit and call him in a spirit of compromise like I suggest you know Adams yes.
