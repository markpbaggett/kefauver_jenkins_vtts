00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
I know you're a human.

00:05.240 --> 00:06.240
Question marks.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.240
Good name.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.240
This is a report.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.340
So what is for the start out there?

00:11.340 --> 00:12.800
And I have a lot of witnesses.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.240
And then that's how the fellow we have been talking about

00:15.240 --> 00:16.500
with the question marks.

00:16.500 --> 00:17.480
Three minutes.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.800
I think that is all to come up there.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.880
I may as your permission, that one or two people

00:22.880 --> 00:25.280
come along with you, and I just think

00:25.280 --> 00:27.320
they'll better come up there and sit there.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.600
And if you wish it, you wish them

00:29.600 --> 00:31.360
and go ahead with him and of not,

00:31.360 --> 00:33.880
I will say with it any way you want.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.280
Go.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.200
What do you think on this thing?

00:37.200 --> 00:39.060
On the question of reaching him or not,

00:39.060 --> 00:39.560
see them?

00:39.560 --> 00:41.760
Because I told you I just don't know.

00:41.760 --> 00:44.220
I think probably you are a bit of a good tonight,

00:44.220 --> 00:45.480
to just go.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.120
The only things that worry me are two things.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.160
I don't know whether you're going to make a book to bear

00:51.160 --> 00:52.320
look to this.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.280
You expect to see a great thing to hear something like that?

00:56.280 --> 00:59.640
And two, I don't know if there is something there.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.760
If there is going, if that is going in any way

01:03.760 --> 01:06.440
to interfere with any of your plans,

01:06.440 --> 01:09.160
it could run, but I don't want to.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.120
Today's your.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.080
Oh, look, the point is this, if we don't call him

01:15.080 --> 01:18.360
that he's just a little something in the common good,

01:18.360 --> 01:20.200
it is not a matter of life and death to us.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
See them?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.680
I think that might be the best.

01:22.680 --> 01:26.000
And of course, until there is a change made,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.800
which I am looking for the opportunity to make,

01:28.800 --> 01:31.560
I can tell you about the record.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.920
Congratulations to the desire.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.600
And you can have it anytime you want him.

01:36.600 --> 01:40.520
And maybe on that basis, it is just as well not to come.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.520
Let's think about that.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.720
See this.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.040
You think about it and decide what to want to do.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.440
And he will be here and ready to come.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.440
Come on.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.360
Let him stay over there.

01:48.360 --> 01:48.880
We want him.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.040
We will call him to come over.

01:50.040 --> 01:50.960
Come on.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.840
And he will come in on five minutes notice anytime

01:53.840 --> 01:55.480
you want him in the morning or any other day.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
Come on.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.480
Let's see if that way.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.480
I'm going to say the thing.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.160
If you think I've seen him in, I'll say him ending.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.160
Get in that eye.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.080
We'll be there correct, if it's your,

02:03.080 --> 02:04.720
move this, yes sir.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.240
When, what is the date of the next manager's call

02:08.240 --> 02:09.720
between this corner, Mr. Feet?

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
Yes.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
No.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
No.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.720
No.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.720
No.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.720
No.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.720
Mr. Feet.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.720
Sir.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.440
Do you have a call from Mr. Coons?

02:29.440 --> 02:32.120
The motion of our concurring beliefs.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.120
Yes, sir.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.600
I have a meeting with Mr. Coon, my class president.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.600
Mr. Feet.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.600
Yes, sir.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.600
Very good.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.600
It's late.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.600
48th September, 1953.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.600
And did you monitor that?

02:40.600 --> 02:41.600
Yes, sir.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.600
And he's trying to strand it.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.600
Yes, sir.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.600
Correctly?

02:44.600 --> 02:45.600
Yes, sir.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.600
You have a copy of his approval?

02:46.600 --> 02:47.600
Yes, sir.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.600
Will you follow him, Mr. Lucas Feet?

02:48.600 --> 02:49.600
Yes, sir.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.600
May I accept him in 1953?

02:50.600 --> 02:51.600
You are calling for him, Curumon and Post-Ec�C.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.600
Post-Ec�C, Mr. Coons.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.480
Mr. Feet, Mr. Coon, I don't know who anybody actually

02:57.480 --> 02:59.480
has sent over words for him, the Curumon.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.480
Coons.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.080
If his iron is sending me to the nutcombs,

03:02.080 --> 03:03.080
he will send me to the room.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.080
But when you made that speech, two days in,

03:06.080 --> 03:08.080
I made that speech, Coons.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.920
When we had an arrangement, I was picked by it

03:09.920 --> 03:12.480
no matter what Joe says or anybody said.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.040
And I understand he knows that he was not the cause.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.760
Now the guy walked right in.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.280
In the front, the front is slow.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.040
So I'm going to buy a parenthesis.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.120
Me, Mr. Coons, question mark, I can use.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.200
Me, Mr. Feet.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.600
Some questions about the being used with a finger.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.320
I remember the impression of Mr. Feet

03:32.320 --> 03:33.720
and the Babies and his brothers in the morning

03:33.720 --> 03:34.920
who know that.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.760
This has not been able to run down as the women

03:36.760 --> 03:39.560
you see the size of the family on the staff of Curumon.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.520
I'd like to know about it.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.360
See this.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.960
I'm in the post office of running out now.

03:42.960 --> 03:43.960
Coons.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.560
I was waiting for him here, not to call him.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.320
I think it was me who took the bait to call this guy.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.320
Feet him.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.200
Shall I get him out of there?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.280
Coons, no.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.480
Me, you work out something.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.440
I have to pull all the sunscreens away.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.880
And all of these things does not call him.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.520
And then the guy marches in and sits in the front row.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.960
He will have a quick adjournment to have

04:02.960 --> 04:07.000
a little effort to be waiting here, something.

04:07.000 --> 04:07.680
Feet him.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.760
I'm hoping to tell you about this because the way you

04:09.760 --> 04:12.720
have played with me has been 100% the night system

04:12.720 --> 04:14.360
of working you for the same as yours.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.920
Coons.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.040
If my day will be the part of someone over here,

04:18.040 --> 04:19.200
we won't call him.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.200
He won't see me.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.120
I can't change.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.200
I can't change and have much I appreciate that, Coons.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.440
And when you see him, say nothing

04:25.440 --> 04:27.160
gets such a scare from the line line.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.160
See this.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.160
Everything?

04:29.160 --> 04:30.600
Do I leave that correct?

04:30.600 --> 04:33.280
Yes, sir.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.480
What Mr. Lucas is the date of the next monitor's call

04:36.480 --> 04:40.280
fighting between Mr. Coons and the second Army?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.240
28th of September, 1954.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.840
Is that the same date?

04:43.840 --> 04:44.840
Yes, sir.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.640
Is it the one I just said?

04:45.640 --> 04:46.640
Yes, sir.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.040
I mean, this is the second call, because I understand

04:50.040 --> 04:52.920
it's September 28th, which is monitored by you.

04:52.920 --> 04:53.920
Yes, sir.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.720
And is it monitored correctly?

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
Yes, sir.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
And hands-piled correctly?

04:57.720 --> 04:58.720
Yes, sir.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.720
I mean, have you noticed before you?

04:59.720 --> 05:00.720
The copy.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.720
I didn't hear it.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.720
We were following your transcriptions.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.720
What, sir?

05:03.720 --> 05:04.720
28th of September, 1950.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.720
It's been 37th phone for Roy Coons.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.880
Two for the five Roy Coons, and it turns out they're

05:08.880 --> 05:09.880
even called.

05:09.880 --> 05:15.120
And we have first before any conversations, by Doc.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.120
Is that correct?

05:16.120 --> 05:17.920
Yes, sir.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.440
See, when you were completely correct and I must

05:20.440 --> 05:24.200
to mall, Coons, don't forget we can get any witnesses

05:24.200 --> 05:25.760
for Senator Potter.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.920
Before he leaves for Honolulu, figure as soon

05:27.920 --> 05:30.400
he can call him, raise recognition and marching

05:30.400 --> 05:33.240
distance on the across of his situation in Korea.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.760
See this.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.280
I want to say here to his home.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.880
I say the letter of introduction to my friend

05:37.880 --> 05:41.320
and Honolulu, he has an inked favorite, as a great guy.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.960
I tell him when he got the pistol to call

05:42.960 --> 05:44.520
General Sween and General Sween,

05:44.520 --> 05:47.920
that I have a complete list for him, both on Phileum,

05:47.920 --> 05:52.040
and Hawaiian, five Docs.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.200
Right?

05:53.200 --> 05:55.280
Yes, sir.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.080
Take a while, I'll go.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.800
That's up perhaps it was a must-convining telephone number.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.320
Coons.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.920
No, I have to go.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.600
Is there anyone in your shop who there's an idea of the overall

06:06.600 --> 06:08.840
situation if we can get somebody to come in to explain

06:08.840 --> 06:10.720
any second?

06:10.720 --> 06:11.520
I didn't really expect that.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.040
I'm sorry.

06:12.040 --> 06:12.880
Coons.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.440
Is there anyone in your shop who there's an idea of the overall

06:15.440 --> 06:16.960
situation?

06:16.960 --> 06:17.960
All situations.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.800
Two vacations, right?

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
Yes, sir.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.160
If we can get somebody to come in to explain any second

06:23.160 --> 06:23.960
of the situation that Martin didn't

06:23.960 --> 06:26.280
was part of presiding on the account of the business,

06:26.280 --> 06:28.560
get an information and get him to the background soon.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.840
The drive, they took me a minute to get on the ride.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.520
I came in the back room, and this is our house

06:34.520 --> 06:36.000
meeting in Malve.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
Mr. Chairman, at that point, a name is given.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.440
And...

06:44.440 --> 06:46.960
I would ask you to do so with the concrete request

06:46.960 --> 06:48.800
that the main not be made.

06:48.800 --> 06:53.080
Frankly, I've seen over this to be fair by making the name.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.080
So...

07:02.720 --> 07:04.800
The manager says the last thing is okay with you the name

07:04.800 --> 07:06.400
of the restaurant.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.920
The name of it is nothing much to worry about.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.920
It's not a good question, right?

07:13.920 --> 07:14.920
No.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.920
We got it.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.920
We are all meeting that name, Mr. Lucas.

07:19.920 --> 07:24.920
We just started with him and we are having a very interesting conversation.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.920
Cole, you're coming to the wedding tomorrow?

07:27.920 --> 07:29.920
See, I am probably.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.920
Cole, what time are you going to arrive?

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
It seems about 10.45.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
Cole, what time are you going to arrive?

07:33.920 --> 07:35.920
We will have somebody look out for you.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.920
Was that red correctly, Mr. Lucas?

07:37.920 --> 07:38.920
Yes, sir.

07:38.920 --> 07:44.920
The name is the next conversation between Mr. Cole and the secretary,

07:44.920 --> 07:46.920
monitored by you.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.920
30 September 1953.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.920
Do you have any transcripts in the four years?

07:50.920 --> 07:51.920
Yes, sir.

07:51.920 --> 07:52.920
Is it correct?

07:52.920 --> 07:53.920
Yes, sir.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.920
Will you follow me as I think it's just over?

07:55.920 --> 07:57.920
30 September 1950, 11 a.m.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.920
Roy Cohn's home secretary, she and him from New York.

08:00.920 --> 08:01.920
Right?

08:01.920 --> 08:03.920
The initials are C,

08:03.920 --> 08:05.920
including Roy Cohn,

08:05.920 --> 08:08.920
and they say they need to be secretary of the army.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.920
Roy Cohn, two things.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.920
Number one, the thing that I told you about.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.920
I will cover everything that is to tell you about it in a day or so.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.920
It is a pretty good situation.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.920
I will check the final word on it tonight, secretary of the army.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.920
Are you going to be in New York when you speak back there?

08:24.920 --> 08:27.920
Roy Cohn, I will talk to you about it and a couple of other things I will do.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.920
And we talk back and forth, and I wanted to talk to you about it again.

08:30.920 --> 08:31.920
What are your plans?

08:31.920 --> 08:32.920
New to New York.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.920
I think there are no other friends.

08:34.920 --> 08:35.920
I will be pretty close.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.920
Get you right here.

08:36.920 --> 08:37.920
Roy Cohn.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.920
The next couple of weeks you will probably do down there.

08:40.920 --> 08:41.920
Secretary of the army.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.920
I expect to be possibly a day out of town

08:44.920 --> 08:46.920
and a quick trip to some installation.

08:46.920 --> 08:47.920
Are you going to be down?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.920
Roy Cohn, I will let you come down anyway.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.920
Secretary of the army.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.920
I will be here until Saturday,

08:52.920 --> 08:53.920
and then Roy Cohn.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.920
It's Friday, I give day.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
I don't want to call you tomorrow and make an appointment for Friday.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
You sit tonight and say the thing.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.920
It should crystallize.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.920
And that possibility of getting an inclinational thing to talk to you about.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.920
I'm Friday, I'm going to be a chamber.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.920
And I have all of Friday afternoon.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.920
And there are...

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
In the...

09:14.920 --> 09:16.920
In the...

09:16.920 --> 09:17.920
Secretary.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.920
Yes, first.

09:18.920 --> 09:19.920
First, I'll do that.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.920
Did I understand you to say five about us?

09:23.920 --> 09:26.920
Uh, uh, then we'll sit in.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.920
The main department from 6.85 to 8.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.920
You can check them up over here.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.920
Will the exception of our differences?

09:32.920 --> 09:34.920
Will the exception of the number of dots of our correctly ready?

09:34.920 --> 09:35.920
Yes, sir.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.920
I'm going to face it.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.920
So the members of this stuff committee are going to find out

09:38.920 --> 09:40.920
who we have the better eye type.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.920
We can move this here or eye.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.920
I think they're 8.5.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.920
When it's time for somebody to go out and see the thing.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.920
I want to send a text.

09:49.920 --> 09:50.920
Is that important?

09:50.920 --> 09:51.920
Hello, Richard.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.920
You're here and maybe taking the drive out there.

09:54.920 --> 09:55.920
Mr....

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
Mr....

09:56.920 --> 09:58.920
Who's the exception?

09:58.920 --> 09:59.920
I've never asked you.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.920
I'm not sure if we're going to get it technically correct in the record.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.920
Did I correct you, Richard?

10:04.920 --> 10:05.920
Yes, sir.

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
Yes, sir.

10:06.920 --> 10:07.920
How do...

10:07.920 --> 10:08.920
I'm in.

10:08.920 --> 10:09.920
I can permit.

10:09.920 --> 10:10.920
Hey.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.920
Look, this is on the younger lady you are, sir.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.920
As far as the eyesight is concerned.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.920
What about it, sir?

10:15.920 --> 10:17.920
Why don't you talk to one of the fifths with an apple?

10:17.920 --> 10:18.920
I'm in there, sir.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.920
I think they have times in one way.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.920
Wow, there's not the 50 given in the apple.

10:24.920 --> 10:30.920
Mr. Luthor, did you enough monetary telephone and call facing between Mr. Cohn and the sectarian army?

10:30.920 --> 10:32.920
Tated off for the first 19.53?

10:32.920 --> 10:33.920
Yes, sir.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.920
Did you correct the monetary and tensed by it?

10:36.920 --> 10:37.920
Yes, sir.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.920
And do you have your transcription before you?

10:38.920 --> 10:39.920
Yes, sir.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.920
You follow me as I meet with my copy, Mr. Luthor, please.

10:42.920 --> 10:43.920
Yes, sir.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.920
One after the 19.53, five or two p.m., right?

10:46.920 --> 10:49.920
Cohn, phone, sectarian, and some new rock.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.920
Cohn.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.920
On tomorrow, we have in the pocket at two p.m.,

10:53.920 --> 10:55.920
would you be free any earlier in the night?

10:55.920 --> 10:56.920
How about Luthor?

10:56.920 --> 10:57.920
Stuthor, luncheon.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.920
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

10:59.920 --> 11:06.920
I've got Harold, a palace, and a chief of engineers, and it is pretty hard to get.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.920
This is not clear.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.920
Some are we, fellow, together.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.920
I can leave in the morning.

11:12.920 --> 11:13.920
Cohn, what time in the morning?

11:13.920 --> 11:14.920
Three of them.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
Six out.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.920
I would like to take care of the first two days.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.920
Mr. Luthor, Mr. T, me and found two days.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.920
I'm sure I would be back in the office by 11 minutes.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.920
Cohn, what's Luthor's two 30s?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.920
Luthor, luncheon will be over the two 30s.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
Cohn.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
One more thing.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.920
Cohn.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.920
And there is a name, Mr. Cohn, who resides next to the Luthor.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.920
Has no name, whatever, upon the meeting of this.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.920
And I'm not placed to remember the subject of the legislation.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.920
Right.

11:48.920 --> 11:49.920
Hmm.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.920
I am.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.920
I'm just a glass of love, just for me and not the name.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.920
Name a brief on that is your name.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.920
A million-one more things.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.920
I see them as good, banging along, and Cohn, I'm a ten-year-old, a two-study.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.920
We've got the exception of the admission of that name.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.920
Was that the right thing to do?

12:17.920 --> 12:18.920
Yes, sir.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.920
I have a twenty-eighth year old man.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.920
I was told that he had an arrived in the Virginia Beach.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.920
He came into the two-parts of that meeting.

12:27.920 --> 12:28.920
Did he have time?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.920
No, I didn't do it.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.920
The industrial German mud-and-ounce of the next session of the hearing will be at 2 p.m.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.920
As he comes to order to resume committee activities, it's afternoon.

12:38.920 --> 12:43.920
It's your would like to continue his customer routine of welcoming the guests who have come to the office.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.920
The guests who have come to the committee,

12:46.920 --> 12:52.920
you seem to be hearing unusually large numbers as afternoon and will bid you welcome

12:52.920 --> 12:56.920
and take this opportunity of following to your attention,

12:56.920 --> 13:01.920
the standing committee rule, which I'm sure is already familiar to many of you,

13:01.920 --> 13:04.920
which prohibits any manifestile.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.920
Now 39.75.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.920
Avapruvo or disapprovo.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.920
And anytime or anytime.

13:11.920 --> 13:18.920
The committee has instructed the uniformed officers that you see before you

13:18.920 --> 13:23.920
and the plain clothes people scattered throughout the audience.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.920
To act without any further word from the chair.

13:27.920 --> 13:34.920
To politely but immediately and firmly removed from the room,

13:34.920 --> 13:40.920
anyone who elects to violate the conditions under which you under the committee room,

13:40.920 --> 13:45.920
manly to remain completely for manifestations of an automobile nature,

13:45.920 --> 13:49.920
indicating your approval or disapprovo of what is taking place at the position.

13:49.920 --> 13:55.920
I'm sure that we can continue to count depending on 100% cooperation of the audience.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.920
Mr. Lucas, do I say you somewhere?

13:58.920 --> 14:01.920
Well, you assume the chair fades.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.920
I say you.

14:05.920 --> 14:10.920
And this is Ike and Mr. Loh.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.920
Listen.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.920
Do you hear me, Mr. Loh?

14:15.920 --> 14:17.920
No, no, no.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.920
No, no, I don't.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.920
Mr. Lucas?

14:21.920 --> 14:23.920
I don't see Mr. Loh and Mr. Paique.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.920
That means that the most of the managers and cows are all covered by you,

14:26.920 --> 14:29.920
so that you...

14:29.920 --> 14:31.920
I understand that they don't have any more customers.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.920
Mr. Loh, if they're less than 30, no, Mr. Cal, I'll tell you something.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.920
Well, that is only part of the process.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.920
And the others are here.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.920
Very well.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.920
Mr. Jenkins, just here reading him to the deputy,

14:45.920 --> 14:47.920
as a manager of the Cohn Cohn,

14:47.920 --> 14:49.920
between Mr. Loh and the Cohn and the Cefi-Cody Army,

14:49.920 --> 14:51.920
that's good.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.920
Mr. Cal, look at the deputy.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.920
One very short mark from the...

14:55.920 --> 14:57.920
Senator, Mr. Loh, I'm not here.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.920
I see him and I'll take you to the room.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.920
No, Mr. Loh.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.920
Mr. Loh, speak in.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.920
Well, Mr. McCullough, I'm actually addressing a remark to you.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.920
During the lunch and period, Mr. Loh,

15:14.920 --> 15:17.920
that the family will know about your conversation.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.920
And one or two questions from you,

15:19.920 --> 15:22.920
will I take a list of the responses that you expect.

15:22.920 --> 15:23.920
That's one item.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.920
The second item is that the blue sweat

15:26.920 --> 15:28.920
that an incline with a sign called,

15:28.920 --> 15:30.920
as under discussion is in the courtroom,

15:30.920 --> 15:34.920
and the notes, the actual photographic notes of the...

15:34.920 --> 15:37.920
The conversation with Mr. Shine, I've been photographed,

15:37.920 --> 15:40.920
as far as the record is being brought in here.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.920
As Mr. Cohn knows, Mr. Loh,

15:42.920 --> 15:43.920
this is no book.

15:43.920 --> 15:44.920
I have top secret matter in them,

15:44.920 --> 15:46.920
and we prefer the photographic pages,

15:46.920 --> 15:48.920
dealing with the Shine conversation alone.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.920
And I think that, again, sorry that he understands that.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.920
He will be up here.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.920
I don't know if this might be for every photograph now.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.920
It could be that the photographic note is not at all.

15:57.920 --> 15:58.920
A question to Charles,

15:58.920 --> 16:00.920
he's determined to present on the call

16:00.920 --> 16:02.920
and ask the one of two brief questions you want to ask

16:02.920 --> 16:03.920
to confirm with us.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.920
The question about his individual line of the call.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.920
Turn him the call.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.920
First, the look is...

16:10.920 --> 16:12.920
I don't get to add the call

16:12.920 --> 16:14.920
for the record of the two relevant.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
I mean, that part of the two relevant,

16:16.920 --> 16:20.920
but he was hearing that my recollection was on that day at call.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.920
Second, the receipts regarding an ROTC,

16:22.920 --> 16:25.920
and one of the callables in ROTC's ROTVHL,

16:25.920 --> 16:27.920
and the notes were respected up.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
What's the other half?

16:29.920 --> 16:31.920
Is that correct or some other subject matter?

16:31.920 --> 16:32.920
That is correct.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.920
It was about ROTC's three matters.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.920
I have no objection, no conversation going in the record,

16:37.920 --> 16:40.920
but it's irrelevant to the better one's true about ROTC.

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
I'm sure there's a...

16:41.920 --> 16:42.920
I don't have one on the seat.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.920
One of the one's in that is the fact that the photo I made

16:44.920 --> 16:45.920
was about another matter,

16:45.920 --> 16:47.920
not a lot of work.

16:47.920 --> 16:48.920
No subject matter.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.920
Now I'll turn on the phone.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
This is Nathan.

16:51.920 --> 16:52.920
You can see it.

16:52.920 --> 16:53.920
We're still in that area.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.920
Call and be in contact.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.920
One minute, let me get my phone.

16:56.920 --> 16:57.920
On the body?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.920
Here, in the list here,

16:59.920 --> 17:00.920
if you turn on the phone,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.920
I think this is the turn up.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.920
The balance of the conversation

17:04.920 --> 17:07.920
and only the deal with the ROTC.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.920
What's the...

17:09.920 --> 17:11.920
Nothing to do with any other subject.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.920
You're sure, that's it?

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
Thank you.

17:14.920 --> 17:15.920
What is the full record?

17:15.920 --> 17:16.920
One year.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.920
I don't have any.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.920
I know what a problem is.

17:20.920 --> 17:21.920
I'm the patient.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
I need you to know when I feel I'm expecting to be around the

17:23.920 --> 17:24.920
senior virus.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.920
When I feel I'm seeing real,

17:25.920 --> 17:27.920
I think we're going to be going home.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.920
Now, I'm going to introduce you to the team.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.920
I'm going to stand.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.920
Mr. Welfare, I'd like to address Mr. Mark T.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.920
You, chief sir.

17:36.920 --> 17:37.920
For the purpose of elevating

17:37.920 --> 17:39.920
Senator Jackson's monitor telephone calls,

17:39.920 --> 17:42.920
which he led in the record last Friday.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.920
And in order to update the necessitated,

17:45.920 --> 17:48.920
we've been reading those calls.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.920
I wish you would have Mr. Welfare, Mr. Pike.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.920
Neither of whom is on the witness stand,

17:54.920 --> 17:58.920
compared their transcriptions with the record,

17:58.920 --> 18:01.920
and then be able to state without reading those calls

18:01.920 --> 18:03.920
and the record before they're not there correct.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.920
We can validate the calls that way

18:05.920 --> 18:08.920
by one question with either Mr. Welfare, Mr. Welfare.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.920
Mr. Pike, I follow the turn.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.920
I think that I'd better be done the first thing more.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.920
They argue at the moment as you know me,

18:14.920 --> 18:16.920
but I've got to work here outside.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.920
So, you'll never get that over here.

18:18.920 --> 18:19.920
You'll have to have the call call,

18:19.920 --> 18:20.920
not admitted by them,

18:20.920 --> 18:21.920
and that's not otherwise.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.920
And sometimes, during the course of the act,

18:23.920 --> 18:25.920
you may make those comparisons.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.920
Yes, and with one answer to one question,

18:28.920 --> 18:29.920
most calls may be valid.

18:29.920 --> 18:30.920
That's right. Thank you, sir.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.920
Mr. Lucas, you were on the stand.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.920
That is a dime of recess this morning.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.920
And we were putting in the record the monitor telephone calls

18:37.920 --> 18:39.920
between the secretary of the Army and Mr. Colm.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.920
The point is the next monitor call you have

18:42.920 --> 18:45.920
Mr. Lucas, if it's not yet been read into the record.

18:48.920 --> 18:52.920
No, 24, not 24, not 24, not 24, not 24.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.920
Mr. Pike, call yourself as the monitor.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.920
Welfare, I'm chance-cranked.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.920
Welfare, and you have your notes before you.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.920
Welfare, I'm there tonight.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.920
Welfare, will you follow me down Mr. Lucas, please, sir?

19:04.920 --> 19:07.920
Mr. Lucas, some complaint was made about me

19:07.920 --> 19:09.920
meeting these calls to that, and that is chairman.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.920
And I'll tell the source, I'm just a little open.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.920
If I go to space, my lesson is great.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.920
So, me down.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.920
I always think, ladies.

19:24.920 --> 19:29.920
Please, welcome up to the 1953 Princess Jesus Princess

19:29.920 --> 19:34.920
Close 4.02 PM, Secretary Steven's return call of Roy Colm.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.880
When Mrs. Ritz get yours, 4,000 in in-line sea Princess

19:38.880 --> 19:40.920
Close Colm.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.920
How is your trip?

19:42.920 --> 19:43.920
I read all about it.

19:43.920 --> 19:44.920
Steven's.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.920
What did you read about it?

19:46.920 --> 19:52.920
I read all about the new comic canons and in the message.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.920
Well, for these left out, Ms. Colm, I'm sure it must be right.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.920
And inventions and everything.

20:00.920 --> 20:04.920
Steven, well, ladies, what have you worked?

20:04.920 --> 20:08.920
Colm, I thought to join Adams and he's going to talk to him.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.920
We've got a problem on this.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.920
General Rikerberger, do you know him?

20:14.920 --> 20:17.920
Steven, I think I know who he is, Colm.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.920
He's the head of the essay about engine now.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.920
He made the decision not to pick out Colm in 46.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.920
When they found the documents in his call,

20:27.920 --> 20:30.920
then you have a general blank land.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.920
And Mr. Colm has asked me to believe that.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.640
The name of that general, and I'm not

20:36.640 --> 20:39.920
trying to just talk to him on the chairman.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.920
And the other members of the subcommittee for their decision.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.920
How many miles to your tankings?

20:45.920 --> 20:49.920
I wonder if we could just to keep the records straight.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.920
Only to point out that they must are Colm,

20:52.920 --> 20:56.920
who has mentioned hasn't found a tip to work in the Red Arle.

20:56.920 --> 21:00.920
The last few days, unlawful security grounds,

21:00.920 --> 21:04.920
and unethical, the chunk will make that statement.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.920
I am giving him that information for the record.

21:07.920 --> 21:12.920
That's the same Mr. Colm mentioned in this conversation.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.920
Mr. Chairman, may I make a point?

21:16.920 --> 21:19.920
Please be a part of this.

21:19.920 --> 21:24.920
Senator Femme, I don't project a leading these names out.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.920
Any of them, one side, please.

21:27.920 --> 21:32.920
I want to put all my hand to be sure there was no question about

21:32.920 --> 21:34.920
withholding any information.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.920
I merely say this because several of the people who were in the wrong,

21:38.920 --> 21:41.920
whose names I did put in, with the graph,

21:41.920 --> 21:45.920
but in order to get all the truth, have protested this fact for me.

21:45.920 --> 21:50.920
There's a no way in the fears of my agreement to keep all these names out.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.920
Norances, suddenly do I intend to tell anybody about them.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.920
By leaking them afterwards.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.920
What's the plan? What the wishes are?

21:59.920 --> 22:02.920
The committee is chairing the standards.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.920
No need to identify the general of his name.

22:05.920 --> 22:10.920
Then you have a general blank, blind, general ex-wea calling.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.920
The president of the later stage.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.920
We want to get to him, Ian.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.920
Michael Berger, you find out by?

22:16.920 --> 22:20.920
When these two dots, French's telephone connection,

22:20.920 --> 22:23.920
cut off, French is close to that.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.920
I don't know how sensitive a position this fellow is, Ian.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.920
And whether you are interested in him or not,

22:29.920 --> 22:33.920
so John is going to talk to you and let me know on Thursday.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.920
Steve, you know what my general policy is?

22:36.920 --> 22:39.920
That I want you to talk to whoever you want.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.920
But in this case, I would like to talk to John,

22:41.920 --> 22:44.920
and I will give you an answer.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.920
Oh, and then...

22:48.920 --> 22:50.920
Eight, two,

22:50.920 --> 22:54.920
and then we'll be staying together.

22:54.920 --> 22:57.920
We only criticize him coming.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.920
Two days since, the situation is not a happy one.

23:00.920 --> 23:01.920
Two days since.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.920
There are a couple of new angles, but the situation has developed,

23:04.920 --> 23:06.920
which is disturbing.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.920
I'm going to give John the whole pitch on Ian.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
I gave John a couple of names.

23:11.920 --> 23:15.920
There's one thing I think was definitely an espionage recently.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.920
Uh, Mr. Chank, I don't think I understood that name,

23:17.920 --> 23:18.920
but I would answer that name.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.920
We're still in Eden.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.920
Mr. Y.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.920
You try to track your limits in the video?

23:25.920 --> 23:28.920
We've got to name, please.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.920
Yes, Senator.

23:30.920 --> 23:31.920
What up?

23:31.920 --> 23:32.920
No sound here.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.920
Can't even try.

23:34.920 --> 23:38.920
Well, the many members are looking at that.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.920
I think it makes you well, but it makes clear to...

23:41.920 --> 23:46.920
The press and the jury are watching this, that the withholding of names

23:46.920 --> 23:48.920
is not keeping any information from the American people.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.920
It's merely in line with the policy of the committee,

23:52.920 --> 23:55.920
that we make public no names,

23:55.920 --> 23:58.920
of those accused of coming to the espionage,

23:58.920 --> 24:02.920
unless and until they are allowed to appear and testify under oath.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.920
In a manner, I have the information.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.920
Mr. Chank, I know the junior senator from Wisconsin,

24:06.920 --> 24:08.920
wouldn't want to apply it after the general's name,

24:08.920 --> 24:10.920
we just agreed not to.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.920
I don't know what name you were referring to now.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.920
Wait, the previous one, Senator, before this one.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.920
Which was a great delay.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.920
That does not involve the general involved in the common case.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.920
But as we go along, you may have seen it under signing them.

24:25.920 --> 24:30.920
There will be a sizable number of names, individuals.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.920
Above them, there was evidence of coming,

24:33.920 --> 24:35.920
this connection of coming as activities.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.920
And each case will last their name, be kept out in my hope.

24:38.920 --> 24:42.920
We do not create the impression we're trying to keep information from the people

24:42.920 --> 24:46.920
as this is in line with the long-standing policy of the committee.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.920
That is that we not make public names,

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
of anyone accused of wrongdoing,

24:51.920 --> 24:54.920
until here he can appear under oath,

24:54.920 --> 24:56.920
and deny the charges, and that is,

24:56.920 --> 25:00.920
prior to keeping an estimate of certain names that kept out of this record.

25:00.920 --> 25:04.920
So, is that any case that's the case that puts the clear,

25:04.920 --> 25:07.920
and that's why I have religiously followed that code of my eye,

25:07.920 --> 25:09.920
Jackie.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.920
The students are still following me.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.920
Just first.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.920
We've got the question of the screening board

25:16.920 --> 25:19.920
that puts your verse in all these dispensions.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.920
The Senator called the aid today from Milwaukee,

25:22.920 --> 25:24.920
and apparently it's moving system,

25:24.920 --> 25:27.920
calling in some of the members of that screening board.

25:27.920 --> 25:31.920
And then we get into a question of direct use and executive orders,

25:31.920 --> 25:34.920
and why are things in all that sort of thing.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.920
And, Jackie, John, we have the names that we have all put in the meantime.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.920
If you'd like to start exploring that situation.
