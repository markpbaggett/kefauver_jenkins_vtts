WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
We have a case.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Yes.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
We have returned from the retest of the members of the Senate

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
to the yogurt boat.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
And the Jenkins, you may have picked up the interagitorial

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
where you defended and continued with the Copy Demonition.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I want that to report it to the police.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Please read my last question to Mr. Adams.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
The point of this is a letter to the people.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
But in an open hearing now, there wouldn't have been

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
that the start is newspaper narration.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And so that is correct, there would not have been.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And up to that time, I had never seen and hoped in hearings.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Interruption by Mr. Jenkins.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I can't hear you.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
We're going back down to Mr. Adams.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
As I understand your testimony now just before the recess,

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
you stated that you had no preference, no choice.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Between a close and an open hearing.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
That is why you were concerned that there was no distinction between this personality.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, may I qualify that there?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Well, let me qualify your answer now.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Yes, sir.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
By that, Mr. Adams.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I need to just qualify.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm not sure.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Very well now, what is the quality of the conversation?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
During the recess, a number of newspaper men have approached me and have suggested that I

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
let the inference might be going from what I have stated to the effect that's the threat

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
where the story, the first month hearing before.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
I did not intend to state that.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
The threat was getting report only from one source.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And the report had only what they heard.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
And the road reports were coming from the senator or from one of his back members who had a threat conference

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
after a hearing or an interrogation.

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
And that from our point of view, those threat conferences did not reflect the fact that we had seen.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
We didn't care for that sort of a hearing with that sort of a result.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Up until that time, where it didn't know open hearings on the fourth month matter.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
The outlines of the sorts of open hearings, which had been given to me as being the sort they would have,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
left me no enthusiasm for their needs.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Because the indications were that witnesses would be called after only a very few questions on a very

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
select, in a very selected area.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
And that's the...

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
And it's impossible to be made through that technique to draw lines from one place to another,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
to my inferences and into the oasis.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
I was no more enthusiastic for that sort of an open hearing than I was in a sort of poetry that I had been watching.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Now, you consider that a qualification of your previous insurge.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I consider it a clarification.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
It's a clarification, yes.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
The different words I was making yesterday.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
Mr. Adams, as we understand it, you have no preferences between an open and a closed hearing.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Well, I had no enthusiasm for either type.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
I'll let me understand that, but Mr. Adams, I was on a night to the my question and all fairness to you.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
And I repeated it you want to, I know we're all getting a little tired.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
You say you had no enthusiasm for either one.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
I let me make it clear now that by my questions, I did not mean to imply that any member of the press

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
would purposely just start any fact pertaining to any of those hearing open or closed.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
My firm condition means to the conrade, but as I am, it's that he can complain.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
And the part of your complaint was that Senator McCarty and his staff gave up to the press and started

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
a narration of what occurred in a closed session.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Not getting back.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
That's a statement, not a question.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Well said.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Getting back Mr. Adams, as we understand it, there was no choice on your part between an open or a closed session.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
No, I didn't prefer either of them.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
All right, now in the pause of the way I had seen closed sessions run and because of the way I was told,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
an open session would be right.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
A little higher, I'd rather you stay busy.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
If I'm not correct, you could correct me or you reach the record.

04:19.000 --> 04:28.000
That your objection to a closed session was in such a mess that the staff gave out his side or his audience.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
As I had, our other side and that closed session that it was,

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
and the roomiest impression left on the American public said the news papers

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
and the reporters who had received such a report from the staff.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
Now then, at an open session, the news papers would get verbatim.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
A correct account of the proceedings would be not a threat.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
Then Mr. Adams, my last question, I think at the time of the recess,

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
was, doesn't that fact destroy your arguments that your objection to the McCarthy gangs

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
was that they were closed sessions and that the story to accounts were given out, they now have,

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
you had no enthusiasm for either one, but to the closed session was no more objectionable to even an open session.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Well, it's a very long question, sir.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
I have no enthusiasm for the type of closed hearings which I had from the earth.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
We had, I was, no up to the idea.

05:35.000 --> 05:45.000
No, there's none of those ideas about the types of open hearings that it was suggested might be developed.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
I have a memorandum which I had hoped to have in time to redo now,

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
which has not come over from the synagogue yet, which in which I decide to the secretary of the island,

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
the objective, the open hearing of November 24th,

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
and it is that the drafted decision has anything of the point I am trying to make for you, sir.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
That is very, very direct.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
That's my step in interrogation of the group of people on a limited subject,

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
would be undertaken for the purpose of establishing either an inference or a suspicion.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So that's enough.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Now, the difference between that sort of an open hearing and this sort of an open hearing

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
is the difference between night and day, because the hearing in which we are now participating,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
is a search for facts.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
Each was a bit extraordinarily question on all phases of this participation.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
That was not the thought of open hearing that I was led to believe I was scheduled,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
and it was not something to be asked about.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
In the lives of all the questions that I have been asking you all day,

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
in which I have read the human excerpts from your 40-page statement,

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
and in the lives of your answers, isn't it the truth, Mr. Adam,

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
before this committee that you did not know all the other types of hearings, isn't that the fact?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
You say you had known these evidence, right?

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
I said I had known this, I didn't know it was the fact that you didn't all these attractive hearings.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I think I'll have to say yes, but.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Well, all right, now what's the but?

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
The but is that I had gone along for a period of nearly two months,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
watching these hearings, placing no attention.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
And the fact that I had reached the point where I was not interested in the answer about these hearings

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
and hope that they would not continue, did not mean that I did anything to stop them, they caused I did not.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
And you say now that you never made it ever to have these certain magazines,

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
to monetize, to play games, to give preferences to David Shines,

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
or any other act word or deed on your part,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
so that this way to him from these investigations, you say that.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
Well, nothing for the purpose of just creating him from the investigation.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
He's made many points there.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Each one of which is susceptible of a little different investigation.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
You said, a piece or a modify, I suspect that the fact that we went to see Senator McCarthy on November 7th,

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
who else for the purpose of modifying them, you said, give favors to David Shines,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
we did not give straight favors to David Shines.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
He was made available to the committee after the committee's request and not as Shines request.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
Wasn't General Ryan to be suggestive when he was to be given satisfactory?

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Well, as I am a city youth, as many of you are on this on your sworn testimony,

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
the hour will have all of this morning, that you, with your own, by the thumb, your own lips,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
counter-manded and cancelled in order of General Ryan.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I can tell you this was the secretary.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
The secretary made the decision to my task on General Ryan.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
I have stated the reason why the secretary did.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
Did you make any recommendations of the secretary about going over the hams of this general?

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
I made no recommendations to him, sir, and I do not consider that we went over his head.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
The state's statement of the secretary had stated and re-statement that he did not want the soldiers training.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
I'm saying that the soldiers training has not left the target.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You just take it away.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
But now you stated definitely in positive that the general Ryan was to be the judge.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
That was the secretary's statement, that is my understanding.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
And in spite of that fact, when this call came from General Ryan saying,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
here is a boy that wants something other boys are not getting,

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
and I'm not going to give it to him, you go to the secretary and the army, have a conference with him.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
And as a result of what was told to the secretary, you call the general back and say,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
let him off. That's right, him.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Not quite there. The general didn't say, here is a boy who wants something,

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
nobody else is getting the general's death to the committee has requested him.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
All right.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Well, all right, let's just use your word.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
General Ryan, I did, I did.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm the secretary.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm the secretary, that I just take the steps to which you refer.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I did go to the secretary, we did this cut that I did call General Ryan.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
I did go in the tutorial to get him to be able to go to the committee.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
So, along we can.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I reach his brother on your statement, the secretary.

10:44.000 --> 10:53.000
On December 8th, General Ryan telephoned me from Fort Six and stated that he claimed that this continued signs weekday of availability to the committee.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Because the soldier has been on site four times in a week.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
And on one occasion, as I'm preparing for the full festitivity of the AM,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
did General Ryan tell you that?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes, sir.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
Did you know whether any of these civilary major was ever taken against this boy for not coming back until four years he passed?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I have no knowledge of it, sir.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
You have no knowledge of it, no, sir.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Did you feel like that's too simple or that?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
No, sir, I did not.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
You know that that was a family of all regulations and rules, didn't you?

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
No, sir, I did not. I don't know what rules. I didn't know then. I don't know now.

11:31.000 --> 11:39.000
All right, what rules was General Ryan's account for the regimental commander or the company commander with reference to the handling, private, kind, and the case of these assets?

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
Did you know whether this secretary is located next on quite sure that he did not?

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
Did he not impose any displeasure made against his soldiers who had stayed out until four fifty-five o'clock in the morning?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
You say you were sure that he did not?

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
I am quite sure that he did not. The secretary has nearly 750,000 by the soldiers.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Yes, at a 30,000 or four days.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Something like that. And here's one boy out of 30,000.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
Excuse the secretary, call the General about and say he's about to come down there.

12:09.000 --> 12:23.000
And here's one boy out of 30,000 who's seized out until four fifty-five o'clock in the morning when 29,999 are infected, are incident-revering, and was anything done about this, if you know it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I have no knowledge.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
All right, now the General's lady is going to come to the low of weekday prices.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Yes, sir.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Did he cancel the gift?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
My understanding, he canceled them that day.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
That day?

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
Was this boy ever given any other weekday prices to December 8th?

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Don't you know that he was with that?

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
Don't you know that he's about to watch this General talk to the soldiers about?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Again, on December 8th.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Here's a boy that gives no respect.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Oh, he had a fight. We got all of them.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Let me finish my question.

13:02.000 --> 13:10.000
Here's one boy out of 30,000 that's giving off four times a week and having long weekend prices.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
And I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to stand by.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
Don't you know Mr. Adams is there after that same thing occurred from time to time until this boy was sent to come, but...

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I did not know that.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
You know what it didn't happen?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
I do not. I did not follow Friday sign that closely, sir.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
The facts that I know about, I'm kind of dying, the facts that you're convening in that America.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
I went through very little to my own knowledge as they were dating with the veterans.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
They seem to be fighting movement.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
The fact that you know about them is talking to me here.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Now, if you're thinking, he was asking from the handcakes.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
On the basis, I don't put that in the category of a weekday.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, he was asking all Christmas, he was asking all for that in category of a weekday within the meeting of my discussion with you.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
15,000 nothing at all for the Christmas holiday didn't it?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
That's my understanding.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
The other 15,000 nothing at all for the new year holiday didn't happen.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I got all full size.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
That's my understanding.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
You know that? After it happened.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
I didn't have to get there.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I knew it could cause.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
And that was extra-rans how I would be familiar to you as a Frenchman.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
I had nothing to do with Friday sign leading on New Year's.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
And weren't you this like a day?

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Allowing all this to go on these special dispensation.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
In order to be present in the pricing of youth committee,

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
all of your next chances of placing them from the investigation of the verses of the first month.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
You know that's a truth.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
That is not a truth.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
That is not a truth.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Why, Mr. Adam, is it you, Mr. Fitt?

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
To go to Mr. Mr. Cohn's office, Mr. Senator McCartney's office, Mr. Cohn's office.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
For having come to Europe.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Did it not come to Europe?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Did it not come to America?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Did it not come to America?

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
And inform him of the fact that this boil is likely,

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
this boil out of 750,000 a million and a half was likely to have a wish.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
You might as you use that.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
If you were to praise,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
I'll Senator McCartney and his committee know what they were doing.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
I did it because of the fact that I was very seriously aware.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
There'll be a treatment that Mr. Cohn had in this folder.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
And very seriously aware of the fact that Senator McCartney's office

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I then had an experience in his folder.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
And because of the fact that it was regularly, regularly,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
brought to my attention independently of any act of mine,

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
that things must be done for this folder, things that I knew could not be done

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and would not be done.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
And I was the author of the dream,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
the decision of this committee over that matter and the arm.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
I can say the position of you in the Secretary and the Operating Army

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
was found that you were,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
that your position was referenced,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
the monmer was unaspectable,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
that you had nothing to cover up,

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
that you didn't care if he investigated from now on out,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
and yet care one side is out of a million and a half.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
You take your valuable time,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
it's harmful to the Army and the valuable time of the Secretary

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
and of the Senator and of Mr. Cohn.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
And go to the trouble.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
I'll go into one of the other of them or all of them are saying

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
what's going to be your reaction

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
if anyone is boycodes over to you.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Wasn't that the cause with that?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And you were afraid of Senator McCartney.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
And the members of his committee and we just ready to break the news.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
And you wanted to break it deadly.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I knew it was one of them,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
back to where I was before we did go over to you.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Isn't that the truth about it?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Well, I don't know that that was the truth.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Mr. Jackson, you know there isn't the truth.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Just beside us, I ask you now,

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
because one of these days this committee will write a report,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
seven of the many times.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
And one of these days this committee will write a report on you and the Secretary

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
and on Senator McCartney's staff.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And that report will just make sense to a large extent,

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
no doubt, reflect to what extent they believe you and believe what you've sworn yet.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Yes, it is today.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Now you have stated that you went to Mr. Cohn

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
and advised him that the science teams that there were 90 percent.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
That this boy would go over to you.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Now I want you to explain this.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
That's kind of pronductive this committee.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Why do you get scared to say so?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
You said perhaps I dreaded to break the news.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
You thought I was fine with time?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Well, I think that's a fair statement.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I knew that this was going to be a problem someday.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
And this team believes for a bit at the moment.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
You bring something just like I wasn't sure.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
The toilet was going to have an operation I guess,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
but I knew that some baby would be safe for the party.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
You must be members there,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
that I have stayed to the floor on this stand.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I have regularly buried that serious

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
because the first couple of weeks in January and the month of December,

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
I was being hung and hung and hung and hung and hung.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
About where the shame was going,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
but why did you take this?

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Why did you take such abuses that if you were on the sound of that?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Abuse that you described Mr. Adams

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
is a lot of respectful men with this act.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Well, after I had taken this for one month,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
you took my way to the center and the McCawson.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I took this from about the fence of November the 9th of December.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Then I went to the center of McCawson.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
The rest of the 9th and the 7th are the two problems that come up in New York City.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I thought in a few times, I don't know which one you thought was the best.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
When I talked about this, a new deal of use went on the 9th of December.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
Didn't you call this the home of the New York City on February 24th?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And say, why have you been sentenced?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
I just needed to say this.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I'm a man who's been your car metter and your prosecutor.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
And I think the abuse is above you that no respectable man will want to say.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
You on your own and he should be.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I said, that's wrong, Tate of Salon.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Call the man that's the first going to hear.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
And say, why?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Mr. Coney, you said nothing before you came.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
That is very correct.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
It was on the case council of the Canadian.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
It was going to continue the case council of the Canadian.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
And as far as I know, indefinitely, my responsibility to the Army

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
was to go to the agency for this committee.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I hadn't heard from this going a long time.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I knew they would be proud of me.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I knew what I was going to put out of town.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
I never let them feel like they had an open place.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
And so I tell them, let's go back now to the business.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Get more evidence.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
Is that the explanation of using your explanation to this committee?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Is the why you went to this one man?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
I was just going to say, this is one of my biggest miscellaneous things

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I've done for this morning.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
I didn't go to the committee to come that day for that specific purpose.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
But during the course of our conversation, I brought the data from the first time.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
It was not a specific tool for the purpose of laying a very strong word.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
I tried to bring it into a regular conversation.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I did.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I was just thinking, you're ready to do it.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Well, I wasn't needy by any time.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It was a matter of a very happy blowout.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And this evening, the day of the phase was moment.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
You mean you meant something?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
You got to tell him it's going to this boy with a girl.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
I was thinking, well, either I would have to tell him or he'd find out some other sources.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I tell him he'd be more angry.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
He found out some other sources than he found out some means.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Well, all means other means of the boys that have been in the arms.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Most dozen have gone overseas, haven't they?

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
That's right, that they have not been in touch with this committee.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
No.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I try.

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
But this committee has been functioning right on since Mr. Shines been down here at Camp Garten, hasn't it?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Yes, there it has.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And apparently in the same manner.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I've had it any time.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
I think the same degree of efficiencies, as this boy has been in Camp Garten, as before he went to Garten.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
That's right, it's that, it's the director.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And I might go home with stratums,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
the area of the millions of mothers,

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
who is why I wore the proud uniform of a proud organization,

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
and a great, nice little legend is described to the second day in his statement.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Did you go to any mother of a single one of those boys?

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
And in part, they often used to hear that similar boy would go overseas.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Did you ever go overseas?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
No.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Never did.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Well, before we type the maps, one of the questions.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
I read you, Mr. Adams.

21:49.000 --> 22:05.000
Your testimony was a respect to the impirating of this portentious news to Mr. Collins, so that you could get his reaction.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
What taste, sir?

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
It don't taste funny, is it?

22:10.000 --> 22:23.000
Oh, five and twenty six, oh, six, oh, six, oh, six, oh, six, oh, six, bottom of the face.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
Mr. Adams, on January 13th, I was a secure and misdeed.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
He was coming up on another appointment.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Now, for you, that means the talking to him, the very busy man.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
I've done his foreign right through his appointment with him.

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
I did his identification when I got here to the Senate office building instead of going back to the Pentagon as I had originally found.

22:47.000 --> 22:55.000
I told Mr. Stevens that I thought I was going down and see if I could not get back in good with Mr. Collins.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
So, in January 13th, that's right.

22:58.000 --> 23:05.000
I told Mr. Stevens that I thought I was going down and see if I could not get back in good with Mr. Collins.

23:06.000 --> 23:14.000
And in 38 years, they called me as in having so much difficulty over shy.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
So, I went down to Room 101.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
This call was bad. This call was bad, I don't remember.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
We must together in the Senate's capacity and everything was peaceful.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
When we returned to Room 101 towards the latter part of the conversation, I asked Cole.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
I knew that 90% of all industries out of the face over these duties.

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
And I knew that one day we were going to face the problem with Mr. Collins.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Did I collect? Yes, sir?

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
So, I thought I would leave this groundwork for future trouble again.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
I asked him what would happen if something had happened and Cheyenne got over these duties.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
That's what you say, sir.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Yes, sir?

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
This one more hour.

23:59.000 --> 24:18.000
Now, Mr. Adams, a target has been made against humans that cannot only stop to ingratiate 2000 to the greatest of the Western Internet's best.

24:18.000 --> 24:28.000
If you not only offered special dispensations for Cheyenne in order to specify this fact,

24:28.000 --> 24:43.000
but that you offered that bigger base from time to time, to which, to the Berkeley, homosexuals in the Arab world and in the 90s.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
Did you ever do that, Miss Adam? I did not.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
We got a definition of that, Miss Adam. That is correct there.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
You'll always get a definition of that.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
That you remember that, Miss Adam?

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
I remember that, Miss Adam. I never made such an offer. I never would make such an offer. I never had such information to offer.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
Whether you ever sit down and draw some sort of an improvised map, I did so.

25:08.000 --> 25:16.000
The United States and divided into the nine main army areas, I divided it. It was not in the nine main army areas.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
I did so for the map. It was not for the purpose of getting information with reference to the airport.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I didn't ask you the purpose. Did you draw for the map? I did, sir.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
You know how many parts did you divide it? I think you did nine.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
In the nine? Yes, sir.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Why nine?

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
I do agree. Like it goes with the captain rack and it came out in the nine areas.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
May I explain it to you, Eddie? I want to ask you them about numbers.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
Yes, please, but I want to ask you about it, Senator.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
You're certainly getting them. I have no objection to you explaining to you the version of the map now.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
You know that it's different to what my deliverable is.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
I know that my deliverable is true, but I still care you, Virgin Malay, indicated in the map.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
And I think you're right. I think Senator, I'm not a bad guy.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
I think you're right. I think you're not a bad guy.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
I think you're right. I think you're saying now.

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
There wasn't anything that occurred one day.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
It came up in this way.

26:20.000 --> 26:30.000
We're telling me that the committee had a basis new investigation of the money, which was about ready to break.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
There was a windmower's test, too.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
I was wondering, somebody's finding questions. One was that, but that doesn't.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Well, I have not heard of a thing that I've been telling you.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
It's a little just to care if you'll make me run.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
You're doing a pretty good proper. Do you want to make a injury?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
No.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
I don't know where we are now.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I'm out of here.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
One was, one was, map one wasn't, map one wasn't.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Well, I have not been able to fix today exactly.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Well, the talk about Mr. Cohen's memorandum is death 9 December.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
And it was approximately that time that the incident occurred.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That way it was. That's true.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
I'm going to hit the cones of it in room 101, and then it off the hill.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
It was in the presence of Mr. Cohen and Mr. Cohen.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Cohen had been waiting to meet some time.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
It's time. There's that dignity had a big new investigation of the arms about the base.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
I did not know what it was, and I was unable to find out from them what it was.

27:29.000 --> 27:36.000
The thing that can turn me to disgivably was because of the fact that there was investigation.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
There was under investigation in the Army at that time, and under the supervision of my office being in disgivable.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
My office being in disgivable for the Secretary of the Army.

27:45.000 --> 27:52.000
Some very serious allegations with reference to almost actual behavior on the part of the group of Army officers

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
that are large Army bases in the South.

27:55.000 --> 28:02.000
The thing that said it, was not necessarily necessary.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
I have, I told the council where it was.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And it's not going to work.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
I told the rest of the two armed officers.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
I can do that, sir.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
There was an act of outrage in front of the audience.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I have the officers.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
I can include all the states to the members of the business.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
It was in the South. It was at a large Army base.

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
It was known to me, and to the officials in the Army, including my subordinates who were working on the matter,

28:31.000 --> 28:39.000
that a dissident employee of this installation was in Washington, and it was reported to us that around the first of the timbers,

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
he was soliciting interest on capital hills from among some congressional committees not further identifying.

28:45.000 --> 28:52.000
I naturally speculated as to whether or not he had come to this committee with those facts which were under investigation in our office.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I was curious to find out.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
When it was told, neither they had this investigation which was discussed between us that day.

29:00.000 --> 29:12.000
As I was sitting there very casually with a pencil, I drew a map of the United States in about 15 seconds by drawing a half a great script.

29:12.000 --> 29:19.000
I'm putting a neck on it for New England, putting a tail on it for Florida, and then going a quick-catching wrap grid, which made nine broken into nine areas.

29:19.000 --> 29:27.000
It was something of that sort. The map didn't come out the way I wanted it to the first time because I was trying to separate the southern area from the whiteened area,

29:27.000 --> 29:39.000
and to separate it from the New England area, or the New York area where Fort Monmouth was, just so that I could see if I talk to them find out which areas they were about to start their investigation as we are in here.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
I asked them whether or not they had their investigation which concerns the homosexual matters.

29:44.000 --> 29:51.000
I was able to get no answer from them. I had this map, I marked it from one to nine, and I said,

29:51.000 --> 30:00.000
if you tell me where in these areas which one of these nine areas you are about to investigate in, I'll tell you whether it's the area in which we have the homosexual problems.

30:00.000 --> 30:10.000
I thought if they had area number four, and if number four was the area in which we were concerned about, I would then know that the individual who was in Washington

30:10.000 --> 30:28.000
soliciting interest among the federal and congressional committees had given the information to this committee, and I would know that it was necessary for us to put a number of additional people on the matter for the purpose of assembling facts because an investigation might be ready about to start.

30:28.000 --> 30:39.000
That was the purpose of the joint of the maps. I offered the maps to them. At first I was able to get to no indications, and I don't think I ever really did succeed in getting them to do this.

30:39.000 --> 31:05.000
I do know that I came away from the conversations with the feelings that they were not in the area and the south before I go on, and for the purpose of stopping new favorite speculation on the matter, I'd like to say further that a careful examination by officials of the Army for a period of many weeks

31:05.000 --> 31:17.000
that's just like this, but essentially put to rest any allegations that this homosexual ring did exist and we didn't even satisfy it in January that it did not. However, at this time in December we were concerned about it.

31:17.000 --> 31:30.000
The purpose of drawing the map was as I had told you. As I remember I left the map there, I wasn't particularly concerned about it, it was a quick, speculative drawing of the piece of paper, and that was all I was through the interest.

31:30.000 --> 31:43.000
And you think now the rest of the map would be an enabling factor in ringing from Roy, Commissioner Roy Coleman, Mr. Frank Carr, the information that he desires.

31:43.000 --> 31:54.000
You could be a sort of a weaky-born thing. No, it was a very, very casual sort of a performance. I don't think now that it would have accomplished anything if I had it to do over again. I wouldn't have done it.

31:54.000 --> 32:11.000
Before you set that map, I have no idea. I left the committee room as I remember. You don't know whether it's in the position that's calling this. I have no idea. I believe you stated in your statements that when you left you failed to figure out that as well.

32:11.000 --> 32:22.000
Was that statement made from stratum to call it use? Grappin said, let that map might be produced here. No, it's too slow. I did say the map there.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
So that's your version.
