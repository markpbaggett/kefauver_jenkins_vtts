00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
In the southern part of the United States, in the latter part of November, 1950, I think

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
of every 27 was the date that the Secretary of the Army gave me a paper which has been

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
sent to the Secretary.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
And the day was ordered and sent to Bob.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
And I took it to my office and I had signed one of my lawyers' full lines through it.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
I gave him instructions that he should get in contact with the commanding general of the

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
area involved with the investigative people at the post involved and that he was to leave

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
no stone unturned to get all the facts on that.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
That information gave you all November 27.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
That's right.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
That's over at Homosexuals in some part of this country.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
That's over at Amigations.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Atrogations of Homosexuals in the south.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
At Anaheim, I'm the same.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
And if you further say so you're not in your statement, that's on the first day of December,

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
about the first day of December, you learned that there was no basis for such.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
Anaheim, no sir, I think it was in mid-January that we finally concluded that that's the charges

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
which we had heard on one December were greatly exaggerated.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
Mr. Adams, were you present when the Secretary of the Army in a conference with Mr. Holmes,

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
the car, son of the McCarthy, or any of those gentlemen stated that it's the size of investigations

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
that have been conducted by his committee for the time being.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
He was before to resign a bacteria.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Yes, speaking of the luncheon on November 6.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I was present that day, yes sir.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
What was such a statement made by Mr. Stevens?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Not exactly in that context.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
All right.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
In that context.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
I think you're on word, you're on word.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, the Secretary stated that he's in the Secretary of the Army for the last two years.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
And he had a responsibility in his area and if he wasn't able to testify to this charge,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
did he also resign?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
That's about how he did it.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
So he also resigned at right?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
That's as I remember it.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
So you remember?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yes sir.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Mr. Adams did he say that at season?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Here in his investigation continues.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
He would be forced to resign from the soul.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I didn't hear him say that.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
And he didn't say that, no sir.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
You remember that he said that he ought to resign?

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
If he could not manage his security problem to the Army, he had to resign.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
And yet you have stated here, does he under all the number of times that neither unit,

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
he as far as you knew, what is these, is that they're scared to one with where the other?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
One with one way or the other?

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Whether they were continued or whether they were disconceived.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Well, I don't think I stated that we have indicated that we cared not one with.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Well, that luncheon of November 6th is to be spent.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
That luncheon of November 6th, one of the purposes of the luncheon was to discuss

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
whether or not Senator McHatley was going to terminate the hearings as he had said to us

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
for two or three weeks earlier that he intended to do.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
And I think I stated also that we were concerned by the end about the size of hearings that were going on.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
On your charge, you said, I'm just within ten existing vestige in the Fort Lama.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
You appreciate that, I don't know.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I understand.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And the time the brain is a special other.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I understand that, that's it.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That's right.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yes, sir.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm just saying that you're just new.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
That is correct, sir.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I never did anything except into a system.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
You never, anytime, in the way that was drawn in the way of its committees

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
because the size of the director I did not.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And neither did the deprecating the bi-asign or the air he did not.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
And we understand that it was the matter that was in the series of hearings.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
If the weather and not, the business between vestiges was being viewed either by clothes or over the years.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Well, I stated that from a professional point of view, and the point of view of my office,

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
we worked in investigations.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
But from the other point of view, as an official of the Army, I was concerned that the secretary was not the type of hearing that was going on.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Now, we said, but now, in terms of the secretary, he made this bold statement.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
The Senator McCartney said, that, yes, I am in effect.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
The design and the people were doing this work myself.

04:21.000 --> 04:30.000
That is, fading out and getting out of the personnel of Mama's approaches and bad news.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Then I ordered a sign at 3.0.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
No, he didn't try at the first month of his island.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Well, at the Army.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
Could I have a responsibility for discharging the security or for managing the security of the Army and the Bikinaster what I should resign?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, you knew what I was talking about.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Yes, I knew what he was talking about.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
I knew he was talking about the very thing we're talking about now with him.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Well, I can't agree with you, sir, that he offered the resign if they did not.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You bet the point is not to get him on.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
No, I'm getting the point. I'm trying to make you say that you did not increase the progress in the investigation.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Discharge the Senator McCarthy has utterly faulted.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
No basis for it.

05:06.000 --> 05:15.000
And yet, as I have to say, as you heard the secretary say that if he couldn't do the job himself, he ought to resign.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I'm a right-wing criminal.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yes, sir.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
He didn't say that.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
And in the case of that thing, you say, hold out the C.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Mr. Stevens, didn't I think you'd get it?

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
Stop even though it were continued that penalty would be his red-wing nation on public humiliations.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
It is nothing to stop here.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Very well.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I shall accept your name.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Now it's going to be your honor to Mr. Adams if you will.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I'll get very glasses.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
No, will I?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Talk about this.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
This place for a ride.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
When you were being taken to the station to get the train back to Washington, you recall that?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Yes, sir.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
What was the data life?

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
December 17, 1963, on Tuesday and Tuesday.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
And all that information you say that Mr. Cohen angered.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It was a full-time job.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
That's right.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Like the times of the scene, sometimes he would reach your high teeth.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
And his belligerency was almost unbearable, and sometimes he was becoming self-in-any-two-event now.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Is that right?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
That's right.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
It was mostly on me, up to three miles around the office.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
While we were riding up now.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
And you've been repeating that during the luncheon, why it came and went?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
There were times where I was normal.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And then everybody left again.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
And if you two out of the day there at the office, and then if you two out there riding,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
we're not as strong as we are.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
All you do is?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yes, sir.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I didn't say I didn't talk to a mushroom in the morning.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I mean, finally, throw me several streets beyond your destination.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
That's right, sir.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Finally, put you out.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Wait until you put me out so that I can still stay with better to get out.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I had an election.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I could have stayed, I think.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I said, I left.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
You said that if you used the same language, you'd rather be ready language.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yes, sir.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I used the same language.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Yes, sir.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
And that was on what day?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
December 17th.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
December 17th.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes, sir.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
When did you make statements called?

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
I think it was about, I think it was in January.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Where was that?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I think.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I think that I saw next.

07:55.000 --> 08:05.000
And the other, the second, the center of all the buildings around maybe in January.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
On the occasion, when you said you were right there on the day of the meeting,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I don't know if it's wrong to remember.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
But when did you make statements called?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
They all won't be you.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
They'll be you, you're the matter of the future.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Not long.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
That one.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
There are few days that I've known with that.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Two days, as I remember, two days, I've been back to Washington.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Then I went to South Dakota.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
We're talking about it.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
It's just time when we were in.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I don't think it's around 150 years.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I don't think it's around that much.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Of course, it's around.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
There are not around.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
There's no place in the cross, but it's around.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But when you're in Washington, you're in Washington.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
And there's people.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I think they're in New York, but I think they're different.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
They're in a tiny country.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
They're in New York.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
That's right.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
That's a diary into the me.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It's been another time that I don't be called at this moment.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You were in the areas of Central, you were in the least.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
That is the way.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
How about first?

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Well, as I stated, I have come to the Central Office building.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
With the state, just to talk to them.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
While I was up here, I decided that I would seem to call.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
So, with the state, without us going to go.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
There's been many interviews in the event.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
About the point that December 17th,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
shines the flame that has been arraigned between Christmas and New Year.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And the colon has called me from New York about to shine

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
a real, real, real, different totally over New Year's.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Car had called me and colon, basically called me

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
when I was in Amherst, Massachusetts.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
With reference to the KP weekend for shine.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Colne had called me and asked me where,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
what was the head for shine at Camp Gordon?

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
About the Boogie-Git-Ton-Tac-it-Camp Gordon.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
And all of these incidents had occurred between the times I had seen.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
In December 17th, I had made it in January.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
And the end of December 17th were preceded by a number of other end of the show.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
December 17th, incident to me was the culmination of a series of events

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
which had begun with my call on Santa Monica, on December 9th.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And it's not only those three seating in the show.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
It occurred as well as the well-owned December 17th,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
but you have been in the show this many times

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
that I have to permit the colon's pride to see you're going to do his office in January.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
That's correct, isn't it, Beth?

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, I don't have to explain how much we talked during the balance of December.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
And I had had conversations with Mr. Colne during January.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
I don't recall whether I was insulted many times or not during this period.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, you were in Southern many times, man, where you're not.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Yes, sir.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And that's those insults you've felt enough.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I did, sir.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
Was that because of your fear of any power or any power that has snelted into you?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
And because of those of their continued investigations,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
the exposure of the investigations of the fourth month.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I don't think you did it, sir.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
And then you had had it last year, on the fourth month, on about the December 17th.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
There had never been another hearing.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
On the fourth month, as far as I know, it's just the 25th, December 17th.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Did you ever go to a prize-priced meeting in New York City?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I did, sir.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
On October 21st, the day I started exposing the...

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
On October 20th, the fourth month was recently, it's been a success.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
The bad news that you accepted hospitality to that prize-priced?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I accepted it hospitality.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
He told me that he had received the ticket to free.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I made a couple of attempts to stay him back, and finally did.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Just be sure you're full of money to do it.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
But I did stay in that ticket for $20.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
I'm accustomed to paying $5 or $6, which is that I was very surprised at.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
He insisted that the ticket had been given to him free.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I have suggested we go to the price.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
All right, he said he'd get the ticket.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And he did get the ticket.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
We did go to the price of Mr. Car and the fourth party, I don't know.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
It took me quite some time to pay him back, so that's a slight ticket.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
But I didn't pay him back.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I would assume, Mr. Hadam, whether or not I saw this flare-up,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
this explosion on the 20th of October,

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
you suggested the heroic colon that you and he go through a championship prize.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And that day, shy and by the tickets.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I did not.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
You did not.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I did not.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I never asked, they'd shine for a second.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Where did you say it?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Where did you say that night in New York City?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
21-hours, Robert.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Where did this drake hotel?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Yes, sir.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Do you know who made your reservations that scorned it?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
You don't.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
You didn't use you.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
You said it was calling.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
You said it was not David Shine.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
It was never.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Now, call and step.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
That he would get the reservations for me.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
He may have done it so, Shine.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I don't know about it.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Did you suggest that you stay at Shine Department and save a wholesale bill?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I did not.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Did not.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Anyway, I didn't even know where Shine Department was.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Now, I should have seen some of October 20th,

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
you went with a man who had threatened war.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I did.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
The threatening investigate the Army from now on out on a $20 ticket.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And you understood that it was free,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
that it had not called upon a dime.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
That's what my phone told me.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
That's right.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I believe you say you paid him back some three or four months later.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Is that right?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
That's right.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Well, sir.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
I've taken back on the second attempt.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
First attempt, I would not be successful.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
You paid him back on when?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
On my second attempt.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
First attempt, I would not pay him.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
He wouldn't pay his money.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Well, when was your first attempt?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
On the 13th attempt.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
But previous attempt, he had insisted to take us to the streets.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Nevertheless, I wanted to pay him for it.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
The stab him, you did not say for that thing.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Until you saw the jig was up.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
And that thing that came to a complete impasse between you and Kornel

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
was going to be an exposure and then you said they $20 bail.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
And it's probably the bail I did.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
That's the chairman.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
You have bought a water for your work?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I don't say so, I don't understand.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Mr. Jackson, what do you mean by the worst?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Well, the jig is up.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I would appreciate it for my explanation, sir.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
If you would explain it.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
You guessed the cost of the bail is $1,000,000.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
You can come over and see Adam from the past.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
You missed Adam some three or four months later.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
You had accepted this $20 ticket.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
I wish you didn't realize that yours and the secretaries

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
appease most of the senators and the facts.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You're following them.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
You're making peace.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
You're giving favors to day sheds.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
You're holding them as a hostage.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
And all of those things, if you didn't realize,

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
that there was going to be a publicly exposure

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
of all of these machinations and demons.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
And that it was land and not until land that you forced the money

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
on this boy for your tickets that you saved,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
you understood this not costing the day.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
That's correct.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You're buying a wedding in silver?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I guess it's the point of order.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
I don't know how I can reject this question when these proponents

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
will probably rule on this, but I would externally suggest

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
that at this moment at least, to my knowledge,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
there is no evidence bearing on any of the hypotheses

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
in the question.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Particularly the one I have in mind that I can take out

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
of this, is that the assertion that five of the chimes

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
are being held as they are hostage.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
I respectfully suggest that perhaps it's the recent fitter

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
that I have hypotheses in the question.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
And the question is that the council will

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
articulate any of these questions in terms of the allegations

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
which have been made by the president of the president.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
You've got to correct.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Small and the bad are the most perfect requirements to chairman.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
I don't suppose I sustainably reject.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
However, I'm afraid that perhaps the president of public

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
would understand that Mr. Jenkins believes that the five of the same

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
held as the hostage.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
Mr. Singh Blair, in my role, I'm not permitted to have any beliefs.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
And I understand that the president has denied the predicate

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
of my questions, and I further understand

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
that this committee is entirely distilled

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
and it's the fit to believe otherwise

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
if you will, all of the testimonies it's entirely.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Now, we've received the stance for what I have been asked

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
and I say, I believe we have not.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't get it.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I've already said it as an answer to the question

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
and I've been asked if there was evidence of the space

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
on the foundation of the allegations

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
which are related in the specification introduced by the country.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
I was taken to the opinion that none of these questions

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
are taken to the opinion on the five of the chimes.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Now I have made the answer and I'd like to have the questions

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
read that, and I'll call up with this in the next one.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
First up, what do you have in mind with that?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I do not have a mind. I'd like to read.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Before that, I'll be reading the questions specifically.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I'll point it out where the reason is in the context.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
I think it's a very great question.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
I'll have to read that.

16:54.000 --> 17:06.000
Well, the reporter is in close to the mic when you read to the table.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Later, we'll be excited to hear.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Question.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Mr. Adam, some three or four months,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
right? You had accepted this $20 ticket.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
I will ask you if you didn't realize that yours and the secretary

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
and the secretary is a pieceman of the officer and his staff

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
you're following them.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
You're making peace.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
You're giving favors to their chimes.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You're holding them as an hostage.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
All of those things you didn't realize with your Adam

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
there was going to be a public exposure of all these

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
machinations and feelings.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
And that it was them and not until then that you forced

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
the money on the story for a ticket that you say you understood

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
did not cross the mud.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
No, the answer to the question is no.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
You can tell you where the gold out of the wall is Mr.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Cole, the piece you on December 11th.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Change to the fourth of the 11th of December,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
which was the telephone call that got us a weekend.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Right? Yes, there I did that spot last.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Let's give it in the fact that on that bear day,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
December 11th.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
You requested Mr. Cole to buy some tickets for you

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
in New York City for a free.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
For yourself and I please some of your relatives.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
No, the occasion of the theatre tickets was on December 16th.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Immediately today, the day before evening, the...

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
...live.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
On December 16th, I went to New York at about two o'clock in the afternoon.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I arrived at New York at about two o'clock in the afternoon.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I went down to the courthouse and I got there about the time hearing.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
I've made an effort to get theatre tickets with no success.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
I asked Mr. Cole to be new for I could get some theatre tickets.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
He made a couple of telephone calls for me and succeeded in getting tickets reserved for me

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
for a rather than Russell and wonderful town.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Three tickets.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
I went to the theatre that night when I arrived to pick up the tickets they were paid for.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
I didn't say Mr. Cole in the next morning until after the hearing started.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
I tried to pay him then and didn't succeed in doing it in the...

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
...in the...

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
...turvian to the hearing.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
I didn't see Mr. Cole in again, excepting at the afternoon when we had the ride.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
The next time I saw Mr. Cole, I tried to pay him.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
He insisted he hadn't paid for those tickets.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
And we had a difficult afternoon, a difficult afternoon,

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
but as a result of the inquiry I made about China going overseas

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
and things got so turbulent and difficult that afternoon.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
When I tried to pay him for the theatre tickets then the fight ticket at the same time,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
this was on January 16th.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
I did not succeed in doing it, so I folded the money up and put it in my wallet

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
and carried it around with me until I saw him again.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
The next time I saw him was in New York just preceding this liquor hearing.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Then I pushed the money for both the fight tickets and the theatre tickets in his upper...

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
...breath pocket of the coat.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
He protested, I don't play that way, I don't play that way,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
but I said I want you to take just money anyway.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I just don't want the only of this money.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
You paid him because the theatre tickets and the price I'd take it at the same time.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
That is correct, and I tried to pay him in January and I had no success.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
How long was it like you got the theatre tickets that you forced this money on?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The first time I tried to pay him was the next day.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
The next time I tried to pay him was in January about three weeks later.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
He protested then again, the fight ticket had been for three and the theatre tickets had been free.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
I didn't succeed because I was the afternoon when things went to places

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
as the rate of all the shines over these duties.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
The very next time I saw him, which was on February 17th,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I succeeded in paying him by putting the money in his pocket and insisting that he did it.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
From two months, two and a quarter months, that is correct.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
That is correct.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
You don't belong to the merchants club in May or not there.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
The second day does, there's enough there.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Do you know that in the early part of these games, the secret days,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
once the merchants club that we see has belonged for many years?

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
And there made arrangements for Senator McCarthy and his fact.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
The dying man accepts the hospitality of that club.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
And by whatever they chose and it was all to be charged to the secretary of the Army.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I do, sir.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Did you regard that as improper?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I did not, sir.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I remember how it occurred.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Mr. Davis told me about it before he did it.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
We were riding in New York and Mobileau from the airport down down in New York to the hearing on the 13th of October.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
And Mr. Davis gave me the state of need.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I did not.

21:32.000 --> 21:41.000
I had belonged for 30 years to a club that was only about two blocks from the courthouse.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
He said there are very few good restaurants down in the courthouse there is.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
He said, I think Senator McCarthy will probably appreciate having the place where he can have a private room for lunch.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
He said, I'm going to invite him when we get into the courthouse.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
I'm going to telephone this club and ask for a private room for the day and tomorrow.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
So that I can date Senator McCarthy and his fact.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
I have a private room for lunch, which he did do.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
And on either the 13th or the 14th, while we were at lunch, Mr. Davis gave me the state of the Democratic,

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
that he had a range with the manager of the club to make the, uh,

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
of the facilities of the private dining room available to send to the Democratic.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
And Mr. Davis gets after he returned to Washington, provided the sender refuses.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
In the evening, food, that's that.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And you see nothing wrong about that.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I saw nothing wrong, sir.

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
Now the situation was that Senator McCarthy was the investigator of the Secretary of the Army at that time.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
That's right.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
He was investigating.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
He was sure the situation had four months.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
He was not investigating the fact there is.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
Wasn't he in the same attitude that a man would be in, for instance,

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
who was being investigated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue?

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
And when that agent came to town to investigate him,

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
the party who was being investigated was going to a hotel in the range for a free room and forward for that investigator.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Aren't the cases comparable?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Not at all, sir.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
That's the same as within those clubs.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
And though, as he was doing nothing to cover up to the trying to assist him,

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
he's not.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
I'd rather be very, very, very, very, very,

23:11.000 --> 23:18.000
and would be encouraging, uh, if it's Senator McCarthy and his best to continue those open and low-dose games.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Well, I'm thinking of taking one more of them.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
You talked about going to Amherst,

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
but making it a speech, and there being called Mr. Carr.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
When was that?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I went about me eight years ago in January.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I was called on the night of January.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
I was called.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Yes, sir.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
And, no, I wasn't.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I guess I was called.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
He had been trying to reach me at my home,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
and my wife had not told him where I was, but she telephoned me.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
After I talked to my wife and told her where I was, Mr. Carr, you're called.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
And you, in that conversation told Mr. Carr to not let Mr. Cohn get on the telephone.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Mr. Carr was in Washington.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Mr. Cohn was in New York.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
I asked Mr. Carr not to tell Mr. Cohn where I was, or I need to defer.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I think Mr. Cohn is to my location.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
Until it's that time that I can check out in a hotel, which I was in a protest.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And before you got checked out the phone line again.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
That's correct.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
You picked up the receiver.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Yes.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
You heard Mr. Cohn's voice.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I did.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Mr. Carr told you about the PC duty for this boy, hadn't you?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Yes, sir.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
He called me about the PC duty.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
You're about getting him off of the PC duty.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Yes, sir.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
And you knew Mr. Adams, that's what Mr. Cohn was calling you calling you about, didn't I?

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Mr. Adam, you refused to take that call.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I did, sir.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
When you taken it all, you would have had to say,

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
wasn't the boy I was not getting off of the PC duty?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Why were you afraid to tell?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I wasn't afraid.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I was never afraid to tell him to call anything.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
But I had an engagement in the home of the President of the College within four or five minutes.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
And I knew if I got on the telephone cone with Mr. Cohn, I'd be there for an hour.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And I had no desire to do that.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
Because I knew that as soon as I told him that I was not going to call General Ryan,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
that I was just might as well unpack my bag and sit down and listen.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
And I didn't want to do that.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
I wanted to leave.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
And we're talking to you as long as an hour.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I don't think all of you ever talked me that long.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
I've been recited yesterday 20 minutes, for the longest conversation I've ever had.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
That's a long conversation that I had.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Well, out here was the man from somewhere in New York calling you.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Counsel for the Army.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Counsel, Mr. Stevens.

25:24.000 --> 25:30.000
About getting one pilot out of Maine's office in the PC duty one morning.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
And you did not want to talk to him on the telephone with me,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
or Mr. Stevens of an tempo.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
And in conformity with your Athedians, your convictions.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
So, it used that call and say the bar was defeated like every other bar in the hour.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Wouldn't it have been saddened and not occurred to you?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Mr.だけ I don't think I can.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I have said I would not say that this was,

25:52.000 --> 26:01.000
I had signories responsible to get along and to help the community

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
when they speak that for a secret.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You can't help me, you can't negotiate,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
and you can't get anything done for your own agency.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
If the employee is a staff, you take care.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
You have a high receive that telephone call from its call.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
It would have been another very, very difficult conversation.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I had no stomach for that conversation,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
so I thought I would avoid receiving that call.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
You had a responsibility to get along with that committee.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
That is correct.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
It is a hurting use that you have a responsibility to the millions of young men.
