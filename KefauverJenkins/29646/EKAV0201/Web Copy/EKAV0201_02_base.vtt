WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.800
I want you to understand, as I am sure you do, that I work for the Committee as its Special

00:22.800 --> 00:23.800
Council.

00:24.800 --> 00:30.800
I am in the wise responsible for the policies adopted by the Committee.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.800
I have no vote on the Committee.

00:34.800 --> 00:43.800
Shouldn't the Committee taste a motion or a resolution that precludes my calling any witness?

00:43.800 --> 00:52.800
Then you're bound to know as I know you do know as an attorney, that my hands are tied and that I cannot call that particular

00:52.800 --> 00:53.800
witness.

00:53.800 --> 01:04.800
If no such restriction is placed on me, Mr. Well, I shall continue in my own way as I have in the

01:04.800 --> 01:16.800
facts to present the facts, but please don't cast the button of the onus upon me because as you know and as everyone knows,

01:16.800 --> 01:20.800
I am taking orders from those who employ me.

01:21.800 --> 01:31.800
Mr. Well, I am confident, sir, that your press teach with this Committee and with this country a set, sir, that if I say to you I want Mr.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.800
Well, that the Committee witnesses and ask the word please, he will be called.

01:36.800 --> 01:46.800
Mr. Well, I have a high respect and great affection for our charming friend from Buffalo.

01:47.800 --> 02:02.800
He has read one side of the story, so suppose to be sure that we do not have an expat a presentation that we read from the same record a little of the other side.

02:02.800 --> 02:09.800
And I will tell you Mr. Welles to page 2857 of the printed hearings.

02:10.800 --> 02:21.800
It was in the course of that long onset of cross-examination conducted by the Chairman, Senator Munn, and on that page it begins as public.

02:21.800 --> 02:27.800
He said, you will develop specifically and this is the first to close to the Army Council and Mr. Welles.

02:27.800 --> 02:34.800
You will develop specifically the chargers so that we can put our champions to something specific.

02:35.800 --> 02:41.800
That is what we are trying to find before January 20th and of course this relates to Mr. Karl.

02:41.800 --> 02:50.800
And here with Mr. Adam, Mr. Welles, he said as I have stated he was a participant in the luncheon on November 6th.

02:50.800 --> 02:57.800
I remember no words. He did not seem to disagree with the request which was made.

02:57.800 --> 03:04.800
I do not isolate the instances, but I know that he was at court ticks from time to time.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.800
He did not participate or he said nothing.

03:08.800 --> 03:13.800
And it must be remembered that it was not Mr. Karl who charged himself.

03:13.800 --> 03:18.800
There was no member of the committee who charged him. It was the Army who charged him.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.800
And your principle prosecuting witness in this case Mr. Welles was your consul or Mr. Adam.

03:24.800 --> 03:32.800
We go on. Senator Welles. Before we leave I want to get these phone files on so we can save time.

03:32.800 --> 03:37.800
We have taken out any charge out as far as the automobile is concerned.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.800
Mr. Adam is right. He was as uncomfortable as I was. Senator Welles.

03:42.800 --> 03:49.800
At the luncheon whether he was comfortable or uncomfortable are you charging him with him proper activity?

03:49.800 --> 03:57.800
Mr. Adams, no sir. He was a co-participant with Senator McCarthy in the luncheon of December 10th.

03:57.800 --> 04:03.800
The prime and sole purpose of which was to discuss the New York assignment for Sean.

04:03.800 --> 04:10.800
Senator Welles and what did Karl do on that occasion that was improper? Mr. Adams.

04:10.800 --> 04:16.800
I state so he was a co-participant with Senator McCarthy. Senator Welles.

04:16.800 --> 04:23.800
I understand that. I want to understand what he was co-ing while he was at the luncheon.

04:23.800 --> 04:30.800
You have been relatively specific about Karl. Welles is very specific about McCarthy.

04:30.800 --> 04:36.800
Now let's get specific about Karl. We have to call Karl to defend himself against something.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.800
And we want to find out what it is Mr. Adams.

04:39.800 --> 04:47.800
I am trying to recall sir my opinion of the Karl attitude prior to and subsequent to January 20th.

04:47.800 --> 04:53.800
Senator Welles, this is December 10th. That is prior to January 20th. That is correct.

04:53.800 --> 04:58.800
What did he do on January 10th? Mr. Adams, you mean January 20th? Senator Welles.

04:58.800 --> 05:03.800
December 10th. That you wanted to charge him with as being improper. Mr. Adams.

05:04.800 --> 05:13.800
He was a co-participant in the luncheon. Probably they were enjoying for succulent pork chops along with everybody else.

05:13.800 --> 05:19.800
This senator was the one who was making the request with reference to the New York assignments for Sean.

05:19.800 --> 05:26.800
Senator Welles, I am talking about Karl. What did Karl do with the luncheon? Mr. Adams.

05:27.800 --> 05:32.800
He did not dissociate himself with the senator's position.

05:32.800 --> 05:41.800
Didn't say anything. Maintained a silence. He was quiet. The nature of Frank Karl has a matter of fact.

05:41.800 --> 05:47.800
He did not dissociate himself at the luncheon on November 6th. Senator Welles.

05:47.800 --> 05:54.800
December 10th, we are talking about Mr. Adams. I am speaking of both November 6th and December 10th.

05:55.800 --> 06:02.800
Senator Welles, let's make a December 10th. What did he do on December 10th, other than the fact that he did not say to his chairman?

06:02.800 --> 06:13.800
Don't say that, Mr. Adams. I would state that he was president. He did not dissociate himself. That's amazing, isn't it?

06:13.800 --> 06:20.800
Where are the acts, Mr. Welles? Where is the affirmative testimony? We have been waiting for it.

06:20.800 --> 06:26.800
Now Senator Welles said, all right, he was president. He charged with improperly using means to intimidate the army.

06:26.800 --> 06:36.800
Because he was president at the luncheon instead of nothing, he is rather charged. Or do you say that as far as that luncheon is concerned, there is no complaint on the part of the army.

06:37.800 --> 06:53.800
I think the fact that he was president, the fact that the position of the chairman was being immancated to us and that he was sitting there quietly listening to it made him a cold participant.

06:54.800 --> 07:08.800
So silence and profundity is now the basis of the proof. There has been no proof that I think this committee must exercise its responsibility to any participant in this case.

07:08.800 --> 07:23.800
And if it comes, I do think, now, to remove this cloud from Frank Carl on the basis of what you're prosecuting in your studying with the state that after all the days on the same, there is nothing affirmative.

07:23.800 --> 07:35.800
There are no acts that would impeach Frank Carl and his come to an indicate that he has identified with the charge that he used improper influence in behalf of Dave Sherman.

07:35.800 --> 07:47.800
Surely he mentioned his name, you refer to the trip from the yard who hasn't engaged in polar car conversation with a scotch in his hand when it went all around the circle full hill.

07:47.800 --> 07:53.800
But what there in affirmative act was there's something over there to bring Frank Carl within the orbit of these charges.

07:53.800 --> 08:04.800
And so I say it's the duty of this committee now that the army has presented its case. You said you concluded with your witnesses.

08:04.800 --> 08:16.800
It is a responsibility of the committee now that your complaining witnesses have been heard that we really Frank Carl this cloud and the motion ought to be put and there ought to be a vote.

08:16.800 --> 08:28.800
One more word from the Mr. Welp by the monitored telephone calls a part of your case.

08:28.800 --> 08:40.800
We assume so if we see the evidence of course and there will be one between Mr. Adams well as there anything in the monitored telephone calls that bears on Mr. Carl.

08:40.800 --> 08:47.800
Oh yes. Yes. Well I really make the point is the testimony all in.

08:47.800 --> 09:03.800
I will say this Mr. Welp I think the evidence to date on Mr. Carl is pretty weak. I'm being absolutely fair but I want to be fair to you to serve and inquiring whether you've got your case all in.

09:03.800 --> 09:13.800
And I really make the inquiry Mr. Chairman whether the motion is made before all of the evidence is served.

09:13.800 --> 09:21.800
I think it's pretty important that I ask the Mr. Welp now do you consider the monitored phone calls a part of your case.

09:21.800 --> 09:37.800
Yes. One monitor phone call at least and I am informed by Mr. St. Clair who is dealt more closely with the monitor phone calls than I am possibly more directly involved Mr. Carl.

09:37.800 --> 09:44.800
I wish to say a word to my phone senator Dirkson who's probably I always so much envy.

09:44.800 --> 10:00.800
You don't strike the cemetery as being open to conversion I'm afraid I may not win your vote but I do wish to point out to you that it is possible to cooperate in a plan by me or silence.

10:00.800 --> 10:12.800
If I were to meet you tonight in some dark alley and relieve you of your wallet and have with me that strong style of character St. Clair.

10:12.800 --> 10:19.800
The same Claire would be a participant in the hold up and you know as well as I what the consequences would be.

10:19.800 --> 10:38.800
But it isn't merely that I say is the train ride in which you introduce the Scott that I don't find in the evidence and in which Mr. Carl says however softly Mr. Adams as long as shines the signs isn't satisfactory.

10:38.800 --> 10:48.800
The army is in for trouble as a lawyer sir I say to you you cannot direct a word in the face of that evidence.

10:48.800 --> 10:55.800
I observe a nod from a lawyer who is opinion I respect all the way different with his politics.

10:55.800 --> 11:08.800
Let me say the senator here for the cause of the case Mr. Carl is found free of all fault by you you see the advancing toward him smilingly.

11:08.800 --> 11:19.800
I have sorry genius for losing cases I wish however not to lose until we have a disease.

11:19.800 --> 11:24.800
Mr. Madderick is there with the one who will allow me to come in.

11:24.800 --> 11:37.800
Well Mr. O's yes I don't know about meeting some lover in the dark alley with that strong Tywin cherry trim is just in Claire who come to the rescue.

11:37.800 --> 11:44.800
But that's of course would refer to a criminal perpetration which is certainly not before.

11:44.800 --> 12:03.800
Here our charges in a file that can but embrace no intense no misdemeanor no tell them a here you have charged a member of the committee staff with undo and improper improvements.

12:03.800 --> 12:20.800
I have been waiting for the proof and it has not come and certainly it is within the province of any judge when the truth has not sustained the charge to direct a verdict and that's precisely what is being done here.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.800
The court doesn't have to wait for the end of the proceeding.

12:24.800 --> 12:37.800
He can remove the cloud from a litigant or a participant or even from one charge with criminality when it appears to the court that that should be done and that's precisely what is before us today.

12:37.800 --> 12:50.800
You charge the permanently in your statement that there was improper influence on the part of Mr. Carl you come now and say that by his silence he may have given consent.

12:50.800 --> 13:07.800
I simply do not agree it was your responsibility to make an affirmative case to this committee sitting as a jury and you have utterly failed to do so in my judgment and for that reason I gladly sustain the motion that is before.

13:07.800 --> 13:21.800
One more that is not forget about this department charges against evens and Adams he charged him with blackmail he charged him with the hostage theory and he and one of his memorandum made that incredible

13:21.800 --> 13:35.800
that the judge that Stephen said he would sell the Navy in the Air Force down the river and supply the witnesses that would say to the other two services if they don't let go of the arms that a

13:35.800 --> 13:42.800
lot of the time of the charge of the group of the state of the charge or regimented by call by car and that will stand in this record in tight fighting when most memorandum are in the case and I say I wish to cross the

13:42.800 --> 13:49.800
exam anymore in that charge.

13:49.800 --> 14:11.800
Mr. Chairman first I would like to if I might correct the phrase of the news so often here in a broken play by many of his use by myself a number of times

14:11.800 --> 14:24.800
I think it should be very clear that this is not the army that's involved if they assume little men from the Pentagon mostly not in uniform.

14:24.800 --> 14:37.800
Mr. Chairman when I asked Mr. Frank Clark and with my committee he was then in charge of the subversive group for the FBI over New York.

14:37.800 --> 14:53.800
He was a supervisor of some of their highly trained investigators all of us getting communism, phrases, subversions, memorandum, 100 up to 200 over that and I call that time my

14:53.800 --> 15:07.800
children's car that he would be fairly smeared in the accused of everything on earth that he came out my committee and passed experience me that would be true.

15:07.800 --> 15:22.800
I think it's very important I think Mr. Welch has performed a service to Mr. Clark the American people by having this smear with a jury of five

15:22.800 --> 15:42.800
people. I think Mr. Welch underestimated the intelligence of this jury. They know the plan you issued charges formal charges and writing nothing less for the moment sign by Mr. Welch acquiesced and by the other

15:42.800 --> 15:58.800
millions in the Pentagon you charge Mr. Car with making threats and almost everything in the book. You knew that if we believe those charges it would mean the reputation it would mean the job of Mr. Frank Car.

15:58.800 --> 16:10.800
There's no doubt in your mind about that Mr. Welch. No doubt in the minds of your clients Mr. Adam Mr. Stevens. Now when your case is over when your evidence is all in

16:10.800 --> 16:20.800
the book and you can find nothing against Frank Car. You have no evidence against this except you say an answer to some of Jackson's question maybe the

16:20.800 --> 16:36.800
monitored phone calls might produce something. Now you know the only monitored phone calls with a call is monitored by Mr. Adam after after I refused to exceed to the blackmail attempt.

16:36.800 --> 16:46.800
You know there are self serving you know Mr. Adams testified to those in detail so you know there's nothing new this is a new rules and I say to the chair of the

16:46.800 --> 17:04.800
centers as a judge I have seen I have seen many dishonest attempts by clever little lawyers to smear and distort the facts but in all my record as a judge as

17:04.800 --> 17:18.800
head of this committee I have never in my life. Same and you may undo like Mr. Welch is doing now namely after he admits he has no evidence he still requires to tell 10

17:18.800 --> 17:28.800
million people in the television audience the Mr. Frank Car here with the tremendous record he's got the most outstanding young man I have ever seen with the most

17:28.800 --> 17:46.800
outstanding record. He still says we'll let's keep him in here maybe somehow someplace sometimes we can get the reputation and the job of this man I may say that Mr. Welch Mr. Chairman has I think

17:46.800 --> 18:02.800
a new name to hearing they should be labeled now on if he is directing the case and I emphasize not the army directing the case of these

18:02.800 --> 18:20.800
civilians in the front of gone they should be labeled smearing instead of hearings and again in conclusion Mr. Chairman I sincerely hope that all of us including myself I've been guilty of a number of times we don't

18:20.800 --> 18:34.800
have to do this as the army case because this is not the army case and I know from the calls I get the great number of come back men in the military get awfully sick away

18:34.800 --> 18:44.800
down deep inside when I hear this effort to cover up communist being labeled as an army case.

18:44.800 --> 19:00.800
The chair would like to say this before voting because he one time before listening to the persuasive powers of Mr. Welch and voted with him in a very important decision at which time the chair he pocketed from his Republican

19:00.800 --> 19:29.800
and he felt that Mr. Welch had reported a position of his client which the chair should sustain the interests of fairness and justice he is a good listen to Mr. Welch he finds him a bit less persuasive today and on his failure in government to persuade the chair I think the chair should explain to Mr. Welch

19:29.800 --> 19:45.800
while he is not quite as persuasive with the chair today as formally in the first place the chair devoted the better part of two days to interrogating Secretary Stevens about any specific charge he cared to make against Mr. Car

19:45.800 --> 20:03.800
and that the conclusion in substance secretary Stevens that if I were the jury on the basis of my testimony alone I would equip Mr. Car so he implied Mr. Eddens might have some very destructive and pointed in specific testimony against Mr. Car

20:03.800 --> 20:27.800
so the chair devoted the better part of two days interrogating Mr. Eddens about Mr. Car he went specifically into the four points that you mentioned the train ride the soup balls call the amherst call and the meeting in the Methodist books and that the conclusion of long call up which you did not read today for lack of time

20:27.800 --> 20:46.800
at the conclusion of those long call up which he asked Mr. Adams specifically in each instance whether he considered anything that was done in connection with any of those four contacts to be in the nature of an improper means to influence the art in the direction of granting favors to Mr.

20:46.800 --> 21:06.800
Eddens. He was assigned on any other direction and each time under oath Mr. Adam said no and then he said late as you have said even more politically and he felt however that perhaps on the memorandum issued on March 11th there is something to incriminate Mr. Car

21:06.800 --> 21:19.800
that was not very persuasive when Mr. Adam said it Mr. Walsh now when you said it because I knew and he knew and you know that at the time you prepared your carefully drawn

21:19.800 --> 21:36.800
set a specification to which you signed your name to which it was testified you prepared them after consultation with the records in the principles not one single mention was made of the memorandum and which you now propose to indict Frank Car.

21:36.800 --> 21:47.800
Nor can I be as much persuaded as I might be about this new suggestion that perhaps you now have found something which will indict Frank Car.

21:47.800 --> 22:00.800
Perhaps there is something in a monitored phone telephone telephone call between Mr. Eddens who testified he found nothing up until March 11th which would indict Mr. Car.

22:00.800 --> 22:10.800
In the face of the testimony of Mr. Adam that he found nothing before March 11th with which he could quarrel seriously concerning the proper time the record of Mr. Car.

22:10.800 --> 22:26.300
I'm not too much persuaded by your expression of the hope that these calls when they are entered will disclose that the fact but for your service Mr. Walsh may I say this you're not before a judicial tribunal you're before a committee of the

22:26.300 --> 22:41.800
sentence any action that the Senate takes is reversible if we make an error in voting now to dismiss Mr. Car as the witness and Mr. Hempsel as a witness if it develops that you can in fact elicit from the

22:41.800 --> 22:52.760
friends of Frank Car statements with which to indict him you could not produce by consultation with those who propose to be against it then of course we can we

22:52.760 --> 23:22.740
have a position on the basis of such a and the basis of the full story as hold up to now and you're complete failure to specify a single direct charge against Mr. Car of improper behavior the chair feels that in common justice he should go at this time with the conclusion of your case certainly to dismiss him as a witness and to dismiss the charge subject to reversal if in fact there's I suggest you should

23:22.740 --> 23:48.020
exceeding getting from his friends who are about to be the witness evidence against him you could not produce by putting your own people on the stand and may I suggest finally that I think it's very important that when we have a man of the importance of Mr. Hempsel who's needed in the defense established for whom Mr. Hempsel for whom there has been no charge

23:48.020 --> 23:57.220
of attention on whom the committee has already ruled up the basic and most serious charges cannot be considered because you're beyond the purview of this

23:57.220 --> 24:08.300
country mercy dealing with incidents from 10 years ago the chair does not be proposed to be goaded into extending these hearings and prolonging them and bringing

24:08.300 --> 24:22.700
you additional witnesses when those presenting the charges against Mr. Hempsel are perfectly willing to see them adjudicated in this way both of those statements are made to you Mr. Welch in the hopes that they may give you some

24:22.700 --> 24:31.020
coverage by virtue of the fact that senatorial bodies do sometimes you've written those perhaps more frequently than judicial tributes.

24:31.020 --> 24:48.220
Mr. Pock. Mr. Trevina. I'm convinced that the army's case was very well presented by Secretary of Army Stevens and the council John Adams.

24:48.220 --> 25:00.220
I think the other collateral witnesses added little to the testimony that the Army presented. All the main charges end

25:00.220 --> 25:10.060
during the interrogation of the witnesses that you have presented. I concur and I think the concerns has also been expressed by

25:10.060 --> 25:23.540
least one member on the other side of the aisle. Some of Jackson the five. The call a newspaper. Over the weekend. That best the case in this against the car is exceedingly exceedingly weak.

25:25.620 --> 25:34.140
That being the case the army has more or less presented its case against the three principles Sunday McCarty Mr. Cohen and Mr.

25:34.140 --> 25:48.900
Carl. It seemed it was seemed to me that Mr. Carl has a witness that had lived on less on less Sunday McCarty or Mr.

25:48.900 --> 25:56.980
Cole brought him to testimony the memorandum with which you mentioned. If he fails if they fail to bring you to evidence and

25:56.980 --> 26:05.980
testify on the memorandums for Mr. Cole for Mr. Car. Then I would say that Mr. Car as a principal witness.

26:08.380 --> 26:15.540
The isn't fucking certainly is not great. However, yes, Mr. is Sunday McCarty or Mr.

26:15.540 --> 26:24.380
Cole and of course the like that. The only memorandums for Mr. Car. Then I would say that you would have a perfect life.

26:25.340 --> 26:35.420
And the committee will be bound to offer Mr. Car as a witness. That respect. But until that is done, I would say that his position will be the same as Mr.

26:35.420 --> 26:47.860
Hinsley. Mr. Hinsley. The charges against Mr. Hinsley. I'm not. We will not be brought in. Now that they were brought in, I'm certain that Mr.

26:47.860 --> 26:55.060
Hinsley would want to be a witness. But if there are not a part of the testimony, as the

26:55.060 --> 27:00.620
ability of the person to make the charges to offer into evidence, what they fail to offer into evidence,

27:00.620 --> 27:08.260
irrespective of public statements that have been made are not to be considered in this and in part of this

27:08.260 --> 27:15.340
carnival. So I would at this point, I would say that both Mr. Hinsley, when the charges made again

27:15.340 --> 27:22.300
to him have not been not suspended by proof in this area. And when the charges against Mr.

27:22.300 --> 27:30.340
Car at this time are not suspended by proof, I think both members should be excused as persons with this one

27:30.340 --> 27:36.100
provides the power. That in case that during the course of testimony is in the McCarty and Mr.

27:36.100 --> 27:43.540
Cole. The memorandums for Mr. Car are used as part of their testimony. Then I would say that Mr.

27:43.540 --> 27:50.660
Car than would be submitted as a witness as a flutter of witness. And he ever sent it

27:50.660 --> 27:58.500
aside before. I want to say one thing, Mr. Jam, and I don't want Mr. Wells to get in the

27:58.500 --> 28:05.460
post. There will be any reversal. This is going to be final. And he's going to be eliminated.

28:05.460 --> 28:10.300
But I want to say I agree with you. You say you don't agree with my politics. I should

28:10.300 --> 28:16.220
agree with you. But I want to say I agree with you as to the merits of the case. I do not

28:16.220 --> 28:24.860
mean that I would vote to sustain it after all the other denses in. But as a lawyer, I believe I know

28:24.860 --> 28:31.460
taking into account the memorandum that the denatured publicly, certainly he's still a top

28:31.460 --> 28:36.900
of part of this proceedings and the law of testimony is in. I agree with you. I suggested

28:36.900 --> 28:45.220
that first thing I said with respect to this motion, that promotion, the two issues in the

28:45.220 --> 28:50.820
motion should be severed. It should be all conceptedly and I made that request. But it will

28:50.820 --> 28:55.620
think it'll make any difference. The length of vote will be just the same in a way. So maybe

28:55.620 --> 29:01.380
there's a short note. But I want to say that I have never before seen a case dismissed

29:02.020 --> 29:07.780
where the accusing party was in court and refusing to withdraw the charges where the charges

29:07.780 --> 29:13.540
actually made a case if it's sustained by evidence. And you're not gentlemen. You are not

29:14.100 --> 29:19.860
you're not deceiving the American people. This great theory that you've heard of is what's in

29:19.860 --> 29:26.260
these proceedings. They are serious, vulnerable charges being made to get smithed the Hensel.

29:26.260 --> 29:29.060
And you have the accusers right there in the room.

29:30.260 --> 29:35.380
Currently, tacitly consenting for the dismissal of those charges.

29:35.380 --> 29:40.500
Then if they ought to be dismissed, they ought to be dismissed by those who made the charges

29:40.500 --> 29:42.980
stuffing up here and publicly what's going on.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.380
Having led the year, Mr. Welch, you would kind enough be the year of the May.

29:51.380 --> 29:52.980
If you want to know, Senator.

29:54.740 --> 29:59.380
If I can tell you, then I will proceed. I'd like to ask with the chairman, consider a question

29:59.380 --> 30:03.140
of further gold. Because if not, I'd like to ask the question. I don't object to being

30:03.140 --> 30:07.220
good. Go ahead, whether it's a go to not. Well, maybe it's a sheep. I don't want to get your

30:07.220 --> 30:15.380
gold. In any case, I'd like to ask this question. Do you intend to vote to call Mr.

30:15.380 --> 30:20.900
Carge of witness? Not in less than evidence. It's made against him.

30:20.900 --> 30:24.340
There is some evidence against him. Then I say I can reverse my position.

30:24.340 --> 30:27.300
What's your real, really, doing it? And it's mercenely.

30:27.300 --> 30:34.340
I'm asking to vote to call all the Americans in due assembly before this committee,

30:34.340 --> 30:38.580
which retimes you expedite hearings on. Unless there's some evidence to do against it.

30:39.940 --> 30:42.900
Now, Mr. Chairman, I want to be sure I understand your position.

30:43.620 --> 30:47.620
Mr. Carge accused the army of trying to blackmail him.

30:50.580 --> 30:56.180
He states, I'm convinced they will keep right on trying to blackmail us as long as

30:56.180 --> 31:02.100
shine is in the army. You, this is a memorandum of peace.
