WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
And that he missed the call.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
How did they allow memory?

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
And was never going to forget their dreams?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Yes sir.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
So you say about that before I say to you what I just told you a few minutes ago.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
So when I spoke to Lieutenant Brown, he indicated to me that it was this Colonel

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
who was making the objection.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
And that apparently there was some reason for animus between him and between Shine.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
I then did relate to this particular incident until Lieutenant Brown as I recall it.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
And I know I mentioned it to a state member and it's a rundown on this Colonel's name.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
And I might certainly have said that I remember the name or something like that.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Yes sir.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Well now this young man is here.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Now let's give him statements to call him.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
This young man just arrived.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Did you say it?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Did you say it?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
The Colonel in the middle of the middle had made things very difficult for Pauline Shine.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Did you or did you not say that?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
No sir, it's very cruel.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Now you're anxious, not just?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes sir.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
And then I'm going on to tell you that it's very cruel a conversation with Lieutenant Brown said

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
that as far as he was concerned the thing was just a lot of nonsense

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
but the arrangement has been made.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
He was working out fine, Shine was doing all of his training

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
and he wanted to spend his spare time doing his committee work.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
That was fine with Lieutenant Brown.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
He thought that was just fine.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
But some other people out there did object to us that Colonel Ringman in particular.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
And he said nothing to say anything to Paul about Colonel Ringman.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
He seemed to have different views about the thing.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Mike Benzol, Lieutenant Brown as I recall this incident

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
was about Colonel Ringman.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
And in connection with that, my very well-made statement about a long memory

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
of Lieutenant Brown says I did, I'm sure I did.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm sure he was not misrepresent.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
You sure this young man was not misrepresent?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm sure he was not one of his representatives.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
I think he's trying to recall a conversation just like some time ago with Fancy Tan.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
It did take flight and such and I agree with him on what was said.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I'll read you further from Lieutenant Brown.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Just a moment.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
The line is saying that he now sees...

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Next day, Lieutenant Brown was...

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
He said he's doing no positions in the night, whatever it is, I'd rather do so.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
As I say to this, there is an argument about certain terminology and things that were said.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I say in substance, I did call them.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
The discussion was just as he said, the topic was contained.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
There are few refinements on which we might disagree, which is only logical,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
after the last of this period of time.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
You know of no feeling or no animal that Brown could possibly have against you.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
No sir, he might have. I know.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, he is disheartening. No sir, I certainly have none to attend.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
He was not very, very good.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
But the whole of us, you say, is dumbed out of the cage.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
That these two officers, Colonel and Lieutenant, have not said...

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
When he cooperated with Bay Shanner, not treated him as you thought he should have been treated.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
And that you had a long memory of the reins with lingering your mind indefinitely.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
It was not a form of a threat against the Army.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
You know, sir, certainly was not men in touch, it was not satisfaction,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
it was said in the context which I've explained here.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm sure that Lieutenant Brown did not interpret it as such, sir.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
As I say, my relationship with him was always very close.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
I thought he was... I thought and I think he was a very nice guy.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I want to reach his father from the show, man, Mr. President.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
835-20k. He can always have his death through Lieutenant Brown's murder and up this border of the release from KPB.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
A lot of days, Jack.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
That's what the call to touch on is about, sir.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
The question was whether he was going to do it during the period of time.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Mr. Thavin's to say he was the available for the committee those two days a week.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Or whether he could do it by staying up some nights during the week when he was out there training.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
And I told Lieutenant Brown that he testified here as far as I was concerned.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
They could put him on K.T. every night in the week, all night long.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
And how long he'd problem was to let him work on these reports when he was supposed to do it.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Under the arrangements made by Mr. Thavin.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
I think it's the call whether or not this statement is correct.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Yes, it's the UNIPE first from the testimony of Lieutenant Brown.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
No, sir.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Mr. Colno, that's the particular day you never mentioned the committee work.

04:39.000 --> 04:48.000
He did say that what we wanted to do was private shine from Monday to Friday with DOC as far as he was concerned.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
That's right.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
But he didn't see why private shine had to prove he's beyond funding.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Did you say that, Mr. Colno?

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
So, so what happened, as far as saying what that I didn't hear what they did with them Monday to Friday,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
or they could put him on as much K.T. or keep him up all night, that's true, sir.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
As far as not mentioning committee work, I believe the lieutenant said, mistaken about that,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
every time I talk to him about the shine thing was about committee work.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
I never talked to him about anything else, and I don't think he suggested I fit.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
I don't think I gave him a detailed description of just what work he was supposed to do or anything like that.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But he knew what it was about, sir, and I knew what it was about.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Did you ask me to send him blind or make a statement to me to send him blind to the effect

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
if you didn't see why shine has to prove he's been giving on Sunday, Mr. Colno?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Not so what I said to him, I believe.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Why is that correct?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
What he said to me was not correct.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Well, sir, it's very hard to say that it's not correct.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Where are we?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
We say you didn't say it.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
So, I'm in almost no control of contingency.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Sir, it's so much here a matter of terminology.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I agree completely.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
But the substance of what was in it's land set, I agree that I called them.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
I agreed just what was in him on just what the discussion was about.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
The discussion was about seeking to the arrangement that has been made and was working out fine,

06:08.000 --> 06:16.000
which would allow shine during his note training series on Sunday to work on these reports and do this committee work.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
I did tell the Senate's last, but we would like that arrangement to be with us,

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
that if they wanted to stick them on KT or anything else all night long Monday through Friday,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
that was perfectly okay with that.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
That's unsatisfactory what I said and that was true.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
Do you remember conversations that the Saturn was on January 11th in its home?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
No sir.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
On January 11th?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
January 11th?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
No sir.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
Do you recall that the Adam's testimony, irrespective of conversation you had with him on that day?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I don't recall I said to refresh my recollectionites.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
They were.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I'm meeting from page 2605 of the records.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
The Adam's yesterday.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
We said the Army had promised shy in a commission and they're not nailed up to it.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm talking about a conversation in which Mr. Adam says that you were humiliated.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
A number of Army are in the Steven's double coffee.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
He says it was like today's guy.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Does he ever have such a conversation with Adam?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
On this day he is just asking about Mr. James.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Can I do a real effort?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
No I don't have any recollection of that.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm a question of the commission.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
Mr. Adam says tell me and other people understand that the car and Senator McCarthy,

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
that's it.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Shine were not who he was, who he is and was and did not come from this committee,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
but he would have been given a commission.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
What does that mean that you were talking to Adam about a commission relationship with Shine?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
No sir.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
I think it was just a discussion about something in the fraud that's been picked and what would have happened

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
and what could have happened with Shine.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Why not a guy from the McCarthy commission?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
You were just together talking?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Yes sir.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
You said nothing.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Senator said nothing.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
No, it's hard that nothing about a commission to lose more in Adam's business.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Out of a clear room.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
And said to the commission if he's been given a jet speed.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
No sir, it wasn't.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
It's probably worth not a clear bloom to say.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
It's hard to give you this whole sector.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
We saw Mr. Adam and talked with him.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Day in and day out over a period of months.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
He was with us professionally, socially, and every other way.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Talk them on the phone all of the time.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Just about everybody and everything we knew.

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
All of our mutual friends, people we knew, things were talked about by us at one time on a...

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
You know, a meeting day, sure.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Absolutely.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
I wonder if you wouldn't have said it in just about here.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
It's 26.5 and we've seen you move 8.0.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
You're a late.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Alligators didn't go.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
That's 26.5 and 26.5.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
He says the army is promised shying and commissioning the rest and has not lived up to 8.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Did you say that in his phone?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I'm not a patient sir.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yes sir.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
All on EDHs.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
I think Mr. Adam tonight has discussed the fact that when General Reba came in, he said on the merit.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
On the basis of shying qualifications, the service and the army transport services.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
The work he's done with this committee is business experience, university degree and everything else.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
There was no doubt in the world that he was in the title for a commission.

09:29.000 --> 09:38.000
Mr. Adam fifth element, that the reason he did not get the commission was because they didn't want to be criticized by the hostile press and the shying were not shying.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
One of the penalties of being who he was was that he did not get the commission.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
That is true sir.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
When your answer is in the affirmative, you did say that the army promised shying and commissioning the rest and has not lived up to 8.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
We had no significant inter-alarmity.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
It looked like it's home.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Well we talked to Mr. Adam.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
The last is discussion not once but I remember two or three times but we about why shying did not get a commission.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
It was laid back in the past and Mr. Adam very frankly told us why he did not get a commission.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I know it is next year that now.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Adam said that he said the army of former shying and commissioning them did not live up to 8.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Now, as I understand it, you say that's correct Mr. Adam.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, did that lie to you?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
In order to move along this period.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not trying to move along with him.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
Moving along this, this called what you testimony in your testimony about that period.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
And don't three years to make it true and don't say no in this period.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I think it might my testimony in that period.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
There were two or three occasions when the reason that shying did not get a commission were discussed with Mr. Adam.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
In those discussions, Mr. Adam made it, we've missed Mr. Adam made it very clear that the reason shying had been turned down was

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
before the who he was and the fact that he came from this committee.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I know those discussions did take place.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
I can't say, sir, that's in the context in which you give it,

11:07.000 --> 11:15.000
that I or anybody else made a special issue out of saying to Mr. Adam that's back in July.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
They should have given shying and commission and didn't give them a commission.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
Certainly, what was mentioned until the three occasions in the form of talk about an event long since then.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And I agree with that, sir.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Yes.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I do not recall it January 11th.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Mr. Adam, my questions in Mr. Adam's was,

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
they extend you a new very serious little call to him that he's been playing the Army of Given Shines.

11:42.000 --> 11:52.000
And the Adam's in response to that said that you said the Army of Thomas Shining commission and the Mothless Upcade was a number call.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Exactly.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It's curiously that the wiring crew are left in the same conversation.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I bet that he's not from there not.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I'll leave this January 11th.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I'll leave this January 11th.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I'll leave this January 11th.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
The best thing I can give you is what I have to do.

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
That there was this discussion between Mr. Adam and us on two or three occasions about what it happens about the commission.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
We never asked him to get Shining commission.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
We never asked to tell him anyway the thing was the close book as far as we were concerned.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
But why the Army of Thomas Shining commission?

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, by the word Thomas, I say sir, the general reason that the first time he came in,

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
when he heard Shining's call of vacation, he didn't hesitate to touch before he said,

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
yes, there's no doubt about it.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
He isn't siloed for commission.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
And you consider the fact that Shining was not given the commission,

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
and he just did the Shining and Mr. Cohn, I would say sir, sir.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yes.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
I would say what?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yes.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Did you consider him a double call?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I would say, sir.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Did you say to General, I just wanted to give you what the fact was.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
General Lee, a man comes in and says on the merit he is entitled for it.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Then he doesn't get it.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
What do you want to call about a double call?

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
They change a sign in justice or whatever you want to call it, sir.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
I don't know.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
They got to wait half.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
Adam's father says that he's a lady with the comments of New York assignments for Shining

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and there's not news up to it.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I'm January 11th.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
What do you think about that, sir?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
No, sir.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.240
I say as you go on and read about this business about Shining from the weeknight of the

13:29.240 --> 13:30.240
Elevatority, changing.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.240
You're changing?

13:31.240 --> 13:33.240
What a weekend constipated and all that.

13:33.240 --> 13:37.240
That of those things from south only worked with Scott between the two of them and between

13:37.240 --> 13:38.240
us.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.240
Yes, sir.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.240
I would agree with that.

13:40.240 --> 13:47.240
I would agree that you make the statement that you've been promised a New York assignment

13:47.240 --> 13:50.240
for Shining, is the Army not the case that they've been using?

13:50.240 --> 13:51.240
No, I'm not.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.240
No, I'm not going to say so on or forth.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.240
You're denied.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.240
I'll take it.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.240
I'll take it.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.240
I'll take it.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.240
I'll take it.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.240
I'll take it.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.240
I have to know the subject now.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.240
Is the New Marais Justice Commission?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.240
Yes, sir.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.240
And you just filed about that.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.240
When he says number two he is.

14:06.240 --> 14:11.240
Let you claim that Shining has been a promise to New York assignments and it not made

14:11.240 --> 14:12.240
work for that another.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.240
A different subject?

14:13.240 --> 14:14.240
Yes, sir.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.240
What about that now?

14:15.240 --> 14:16.240
I'm sorry.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.240
Now I was saying that that's inaccurate.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.240
That's inaccurate.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.240
Yes, sir.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.240
You denied that statement.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.240
Yes, I was saying that's inaccurate.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.240
Number three.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.240
Let's say that they have a handful of Shining weeks not available to these.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.240
What do you say about that?

14:28.240 --> 14:29.240
I give the reenactment.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.240
You're not accurate, sir.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.240
That's accurate.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.240
All right.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.240
They have.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.240
Yes, sir.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.240
I'll have them done that.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.240
General Lyon made an arrangement.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.240
Mr. Adam, put it up with General Lyon.

14:39.240 --> 14:44.240
General Lyon made an arrangement whereby spare members can go down and see it.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.240
On the post and all that and put a conference room if they had to fall home.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.240
That was satisfactory.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.240
That's the care of the problem.

14:49.240 --> 14:54.240
The next number is that we will require Shining to meet Saturday morning.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.240
He did 50 years with the double call.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.240
That's that weekend discussion, yes sir.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.240
All right.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.240
Is that accurate?

15:00.240 --> 15:01.240
Yes, sir.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.240
We discussed the changing in the terms of the weekend.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.240
What's Mr. Adam?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.240
All right.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.240
That is X number.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.240
That's the 60K statement of November 13th.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.240
He's saying that up to him, man.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.240
On January 11th.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.240
So I'm not saying anything.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.240
Wait a minute.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.240
I'm asking you now, sir.

15:18.240 --> 15:25.240
Is he waiting what do you, what do you claim he told him up to the numbers of the conference?

15:25.240 --> 15:28.240
I'm not the 60K statement of November 13th.

15:28.240 --> 15:32.240
The 60K was referred to perviscuitly and our report model was the double call.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.240
Did you say that?

15:34.240 --> 15:36.240
Sir, maybe I don't understand.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.240
Are you if he did I in a specific conversation on January 11th?

15:39.240 --> 15:40.240
Or on the other side?

15:40.240 --> 15:44.240
Yes, I certainly might have, I certainly suggest Mr. Adam.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.240
The secretary's statement of November 13th.

15:47.240 --> 15:52.240
I told Mr. Adam that I saw this statement was unfortunate because it was untrue.

15:52.240 --> 15:57.240
I told him that the statement on FBNR I just thought one was untrue.

15:58.240 --> 16:04.240
I told him that Mr. Seven's statement about why the 30 odd people had been suspended with untrue.

16:04.240 --> 16:10.240
And I certainly did consider that, sir, to be a holy untrue and inaccurate statement.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.240
And one with which I disagree.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.240
And I did discuss that with both Mr. Adam and Mr. Seven.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.240
And the Mr. Adam said I discussed that.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.240
And what I thought they had been wrong in that.

16:20.240 --> 16:24.240
And I had made untrue statements that Mr. Adam is telling the truth about that, sir.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.240
Yes, and strictly.

16:27.240 --> 16:33.240
He's humiliated, fixed, and late double causes, but he turned double causes.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.240
And now he says he stated on January 11th.

16:36.240 --> 16:41.240
This long repeat kept Gordon was a fixed double cause.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.240
No, sir.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.240
Definitely impossible to be unjustly scolding, sir.

16:45.240 --> 16:49.240
As I can say, is this the discussion about Sam Gordon.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.240
Mr. Adam's gave a different verse on the length of time.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.240
Shine would be down there on a number of occasions.

16:55.240 --> 17:01.240
I don't believe, sir, that I ever said is the change version is constituted as double cause or anything like that.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.240
And on his subject, Mr. Jenkins, I would go further.

17:04.240 --> 17:13.240
If Mr. Adam was listening here, things which I have discussed with him, where I thought that, in my opinion, he was maybe with the wrong opinion.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.240
He was quite wrong.

17:15.240 --> 17:21.240
And if some things which should come under the heading of things will be unfair and unjust by certainly.

17:21.240 --> 17:26.240
What if we counted what they were trying to do to General Watten?

17:26.240 --> 17:31.240
I would have recounted a large number of other things which I thought and still think.

17:31.240 --> 17:38.240
Has been handled by Mr. Adam in a way that was not fair and not accurate.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.240
So I would say that the flip is probably incomplete.

17:41.240 --> 17:48.240
And with Sam, in the funny case, the tragedy of falling into the home, the serious conversation that those two states had achieved,

17:48.240 --> 17:54.240
that you were quite animated to use your expression.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.240
Yes, sir.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.240
And use that impurity and unseem language.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.240
Is that true or not?

17:58.240 --> 18:00.240
I don't even remember the conversations.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
I remember the conversations.

18:01.240 --> 18:06.240
On the... I do remember discussing these things which we'd gone down the list about, was Mr. Adam.

18:06.240 --> 18:10.240
I can add to it. I think he was on the conservative side and mentioned.

18:10.240 --> 18:14.240
So we had animated discussions about what they were trying to do to General Watten.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.240
We had a discussion about the pile-stripping situation.

18:17.240 --> 18:26.240
We had discussions about a number of other things in which they were animated discussions and disagreements between us.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.240
There were a lot of things.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.240
The start felt very long period of time.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.240
The start here.

18:31.240 --> 18:36.240
What happens when Mr. Adam told you this morning was like, you go, we'll see you in the school?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.240
I believe I've related that, sir.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.240
If you want me to do that again, I will.

18:39.240 --> 18:43.240
Well, I like to get this one grip, given the type of ice cube about that.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.240
Here to four, and it's made these that I have.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.240
Yes, sir.

18:46.240 --> 18:51.240
This out of this, it can be used as the changes were, now I'm the one that he was going over to, he's in him out.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.240
Didn't happen that way, sir.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.240
Didn't happen that way.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.240
No, sir.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.240
How did it happen?

18:55.240 --> 18:59.240
Mr. Adam came over to see Mr. Carr and me.

18:59.240 --> 19:05.240
I believe he fixed the date of January 14th, and I have no reason to argue with that, sir.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.240
A lot of things, just about everything, was talked about.

19:08.240 --> 19:13.240
The personal things, the law partnerships, a lot of other things.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.240
Stopping the investigation of Monmouth, not crawling in the members of the loyalty board.

19:17.240 --> 19:22.240
We went out for lunch, we came back, there was more talk, it was entirely pleasant throughout.

19:22.240 --> 19:32.240
It was during that visit, which Mr. Adam's case has, that he throughout this business about sending him sending Cheyenne over to the city.

19:32.240 --> 19:37.240
And I think, sir, I might respectfully suggest a few in the committee.

19:37.240 --> 19:42.240
For example, examine the context in which that would say to a regarded as the most unusual fate.

19:42.240 --> 19:47.240
When Mr. Adam was to come out and make, on that occasion, one not supported by the fact,

19:47.240 --> 19:52.240
and one which I think clearly indicates the process for which he was making the statement at that time.

19:52.240 --> 19:58.240
We know the Cheyenne was going to go to Cancors, we're going to get training as a, the ID agent,

19:58.240 --> 20:01.240
so there's some of these intelligence schools.

20:01.240 --> 20:06.240
And that's his overseas show, it's probably coming sometime later.

20:06.240 --> 20:15.240
And Mr. Adam threw that in right then there at this point, I think, sir, as an example of how he could get met.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.240
And I think the record fairs that out.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.240
I went to the entrance because I think this is an important point.

20:20.240 --> 20:24.240
I showed you the inconsistencies between Mr. Adam and testimony before this committee.

20:24.240 --> 20:28.240
When he said that this overseas business just came out of a thin air,

20:28.240 --> 20:33.240
but just brought up by him out of a thin air, and his original charge in which he admits,

20:33.240 --> 20:37.240
coupled on that visit, which he initiated, in which he admits,

20:37.240 --> 20:44.240
coupled the statement about Cheyenne going over these, with a discussion about the fourth month investigation.

20:44.240 --> 20:48.240
And I think his original statement is the true one.

20:48.240 --> 20:55.240
You would recall Mr. Cohn that seems to be satisfied that he's that he's shining over his feet,

20:55.240 --> 20:58.240
even through a spectriscatier higher than the state of the state.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.240
Did you know?

20:59.240 --> 21:00.240
No, sir.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.240
Did you see anything like that, Mr. Cohn?

21:02.240 --> 21:04.240
No, sir, and I thought that my recollection is right there.

21:04.240 --> 21:11.240
Not, and I thought that Mr. Cohn was sitting there the whole time, and he said, I did not.

21:11.240 --> 21:16.240
When you say that such a statement on the part of Mr. Adam,

21:16.240 --> 21:18.240
it's really efficient that he's imagination.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.240
There has no foundation whatsoever in fact.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.240
I would say, sir, he is in the state.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.240
He's in the state.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.240
Yes sir.

21:24.240 --> 21:28.240
On when he says a say, is your check in?

21:28.240 --> 21:33.240
On page 26, so it's 6, so it's 6, so it's 6, so it's 6.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.240
Yes sir, that is right.

21:35.240 --> 21:39.240
I ask him what would happen to Cheyenne going over these duties.

21:39.240 --> 21:42.240
He responded with bigger and more.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.240
Even Mr. Cohn is the army.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.240
You say I didn't have Mr. Cohn?

21:47.240 --> 21:49.240
I said, I have no recollection of having said that.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.240
I checked with Mr. Cohn, who was sitting right there, and he said, I did not say it.

21:52.240 --> 21:56.240
On the school, I'm not asking you what somebody else said.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.240
The shoes did it, it did not say.

21:59.240 --> 22:02.240
As I am the civil moment of gold, you said that did not happen?

22:02.240 --> 22:03.240
Yes sir.

22:03.240 --> 22:08.240
And as I am the civilized to sponsor my procedure, you have no recollection of that.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.240
I don't recall that having happened.

22:10.240 --> 22:14.240
I don't remember saying that, and I have checked with the only other person in this world who was there.

22:14.240 --> 22:20.240
And he said, likewise, he does not remember it being said, and does not remember it having happened.

22:20.240 --> 22:24.240
As we get offended Mr. Cohn, you're not here tonight either of your own knowledge.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.240
Sir, I can come pretty close to that.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.240
I know what they are.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.240
That's pretty close as a relative to us.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.240
Sometimes you mean to mean to mean to a whole lot of them.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.240
Sure.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.240
And sometimes you'll several feet mean nothing.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.240
Sure.

22:36.240 --> 22:49.240
I must say now, as I get your testimony, you neither admit me to ni, saying that, say, Stevens is through the Secretary of the Army of the Civil War time.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.240
And I was over-seeking.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.240
You know that's not how it's told.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.240
No, so I think I go much further than that.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.240
I've given it to you sir.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.240
It's my best recollection and my recollection is a fairly good one.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.240
That I did not make those statements.

23:00.240 --> 23:04.240
I told you I've checked with the only other person on this earth who was there.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.240
But he says I did not make those statements, sir.

23:06.240 --> 23:12.240
And I can tell you under my old tears that I never, I never threatened to wreck the Army.

23:12.240 --> 23:17.240
That I'm sure Mr. Adams never believed the two seconds that I threatened to wreck the Army.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.240
But I'm sure he knows I could not wreck the Army.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.240
That the whole thing is just a little bit ridiculous.

23:23.240 --> 23:30.240
So now, as we get it to keep the night, you affirm it.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.240
I say you've got no recollection.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.240
Now, let's get it from the side.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.240
That's number one.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.240
I have pretty good recollection.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.240
Number two, I remember that day.

23:39.240 --> 23:44.240
Number three, I do not remember saying any of those things the way Mr. Adams has them.

23:44.240 --> 23:48.240
And number four, I've checked with the only other person who was there on that occasion.

23:48.240 --> 23:52.240
And he says my recollection is correct that I did not make those statements.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.240
Now, you're telling us what must you think, how to say it?

23:55.240 --> 23:56.240
Yes, sir.

23:56.240 --> 24:01.240
And I will know in the committee wants to know for the benefit of this recollection, Mr. I am clone-said.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.240
Yes, sir.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.240
And as I get it now, you're saying that you have no recollection at it?

24:05.240 --> 24:06.240
No, sir.

24:06.240 --> 24:09.240
I say I do not recall having said that.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.240
That's what I get to answer.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.240
Now, you don't recall having said it.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.240
But you don't deny.

24:14.240 --> 24:17.240
So I'm saying I sure I did not say that.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.240
I am sure I'm not.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.240
Now, you're saying you did not say this, cool?

24:20.240 --> 24:21.240
Yes, sir.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.240
I say I assure that I did not make that statement.

24:23.240 --> 24:33.240
And I am sure that Mr. Adams and anybody else with any sense that Mr. Adams has a lot of sense could not ever believe that I was threatening directly on me or that I could correct the army.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.240
I say so that statement is ridiculous.

24:35.240 --> 24:40.240
I'm talking about the season 2 secretaries in that equally ridiculous statement.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
I know two.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.240
Yes, sir.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.240
Equally ridiculous and unsure.

24:43.240 --> 24:48.240
I should not call the President of the United States to remove Mr. Steven's secretaries of the Army.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.240
Mr. Coleman, I pay to you.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.240
Strike that.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.240
Strike that.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.240
Take the test to fight our defense comrades, Heidi.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.240
Yes, sir.

25:12.240 --> 25:18.240
At that time, you were questioned about the many words that was done by Mr. Shine.

25:18.240 --> 25:21.240
I think he was inducted in the Army on the room of the third.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.240
Yes, sir.

25:22.240 --> 25:26.240
And about the many words that he did tie it on the room of the third.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.240
Yes, sir.

25:27.240 --> 25:34.240
And if he was to testify that the subsequent in the room of the third, I think he was inducted in the Army.

25:34.240 --> 25:41.240
And how he was on these various pages, the leaves of options, his indicated shippings memorandum.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.240
That's not correct.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.240
He does not hear me.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.240
I'll have you correct this.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.240
What is correct there is this.

25:48.240 --> 25:56.240
I might say that neither I nor Dave Shine or anyone in that state as a matter of practice goes around dictating a lot of memorandum.

25:56.240 --> 26:03.240
I thought, sir, that what Shine did when Staggs was thoughtful and when he was all thrown to a number of categories.

26:03.240 --> 26:10.240
One of the things he did was to clarify and turn all the information which he might have in his head,

26:10.240 --> 26:18.240
which he might be able to get by reference to papers which we showed him concerning witnesses and situations on which he had worked when he was with the committee.

26:18.240 --> 26:30.240
I also told you, sir, that he did a good deal of work on the interim, the three interim reports which I mentioned of the subcommittee and on certain sections of the annual report of the subcommittee.

26:30.240 --> 26:37.240
That is the substance to what he did during that very limited period of time that he had all three of his army training sets.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.240
And that's what I told you that he did, sir, and that is when he did so.

26:41.240 --> 26:46.240
Mr. Cohn hearing this time that he resolved on these pages, he said,

26:46.240 --> 26:48.240
Did he take any memorandum or whatever?

26:48.240 --> 26:53.240
It's just work on these three interim reports to which he referred.

26:53.240 --> 26:57.240
I don't think he himself did say anything, sir, in the way of memorandum and nothing.

26:57.240 --> 27:08.240
Did you or any member of the staff dictate any memorandum as a result of your conversations with the shindering these leads of absences or pites?

27:08.240 --> 27:09.240
That's not a problem, sir.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.240
That's not a problem, sir.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.240
Yes, sir.

27:11.240 --> 27:15.240
And we, I might say, we will have available to testify, staff members who have talked to them,

27:15.240 --> 27:21.240
and I assume they're checking their files and we'll be able to show you whether or not there are any memorandum which they prepared,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.240
an information which Dave Shind gave them.

27:23.240 --> 27:29.240
Mr. Jenkins, on that point, a typical thing would be we would ask him about a certain situation,

27:29.240 --> 27:33.240
one which occurred to me very clearly with the situation concerning this major.

27:33.240 --> 27:40.240
Major, well, I know if I had to mention this major, this major, Dave Shind, from Dave Shind and Handle before he went in the army,

27:40.240 --> 27:44.240
was given us some pretty important information which it never meant to us to write.

27:44.240 --> 27:49.240
I thought the Dave about that information when it became an issue, some time in November,

27:49.240 --> 27:51.240
send them a coffee tour from about it.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.240
I did not make any memorandum about what Dave told me.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.240
I know the son of it, isn't it?

27:56.240 --> 28:01.240
I know that the same thing came up again in January when this major committed suicide.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.240
The FBI asked me about it.

28:03.240 --> 28:11.240
They knew that Shind had been in touch with this man, and I communicated with Shind again and rechecked my recollection of what Shind had told us.

28:11.240 --> 28:14.240
But I don't think I'm an education I made any memorandum, sir.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.240
And I don't think the son of it is.

28:16.240 --> 28:19.240
On the other hand, you do have these reports.

28:19.240 --> 28:23.240
And I can't tell you that there are no notes by Shind and things like that because I know that there are.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.240
I know he worked on these reports.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.240
I know we have the end product of what he produced.

28:28.240 --> 28:33.240
And we might have parts of the drafts and things going on all the time.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.240
That is cool. You produced a positive end product.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.240
Yes, sir.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.240
How was Dave Shind accomplish?

28:39.240 --> 28:42.240
I think he went in the army on the Wimbledon Third.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.240
Yes.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.240
In your testimony, life's life is in you not.

28:45.240 --> 28:48.240
And that's consistently the least three interim reports.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.240
Yes, sir.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.240
I'm nothing else.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.240
So, I'll have to answer.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.240
Yes, sir.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.240
Well, I'm not in position to judge.

28:55.240 --> 28:58.240
Judge, you sit most of them arrived in the land.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.240
Yes, sir.

28:59.240 --> 29:00.240
Mr. Gomes.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.240
Do there any other evidence?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.240
For documentation.

29:04.240 --> 29:10.240
Reflecting the work of Dave Shind accepts those three documents that you produced, J.L.I. by me.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.240
Yes, sir.

29:11.240 --> 29:14.240
Oh, I think that we found we did not keep them, fortunately.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.240
So, we did not keep all the drafts.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.240
But let us delete documents.

29:18.240 --> 29:23.240
We do not drafts or fragments of drafts of some of these reports.

29:23.240 --> 29:32.240
Some were dictated by Dave Shind before he went in, and after he went in, we have some notes which were made by him on drafts of those reports.

29:32.240 --> 29:36.240
I think while he was down at four six specifically, it was beginning in January.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.240
A few things along those lines, sir.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.240
And you have my sworn testimony as what he says to what he did.

29:41.240 --> 29:51.240
And you will have the sworn testimony under Altier, and subject to cross examination of other staff members who talked to him on the question of what he did in that very limited time.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.240
We're talking about when he was doing his army training at the same time.

29:55.240 --> 30:02.240
Now, what is this modern understanding, life's strategy that between Friday and Tuesday morning this morning?

30:02.240 --> 30:15.240
New and other staff members in your employee needs, second days, to not overuse, were to set the files and produce the evidence this morning in any documentation of any additional work done by Shind.

30:15.240 --> 30:31.240
So, I think what you answered to do was to propose for the committee work done by Shind, or things worked done by Shind in any stage from the time he went with the committee to July to time he went on the army from the time he went on the army up until the first time.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.240
You said make that direction and answer me for the other things.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.240
Are you prepared to do it now?

30:36.240 --> 30:38.240
Yes, sir, I am.

30:38.240 --> 30:42.240
To produce additional documents, data, and power of the Shind.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.240
Yes, sir.

30:43.240 --> 30:47.240
Our other members of the staff members who are involved with their conversations with Shind.

30:47.240 --> 30:50.240
Yes, sir, I see the details now. It's cool.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.240
Thank you.

30:51.240 --> 30:58.240
Tomorrow, we're searching for the records and while we have this opportunity, let's return to our studios across the country to permit our station to identify themselves.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.240
This is ABC Television Network.

31:02.240 --> 31:08.240
Our resulting matter for 15 minutes by our moment of search, we could proceed at 30 seconds.

31:08.240 --> 31:12.240
We should be here in two minutes.

31:12.240 --> 31:17.240
Maybe we haven't had the many of you thought of asking about it someone when I'm staying together.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.240
I'll proceed at 30 seconds.

31:22.240 --> 31:27.240
I'm asking you to come. This is a two-a-feet minute meeting.

31:27.240 --> 31:30.240
It's now 10 to 15 minutes. Let's get back.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
Fine.
