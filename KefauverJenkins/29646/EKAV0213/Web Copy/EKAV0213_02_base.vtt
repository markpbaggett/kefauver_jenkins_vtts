WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
We therefore been concluded.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.680
Council was interrogating Mr. Cohn about the production of the data and documents and

00:14.680 --> 00:18.160
worksheets which have been recruited by the committee.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.160
It's emanating from Mr. Shire.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.160
I see a bottle of something has arrived.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.160
I presume it's a material.

00:24.160 --> 00:31.160
So, a pencil definition would make it continue with the interrogation of Mr. Cohn.

00:31.160 --> 00:36.160
Mr. Cohn, are you not prepared to answer my right question and to produce the documents

00:36.160 --> 00:39.160
to which I refer to the German and just your first?

00:39.160 --> 00:40.160
Pretty much so, sir.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.160
Will you now do so?

00:41.160 --> 00:43.160
Consider it done in a second.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.160
I would like to make a brief statement of the collection of this production.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.160
By now, Mr. Bocks, in front of you, contain those documents.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
Workheets.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.160
Yes, sir.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.160
The end product is the work of Mr. Shire.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.160
It does, sir.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.160
And I'd like to make an explanation.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.160
Do you wish?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.160
I may.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.160
What we did was it's first of all, this was all of the memorials of a weekend.

01:03.160 --> 01:07.160
Plus, although we could keep our words to the committee enough as much of this material as we could

01:07.160 --> 01:09.160
hear this morning.

01:09.160 --> 01:13.160
We made some members of the staff work during process a weekend.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.160
We have tried to get together here.

01:16.160 --> 01:25.160
I could be able to plot the same sign, well, dictated, worked on while he was with the committee

01:25.160 --> 01:29.160
and the business secretary left the committee.

01:29.160 --> 01:33.160
I sometimes say this is a complete reduction.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.160
I told you there are probably a thousand files.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.160
We haven't gone through them all.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.160
There's probably a lot more, somewhat more.

01:41.160 --> 01:50.160
Another thing I have to tell you, sir, is that the name of confidential informants do appear in the various of these documents.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.160
And various of these documents there are no names of confidential informants.

01:54.160 --> 01:58.160
And some there are names of people who are confidential informants.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.160
Have you figured this out?

01:59.160 --> 02:04.160
I have not done that, so I have not been able to in the sign room.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.160
I want to make one more statement.

02:05.160 --> 02:10.160
So, by May, there's also some information here in which Shire worked and got some other agency.

02:10.160 --> 02:16.160
Which is security information and so it's denominated by other agencies.

02:16.160 --> 02:21.160
In other words, I noticed some stuff with the CIA turn over to him.

02:21.160 --> 02:25.160
And they sent that confidential security information.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.160
So that material does have a security classification.

02:28.160 --> 02:33.160
There is some other material, I think, some basic often material, since the Shire addresses to him,

02:33.160 --> 02:37.160
which does have a security classification.

02:38.160 --> 02:43.160
There are names of informants and informants with these disclosed information.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.160
Which this committee has with the awards.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.160
Some of these names were published.

02:48.160 --> 02:56.160
There's a good deal of material, which does not come under that prohibition, which would not reveal the names of informants or concerns and informants.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.160
Or have already been exposed and have already testified.

03:01.160 --> 03:08.160
But I would say, sir, this is the first job we get to play it in the limited period of time which we have.

03:08.160 --> 03:17.160
The chief of the Chair, Justice, and we have been deemed this material with the understanding that the names of the informants will not be made public.

03:17.160 --> 03:26.160
And I suggest we'll have to have some kind of a screening process to delete those names in the events of Mr. Wilk or anybody on the committee.

03:27.160 --> 03:39.160
The first part of this material, into the public records, and the Shire would also like to suggest that in that screening process we delete the names of people who are accused of different,

03:39.160 --> 03:50.160
the malignations of various times that we have in a investigation pathway too, because there's no need to bring in the names of a lot of people who might only turn out to be innocent.

03:51.160 --> 04:08.160
The first part of that, at least, this material is available to the members of the committee, which is available to Mr. Wilk and I think he understands the terms under which it was received as there would be no disposition on Mr. Wilk's part of the names of informants and any public records in my right must be lost.

04:09.160 --> 04:15.160
I am to go into questions about the findings, I am to try not to say Mr. Wilk's correct about my understanding, and it's correct I think so.

04:15.160 --> 04:22.160
But he wants to find out his last work was done by Mr. Shire rather than to try to put a lot of names to people in public records.

04:23.160 --> 04:38.160
I cannot see that I would have any need to put names in the public records, but I do not wish at this time thinking of complete ignorance of what is in the box that I would include in him, but no, my point is Mr. Wilk, is you looking at these names?

04:39.160 --> 04:48.160
I am looking at the records which should be made part of the committee material which you do so with the only standing in this before any names, the place in the public records that would take somebody out in.

04:48.160 --> 04:55.160
Sir, I am not standing with Mr. Sonamant, the legitimate blue part, can I write a new one?

04:55.160 --> 04:57.160
Yes, but could I say one thing more?

04:58.160 --> 05:07.160
What I am particularly interested in is the work project of David Shire after he was inducted in the army, that is what I wish to see.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.160
That is not I take it as segregated or can be segregated.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.160
Sir, if I may, I have something to have to say here.

05:15.160 --> 05:22.160
There is some material in here concerning the name of the form and the other things which speaking for myself, I don't think Mr. Walter would have seen.

05:23.160 --> 05:30.160
I have no objection to the chair thing if it belongs to the committee. Committee information and every member of the committee certainly ought to see it.

05:30.160 --> 05:39.160
And Mr. Jenkins, I think there might be some things which Mr. Wilk does not want to see. There might be some things with concern.

05:39.160 --> 05:48.160
Matters are concerning the investigation of some of Mr. Wilk's clients and things along those lines, I am sure the committee was not wanting him to go on to the wall.

05:48.160 --> 06:02.160
The second point is, ten a month, that is about what Mr. Wilk does there for in the very moment it is very short time that Dave Shire had to do some of this work when he was throwing his train in all day long at the same time.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.160
Then for six, the bulk of the work he did was on those reports.

06:06.160 --> 06:13.160
And there is some information bearing on that which I know will be of Mr. Wilk in here among the documents.

06:13.160 --> 06:23.160
I have explained to Mr. Wilk on Friday, sir. Dave Shire did not come down to Washington at all. He did not seek aid to our sonarguerfoot down here, sir.

06:23.160 --> 06:33.160
For a dino, he did not seek aid in memorandum. That is not the way it went. There was a very limited thing. He did a lot of work.

06:33.160 --> 06:44.160
I am finishing up these reports. I have given Mr. Wilk's reports in front of the forum. He is reading in the bathroom. We do have some notes and a few drafts, which I think will be of help in Mr. Wilk.

06:44.160 --> 06:54.160
But I do want to make a clear search, but in the very limited period of time that Shire had while he was down to four thick, doing a training at the same time.

06:54.160 --> 07:04.160
I covered the categories of what he was working on, sir. And the rest is not that much more.

07:04.160 --> 07:15.160
All right, Mr. Macons, I think you are understanding the terms and the written here receiving material that the committee has taken as to what does go into the public record.

07:15.160 --> 07:26.160
Mr. Wilk is made available beyond the personnel of the committee of his staff. Mr. Durin is a very well-versed officer here at the Office of the Office.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.160
Mr. Durin, Mr. Wilk.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.160
Mr. Durin, are you ready?

07:31.160 --> 07:46.160
Yes, sir. I am ready. I am ready. I will puzzle Mr. Cohn's reference to my client. I have only a kind of a modest collection of them, presumably.

07:46.160 --> 08:01.160
They might all be listening on the television and they wouldn't crowd the audience much. I am not a lawyer of any client who were investigated by a lawyer who had any child by home witness.

08:01.160 --> 08:10.160
I wish you would say something here, but thank you. I am feeling better than they must have done so much.

08:10.160 --> 08:23.160
I thought maybe it might fall off, and I will apologize if it works. I thought I clearly indicated to the committee what I referred to as information dealing with the investigation of the communist infiltration in the army.

08:23.160 --> 08:32.160
A few of the facts are that he represents the Secretary of the Army and the Council that the part I did not serve is completely fair to any of your clients and private practice.

08:32.160 --> 08:38.160
I know that one of them who happens to be a good friend of mine, sir, and I have no intention of trying to get his business open.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.160
I feel better.

08:41.160 --> 08:49.160
Mr. Cohn, you ready to make that be? Do I recognize?

08:49.160 --> 08:58.160
Mr. Cohn's chairman of the field of practice made subpoena with serve upon me and the chairman of the previous chair by the chairman of the league.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.160
The chairman of the chair was produced without the benefit of the subpoena. It has been just an excellent injection.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.160
I'm curious if the subpoena and the daughter can get out of this incident.

09:06.160 --> 09:10.160
I've been tracking this for a long time since you've done a few questions about this material.

09:10.160 --> 09:19.160
Just to put it in my pocket of one, as we know that this will do it, it will do it.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.160
According to the Memorial Day, all of it, yes.

09:22.160 --> 09:27.160
We have a bit of time to go through this material last night.

09:27.160 --> 09:31.160
Well, so I went about, we've been in some time on it for a while.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.160
And I'm a slave for the record.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.160
I was the way I'm being vacationally, all of it myself.

09:39.160 --> 09:45.160
I think I talked to you twice before and talked to you for a few months, but I know some.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.160
I was going to know a little more about this material.

09:48.160 --> 09:57.160
So just contain the names of any informants who came to me, give me an introduction.

09:57.160 --> 10:04.160
Are you saying that to you personally as I'm talking to the day China or my father someone on the set,

10:04.160 --> 10:06.160
I don't know, sir.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.160
No, you don't know, no, no.

10:08.160 --> 10:19.160
Well, I can think of some who I know spoke both to you and today China.

10:19.160 --> 10:26.160
So what's the chairman I'm going to order the council not to turn the material over?

10:26.160 --> 10:29.160
It will be available to Mr. Wilson, until I have a chance to go through it.

10:29.160 --> 10:33.160
Like the minute, like the Jenkins, both there.

10:33.160 --> 10:38.160
The super-tunner service will be available only to Mr. Jenkins and to the chairman, yes,

10:38.160 --> 10:42.160
but I will not make that available to not order you not to be available to Mr. Wilson,

10:42.160 --> 10:45.160
but I have a chance to go through it.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.160
Oh, yes, the producer.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.160
And that's the producer materials.

10:50.160 --> 10:54.160
I'm ready to produce material out of master produce.

10:54.160 --> 11:02.160
I may say that it took the Mr. Steven's Mr. Adams about six months to get a few names for him.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.160
I think maybe we should have more than just the least.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.160
All we can to go through this.

11:08.160 --> 11:13.160
Now, I'd like to ask the chairman's old ones to have at least another half a day.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.160
So I can keep the card or through the material and see what we have here.

11:17.160 --> 11:21.160
We should have some clients with the recourse of the chair.

11:21.160 --> 11:26.160
The chair is able to announce that the material is being accepted by the council and by the committee.

11:26.160 --> 11:30.160
It will not be released to people beyond the committee staff and the committee members.

11:30.160 --> 11:33.160
What about the committee action?

11:33.160 --> 11:48.160
As chairman of the committee, I have no rights to turn material over this committee without commission of the commission of the committee.

11:48.160 --> 11:54.160
I will call on me and think about the committee after we get through the legs.

11:54.160 --> 12:00.160
The master has anything to say if time is done, any work is performed.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.160
Any notes is made.

12:02.160 --> 12:08.160
Part of me should be available to Mr. Wells to everything on this committee.

12:08.160 --> 12:13.160
However, I am a praise today.

12:13.160 --> 12:20.160
We'll have to refuse to turn files over to the...

12:20.160 --> 12:27.160
I'm going to consider Mr. Owing-Hot-A-Vim until I get permission of the committee.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.160
I'm just getting testimony on the committee for that purpose.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.160
Committee, please.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.160
The committee committee will have a meeting with the committee for Jenkins in response to our recourse.

12:37.160 --> 12:41.160
The issue is a little bit too pity, but it's a shame I understand.

12:41.160 --> 12:51.160
I made a record indication of the month that we are dealing with producing two self-surance who counsel Jenkins, the material,

12:51.160 --> 12:56.160
much of the material we can assemble, call for five minutes of Jenkins on Friday afternoon.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.160
Where are we going?

12:57.160 --> 12:58.160
We're going to go to the zone.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.160
We're going to go to the zone.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
We're going to go to the zone.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.160
We're going to go to the zone.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.160
We're going to go to the zone.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.160
We're going to go to the zone.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.160
Please listen to me, Kathy.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.160
I'm going to go.

13:08.160 --> 13:15.160
What I understand is, are these files in the custody of the district committee or are there not?

13:15.160 --> 13:16.160
I don't know.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.160
I came to the office all the way.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.160
Chair would assume that they have been found.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.160
No, I'm not sure.

13:21.160 --> 13:27.160
I want to know, are these files of the district committee or the time or are they not?

13:27.160 --> 13:30.160
When we are in the room, we're in the room.

13:30.160 --> 13:35.160
The chair would assume, and the basis of the record, which you have already told us I,

13:35.160 --> 13:39.160
which he has been telling us about, has been turned over with the request of you,

13:39.160 --> 13:45.160
as many counsels as Jenkins and have been delivered to him by the Chicago.

13:45.160 --> 13:50.160
This is so far from the director.

13:50.160 --> 13:57.160
I have a fairly repeated way that I would not make available.

13:57.160 --> 14:02.160
The name of any informants is any of my informants now.

14:02.160 --> 14:16.160
It's a matter of Mr. Cheyenne, Mr. Cohn, as things are informants that he was to be turned over to the council committee.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.160
I assume that you've talked to him of Cheyenne about this.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.160
That's one good, however.

14:20.160 --> 14:28.160
With now 12 p.m., I would like to have the new knowledge discuss this a lot of evidence here.

14:28.160 --> 14:34.160
But Mr. Cohn, the meantime, I know, and for the chair of the commission, consider these.

14:34.160 --> 14:38.160
Charles, in the custody of the...

14:38.160 --> 14:40.160
I want to talk to him up to getting something.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.160
Sir, I'm sending a month from my day of claimant.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.160
I have thought to private chained about this over the weekend, sir.

14:47.160 --> 14:54.160
The file will contain the names of certain informants, certain people's often giving this committee information, sir.

14:54.160 --> 14:59.160
And I would like to say that both the Cheyenne and I and I play well with their members now,

14:59.160 --> 15:11.160
that the successful failure of this committee, sir, depends upon our authority to get information concerning the mishandling or laxity for inefficiency and the executive branch of government,

15:11.160 --> 15:13.160
because that's why this committee is set up, sir.

15:13.160 --> 15:18.160
And we must get that information from people in the executive, but we don't get it.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.160
We're out of business.

15:19.160 --> 15:27.160
And we have a specific mandate under the legislative re-organization act to look into laxity and mishandling of situations in the executive,

15:27.160 --> 15:32.160
most of the time, sir, you can get that information only from people who work in the executive.

15:32.160 --> 15:37.160
And we have obtained statements from a large number of people who do work in the executive.

15:37.160 --> 15:46.160
I am no more anxious, sir, to embarrass those people, but to betray their confidence, when it's like a distinguished chairman,

15:46.160 --> 15:48.160
for whom I have the highest respect.

15:48.160 --> 15:53.160
I noticed there in the memorandum of law which means to ground else submitted in support of the Eisenhower Directive,

15:53.160 --> 16:04.160
he has a talk from President Theodore Rolf, who refused to turn information over to a senatorial committee on the ground that that information would give away the name of a man who furnished that information to the government,

16:04.160 --> 16:11.160
and asked that his name be kept sacred, and President Theodore Rolf said that that was a sacred trust.

16:11.160 --> 16:19.160
I regard the information given to this committee, so I people who want to see communists exposed and uncovered as a sacred trust.

16:19.160 --> 16:26.160
And I am the last one who wants to reveal their name, sir, because I understand that now I am producing this material to you, sir,

16:26.160 --> 16:34.160
Mr. Jenkins and to the committee, not to the purpose of destroying these sources of information and revealing the names of these people,

16:34.160 --> 16:44.160
but on the understanding that these names of confidential informants will not be revealed, but that the material will be made otherwise available to you, sir.

16:44.160 --> 16:51.160
And the biggest kind of material we have to do is run that page and we shall have a meeting on the floor.

16:51.160 --> 16:57.160
Mr. Jenkins, I would like to ask you a question, Mr. Jenkins, what is the matter with you?

16:57.160 --> 17:04.160
The air is made available, so I am expecting the committee as it is now, this is what is in that form,

17:04.160 --> 17:09.160
or this one, that's what I want to explain, I am just planning very definitely that it is here.

17:09.160 --> 17:14.160
Mr. Jenkins, the other information that I have had, any information on or any follow-up of the pages, is that too?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.160
Mr. Jenkins, we are a professor.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.160
Mr. Jenkins, I know what I want to say.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.160
Mr. Jenkins, we are a professor.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.160
Mr. Jenkins, I am a professor.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.160
Mr. Jenkins, I am a professor.

17:24.160 --> 17:32.160
Mr. Jenkins, I have a chair, I have a chair, I have a chair for this, I would like to introduce a form of the material produced by Mr. Schein,

17:32.160 --> 17:35.160
minus the names of any confidential informants.

17:35.160 --> 17:39.160
I told him I would do that, I will do that.

17:39.160 --> 17:47.160
I will not turn this material over to the committee now, and leave it to the fact that it appears that the plan of confidential informants is invented.

17:47.160 --> 17:57.160
Yes, the committee, which I am chairman, both, will I must turn over the names of confidential informants, and we will take that matter up.

17:57.160 --> 18:03.160
I have no right as chairman, although they come and that's getting committee.

18:03.160 --> 18:12.160
To turn this material over to chairs, never asked for, or was a chair, and I want to say it's going to be very clear, this might not be the only thing that they call it a day.

18:13.160 --> 18:18.160
You can see that it's going to be a mass amount of material.

18:18.160 --> 18:25.160
I want to know other, for example, Mr. Schein has an informant.

18:25.160 --> 18:29.160
If I had an informant, I would have named him well, well and good.

18:29.160 --> 18:37.160
I would have this kept turning over, I want to know what my chair was, and their informants are chairman.

18:37.160 --> 18:50.160
I am not sure what my plans were, but chairman of the committee, but as jurisdiction of this material, I would like to have four or at least a few hours, and they sent it to this floor, and give me a report once we got there.

18:50.160 --> 18:56.160
The Army is just six months to give us a few names, I think I should have a couple of hours.

18:56.160 --> 19:01.160
I was there, but since that was possible, he doesn't call that I'm Friday.

19:01.160 --> 19:08.160
Mr. Cohen was up on the target specifically to produce the material. He was after he could do it. He said he could.

19:08.160 --> 19:13.160
He said Friday night and Saturday and Sunday and Monday until Tuesday morning.

19:13.160 --> 19:22.160
He said he's going to be very disappointed if Mr. Cohen is unable to come to comply with the coronavirus, because he's been planning to leave in New York.

19:22.160 --> 19:29.160
Mr. Cohen is the chairman of the committee.

19:29.160 --> 19:35.160
Mr. Cohen is my chief counsel, he is not chairman of the enough getting committee.

19:35.160 --> 19:43.160
The chairman of the enough getting committee, I have the control of his file.

19:43.160 --> 19:50.160
The members of my committee can both want to do it, but I will have to go and buy a majority book.

19:50.160 --> 19:56.160
I will not turn the file over to the committee now without knowing what's in them.

19:56.160 --> 20:01.160
I am early asked that we have a bit of time, it's 12.15.

20:01.160 --> 20:09.160
The federal thinketh is only about 15 minutes until 12.30, so that I can go over the stuff during the new year.

20:09.160 --> 20:15.160
And the chairman will consider the president's manager or whether he's in my jurisdiction now.

20:15.160 --> 20:20.160
The chair and fire are going in a new hour, you will all together a meeting of the committee's end of the chairman.

20:20.160 --> 20:25.160
The legal process by which in your opinion these pathways can be made.

20:25.160 --> 20:31.160
I will want to first rule over the materials with the tool and plan about here, I'm not sure if I have to do that yet.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.160
You can do that.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.160
It may be undestartic all the meeting of the committee.

20:35.160 --> 20:43.160
The chairman knows that I have worked with him very closely, I have exceeded the many requests, which I didn't fully agree with.

20:43.160 --> 20:53.160
I am going to do an exercise of matter and this matter I am sure will be taken care of to the senate action of all members of the committee.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.160
What the left hand is.

20:56.160 --> 21:04.160
We are going to do something similar to suggesting now because if a great degree says so, two o'clock we are going to come back to two o'clock and have to be judged again.

21:04.160 --> 21:10.160
If you can decide if Mr. Colne and the private office, which you think you have the authority,

21:10.160 --> 21:12.160
can you deliver this material?

21:12.160 --> 21:15.160
If not, the chair of the chair will arrange to call a committee meeting.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.160
We are going to do that, which we can decide.

21:17.160 --> 21:21.160
I have suggested you continue with the extra cost and generalization of Mr. Colne.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.160
The council will provide all of this as the next step in his interrogation.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.160
The commission will tell us about it before it can go to committee members.

21:27.160 --> 21:32.160
Well, then I will check in and put them to the meeting after 1230 a.m.

21:32.160 --> 21:36.160
So it's sitting up to the clock and 1215 on 12 o'clock.

21:37.160 --> 21:43.160
We are going to turn now back into the list of matters with my chief counsel, if I have to find out the exact same what we have here.

21:43.160 --> 21:50.160
So it certainly is no information, no desire to keep any material from the list of the investigations from this committee.

21:50.160 --> 22:02.160
I may the chair inquire whether if we do that, you will be ready to a clock either by action of committee or by your own action to produce the material which we have tried to endeavor to get tried to get.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.160
It's scanning.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.160
The room is open.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.160
We are now at the MacArthur.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.160
The committee has placed some of the committee tables over the top of the road.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.160
Concentrate on the moment when they have an early recess.

22:21.160 --> 22:27.160
And if the timing can be sent to the recognition from the chair, you know the column now chatting inside of you.

22:27.160 --> 22:34.160
We have a chart and three use of full material.

22:34.160 --> 22:41.160
I recently started by a two o'clock.

22:41.160 --> 22:45.160
We will be able to handle this matter properly.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.160
I do want to talk to Mr. Carr.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.160
Mr. Cohen, find out what we have here.

22:52.160 --> 23:06.160
I go with the giving all the material minus finance and finance and finance.

23:06.160 --> 23:10.160
I can talk with me about the cost of material, no matter how many finance and finance.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.160
I let the cost and the total.

23:14.160 --> 23:23.160
The plan is going to be over here before their name is much more through anyone who would try to punish them so they get their jobs.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.160
The film at position, the chair, has an absolutely excellent performance.

23:27.160 --> 23:30.160
I hope we can go through that.

23:30.160 --> 23:36.160
And perhaps with Mr. Jenkins and William Fatt, I'm defied hot as material.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.160
I hope we can shoot that by two o'clock.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.160
I'd be very happy if we could work with that time.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.160
I'll come in the comments.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.160
Let's just get on our lines.

23:44.160 --> 23:52.160
We'll turn about seven to seven times to go through five, so that you'll know what will be implemented.

23:52.160 --> 23:57.160
Our line is being filed on a page made available for the committee.

23:57.160 --> 24:01.160
If he doesn't know, no time, let's first know.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.160
But I do want this file on both of us.

24:04.160 --> 24:09.160
If anything, filed, if there's committee and it's only been implemented in its month position,

24:09.160 --> 24:12.160
let's just look at the situation, whatever it is.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.160
Those senators don't look at it anymore.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.160
I don't understand about this.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.160
I'll say that to you.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.160
I mean what I'm saying.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.160
I want you on the phone.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.160
I want to know when it's filed and when it's not.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.160
We went out of school before this committee.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.160
I was part of the record for this committee.

24:31.160 --> 24:36.160
And this, when it is going to be it, we now have to drop out after that.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.160
But whenever it goes into the custody of which committee,

24:40.160 --> 24:44.160
works on a big double bar that it evolved through, and I loveמו as a chair of the committee,

24:44.160 --> 24:46.160
whether it's home or not.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.160
We'll turn to the members of the chair of the chair of the committee.

24:49.160 --> 24:53.160
We'll turn to the members of the chair of the committee.

24:53.160 --> 24:57.160
May the chair of the committee receive an evidence before this committee.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.160
He's received by the committee and is availableistically to the committee members

25:00.160 --> 25:02.160
and to the staff of the committee.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.160
I don't know anything about what's in that box.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.160
I know what we ask for, whatever we get.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.160
Is available from the committee.

25:09.160 --> 25:14.160
To all of the members of the committee staff, from the RFA.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.160
May I say to the committee members?

25:16.160 --> 25:20.160
The chair of the committee is available in the chair of the committee.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.160
He's up here to write here.

25:22.160 --> 25:25.160
The committee is available in the chair of the committee.

25:25.160 --> 25:30.160
The center of the micens will not get the name.

25:31.160 --> 25:35.160
Any confidential informants will I have?

25:35.160 --> 25:38.160
This is especially true in view of the micens.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.160
The center came back on the committee.

25:41.160 --> 25:47.160
Came back on six days after the Mr. Adams was to Steve's contact with him.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.160
He hasn't taken the stand to tell his father he came back.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.160
What that conversation was with his business.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.160
We can't seem to do it.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.160
He has made it very clear for us.

25:55.160 --> 26:05.160
The center of the micens has that he deals with those individuals that give me information about communists, about snipers.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.160
But they should be prosecuted.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.160
He's made speeches demanding they be prosecuted.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.160
I want to tell the center of the micens all.

26:12.160 --> 26:16.160
And all of them now that he will not get the name.

26:17.160 --> 26:22.160
Any individuals that give me information about drafts or optimism.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.160
I'm left on until.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.160
Are you sure as my age.

26:26.160 --> 26:29.160
What those names will not be used.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.160
Of them make this clear as far as I am concerned.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.160
I don't make them around.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.160
I don't put those names on the file.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.160
I'm very careful not to do that.

26:39.160 --> 26:43.160
I'm glad and worried about the sort of thing some were told when I seemed to the past two days.

26:43.160 --> 26:47.160
I was frankly worried that my three double-fired friends came back on the commission.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.160
But whether they were coming back or helpers.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.160
Big outs, drafts, drafts, and communists.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.160
But as they were coming back.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.160
Upon the request of Mr. Adams and Mr. Stevens.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.160
I still don't know.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.160
I still don't know what I want to say.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.160
Very clearly.

27:04.160 --> 27:07.160
The center of the micens all will never get.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.160
The name.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.160
Of anyone who's confidential in secrecy.

27:13.160 --> 27:17.160
Use me information about dishonesty.

27:17.160 --> 27:20.160
drafts, corruption, freedom, and the government.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.160
That's absolutely clear.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.160
From where I have to present it to from Wisconsin.

27:25.160 --> 27:29.160
I've never asked him for such names.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.160
There's implication as well.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.160
Secondly as well.

27:33.160 --> 27:38.160
When you imply by any language that you may have used.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.160
Here now.

27:39.160 --> 27:42.160
And when I was absent from this committee.

27:42.160 --> 27:47.160
But I wanted the name of informants to make public.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.160
I never made such a statement.

27:49.160 --> 27:52.160
I never thought they should be made public.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.160
What Senator knows about it.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.160
And he knows he was unfair.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.160
When you made such statements from such implications in my office.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.160
I do take this position.

28:01.160 --> 28:05.160
But I am talking about classified information.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.160
If this Senator has a wife.

28:08.160 --> 28:12.160
House chairman of this committee or as a United States senator.

28:12.160 --> 28:16.160
The House has the secret files of this government.

28:16.160 --> 28:20.160
The classified files dealing with the security of this country.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.160
The half of them still for it.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.160
And the documents given to him.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.160
When I say it is this law, I'm the security assistant.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.160
That's the perfect system.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.160
That's the position I have taken.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.160
I take it now.

28:34.160 --> 28:40.160
I simply ask your administration to take the facts as reviewed by you.

28:40.160 --> 28:48.160
And let the Americans people know whether that is the process that this government and this administration is going to follow.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.160
If it is, if people in the United States have heard.

28:51.160 --> 28:56.160
And if you haven't seen it, this can inform the same conduct that they should do.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.160
But I want to point out to you.

28:58.160 --> 29:03.160
But I'm talking about the basic issue of national security.

29:03.160 --> 29:09.160
And if this Senator, if there is information in the file.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.160
Seek an information at the standard of it first of the year.

29:12.160 --> 29:17.160
Mark, last time did a bureau press classified in your statement.

29:17.160 --> 29:24.160
Last Friday, that little bureau press can be no one else except Jay at your Uber.

29:24.160 --> 29:27.160
And he's a one who markets classified.

29:27.160 --> 29:31.160
And if you want to refer to him to the American people as a little bureau press.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.160
That's your privilege.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.160
That's the American people entitled to know.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.160
It is a little bureau press.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.160
That's controlling the secret information.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.160
I like to know it too.

29:41.160 --> 29:44.160
But I do say that I take the position.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.160
But this has become a national issue.

29:47.160 --> 29:56.160
As the weather, we are entitled to get the classified files and make some public here in hearings of the status.

29:56.160 --> 30:00.160
If we are legally so, then we know how to proceed.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.160
We can speak of the government.

30:02.160 --> 30:04.160
But the FI have.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.160
And you can carry on.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.160
You get more work from that.

30:08.160 --> 30:12.160
But all of the Congress divided into many different parts of the agenda.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.160
If we are not inside of the league,

30:14.160 --> 30:18.160
if we are not inside of the get it by speaking,

30:18.160 --> 30:22.160
when I raise the question, are we inside of the get it by itself?

30:22.160 --> 30:24.160
I do not believe you.

30:24.160 --> 30:28.160
Now that's the correct definition after you're in lawments.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.160
I don't want to know the name.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.160
I don't get anything about them.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.160
I'm not concerned about that.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.160
People give you information.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.160
Uncertainly government info.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.160
When you give information within that personal knowledge,

30:41.160 --> 30:44.160
write properly about any commonist info.

30:44.160 --> 30:49.160
When you get that information from a classified document,

30:49.160 --> 30:53.160
that is marked secret and deals with the security of this public,

30:53.160 --> 30:55.160
when I run the message app,

30:55.160 --> 31:00.160
and all I want and all is what this administration in purpose will all be.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.160
If they in purpose, it's supposed to be no crime,

31:03.160 --> 31:08.160
so he and the government take that document and make it available.

31:08.160 --> 31:12.160
When the committee cannot get it by speaking, if that's no crime,

31:12.160 --> 31:15.160
we're inside of it, and I know it's not what I want and all.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.160
And I'll be there, is it?

31:17.160 --> 31:20.160
And I will be able to be accepted out of one way or the other.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.160
And the attorney general making that decision.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.160
I think he's already made it.

31:25.160 --> 31:29.160
But I think the American people are inside of the law.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.160
What the position of this administration is,

31:32.160 --> 31:37.160
we'll respect to these secret documents that those of the vital security of our country.

31:37.160 --> 31:40.160
We're inside of the law on illegal basis,

31:40.160 --> 31:44.160
and not up to the end of the legal basis of what one citizen may think,

31:44.160 --> 31:47.160
one citizen may think, or someone else may think.

31:47.160 --> 31:53.160
I hope we'll keep this a government's law in order for chairman.

31:53.160 --> 31:56.160
Chairman, Chairman, Chairman has a financial disarmament

31:56.160 --> 32:01.160
and he wants to call a decision to this fact that we're talking about two different committee facts.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.160
There is no argument to be thought.

32:03.160 --> 32:09.160
It's about the special investigation of the committee and the fact that from material you can receive,

32:09.160 --> 32:14.160
in testimony by subtene or otherwise, is made available to all of the committee members.

32:14.160 --> 32:19.160
Discussing and taking place between son of your McCarthy and part of McClellum,

32:19.160 --> 32:22.160
and the weeks of signing the contract and now we just enjoy it.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.160
I've got some kind of mind.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.160
That's the section of the people's impollety.

32:26.160 --> 32:31.160
With the regular investigating committee of the son of the McCarthy in the chat.

32:31.160 --> 32:35.160
I'm going to say, don't ever have a grime to get a recognition here.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.160
I'm going to point a point for this.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.160
I may take you to find a free form for this.

32:39.160 --> 32:43.160
I think the fact that I have another right to answer some of the McClellum without any introduction of the summit's timing.

32:43.160 --> 32:46.160
When we get through, and I get through, I think the most residing is.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.160
I'm very good.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.160
We've been long as well.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.160
We've practiced that.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.160
It's just a...

32:51.160 --> 32:54.160
A little bit more critical to see when I turn it over.
