00:00.000 --> 00:10.580
I had been told in an informal conversation with the Adlerant General that

00:10.580 --> 00:16.180
China's billionaire camp Gordon was going to be only eight or nine weeks.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.960
I wanted to double check that, so I called the Provost Marshall General under

00:19.960 --> 00:27.460
a little jurisdiction the Provost Marshall School of Camp Gordon here, and I asked him for

00:27.460 --> 00:31.760
information with reference of the link to time that China would be required to share.

00:31.760 --> 00:36.040
He told me that my initial information that China would be a picture of Gordon only eight weeks

00:36.040 --> 00:41.360
for an error, and whoever had told me so was wrong, that China is going to be required to say

00:41.360 --> 00:46.780
there eight weeks, which was the second-based week of his basic training, and that if he

00:46.780 --> 00:52.800
status-pectrally participated or if he was in basic training, then if he status-pectrally

00:52.800 --> 00:58.160
included facilities, and that if he were selected, he would be able to go on to the Provost

00:58.160 --> 01:02.680
Marshall School, the CID School, which is the thing I had earlier talked to so much about

01:02.680 --> 01:07.960
as being the thing he was going to at Camp Gordon, and he pointed out to me that the CID

01:07.960 --> 01:12.400
school was up from two and a half to three months, and that the total time that China

01:12.400 --> 01:18.840
should expect at Camp Gordon was going to be five months provided he was selected for

01:18.840 --> 01:24.840
the CID school, or two months if he was not selected after which he probably would be

01:24.840 --> 01:29.480
reassigned where I am he knew not nor did I.

01:29.480 --> 01:36.480
This upset me because I had given this extraordinary information, so I telephoned him and told him

01:36.480 --> 01:37.480
this new development.

01:37.480 --> 01:45.920
He reacted extremely with extreme violence, he numerated the various double-crosses that

01:45.920 --> 01:49.920
he has been claiming to be the Army has given to the Canadian Navy through various double

01:49.920 --> 01:53.120
crosses, but he has been claiming to be the Army in a given and child.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.960
Yes, sir, he said this to the Army, the Department of China Commission not lift up to it,

01:57.960 --> 02:02.240
the Red Department of Reo, the Department of Justice not lift up to it, so we attempt to

02:02.240 --> 02:07.840
shine with night availability, but we were requiring China to be Saturday morning duty scheduled

02:07.840 --> 02:08.840
to deliver draw.

02:08.840 --> 02:13.360
It was at the very station of November 13th, with reference to China's SDNI report

02:13.360 --> 02:17.680
on the CCTV double-cross, and now there's one longer area that can't port in with the

02:17.680 --> 02:18.680
6 double-cross.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.360
And bearing the conversation while I was attempting to conciliate him, he abruptly

02:22.360 --> 02:23.360
hung up the telephone.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.560
You say he had roughly hung up the telephone?

02:26.560 --> 02:27.560
Yes, sir.

02:27.560 --> 02:34.200
Was that conversation interspersed with any virtue-produced remarks or seen language, Mr. Adam?

02:34.200 --> 02:35.200
Yes, sir.

02:35.200 --> 02:41.400
Mr. Adam, when did you finally tell Mr. Holmes that you did this to him?

02:41.400 --> 02:45.400
The China in all probability was scheduled to deliver the CCTV.

02:45.400 --> 02:53.560
On January 13th, I wrote a camp at Ole Miss Mr. C. He was coming up on another appointment.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.800
I often used that means his problem to him, he's a very good man.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.320
I was definitely trying to drive through the point for this.

02:59.320 --> 03:03.520
I did it on this occasion, when I got here to attend off the filming.

03:03.520 --> 03:09.160
Instead of going back to the tent of going on, as I originally planned, I told him to

03:09.160 --> 03:15.680
see if I could get back in Georgia with Mr. Cohn and conciliate him as he would have

03:15.680 --> 03:18.880
been having so much difficulty over the shine.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.680
So I went down to Room 101.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.280
His cone there, his tire was there.

03:25.280 --> 03:33.480
I remember we lunched together in the camp series and everything was peaceful.

03:33.480 --> 03:44.840
When we returned to Room 101 towards the latter part of the conversation, I had cone.

03:44.840 --> 03:53.840
I knew that 90% of all inductees, the public, we faced all these difficulties.

03:53.840 --> 04:00.840
I knew that one day we were going to face that problem cone as to shine.

04:00.840 --> 04:09.200
So I thought I would lay a little groundwork for future troubles.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.760
And I asked him, I asked him what would happen if shine not over these days.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.840
You mean you were breaking the news gently and gently?

04:17.840 --> 04:18.840
That is right.

04:18.840 --> 04:25.840
I asked him what would happen if shine not over these days.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.840
He was finally able to figure it out.

04:30.840 --> 04:35.840
I said, oh, Roy, something is going to happen.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
I said, oh, Roy, come on.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.840
Really, what is going to happen is shine not over these days.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.840
And he responded with even more voice.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.840
We all wrecked the arms.

04:45.840 --> 04:52.840
And he said, the first thing we are going to do is get to the Mariah for the way he has treated.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.840
They report things.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.840
They should get through at 46 tomorrow.

04:58.840 --> 05:08.840
And the student he is going, we are going to get to the Mariah for the vaccine-free way in which he has forbidden shine.

05:08.840 --> 05:09.840
He treated up there.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.840
He said, we are not going to do it ourselves.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.840
We have another committee of the council of Interfinite.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.840
And then he said, I wouldn't be so happy to do this.

05:17.840 --> 05:23.840
We are going to start a investigation with...

05:23.840 --> 05:27.840
We have got enough stuff on the army to keep investigation going indefinitely.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.840
And if anything, like question such a double cross, it occurs.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.840
That's what goes on.

05:34.840 --> 05:40.840
This remarks were not for the way they were likely in the context of the case.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.840
You mean the manner in which it was regulated?

05:43.840 --> 05:44.840
Yes.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.840
Mr. Adams did he elaborate on how he was going to get rid of...

05:48.840 --> 05:52.840
The things Mr. Stevens was through as secretary?

05:52.840 --> 05:54.840
No, sorry, just lean back and his care and test.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.840
Stevens is through as secretary of the army.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.840
There is not the going to detail Mr. Harry.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.840
He was going to accomplish the wreckage of the army.

06:04.840 --> 06:09.840
No, he said, we have enough stuff on you to keep investigation going indefinitely.

06:09.840 --> 06:17.840
I'll ask you whether or not about that time or a few days after Mr. Cornwood supplied on a vacation.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.840
He was my understanding of the case.

06:21.840 --> 06:31.840
Whether any events that hurry in between the threats to wreck the army and to use house, Mr. Stevens as his secretary...

06:31.840 --> 06:37.840
After I went back to my office on the afternoon, which that event occurred...

06:37.840 --> 06:41.840
General Magdalen, the provost marshal general, called on me and my office...

06:41.840 --> 06:44.840
His office is in a different building from the Pentagon.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.840
And when I had talked to him in the previous week, I suggested that next time he was in...

06:48.840 --> 06:52.840
If he stopped in my office, I'd return to him the problem that we had been having...

06:52.840 --> 06:56.840
And so that he would know what to instruct his people at Camp Fortress...

06:56.840 --> 06:59.840
...as to conduct an after the thing.

06:59.840 --> 07:06.840
And he was in company of General Howard, who was the newly selected commentator of the provost marshal...

07:06.840 --> 07:08.840
...who was at Camp Fortress.

07:08.840 --> 07:15.840
They came into my office together and they...

07:15.840 --> 07:19.840
I have not retuncted the entire incident of the previous day.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.840
What suppose you do so now that I'm not out of the minute you will?

07:22.840 --> 07:25.840
On the previous day when I told...

07:25.840 --> 07:32.840
...that when I told Mr. Corn that this long period of duty was probably ahead of China's camp order...

07:32.840 --> 07:34.840
...and he honoured the telephone.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.840
I quickly made a check again without going to the truth source...

07:39.840 --> 07:42.840
...but to an officer in the Army who told me that he stopped...

07:42.840 --> 07:45.840
...certainly I must have wrong information from the provost marshal.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.840
And on the basis of that I called Mr. Car.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.840
Within about 45 minutes of my earlier call to Corn.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.840
And I asked him if he wouldn't find Corn and call them off...

07:54.840 --> 07:58.840
...because I stopped perhaps my information was wrong on the five month period.

07:58.840 --> 08:03.840
So I agreed to do so and as I understand he did do so and he did play against Mr. Corn to sign B.

08:04.840 --> 08:08.840
But then on the 14th of January when General Magon called on me...

08:08.840 --> 08:14.840
...he was quite psyched and quite explicit about what wasn't ahead for the show's soldiers...

08:14.840 --> 08:22.840
...and it became obvious to me that I now had tried to show Mr. Corn different things about how long the show was going to stay a camp order.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.840
So I went to see the steam.

08:25.840 --> 08:31.840
I told him that I had on either two or three occasions given inaccurate information in the period of about three days.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.840
I was referenced to how long time was scheduled to say I can't afford to do it.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.840
Mr. Steven stated that he was getting ready to go to the fire east...

08:39.840 --> 08:43.840
...and that I've been planning to try and talk to him in the morning before I go anyway.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.840
I want him to be aware of the fact that I'm gone.

08:46.840 --> 08:50.840
I want to restate to him my desire to be of cooperation and assistance in the committee.

08:50.840 --> 08:55.840
And I want to see him as long as the Army is being investigated and let him know...

08:55.840 --> 08:58.840
...about continuing desire to be of assistance.

08:58.840 --> 09:03.840
I'll tell him about what is ahead for private time.

09:03.840 --> 09:08.840
He then called General Young, who is the distant chief of staff for personnel...

09:08.840 --> 09:11.840
...and asked General Young to check with the Provost Marshall General...

09:11.840 --> 09:15.840
...and be sure we would exactly act with and see what was ahead for private time.

09:15.840 --> 09:20.840
General Young came back within an hour or so and affirmed that General Maglan had told us...

09:20.840 --> 09:27.840
...the private time had five months of camp orders and if he was selected for the Provost Marshall School...

09:27.840 --> 09:32.840
...two months otherwise within assignments subsequently had some other place.

09:32.840 --> 09:39.840
On the basis of that, Mr. Steven went to see Senator McCarthy on the afternoon of the 14th of January.

09:39.840 --> 09:44.840
On the following morning, the 15th of January, Mr. Steven reported to me...

09:44.840 --> 09:50.840
...that he had seen Senator McCarthy, that he had talked to Senator McCarthy about private time's statement...

09:50.840 --> 09:54.840
...that he had a numerator to a model to enter private time...

09:54.840 --> 10:03.840
...and that Senator McCarthy on four old fly vacations during the course of their meeting of an hour and a half or so...

10:03.840 --> 10:09.840
...had receded to him the suggestions to army to the assigned private time to the organization.

10:09.840 --> 10:14.840
Was that the meeting of January 14th at the Fair Alarm Hotel?

10:14.840 --> 10:16.840
Yes, sir.

10:16.840 --> 10:22.840
Mr. Adams, did you and the secretary have any time, whatever, to attend to your other business outside of...

10:22.840 --> 10:27.840
...looking at you as the future of China?

10:27.840 --> 10:33.840
Mr. Steven is a very busy man. Mr. Steven did not spend much time on this problem.

10:33.840 --> 10:37.840
The position of the private counselor has a variety of duties attached to it...

10:37.840 --> 10:47.840
...and we've worked long hours. Steve Matters took and sold more of my time than they should have.

10:48.840 --> 10:53.840
But they certainly did not make it impossible for me to discharge my student.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.840
And you...

10:55.840 --> 11:04.840
...didn't it depend like this much time and attention to any of their private, lieutenant, captain?

11:04.840 --> 11:06.840
General in the army.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.840
Have you given...

11:08.840 --> 11:11.840
...with respect to China?

11:11.840 --> 11:15.840
I had never been in the situation like this before.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.840
I wanted the secretary leave for the parkourian.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.840
Mr. Steven left on the 17th of January, which was on the 28th.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.840
When did Mr. Cohn go to Florida on a vacation?

11:26.840 --> 11:29.840
Well, I don't know, sir.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.840
I think he went on the 60s, but...

11:31.840 --> 11:34.840
...sixteenth of January? Yes, sir, but I don't know.

11:34.840 --> 11:39.840
Did you have a telephone conversation about that time with Mr. Car?

11:39.840 --> 11:42.840
Will you respect the chance?

11:43.840 --> 11:48.840
Well, the day after Mr. Steven had reported to...

11:48.840 --> 11:51.840
...he had part of the party on January 18th.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.840
I had a case he was talking to Car on the regular basis.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.840
I don't recall a subject.

11:58.840 --> 12:07.840
But I knew that the previous weekend, Senator McCarty and Mr. Car and Mr. Cohn had been together in Boston, I believe, at Heary.

12:08.840 --> 12:16.840
And they had gone to Boston, I think, shortly, very shortly after Mr. Steven and Senator McCarty had been together at the Carolire and Hotel.

12:16.840 --> 12:23.840
I was quite sure that Senator McCarty would have made the fact that the reference to China's future...

12:23.840 --> 12:26.840
...known to Mr. Cohn and Mr. Car.

12:26.840 --> 12:36.840
So, during the course of our conversation on the telephone on the 18th, I asked Mr. Car if Senator McCarty had told him over the weekend about...

12:36.840 --> 12:42.840
...the now firm program which was at the head of the Sean.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.840
He's the best complete ignorance about it.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.840
And I said something to you, Mr. Cohn.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.840
I said, yes, I shouldn't have spoken to them.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.840
He said, well, I guess you better tell me, or something's not effective.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
Many of that, I did tell him.

12:54.840 --> 13:03.840
And while I was talking to him, he said that he had an incoming call from Boba Razzan, Florida, from Mr. Cohn, waiting on the other line.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.840
And that he would transmit this information to Mr. Cohn.

13:06.840 --> 13:19.840
Not very long after that conversation within me, or I think perhaps within the half hour, I received a long distance call from Boba Razzan, Florida, from Mr. Cohn.

13:19.840 --> 13:29.840
He asked me to repeat to him what I told Mr. Cohn, the reference to the future of China.

13:29.840 --> 13:34.840
And when I did tell him, I was obvious to me that he was very upset.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.840
I asked him to be in tendons to continue his vacation in Florida.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.840
He'd only been there about a day, maybe two days.

13:40.840 --> 13:45.840
And he said something to me to the effect, how can I, when this has happened?

13:45.840 --> 13:48.840
That was on the A.T.

13:48.840 --> 13:57.840
On the following morning, the 19th, I received the telephone call from Mr. Cohn, requesting the appearance of certain members of Army Loyalty Institute of Field Force,

13:57.840 --> 14:01.840
requesting by the security.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.840
I objected to him very strangely.

14:03.840 --> 14:13.840
I pointed out to him that we had discussed this matter many times, and that there had been an informal understanding, and so far as I know, that this matter was not the same issue.

14:13.840 --> 14:18.840
I pointed out to Mr. Steven Schluffer, the body is just two days, or just a day or so.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.840
And now this could all happen.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.840
I asked him why it happened.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.840
He said there was nothing that there was nothing that he could do about it.

14:26.840 --> 14:34.840
Mr. Cohn has returned the night before at 8 p.m. from Florida, which is just six and a half hours after he's talking to me on the telephone.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.840
On both of his honor, so it's nothing that's hard to do about it.

14:38.840 --> 14:45.840
This is on the 19th, the request was to be adherent to these people at an meeting at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.840
We did not produce the people.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.840
I talked again on the telephone with the car.

14:50.840 --> 14:55.840
I told him that I was going to come and keep them to Musati myself, which I did.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.840
I came to see him in Musati.

14:57.840 --> 15:03.840
I got up here about 20 minutes before the meeting, and met him in New York.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.840
I asked him if I could walk from New York to the community room with him.

15:06.840 --> 15:12.840
To talk to him about this, this, uh, Florida, for the early, for the people who were here.

15:12.840 --> 15:18.840
And I walked with him over to the, uh, got the Calvary's office in the Capitol,

15:18.840 --> 15:23.840
and then back on the Subway car and into the community room, which is room 357.

15:23.840 --> 15:28.840
When we entered the community room, there were some new, say-for-men present,

15:28.840 --> 15:32.840
and they have sent it in the car to me once the meeting was about.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.840
We're here, Miss Adams.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.840
It's a little more than a station back there.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.840
Not in time, really.

15:41.840 --> 15:46.840
Like a side of the football team.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.840
Well, I'll ask you, we can say in a few minutes.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.840
We expect it's one of the spectators to say.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.840
The sadams, uh, well, there's some confusion.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.840
That's a bit of a shame.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.840
Well, there is a set of confusion.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.840
And while we have this opportunity, let's return to our studios across the country

16:02.840 --> 16:05.840
to permit our station to identify themselves.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.840
This is ABC Television Network.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.840
Statewide and Detroit.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.840
Nash, Lowell, Prices, Rock America.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.840
On ambassadors, Feytman, National Policeman.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.840
Let's bring now is to Nash.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.840
And here's the big-fice farm sale.

16:19.840 --> 16:24.840
Our famous Nash Rambler family for that, and tax-free delivery shows for only $1550.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.840
That's your Nash dealers now.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.840
Modern house mentality calls for life and freshmen.

16:31.840 --> 16:36.840
Autopepsy by the Carpenter case and my daughter's repress without filling.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.840
I'll let you in the audience.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.840
Send it now back to the question.

16:41.840 --> 16:46.840
When we walked into the committee room, the press, the newspaper man asked me,

16:46.840 --> 16:49.840
sir, I send him a time he wants the hearing was about.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.840
And he stated that he was giving the Army and Bill Friday.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.840
This was Tuesday.

16:55.840 --> 17:00.840
The police, the members of the lawyer is below, so I'm glad they're doing.

17:00.840 --> 17:05.840
And if we did not police them by Friday, that they would be shooting.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.840
This is a matter of which is a vital interest to the Army.

17:09.840 --> 17:12.840
The boys are a quasi-judicial in nature.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.840
They have somewhat the function of an affluent court.

17:15.840 --> 17:19.840
And the Army had always felt that to subject their actions to review by other bodies

17:19.840 --> 17:23.840
would be similar to requiring a judge to appear before a legislation

17:23.840 --> 17:26.840
to explain the reasons for this decision.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.840
We knew that the performance of these difficult tasks would be jeopardized

17:29.840 --> 17:31.840
and objectivity would be lost.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.840
If there was even a remote possibility of a board member having to appear

17:35.840 --> 17:39.840
and explain the reasons behind this decision.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.840
At some point we were very disturbed.

17:42.840 --> 17:45.840
I was very disturbed about it.

17:45.840 --> 17:50.840
And when I returned to the Pentagon after having received this all the news,

17:50.840 --> 17:54.840
which was reported in newspapers to be in all the media,

17:54.840 --> 17:59.840
I began a series of conferences with officials of other agencies of the government.

17:59.840 --> 18:04.840
I first discovered this red of a subpoena with Mr. Hensel,

18:04.840 --> 18:07.840
the General Counsel of Defense Department.

18:07.840 --> 18:12.840
And he suggested that I talk about the matters of the deputy Attorney General Rogers.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.840
I had helped previously with Mr. Rogers on this same subject.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.840
And with his release, I know I'm Mr. Hensel, among the earlier.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.840
I telephoned Mr. Rogers to discuss the matters.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.840
And he asked me what is my opinion had caused the subject to become an issue again

18:29.840 --> 18:32.840
after we thought that it had been settled and that it would be no issue

18:32.840 --> 18:35.840
between the Army and the State.

18:35.840 --> 18:39.840
At that time, I outlined the problem that the Army had had overshined

18:39.840 --> 18:43.840
and how the revival of the subject of the calling the Loyal Divorcees

18:43.840 --> 18:48.840
was deemed to be related to the calling danger overshined.

18:48.840 --> 18:52.840
I had further conversations with Mr. Rogers on the following day,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.840
which is the 20th of January.

18:54.840 --> 18:58.840
I told him this was not a matter of the Army to take the position alone.

18:58.840 --> 19:03.840
I felt that the Army and the defense department, if we were to refuse

19:03.840 --> 19:06.840
to permit Loyal Divorce members to be a family,

19:06.840 --> 19:11.840
we would have to have the support of the Department just because we could not be alone

19:11.840 --> 19:15.840
in the government, the only agency taking that position.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.840
For that reason, I requested an interview with the Attorney General

19:19.840 --> 19:24.840
with Mr. Rogers arranged for the next day, which was the 21st January.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.840
Later that afternoon, Mr. Rogers telephoned me and asked me

19:28.840 --> 19:30.840
if I was owned seat under the�.

19:30.840 --> 19:37.840
I did not know and tell him the story of how these matters seemed to be related.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.840
The arrangements to be appointed, I went to seat under the�,

19:40.840 --> 19:43.840
about 6 o'clock in the evening on January 20th.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.840
This was the first time I was used to face the base that you gave me

19:46.840 --> 19:48.840
to receive me at over call.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.840
The about 6 o'clock in the evening on January 20th,

19:51.840 --> 19:55.840
545 and 8.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.840
On the following day, January 21st, I met in the Attorney General's office

19:59.840 --> 20:03.840
with Mr. Valnell, Deputy Attorney General Rogers,

20:03.840 --> 20:06.840
President of the Fifth and Chairman Adam,

20:06.840 --> 20:09.840
White House Administrative Assistant Gerald Morgan,

20:09.840 --> 20:13.840
and UN Ambassador Henry Davis-Lash.

20:13.840 --> 20:17.840
To this group, I recounted the details about the Royal Deboard Automatum

20:17.840 --> 20:21.840
and that Mr. Rogers' request I described the problem we were having over

20:21.840 --> 20:26.840
Pride of Shine and how the two matters seemed to be related.

20:26.840 --> 20:31.840
At this meeting, Governor Adam Davis seemed to have had a written record

20:31.840 --> 20:34.840
of all of the incidents with reference to Pride of Shine,

20:34.840 --> 20:37.840
which I discussed with him that day in which I have recounted here.

20:37.840 --> 20:42.840
And when I replied in a negative key statement that he thought I should prepare for.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.840
The meeting finally concluded with the decision that I should call

20:46.840 --> 20:49.840
on the Republican members of the investigation subcommittee,

20:49.840 --> 20:53.840
the Democratic members were then not members of the committee,

20:53.840 --> 20:59.840
and point out to them the two problems that I had discussed in the Attorney General's office.

20:59.840 --> 21:05.840
So on the same afternoon, January 21st, I think,

21:05.840 --> 21:07.840
and company was Mr. Gerald Morgan.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
The White House staff I called on Senator Dirtian,

21:09.840 --> 21:11.840
whom I did not then know,

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
but who is acquainted with Mr. Morgan?

21:13.840 --> 21:17.840
We discussed the matter for about 20 minutes.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
Mr. Morgan, it's most of the talking.

21:19.840 --> 21:26.840
We very briefly outlined how the Cohen Shine matter seemed to have caused the all needs.

21:26.840 --> 21:30.840
That time, Senator Dirtian said that he was telephone car,

21:30.840 --> 21:34.840
requested delay, and the issue of the meeting is long enough for him to look into the matter.

21:35.840 --> 21:41.840
That same afternoon, my deputy, who was very contacted Senator Dirtian.

21:41.840 --> 21:47.840
I don't know how much to tell, even in due interest conversation, I was on the same.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.840
The following day, I called on Senator Dirtian once.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.840
I discussed with him for about half an hour,

21:53.840 --> 21:57.840
the same general subject to guy I have recounted here,

21:57.840 --> 22:00.840
who I am to tell about Cohen's Shine matter,

22:00.840 --> 22:03.840
and I'm in the law of the Lord's matter.

22:04.840 --> 22:09.840
On the meeting, which has reached the lowerly board,

22:09.840 --> 22:15.840
people were scheduled to appear, was January 22nd, on Friday.

22:15.840 --> 22:19.840
During the morning of the 22nd, I had a telephone call from Mr. Cohen,

22:19.840 --> 22:22.840
telling me that the morning meetings had been postponed,

22:22.840 --> 22:27.840
and probing me as to whether I knew what Senator Dirtian's substance-fifth and matter was,

22:27.840 --> 22:30.840
which I have always been.

22:30.840 --> 22:34.840
The late of the afternoon, Friday, January 22nd,

22:34.840 --> 22:38.840
my office received a telephone call from Senator McCarthy's office.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.840
They didn't send me the time they desired that I come to his home,

22:41.840 --> 22:44.840
and I need you to talk to him.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.840
They said I did, and I need you to be.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.840
There were two prints.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.840
Excuse me, sir. Did you see them?

22:52.840 --> 22:54.840
No, I did not go out and hit Mr. Dirtian.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.840
I wish you'd talk with him rather, I think.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.840
I thought there were some other gender checks in there, especially as having trouble getting used.

23:00.840 --> 23:06.840
There were two principles, subject, discussed, during the meeting of Senator McCarthy's house.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.840
One was the possibility of immediate New York assignments to shine,

23:10.840 --> 23:14.840
and the other was sent from McCarthy's request to the Army.

23:14.840 --> 23:20.840
Royal DeGorne Embassy in the United Vailable Court, Subcommittee Interrogation.

23:20.840 --> 23:25.840
A number of occasions during the evening, the Senator reinstated his inquiry,

23:25.840 --> 23:30.840
as to why we couldn't assign shines to New York,

23:30.840 --> 23:35.840
and on two or three occasions, the Academy to extract the commission's promise to that.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.840
How long were you there, Mr. Evans?

23:37.840 --> 23:40.840
I was there about three hours from about 8.30 to about 11.6.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.840
Can we have a sentence that was the evening of January 22nd?

23:44.840 --> 23:45.840
Yes, sir.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.840
After the residents of Senator McCarthy.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.840
Senator McCarthy's apartment in the wilderness hotel.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.840
And who was President besides you and Senator?

23:53.840 --> 23:56.840
Mrs. McCarthy was President.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.840
The three of you were back? Yes, sir.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.840
Very well, now you may proceed.

24:04.840 --> 24:09.840
You say that all the number of occasions that evening, Senator McCarthy, discussed shine with you?

24:09.840 --> 24:10.840
Yes, sir.

24:10.840 --> 24:15.840
You discussed shine with me on a number of occasions.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.840
I'm on a commitment of what you say with reference to assigning him to...

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
That's right, sir.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.840
And he also deciding him where?

24:24.840 --> 24:26.840
Assigning him to New York.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
Very well.

24:27.840 --> 24:31.840
This suggestion was any sort of booty just over New York.

24:31.840 --> 24:38.840
The other year, he said, at some time, the time, studying what point six books I don't think he said that on this occasion, although he may have.

24:38.840 --> 24:43.840
But he was just saying that any sort of assignment just to get over New York.

24:43.840 --> 24:48.840
And you've seen a letter from Senator McCarthy's 80th, December 22nd?

24:48.840 --> 24:49.840
Yes, sir.

24:49.840 --> 24:54.840
Exactly one month prior to this meeting of January 22nd? Yes, sir.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.840
That letter has been introduced to this record for the Secretary.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
You have read it, have you not? Yes, sir.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.840
Very well.

25:01.840 --> 25:08.840
Is that all of the current amount of the senators of Park Fund on this evening of January 22nd?

25:08.840 --> 25:12.840
Well, why was there telephone rang?

25:12.840 --> 25:17.840
George the Colby newspaper column was on the telephone.

25:17.840 --> 25:22.840
The secretary says something to the effect. Well, he's here right now. He's talking to him.

25:22.840 --> 25:27.840
So I took the telephone. I didn't know why the Colby would want to talk to me.

25:27.840 --> 25:34.840
I was next to him only on one free newspaper, which was at the London Emergency Club on 17th November.

25:34.840 --> 25:40.840
But he was the Colby one to know what the cause was of the flare-up between the encomb.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.840
I pointed out to him. I denied that there was any flare-up.

25:44.840 --> 25:49.840
And he talked around this up with the shine.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.840
What's going to happen today is the thing to that storage.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.840
We'll print the play about what's the cause of the flare-up between you and the encomb.

25:57.840 --> 26:04.840
I was uneasy as to why he wants to talk to me, why he's basically an infant and pregnant partner.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.840
So why I had to put on the telephone. So it's simply as I do it.

26:37.840 --> 26:42.840
What's shown to the colon pressures on the armors.

26:42.840 --> 26:53.840
Overshah. And he stated to me on that occasion that he felt that even that is he stated that he felt that the colon had in his first place accidentally done the army a great deal.

26:53.840 --> 27:01.840
Because he caused his extreme pressures on the armors. He made it necessary that the city call all the investigations of the army.

27:01.840 --> 27:08.840
He stated to me on a couple of occasions that night that as far as he was concerned, the immediate investigation of the army would over.

27:08.840 --> 27:17.840
So they couldn't investigate the army after the victory, after it's in due of his own actions.

27:17.840 --> 27:22.840
He also, well we talked generally about the Chicago colon.

27:22.840 --> 27:28.840
I told him. He told me that the Chicago colon had operated in the work elsewhere.

27:28.840 --> 27:33.840
He was a great, he was a good committee. That sort of thing.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.840
I said something to him. I expected. I didn't see why he was.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.840
He said that the recive was acting as a witness.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.840
He had a great interest in his father's shine.

27:45.840 --> 27:51.840
Going this far out of the poor colon. That doesn't necessarily mean to.

27:51.840 --> 27:56.840
I don't know whether to keep calm because Senator McGonney had a name which was well known.

27:56.840 --> 28:01.840
Long before a colon came work for him and I didn't see the reason for all these things.

28:01.840 --> 28:07.840
But that's the substance of the conversation during the course of the evening.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.840
We were very social reasoning.

28:09.840 --> 28:15.840
Three or four finely-cated, little or four years ago in the kitchen by Mrs. McIntyre.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.840
She went out and three or four occasions.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.840
She got some examples of some wood comp and cheese.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.840
It was comp and forth as they had received the prison time.

28:24.840 --> 28:28.840
She went out and drove into two or three pots of tea.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.840
One occasion I walked into kitchen with her.

28:30.840 --> 28:34.840
It was a new way to do it with her on how small location was.

28:34.840 --> 28:41.840
And when we lived at a city, we were very easy-friendly terms.

28:41.840 --> 28:45.840
I was given a present of the night's big slice of cream cheese.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.840
We were taken on top of each other's own.

28:51.840 --> 28:52.840
Where are you from?

28:52.840 --> 28:56.840
In a bus for the great state of Wisconsin, by that.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.840
Here in the federal government, the text writes.

28:59.840 --> 29:03.840
That is the way to begin to take advantage of memorandum,

29:03.840 --> 29:06.840
which was to get to the U-Bamistor's Rutgers.

29:06.840 --> 29:11.840
Well, on the following morning, it was the 23rd January.

29:11.840 --> 29:16.140
I've been very disturbed about the substance of the meeting in St.

29:16.140 --> 29:20.840
McIntyre's Department, and I've been disturbed about the event of the meeting.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.840
So I went to my office at 8 o'clock in the morning on Saturday.

29:23.840 --> 29:28.840
I was practically the only person on the street we had a big snowstorm that weekend.

29:28.840 --> 29:35.640
I got into the Pentagon at 8 o'clock, and I dictated a memorandum for record of my meeting in St.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.640
McIntyre's Department.

29:36.640 --> 29:41.640
It was dictated about 8 o'clock this morning, about 3 days a month.

29:41.640 --> 29:46.640
And then I took my dictapone and he called.

29:46.640 --> 29:59.640
I took my dictapone and she in a home over the weekend of the 24th and on Sunday.

29:59.640 --> 30:12.640
I dictated the first of the series of notes in the memorandum that I attempted to reconstruct the incidents that November and December and January.

30:12.640 --> 30:23.640
I took him back to my office for a few weeks and compared him with my calendar with my travel order, with my hotel for a ticket with my office.

30:23.640 --> 30:28.640
And I consulted with my associate in the office who were aware of my meeting with him.

30:28.640 --> 30:38.640
And that substantially completed the first draft of my own file in about a week's time.

30:38.640 --> 30:52.640
I was asking whether or not the end result of your dictation was the compilation of the events.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.640
Released by the Army.

30:55.640 --> 31:02.640
No further, it was on March, no further, April which is my folio for my file.

31:02.640 --> 31:06.240
This is the accumulation of St.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.920
McIntyre's memorandum for record of the meeting in St.

31:09.920 --> 31:10.920
McIntyre's Department.

31:10.920 --> 31:18.920
The memorandum was I just gave to the Secretary of the Army on November's PIMP on the occasion of the luncheon as we had with Mr. Car.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.920
And this is the necrarchy of the Carol arm for sale.

31:22.920 --> 31:33.920
The memorandum is 29 December's as a Secretary on what was ahead for private shine and various others.

31:33.920 --> 31:38.920
The ticket is notified which I attempted to reconstruct the incidents that affected me.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.920
That was the end result of my dictation.

31:42.920 --> 31:50.920
The paper to which you will be the Army report was prepared a month later.

31:50.920 --> 31:54.920
Do I prepare any office of the Secretary of the FEMP?

31:54.920 --> 31:56.920
Would you prepare for my Mr. Frank Hague?
