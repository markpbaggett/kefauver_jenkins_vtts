WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm glad you're here.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Great, Annie.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
To take you to any center anytime on any matter

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I saw this.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
And that...

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
The last day comes to the conversation.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
We were actually having another conversation with Mr. Cohn

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
on the 11th of September.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And particularly with respect to any Saturday morning

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
beauty on the part of Cheyenne at 4th take.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
On either the 4th of December or the 11th of December

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
say that there's an event in front of the record

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
and not quite accurate as to which weekend it was.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Any defasion?

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
The training schedule for Friday's time has four weeks worth of change.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
And the change requires him to train in Saturday morning.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
That will be 8th Saturday morning,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
5th Saturday morning, and 12th.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
I will remember what it was that night.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
I received a series of telephone calls.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I said correct, and I said there were three of the telephone calls.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I think they're called Cohn Cohn and I called him back.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
And he called me again.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I called him again and three of those were missing.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
But during this particular Friday afternoon,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I was three telephone calls.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
And the goal was on his accent on the telephone

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
was to the neighborhood of an hour, with Mr. Cohn.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
The entire subject under the question

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
was the fact that starting now everything on Saturday morning,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
which I was made aware of the fact was a new season of a cross.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
And this was as difficult as any of the telephone conversations

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
or any of the series of conversations I had.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
I was faced with extreme pressures, abusive pressures,

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
and very, very abusive criticism that I received.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
You were generating a broken concrete state.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Mr. Adams was very near abusive language.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
For you, you used the time well.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
And the tone of voice is as abusive as the word is very often.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
When these telephone calls from the subject

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
were shining at the top and under the afternoon

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
of the Fourth of the 11th of December,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
we were extremely angry.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And they were very upto you.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
And I was quite aware of this.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
As you mean the best, there was language

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
that we used, but Mr. Cohn that you cannot repeat.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I do share it.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Or any of those calls monitors,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
you say they were not aware of it.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
They were not there.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
There was any argument or discussion between Mr. Cohn

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
on that at that time

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
with respect to what a weekend lamp

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
when it started when it ended.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Yes, the whole point.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
As it's Cohn, the side of me is that everybody knows

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
that weekend begins on Friday night.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
And I pointed out to Mr. Cohn that weekend began

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
whenever the commanding general fort dictated

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
that he was through his exposure.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And the entire target was,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
you get the exposure off of that,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
including the training at 5 o'clock

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
or at the clock on Friday night,

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
instead of requiring the deliverer to do an un-badid.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I was, I think, at third of the day

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
to read the conversation that reached an impact.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I did nothing.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I did not call them a line of things.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I did not talk to the secretary about it.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I was, what I'm willing to do

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
anything about the fact that he's the only one I can tell.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
If you know how Mr. Cohn confused

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
with the request to say,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
it's important that Friday night,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I can only assume that he had telephone conversation.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
That is what I want you to now relate to this to many.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
You're a phase of December 17th.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
In New York,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
was that number Carpley, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
The report's monopsyring has been transferred

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
by New York.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And there were hearings on,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I think December 15th, 16th, 17th,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
and 18th, and many of them,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
a few of earlier.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I might say that one of the,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
one of the ways that I selected the days to go

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
for those years,

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
I attended in New York a total of about 13 or 12 days

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
of hearings.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
There were many more than that.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
There were a total of probably 28 or 30 days of hearings

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
at New York, Washington, and Portland.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I selected the day to go when it was indicated

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
on the telephone to me that

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Army witnesses would be interrogated

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
or that there was something which might concern us,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
which would come up during the course of the hearings.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And even on those circumstances,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
I did not always go.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
But in any of that,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I selected this day at the telephone conversation.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I went up in the airplane on the afternoon

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
as a 16th of December.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
There were a few interrogations in the afternoon

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
of the 15th that I got there in time for,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
but I didn't see any of them.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I stayed overnight,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
the next morning the hearings began at 1030.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
I went downtown from the Commodore Hotel by subway.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I walked into the courthouse,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
and as I mounted the courthouse,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
from one direction to the commodore,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I mounted the courthouse steps from the other direction

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
so that we saw each other

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
as we were entering the building.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
On the plaza or the plaza,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
at the top of the desk in the commodore,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I tried the telephone you last night.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
You weren't staying in the hotel

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
as the soldier wiped you at the end,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
so I didn't find you.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
I found out later that my wife has been called

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
about getting on to find out where I was staying.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, I'll be sure no one will say,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
what the inferences are going to be drawn for better than that.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
I'm sure that I'll be sure that I'll be sure that I'll be able

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
to find out where I was staying.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Well, I'll be sure no one will say,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
what the inferences are going to be drawn for better than that.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Now, once this fellow retirement is placed

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
to you on meditation on September 70th.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
I spent the night at the sixteenths with my two sons.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, you are now completely inaugurated.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
The fellow retirement is said to me

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
that the purpose of his call, 94,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
was that he had just learned

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
that I do on the previous day

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
of the amount of interference with the official

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
that Fort Dick, which his staff had accomplished

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
and that he was to tell me that as a venomous now,

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
it's most true that he was not going to be admitted.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I told him I was gratified to get that information

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
but it would be absolutely as no value to me

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
and let these data be taken in front of me.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And we walked on this conversation

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
until only a matter of a few months,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
left along this up to walking to the building

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
and reached the room which was used as a courtroom.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
This car was in the room.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
When we walked into the room, he began speaking

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
about the stuff that he began to criticize.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
This is the car about the matter

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
that he has spoken in heela.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I wanted to call one of these members of the car.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
No, I don't think all exactly,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
but it was on that subject

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
and it was in a critical vein.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I didn't want to stay there under those circumstances

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
so I walked out of the room.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Hearing you started shortly thereafter,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I don't know how long it has been.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
As I recall, I didn't see the center

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
because it was a classroom again before the year.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Nor did I see the car or home except that perhaps

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
it could be kept in the hallway.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Hearing lasted until about 12-15

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
at which time they were reset.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
We walked over to the entrance

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
to a restaurant called Gattner,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
the EAS-NU,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
which is about two blocks from the forthouse.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
It's where we walked once.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
We walked into the restaurant

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
and sat down at the face of the restricted.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
There were two centers,

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
the St. Mastrakees,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
who were there for a while,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
but they left before.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And he had the incident down now related.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
The car.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
While they were still there,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
something occurred.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I don't remember what.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
We saw Mr. Cohn and the maker,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
the rocket driver,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I remarked with reference to Donald Patrick,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
who was the former G2.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Shortly after that,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
he made a remark

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
that just being the second area of the Army

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
was relating to Donald Watson,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
only because of the fact that he was friendly.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
With the time I stayed at the home

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
and he knew that wasn't true.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So if you think you can tell the same

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
about that time,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
the two friends left.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And because I wanted to send him a party to be safe,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
before it's your home,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
when he told me on the court house death,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I said, let's talk about it.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Let's start at a kind of event.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Experience similar to none,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
which I've had in my life.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
This tone became extremely agitated.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
And it became extremely abusive.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
First name and second title.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
But he is kind of when it's way,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
to be very abusive,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
and then it's kind of a face

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
to be friendly for a few moments.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
And everybody needs a little bit more

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
and then it will start him again.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
And this kept on.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
I was trying to get to one place famous.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
But it's kind of so violent.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
When I said I better not do it.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
It leaves him that angry with me.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And that angry with Senator McCarthy.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
He's called to the remark I have made.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
So I say, you miss my one place, you know.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I thought, cheerly, I'd be able to get out of there by two.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
So once you're included,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
and this day you were afraid to leave

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
that Senator McCarthy a little mayor with ease.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Mr. Adam and what did he say?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
You say he was very abusive.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
He was extremely abusive.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
This I wasn't.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Was there not any of the same language you used?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yes.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Well just to admit that.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And tell what he did say.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Constituted abuse of your face.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Well I have a voice.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I'm tone of voice.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I have a much earlier news in my voice.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm an atheist.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I do not remember the prayers.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I do not remember the sentences,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
but I do remember the violence.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Well you remember the subject?

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
The subject was the fact that the thing that's told me was angry about.

11:18.000 --> 11:28.000
The thing that he was so violent was the fact that one of the Armenians was not.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
It was not agreed to an asylum for China and who?

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
That Senator McCarthy was not supporting his past and its efforts to get China signed in New York.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
So his abuse was directed partly to me and partly to Senator McCarthy.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
And as I say it kind of came to a way.

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
There is the experience of an extreme abuse and then there is the period where to get almost back to normal.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
And I think with the order and then about halfway through that.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
A little more of a thing.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I missed the 230 train also.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
This violence continued with a remarkable thing.

12:16.000 --> 12:24.000
And at first Senator McCarthy came to be trying to facilitate.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
He seemed to be trying to conciliate tone and not to state anything contrary to what he stated to me in morning.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
But then he more or less laughed from silence.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
Finally it was about three o'clock or ten minutes or three.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
We left the restaurant and got in the home car which was directly in front of the restaurant.

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
From the state that he was going to get me arrived at the station which is directly uptown.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
From the courthouse I had supposed to go in the subway that he had known and get to that quickly.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
So we began writing up four panels in New York.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
And the phone rang her and he wrote it again.

13:08.000 --> 13:16.000
And as it was directed more on this occasion to Senator McCarthy than it was me.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
And as we were writing uptown, I was trying to turn around to me.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
And to which we faced during the write uptown, this was about fifteen minutes.

13:26.000 --> 13:37.000
We asked me if I couldn't say that when I got back to Washington, documents and statements in a range in the fine and in New York for sure happened.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
When we got to say four things, this is where this was.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
But why was you in a fight?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I was a senator, Miss Adam.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I was called recollecting it that I made no response.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
I didn't say much on the write uptown.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
There's a little left.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
You mean the both you and the senator have been completely confused?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I have been.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
All right. Now then you were writing uptown in this phone car being driven by Mr. Cohn.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Is that correct?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And you were being taken to the station.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
That is correct.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I was going to tell the committee the events of that trip.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Well, that day at the end of the car she was going to make sure at three times.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
That's me on three occasions if I wouldn't.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
But I could want to send an ask and send a few statements to the one.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
A range for a round sign of the assignment in New York.

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
And that's when we got to thirty-fourth street, which is where the turn must be made.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Is it going to go over to the tentations, which around seven to seven?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
We attempted less turns.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
We were not committed.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
At least we were in the medicine court of the Ptoon Head.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
We took us under a long tunnel.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I know we took it under the Grand Central Station.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
We came out at about forty-six feet or thereabouts.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Going away from tentation.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
And I had about ten or twelve minutes to make the research.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I complained to Mr. Cohn.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
I said, you're just taking me away from the station.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And final third violence, he stopped the car and looked for a lane to the tapet.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
He said, just a hour to the end.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
So I climbed out of the car and looked for a lane to tapet between forty-six and forty-seven feet on that.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
I parked out of the room, ran across the street, jumped into the gap.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I tried to make three thirty frames.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
As some of their potters direct me to ask you whether or not you made the train.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
This thirty-three was ten minutes late, so I made the train.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
Mr. Cohn told me a few days later that he didn't think that I could feel badly about the way I was gone in the car.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Because he said I should have been there to see the way the center of the car.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Mr. Cohn asked you to lock the laser.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Who told you that?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Mr. Cohn.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Well, what did he say to you?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
A car or a few minutes later.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
He said to me, if I thought that I didn't put out of the car, he said that I could have seen the way things went.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
And the traffic that went out of the car in front of the wall, though, took the story.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I was always the events of that day happened.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
That was the reason.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
What if anything occurred on the following day, that is December 18th?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I don't know.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh, I'm just emberating.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
Well, say to whether or not to refer your recollection, you spoke to Mr. Cohn on December 18th.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
On December 18th.

16:49.000 --> 16:57.000
I am a whole new him that sometime between Christmas and the New Year, you was the best time for there was a second phase there.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Yes, Mr. Cohn was in Washington.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I think Mr. Cohn was in New York.

17:02.000 --> 17:12.000
I had a conversation with Mr. Cohn, which was further reference to Mr. Cohn's attitude on time.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
And I say to him, that's that.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
If they were just leaving your home, I was going to stop the school.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
For four days, it was my mother and sisters.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
And that day was just let me alone, and I got back.

17:28.000 --> 17:36.000
I was finding ways to see the secretary behind me between Christmas and New Year's, and to see her mom where she was going to go.

17:36.000 --> 17:45.000
I did not guarantee the baby life what the decision was, but I said I'll get an answer, so we'll know where he's going and we'll just leave me alone to make six days.

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
On the 19th of December, I went to football down to quarterback here.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
On the 20th of December, I received a long distance call from the car.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Which is the subject.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
On the 20th of December, I hand on the 23rd of December.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
While I was in football down to court, I received a long distance call from the car.

18:12.000 --> 18:21.000
On one, and I think, on both of the occasions, the principal Sunday of the call, came to the evening to the evening's time.

18:21.000 --> 18:31.000
And I received that I had told him that if they were just waiting until the Christmas and New Year's, I would try and find out what was going to happen to Shion.

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
When I say this one or two calls the subject, things will be shined by me.

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
Well, I'm not shined as best of a car long distance by you or a visitor, your mother, and she falls down to court.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
It was, and as I say, the principal first is one of the calls that I recall as a Shion.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
My recollection is that both calls Halliburgyan.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
Was there not there another fifty-seaters first with the fifty-two-kind data?

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
There probably was there, I do not remember what was going on.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
You returned from South Dakota to watching the plan.

19:11.000 --> 19:19.000
I returned to Washington on the day before Christmas, which was December 25th.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
I returned to my office on December 28th.

19:27.000 --> 19:40.000
From my leave, my fellow fellow General Ryan at Fort Dixon, ten minutes after nine on the morning, December 28th, to ask him what was scheduled for Shion.

19:40.000 --> 19:55.000
He stated to me that he had nothing to do with this, that an evaluation was made at Fort Dixon, and that the evaluation was sent from Fort Dixon to the Agenda General's office in Washington, where there was a distance that I had.

19:55.000 --> 20:06.000
I had to set up and the back system to a machine recorders, the business machine system evaluated where he would go.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
I went to the Agenda General's office.

20:09.000 --> 20:18.000
I took to the deputy Agenda, and I stayed with him, that I was interested in finding out what was scheduled for Shion.

20:18.000 --> 20:34.000
I made it quite clear that the Secretary did not want to find the clarity to be conservative as a request that anything special be done, that all we wanted to know was how the cards were going to fall.

20:34.000 --> 20:41.000
On the following days, the deputy Agenda General, or one of those people, I think it was General Ryan.

20:41.000 --> 21:04.000
I recorded to me that the Fort Dixon interview with the private Shion had classified him as a prospective criminal investigator, and that, quite probably, he would be sentenced to camp Gordon George at the conclusion of his weekly pay-safe-weekly schedule for January 15th.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
I passed in the bar as they then, and that's what happened to me.

21:11.000 --> 21:28.000
I then told on the telephone to Cone and Carr, I did not state the death rate definite, I did not state the Secretary had agreed to it, but I indicated that that was what in fact.

21:29.000 --> 21:37.000
Cone was quite adamant, that the camp Gordon George would, much too far from New York, would not do.

21:37.000 --> 21:57.000
On the 29th of December, I advised Secretary Steven by memorandum of the concept for Shion as he has developed by the Agenda General, and, from the point of that, I had a conversation

21:57.000 --> 22:21.000
with the Secretary in which the matter was shut, and the Secretary stated that the private Shion should be sent to camp Gordon George, and that I could certify him, which I did to private students who were on the street or the 31st.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
My name is Anne and I do this to Steven's and we guide his press to subject, as available.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Day of 29 December, you can leave it by the end.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
And you'll drive Mr. Cone and Mr. Carr on December 31st.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
I take I advise Mr. Carr, I am not sure that I got the, but I wish Mr. Cone.

22:39.000 --> 22:45.000
Upon giving Mr. Cone definite advice, this is the Shion man's shine, we're going to camp Gordon George.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
But this is Cone's day of his final, that is.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Well, as I say, it's a definite advice.

22:54.000 --> 23:05.000
What's Carr on the 31st and he transmitted as Cone, I had no precise conversation with Cone that he was going subsequent to the time that I told him probably would go.

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
And I mean, the occasion when I said he probably would go, Cone's principal objection was to the fact that it was so far from the Yorick.

23:13.000 --> 23:23.000
I like to whether or not the beginning of that January 4th, he started receiving telephone calls from Mr. Cone about to, possibly, the assignment camp for it.

23:23.000 --> 23:35.000
I did serve at Cone's point about to reach on around 4th of January that the assignment of Shion is probably been accomplished by an machine record.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
This is a machine determination and there is nothing special done for it.

23:41.000 --> 23:55.000
I point out through that how good that was, from everybody's point of view, that it's strictly something which has been done and the ordinary is working to be the same as different.

23:55.000 --> 24:03.000
But he's complaining that he didn't think that he was going to be enthusiastic about and do what not.

24:03.000 --> 24:23.000
On the same day, about the 4th of January, I had a long, long recall of the Cone who was very disturbed about an AWOL situation in which Shion was involved at 4th gate on that occasion.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
I missed that and sparked me before you get to that.

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
What is anything that Mr. Cone makes inquiry about?

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
Insofar as Shion's availability was concerned.

24:37.000 --> 24:45.000
Instead of not making inquiry about whether or not Shion was available to the committee for special work Friday was a camp party.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Not at that time, I believe it later this is.

24:49.000 --> 24:57.000
Now you see on the same day Mr. Cone was in crying about an LHWOL on the part of Shion on New Year's Eve.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Yes.

24:59.000 --> 25:11.000
As I as I as I as a recent structure of the situation soldiers were given information that they would get either the Christmas holiday or the New Year's holiday but not both.

25:11.000 --> 25:23.000
I was told that Shion had elected the Christmas holiday and that then subsequently he had been absent over the New Year's holiday.

25:23.000 --> 25:33.000
I am not able to explain the circumstances of the absence but there was some dispute as to whether or not his absence was authorized.

25:33.000 --> 25:43.000
There was an investigation underway that the camp's decision calls and concerns are called immediately to express concern over the investigation.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
I tell a phone general Ryan during the day of the Fourth of January to ask what it was about.

25:49.000 --> 26:01.000
He told me that there was enough of a cloud over what had occurred as to make it impossible to be sent to the responsibility either on the soldier who was absent or on the people who should have been controlled.

26:01.000 --> 26:09.000
I told him that I had been resolved without further investigation and that ended up to be.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
In short you were saying that the case of the soldier is that the Christmas holiday.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
The other has the New Year's holiday and that's correct.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Yes.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
I miss the Shion got both.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Yes.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
How much of them when did you go to the hammer's Massachusetts?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
I went to hammer's Massachusetts on the 8th of January.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
For what purpose?

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
I went up to the post office taking the day.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Why are you with I was in and off you received a call from the McCarthy Investigating Committee.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I didn't think.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
From which member?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Oh, Mr. God.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Mr. God.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
What was the dinner of that conversation?

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
I had telephoned my wife on the afternoon the 9th of January.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
I had a cellar that the weather was bad. It was snowing and it didn't look as though I would get back to Washington.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
That day as I had planned, who told me that you had issued a telephone call?

26:57.000 --> 27:07.000
From a woman who had stated that Senator McCarthy and Mr. God were anxious to get in touch with her.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
So the she had indicated that she didn't know where I was.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
I wasn't particularly anxious to receive the call because I felt so new what it was to be about.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
Never the less I told her to tell Mr. God where I was.

27:22.000 --> 27:31.000
I received a telephone call from the car at about three o'clock or three 15 in the afternoon of January 9th.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
The public quickly discussed where it came.

27:37.000 --> 27:48.000
One paid a call for pay wishes to get behind it and to be heard in for an inclusion in the annual report of the committee.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
And the problem concerned with fright of shine.

27:54.000 --> 28:09.000
He told me with written shine that shine had gone to New York on leave for the weekend and has been advised that he had the return on Saturday night to be available for KPM on Monday next day.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
And he indicated to me that it's combed.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
I was very anxious to get a hold of me about it.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I wanted to talk to me about it.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I wanted to know what I could do about it.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
The car wanted to know if there was anything I could do about it.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I presented Mr. Carr.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
I tried to put them on by saying that I was helpless for an average.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
I couldn't do anything that I wasn't spending on.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
I asked him if he was in the first telling Mr. Cone where I was.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
It comes within New York.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I was in the first and the first one.

28:37.000 --> 28:43.000
If he wasn't he'd be further telling Mr. Cone where I was long enough to let me complete checking out at a hotel.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
This time he was in the office of the room.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
I did not want the co-hidden food to get him a co-efficient.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Tell him no, you may not tell Cone where I am.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
Because I didn't want to be in the position of refusing to use the phone call and make that number.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
However, I did go to a boy's call because I was sure about it.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
Mr. Carr called with me to terminate shortly thereafter.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
In a few moments I received another telephone call.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
I picked up the phone and heard Mr. Cone's voice on the other hand.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
I said hello and I heard him say hello, gone or something without effect.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
And I very much just didn't sit down to see.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I met a hundred people there.

29:35.000 --> 29:41.000
Do you recall the incident of the week of January 11th, Mr. Adam?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Yes, sir.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
Will you relate to the committee that is? Are the incidents of that week?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Where is the week of January 11th?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Mr. Cone talked to me.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I have to accept the question to the reference camp Gordon.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
One of the only exact number of days.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
The sign would be required to refer there.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
One of the note is that it is necessary to sign the number of votes.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
It says that the committee would need sign for committee work.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
No one to know.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
The name of the person I could give him to be his conduct.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Contact for getting signed on the camp board.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
I told him that there was going to be no reputation in the board picked situation in camp Gordon.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
And then he found that we had to meet a complete authority over sign.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
I was still concerned after...

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
I am scared.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
I am scared.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
I am scared.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
I am scared.
