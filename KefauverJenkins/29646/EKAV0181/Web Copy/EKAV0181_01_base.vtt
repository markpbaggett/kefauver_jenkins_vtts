WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What do you have, long?

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Yeah, I have to.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.400
Senator Munger's rather alone there at the Long Committee

00:08.400 --> 00:09.000
table.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Senator Conner, may I have a recap?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.600
Now he is calling his order and there's the flight

00:15.600 --> 00:16.600
to the afternoon.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.000
Committee Council, Jenkins takes his place

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
to side, Senator Munger.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
The plane is going to be in a hurry.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
The flight is going to be in a hurry.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
While they are waiting, you can have a more democratic

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
meeting.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
The forum can be present here.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Let's return to our studio to cut the country

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
to permit our state to identify themselves.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
The Intercom to the area of the VBC Television Department.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
The Lesser Form of the Vercut of Columbia,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
59th Century, the brand new brand new store,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Elections and Avenue, between

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
and the gradients.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
We will interrupt it by the explanation of my 10-minute

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
period.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
The last, as it surely calls, is what got in

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
beyond the period of January 20th.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Over to some unnamed data on the occasion of a telephone

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
call with George Sikowski, which, if the chair and the

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
teacher answered correctly, did not involve what you considered

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
to be any improper means on the part of Mr.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Carr.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
He simply said that at the time of the occurred, he thought it was

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
a bit unusual.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
That was a great stir.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I will give you a big talk in the next room.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Mr. Sikowski, you were in the conference.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Mr. Sikowski, you were not in witness at the first time

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
with time to determine whether or not you were going to be

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
getting Mr. Carr.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Will you take your name me now or your files?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
And what date was that, by the way, if you haven't?

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
I found Mr. Sikowski, as I remember, on the case of

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
February and on the Trump's February and on the 15th

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
or so.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
However, the fifth of February, at least then, there has

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
been nothing that has the time and place.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Taking place, you can come to the infact around the part of

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Carr.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And we will move down to the present date from the fifth of

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
February and specify the fifth date and the next year of

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
the first action or conversation on Carr's part as

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
you are waiting to get in the conference, or the late

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
concise date that is what it was enough to intimidate

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
you.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
Well, my call was because people always knew about the

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Carr's urgent.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
I have stayed to, I thought they were, I did not think that

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
himself would come to the threat.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So, we're going to make them the following.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
The thousandth year I think is the February 50th.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
That is correct.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Will you keep going coming down to Ardenay and tell us the

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
weight of the February and faith in New York?

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
On February 18th.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
February 18th, on the occasion of this week's event.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
I was told by Mr. Home that I would have no longer,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
that she could no longer negotiate with me, that it was

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Mr. Carr or Sir Paul Hayden with whom I would have to

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
negotiate.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, there's no way can Mr. Carr's hardest,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
nearly for the purpose of showing the dinner and now

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
these things are out.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, well, he's been going 18th and he's gone moving

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
to Ardenay and he's gone.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
When Mr. Carr has been first in debt to himself improperly

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
into the uninfected Carr, so to give it to date and

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
might belong my vision.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
When you were able to find that thought, Mr. Carr,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
tell us something on the number of occasions.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
On the vote of Marantini, so that he thanked his team,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
that was important for the Ardenay,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
was important to me.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
He made it clear that I had to come to

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
when he breathed the need of the net of a building for lunch.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
And he gives it.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Well, there's the lunch.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I don't recall the time I picked him up as his office

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
first to mount.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
But in any event, after lunch, he told me

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
to go to the town of Ardenay.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
So, by the track, a long lunch.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
That, and...

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I don't know.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
No, just not a point of what I remember.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
I call it a fair decision to meet the first

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
issues of Mr. Ardenay and Mr. Carr.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Even the last day, the last day,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
the last day, the last day, the last day,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
the last day, the last day, the last day,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
the last day, the last day, the last day,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
the last day, the last day, the last day, the last day,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
the last day, the last day, the last day, the last day,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
the last day, the last day, the last day, the last day,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
the last day, the last day, the last day, the last day

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
the last day, the last day, the last day, the last day,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
the last day, the last day, the last day, yesterday,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
the last day yesterday, the last day.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.500
The last day, the last day, the last day, the last day,

05:04.500 --> 05:06.000
yesterday, the last day, the very last day, the last day,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.200
the last day, the last day, the last day, the last day,

05:07.200 --> 05:07.960
the last day, the last day, the last day,

05:07.960 --> 05:09.360
the last day, the last day, the last day, the last day

05:09.360 --> 05:11.400
the last day, the last day, the last day, radical investigation,

05:11.440 --> 05:14.260
based army on that case.

05:14.260 --> 05:16.260
The last classification Mr. Chairman,

05:16.260 --> 05:31.720
There was

05:31.720 --> 05:52.700
I mean it was

06:52.700 --> 06:54.700
now, right?

06:54.700 --> 06:55.700
Yes.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.700
Mr. Adams, I know you'll fight me at my scheduled

06:58.700 --> 07:00.700
persistence, but you are about to go to.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.700
I'm about to go to.

07:02.700 --> 07:07.700
You recognize, when you and I were young men out there in the early 30s,

07:07.700 --> 07:13.700
about to put it was played by guns, by gunstorms, by

07:13.700 --> 07:18.700
defecations, by demonstrators, humanity to survive.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.700
Most of those difficulties and counter-dumbs and

07:21.700 --> 07:24.700
consequences came with the kind of resistance people.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.700
It's just been all the time.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.700
Now, so far it's over the day now.

07:28.700 --> 07:31.700
And, over half time, a little perseverance

07:31.700 --> 07:34.700
and patience on its effectiveness, but I think we must

07:34.700 --> 07:38.700
stick with my support now and I just hope that it can be

07:38.700 --> 07:40.700
human-right-round and have a clean.

07:40.700 --> 07:43.700
Anything with that is an ancient of a threat.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.700
Am I incorrect in you calling your direct testimony to the

07:47.700 --> 07:51.700
effect system in recounting that yesterday or

07:51.700 --> 07:54.700
24, the luncheon and the number of those.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.700
You stated that Carl is reporting to you in front of a

07:58.700 --> 08:01.700
progress report in the direction of placating

08:01.700 --> 08:04.700
the parties in coal and that you felt that that time,

08:04.700 --> 08:08.700
Carl had no personal interest in shine, but was

08:08.700 --> 08:12.700
rather serving as an intermediary sign of the heavy threat.

08:12.700 --> 08:18.700
He's not so much of an intermediary trying to make peace

08:18.700 --> 08:25.700
for those impeccions, passing on to meet his evaluation

08:25.700 --> 08:29.700
or for takes beyond.

08:29.700 --> 08:33.700
On the left, though it would interpretation as his understanding

08:33.700 --> 08:37.700
of what may have been the opinion of the coal,

08:37.700 --> 08:40.700
rather than he wanted to.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.700
I think so.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.700
And the weather on the time was determined whether it was

08:44.700 --> 08:48.700
his father, Mr. Carl had his relationship to

08:48.700 --> 08:51.700
his associates on the committee.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.700
A statistician who proved rather than knowledge is to

08:53.700 --> 08:57.700
the position that you had with your associates to be honest.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.700
You never received a certificate of advice, you would

08:59.700 --> 09:02.700
have a good way to initiate phone calls of Mr.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.700
Thorne and say him a different luncheon, he was calling

09:05.700 --> 09:08.700
and he would have to keep made sense because you had

09:08.700 --> 09:11.700
a business with a committee and you felt that was

09:11.700 --> 09:13.700
in your mind a bit.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.700
You were not in any way doing that because you were trying

09:15.700 --> 09:18.700
to call out here, is it not considerable?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.700
Mr. Kyle, here's the strategy.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.700
It's conversing with you, most in the same fight in the

09:23.700 --> 09:27.700
truth and rest of people may remember his development.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.700
It's considerable, sir.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.700
It's not considerable.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.700
If you would not be prepared to deny that, I apologize to you

09:34.700 --> 09:36.700
at the moment.

09:36.700 --> 09:40.700
Of course, I began to feel and by certainly felt after

09:40.700 --> 09:44.700
syndrome copies, childhood and family

09:44.700 --> 09:48.700
published, what it was, let the pattern begin

09:48.700 --> 09:50.700
more clear.

09:50.700 --> 09:54.700
It is wrong for an agent to transmit threats in

09:54.700 --> 09:59.700
the name and the incident to the next week,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.700
for the coincidence of the fifth of March.

10:01.700 --> 10:02.700
Well, certainly.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.700
For this, I'm giving you a new date and a new

10:04.700 --> 10:07.700
account and a new report that will pass the

10:07.700 --> 10:10.700
race for March 4th, on the basis of that, certainly

10:10.700 --> 10:12.700
conceivably, as Twitter said, a friendly

10:12.700 --> 10:15.700
discussion with you and the common issues with you and

10:15.700 --> 10:19.700
these days of trying to have respectable and peaceful

10:19.700 --> 10:22.700
relations between the 20th.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.700
Well, the great difference between the publication

10:25.700 --> 10:27.700
and the Spanish Macinty's, number answer.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.700
How do you like my thoughts?

10:28.700 --> 10:29.700
March 4th.

10:29.700 --> 10:30.700
Yes, sir.

10:30.700 --> 10:34.700
And let's say for the shadow of the Chiquai

10:34.700 --> 10:38.700
Meekens, I presume we're published with his

10:38.700 --> 10:40.700
observation.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.700
I presume we're written by him and those men are

10:43.700 --> 10:44.700
false.

10:44.700 --> 10:48.700
They are so false that they're dating

10:48.700 --> 10:51.700
false in my line from my knowledge.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.700
Very well, now, before they get to March 12th,

10:54.700 --> 10:57.700
they will show understanding up until that date.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.700
There are no actions on the father's file which

11:00.700 --> 11:02.700
at the time they were made.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.700
Could these be interpreted by you as the

11:05.700 --> 11:09.700
search for the army, as the efforts to intimidate

11:09.700 --> 11:12.700
the army, or as the improper means for

11:12.700 --> 11:14.700
the influence of the decisions of the army?

11:14.700 --> 11:15.700
How far so much so?

11:15.700 --> 11:18.700
Well, although it's a, we still have a week,

11:18.700 --> 11:21.700
which is much, much, much, 12th, maybe there's some of

11:21.700 --> 11:22.700
that there are a little number.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.700
Okay, and one time, I told one, I had at least

11:25.700 --> 11:28.700
one telephone conversation with Mr.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.700
Carr, not about the age of March.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.700
Very good.

11:31.700 --> 11:32.700
That's all the process.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.700
You wish he was urging me to come up and say

11:34.700 --> 11:37.700
him, telling me you can say he has come up yesterday

11:37.700 --> 11:38.700
and you haven't done it.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.700
You said you've come up to 84, you haven't done it.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.700
This is my last offer, friends.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.700
I didn't know exactly what he meant, but

11:46.700 --> 11:48.700
it was a strange thing today.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.700
Would you want to get in place?

11:51.700 --> 11:54.700
Mr. Carr, before the American published on the

11:54.700 --> 11:56.700
page, you said the statement that you've been saying is

11:56.700 --> 11:58.700
you don't know what it meant?

11:58.700 --> 12:02.700
Well, I, uh, surely I don't know what it meant.

12:02.700 --> 12:03.700
I didn't do it.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.700
I have no more answers for Mr. Carr, and I have him,

12:06.700 --> 12:09.700
all the lift to the party to the future.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.700
All I've told him today is, you are normally

12:11.700 --> 12:13.700
too adamant to be including yourself,

12:13.700 --> 12:14.700
or friend of mine.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.700
I'm just looking very true.

12:16.700 --> 12:21.700
And I don't feel I let the executive agency change any of this.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.700
I'm engaged and attacked by people without

12:23.700 --> 12:25.700
specifying the charges.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.700
Any more than I've used congressional committees to do this.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.700
congressional committees have been really

12:31.700 --> 12:34.700
criticized by the press for having done it.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.700
I would expect the press to ask the same way

12:36.700 --> 12:38.700
if the executive agency do it.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.700
I hope that it is not done, so I hope

12:41.700 --> 12:43.700
there is an easy, reasonable specification

12:43.700 --> 12:45.700
charges against Mr. Carr, or which role?

12:45.700 --> 12:48.700
In the interest of frequency and purpose.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.700
Now, we'll have the telephone conversation

12:50.700 --> 12:52.700
with you for another time.

12:52.700 --> 12:53.700
I don't understand.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.700
Do you want to say in your old-to-do deal

12:55.700 --> 12:58.700
that that should be considered as an invite to Mr. Carr?

12:58.700 --> 12:59.700
On the east.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.700
Well, I felt that there was an indication

13:02.700 --> 13:07.700
to me that I didn't get up there, the, uh,

13:07.700 --> 13:10.700
the charge efforts to assist Mr. Carr,

13:10.700 --> 13:13.700
Mr. Cooke, Mr. Cooke, is efforts that he,

13:13.700 --> 13:15.700
I'm interested in telling me that he was

13:16.700 --> 13:20.700
undertaking to, uh, to meet him as the, uh,

13:20.700 --> 13:24.700
higher, higher, he'd be tempered,

13:24.700 --> 13:26.700
to spend a little bit of exciting

13:26.700 --> 13:28.700
against the Army, with things.

13:28.700 --> 13:32.700
And I, uh, you know, there's something

13:32.700 --> 13:34.700
I'm also like that for nothing.

13:34.700 --> 13:37.700
My time is as far as the starting

13:37.700 --> 13:39.700
and the March 5th, then, will be resumed.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.700
I'll wait for Senator West.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.700
Uh, Mr. Adams, I would like to resume

13:46.700 --> 13:50.700
the previous line of questioning,

13:50.700 --> 13:53.700
and I would like to invite your attention

13:53.700 --> 13:58.700
to the charge at 25 on page 12 of the

13:58.700 --> 14:03.700
bill of the six years committed by Mr. Cooke,

14:03.700 --> 14:06.700
Mr. Carr and Senator McCarty.

14:06.700 --> 14:10.700
On page 25, page 12 of the thinking

14:11.700 --> 14:13.700
of his documents that are referred to

14:13.700 --> 14:15.700
I told him.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.700
On or about October 21, 1953,

14:18.700 --> 14:21.700
Mr. Adams renewed his suggestion

14:21.700 --> 14:24.700
that the Subcommittee conduct an investigation

14:24.700 --> 14:27.700
of the Navy and Air Force

14:27.700 --> 14:29.700
and drop the investigation of his

14:29.700 --> 14:31.700
departs end of school.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.700
Mr. Adams, is that

14:34.700 --> 14:36.700
allegation true or false?

14:36.700 --> 14:39.700
The allegation is false.

14:39.700 --> 14:43.700
Now, paragraph 26 on page 13,

14:43.700 --> 14:47.700
again, referring to the same document,

14:47.700 --> 14:49.700
says tonight's vote.

14:49.700 --> 14:53.700
On or about November 6, 1953,

14:53.700 --> 14:56.700
look at Stephen and Mr. Adams

14:56.700 --> 14:58.700
suggested that the Navy, Air Force,

14:58.700 --> 15:00.700
and Defense and Stalinism,

15:00.700 --> 15:02.700
as Defense and Stalinist,

15:02.700 --> 15:04.700
would be a appropriate object

15:04.700 --> 15:06.700
of an investigation.

15:06.700 --> 15:10.700
Instead of their administration of the Army,

15:10.700 --> 15:14.700
and Mr. Adams offered to supply information

15:14.700 --> 15:17.700
about this end of school.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.700
First, Mr. Adams, if you ever hear Mr. Stephen

15:20.700 --> 15:23.700
make such a suggestion to any

15:23.700 --> 15:25.700
son of yours on the subcommittee

15:25.700 --> 15:29.700
or to any of the subcommittee's plans.

15:29.700 --> 15:34.700
Mark, did you ever make such a suggestion

15:35.700 --> 15:38.700
to any of the senators on the subcommittee

15:38.700 --> 15:42.700
or any of the subcommittee's plans?

15:42.700 --> 15:45.700
First, did you, Mr. Adams,

15:45.700 --> 15:47.700
ever offer to supply information

15:47.700 --> 15:49.700
about the Navy, Air Force,

15:49.700 --> 15:52.700
or Defense, establishment's profit?

15:52.700 --> 15:55.700
To the subcommittee for their investigation.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.700
I am not saying that I'm not saying that.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.700
Now, it's weird.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.700
We're referring back to the

16:04.700 --> 16:07.700
allegation in paragraph 26

16:07.700 --> 16:10.700
that I read to you just a moment ago.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.700
Is that allegation true or false?

16:16.700 --> 16:20.700
Paragraph 27 on page 13,

16:20.700 --> 16:24.700
and I continue to read from this same document.

16:24.700 --> 16:27.700
State and I quote,

16:27.700 --> 16:30.700
honor of bottom of November 14, 1953.

16:30.700 --> 16:34.700
Mr. Adams advised that in his opinion,

16:34.700 --> 16:37.700
the time is right for the investigation

16:37.700 --> 16:39.700
to turn to the Navy and to full.

16:39.700 --> 16:44.700
The stratum is that statement true or false.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.700
We're referring again to the same document.

16:46.700 --> 16:52.700
Paragraph 28 page 13, states, and I quote,

16:52.700 --> 16:55.700
honor of bottom of November 17, 1953.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.700
Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams renew their request

16:59.700 --> 17:01.700
that the subcommittee should investigate

17:01.700 --> 17:05.700
the Navy and Air Force, and, quote,

17:05.700 --> 17:08.700
the human stratum here, Mr. Stevens,

17:08.700 --> 17:10.700
makes such a request to any member

17:10.700 --> 17:13.700
of the subcommittee or subcommittee spent.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.700
No, chair, I did not.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.700
As far as you're concerned, personally, Mr. Adams,

17:18.700 --> 17:22.700
is this statement true or false?

17:23.700 --> 17:25.700
Recall your attention now to page 13,

17:25.700 --> 17:28.700
same document, paragraph 29,

17:28.700 --> 17:31.700
states, and I quote.

17:31.700 --> 17:35.700
Honor of bottom of November 30, 1953,

17:35.700 --> 17:38.700
Mr. Adams made a specific suggestion

17:38.700 --> 17:41.700
and offer of assistance in switching

17:41.700 --> 17:44.700
the subcommittee's quote from his department

17:44.700 --> 17:46.700
to another branch of the service,

17:46.700 --> 17:48.700
and it's false.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.700
Does this statement Mr. Adams true or false?

17:50.700 --> 17:54.700
Page 13, again, the same document,

17:54.700 --> 17:57.700
paragraph 30, states, and I quote.

17:57.700 --> 18:01.700
Honor of bottom of November 9, 1953,

18:01.700 --> 18:03.700
Mr. Adams, again, urged the subcommittee

18:03.700 --> 18:07.700
to investigate security risks in the Air Force,

18:07.700 --> 18:09.700
and offered specific information

18:09.700 --> 18:12.700
and return for certain information

18:12.700 --> 18:14.700
he desired from us,

18:14.700 --> 18:17.700
in post-falling a further investigation

18:17.700 --> 18:20.700
of news department and the post.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.700
The human-street Adams urged that the subcommittee

18:23.700 --> 18:25.700
investigate security risks

18:25.700 --> 18:30.700
in the Air Force Honor of bottom of December 9, 1953.

18:30.700 --> 18:31.700
I did not.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.700
Did you offer specific information

18:34.700 --> 18:36.700
in regard to this matter?

18:36.700 --> 18:37.700
I did not, chair.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.700
I never answered information.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.700
I wouldn't have offered it if he had had it.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.700
Mr. Jones stated on me to press

18:44.700 --> 18:47.700
on March 14th of this year

18:47.700 --> 18:52.700
in answer to a question by Larry C. Matt,

18:52.700 --> 18:55.700
but you, Mr. Adams, stated that you

18:55.700 --> 18:57.700
were trying to subcommittee

18:57.700 --> 19:00.700
with information concerning an Air Force base

19:00.700 --> 19:03.700
where there were number of suspect deviates,

19:03.700 --> 19:05.700
and you, Mr. Adams, thought this would make

19:05.700 --> 19:08.700
an excellent hearing for the subcommittee.

19:08.700 --> 19:13.700
He went on to say, and I quote Mr. Stone as follows.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.700
I might say I remembered that very clearly

19:17.700 --> 19:22.700
because Mr. Adams took off a pad of paper

19:22.700 --> 19:25.700
and drew a map of the country

19:25.700 --> 19:29.700
and divided into sections and numbers of them,

19:29.700 --> 19:32.700
one through nine, as I recall it,

19:32.700 --> 19:34.700
and told Mr. Caw and myself

19:34.700 --> 19:37.700
that if we would indicate on that map

19:37.700 --> 19:40.700
the location of the Army base

19:40.700 --> 19:42.700
was where a bomb to investigate

19:42.700 --> 19:45.700
that he would mark on that map

19:45.700 --> 19:48.700
the location of an Air Force base

19:48.700 --> 19:51.700
wherein this map existed,

19:51.700 --> 19:55.700
and that we would then be able to go after that.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.700
End of folks from Mr. Caw's statement

19:58.700 --> 20:02.700
on me to press on March 14th of this year.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.700
Is this allegation of Mr. Caw's

20:04.700 --> 20:07.700
through orself, taking his fault?

20:07.700 --> 20:10.700
That's why all my thoughts are in this time of the day.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.700
Are you back to balance the mind?

20:18.700 --> 20:19.700
Thank you.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.700
Stand at it.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.700
The trial of the division is the wrong telephone call

20:25.700 --> 20:28.700
of the people of this group of Caw's case.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.700
It is immediately with the Caw's case

20:30.700 --> 20:34.700
that eventually between the fishing Caw's case

20:34.700 --> 20:36.700
and the other Caw's case,

20:36.700 --> 20:39.700
and we'll be there for a meeting of issues.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.700
You will be both with Mr. Caw's case.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.700
Mr. Caw's case was a closing capacity

20:45.700 --> 20:46.700
luncheon in the merchant's club

20:46.700 --> 20:48.700
on the 17th of November's death.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.700
What about the other cases?

20:50.700 --> 20:51.700
There was no other occasion

20:51.700 --> 20:53.700
when I was a Mr. Caw's case president

20:53.700 --> 20:55.700
that I now remember.

20:55.700 --> 20:59.700
So you'll be in the one-on-one construction in New York.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.700
Yes, Mr. Caw's, who is president?

21:01.700 --> 21:03.700
Yes, Mr. Caw's.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.700
I know that the disconnection is just testimony

21:06.700 --> 21:09.700
that you went to the method that you were looking

21:09.700 --> 21:11.700
or to have lunch with Frank Caw along

21:11.700 --> 21:13.700
at any occasion.

21:13.700 --> 21:16.700
Now, the innovation of that.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.700
I've resumed that on occasions

21:20.700 --> 21:23.700
there were luncheon stations with the Caw along the tail,

21:23.700 --> 21:25.700
and the dining room.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.700
There were one lunch in the Italian hotel

21:28.700 --> 21:30.700
on the 15th of December

21:30.700 --> 21:32.700
and the half-day in the state and the standard

21:32.700 --> 21:35.700
car having said that the fifth moment

21:35.700 --> 21:37.700
is the only one I remember.

21:37.700 --> 21:38.700
Whether it be stuck in the room,

21:38.700 --> 21:39.700
or the lunch room,

21:39.700 --> 21:42.700
at the counter, I'm sure he'll get it.

21:43.700 --> 21:44.700
I don't know at all.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.700
There means things that I don't know at all.

21:46.700 --> 21:47.700
Well, why are these the first things

21:47.700 --> 21:49.700
for all the more reason?

21:49.700 --> 21:52.700
Because in my mind, I'll get this.

21:52.700 --> 21:56.700
Oh, because the creation of a socially bent

21:56.700 --> 21:58.700
will probably fight

21:58.700 --> 22:00.700
by the way after the five-five days

22:00.700 --> 22:03.700
where the half-the-calorie of the store

22:03.700 --> 22:05.700
costs the enjoy on medication.

22:05.700 --> 22:06.700
Yes.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.700
So, there was the five nights

22:08.700 --> 22:11.700
the store was on gas and restaurants.

22:11.700 --> 22:12.700
Yes.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.700
Like a merchant's car, the meanwhile.

22:14.700 --> 22:15.700
Yes.

22:15.700 --> 22:16.700
And the caravans in Washington

22:16.700 --> 22:17.700
were sent to the method

22:17.700 --> 22:18.700
into the dining room.

22:18.700 --> 22:19.700
Yes.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.700
We give it a lot of lunch and that

22:22.700 --> 22:24.700
mission is to call you the service.

22:24.700 --> 22:25.700
Yes.

22:25.700 --> 22:27.700
And which is quite a worry,

22:27.700 --> 22:28.700
father and son,

22:28.700 --> 22:29.700
your patience for

22:29.700 --> 22:31.700
child and son.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.700
Any feud with developing is going on.

22:34.700 --> 22:35.700
Childish husband and son.

22:35.700 --> 22:38.700
Childish, rather any feud is what

22:38.700 --> 22:39.700
they call it.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.700
Well, we will call her

22:41.700 --> 22:42.700
and get straight to the job.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.700
But these developments were in time.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.700
I was into the arms there

22:47.700 --> 22:49.700
a total of stuff.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.700
I think 12 days,

22:51.700 --> 22:53.700
I'm doing October in November,

22:53.700 --> 22:55.700
and the day is always day temperate.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.700
And, um,

22:57.700 --> 22:59.700
on about 57,

22:59.700 --> 23:01.700
the four vacations we have lunch together.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.700
And, um,

23:03.700 --> 23:05.700
we went for the moment together.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.700
We have lunch together

23:07.700 --> 23:09.700
for the month.

23:09.700 --> 23:10.700
When I think we have lunch together

23:10.700 --> 23:13.700
in cash and we're at about 57 days,

23:13.700 --> 23:15.700
we've been in emergency

23:15.700 --> 23:17.700
for twice within a month.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.700
And another time,

23:18.700 --> 23:20.700
we've been in a mess.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.700
Uh,

23:21.700 --> 23:23.700
what Mr. Cohen will

23:23.700 --> 23:26.700
throw to Mr. Carly and his

23:26.700 --> 23:28.700
terrible woman on the air known.

23:28.700 --> 23:29.700
Uh, all of a sudden,

23:29.700 --> 23:33.700
I think that was on November 23rd.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.700
Uh,

23:35.700 --> 23:38.700
so what is the price of that each one evening?

23:38.700 --> 23:39.700
And then, uh,

23:39.700 --> 23:40.700
I was on November 24th,

23:40.700 --> 23:41.700
24th last year,

23:41.700 --> 23:43.700
and the McCarthy had had a

23:43.700 --> 23:44.700
television broadcast.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.700
I was not listening very to the evenings,

23:46.700 --> 23:47.700
but I went over to

23:47.700 --> 23:48.700
11th area in May to watch

23:48.700 --> 23:50.700
with television broadcast

23:50.700 --> 23:51.700
and first of all,

23:51.700 --> 23:53.700
to last in a fairly large

23:53.700 --> 23:54.700
five-to-five pictures.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.700
So, then, how does that?

23:56.700 --> 23:58.700
Now, what's this talk about?

23:58.700 --> 24:00.700
And, uh,

24:00.700 --> 24:02.700
on another occasion,

24:02.700 --> 24:03.700
one or two occasions,

24:03.700 --> 24:04.700
first of all,

24:04.700 --> 24:05.700
to keep the hearing

24:05.700 --> 24:06.700
in New York,

24:06.700 --> 24:07.700
who's right up town together

24:07.700 --> 24:08.700
on one occasion,

24:08.700 --> 24:09.700
we stopped in the allowing

24:09.700 --> 24:10.700
to the world

24:10.700 --> 24:12.700
or the story of an hour or so.

24:12.700 --> 24:13.700
On one occasion,

24:13.700 --> 24:14.700
what is the apartment

24:14.700 --> 24:15.700
of the French and the Democratic?

24:15.700 --> 24:16.700
Well, the only reason

24:16.700 --> 24:17.700
we should be proud of

24:17.700 --> 24:18.700
is for the first two days.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.700
One secretary seemed

24:20.700 --> 24:21.700
with his own sense.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.700
I think the question

24:23.700 --> 24:24.700
whether he had a good deal

24:24.700 --> 24:26.700
of his discussion back

24:26.700 --> 24:27.700
and forth over here

24:27.700 --> 24:28.700
at the time,

24:28.700 --> 24:29.700
wasn't in the nature

24:29.700 --> 24:31.700
of the river in ten days.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.700
And he's got up

24:33.700 --> 24:34.700
to see it and he left

24:34.700 --> 24:35.700
in full close expressions

24:35.700 --> 24:37.700
to you,

24:37.700 --> 24:38.700
which, uh, when we do

24:38.700 --> 24:39.700
the cold winter,

24:39.700 --> 24:41.700
have a significant

24:41.700 --> 24:43.700
speciality wasn't intended.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.700
So, what I'm trying

24:45.700 --> 24:46.700
to rationalize

24:46.700 --> 24:48.700
is the alleged

24:48.700 --> 24:49.700
heart's grace

24:49.700 --> 24:51.700
that our hands, uh,

24:51.700 --> 24:52.700
condying,

24:52.700 --> 24:53.700
promised to devibition

24:53.700 --> 24:54.700
column that he was going

24:54.700 --> 24:55.700
to wreck the army

24:55.700 --> 24:56.700
and that's what it means.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.700
Against the very

24:57.700 --> 24:58.700
interesting

24:58.700 --> 24:59.700
and almost continuous

24:59.700 --> 25:01.700
social backdrop,

25:01.700 --> 25:02.700
which would remind

25:02.700 --> 25:03.700
one of that old play

25:03.700 --> 25:04.700
that the popularity

25:04.700 --> 25:06.700
of his old friendly enemy,

25:06.700 --> 25:07.700
and that perhaps

25:07.700 --> 25:08.700
some of the theme

25:08.700 --> 25:09.700
would be taken out

25:09.700 --> 25:10.700
as well.

25:10.700 --> 25:12.700
That's all, Mr. Chair.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.700
I'm just out of it.

25:15.700 --> 25:16.700
Mr. Adam,

25:16.700 --> 25:17.700
not only would

25:17.700 --> 25:18.700
it interest to be

25:18.700 --> 25:19.700
questioning

25:19.700 --> 25:20.700
of the chair of Mr.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.700
Inspector Mr. Car.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.700
Now, uh,

25:24.700 --> 25:26.700
our counsel

25:26.700 --> 25:27.700
for the committee says

25:27.700 --> 25:28.700
he charges to made up,

25:28.700 --> 25:30.700
uh, very quickly,

25:30.700 --> 25:32.700
at his request,

25:32.700 --> 25:33.700
and I think Mr. Wells,

25:33.700 --> 25:34.700
at some point,

25:34.700 --> 25:35.700
verified the fact

25:35.700 --> 25:36.700
that they were made up

25:36.700 --> 25:37.700
quickly.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.700
In all frankness, uh,

25:39.700 --> 25:41.700
if you, uh,

25:41.700 --> 25:43.700
had a chance

25:43.700 --> 25:45.700
now to revise those charges,

25:45.700 --> 25:46.700
would you take Mr.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.700
Car's name out?

25:47.700 --> 25:48.700
Sure, I was not

25:48.700 --> 25:50.700
for the principal reason

25:50.700 --> 25:51.700
of the number

25:51.700 --> 25:52.700
and, uh, which he permitted

25:52.700 --> 25:53.700
to be published

25:53.700 --> 25:54.700
over the line-in,

25:54.700 --> 25:55.700
as much as anything else,

25:55.700 --> 25:56.700
sir, which he permitted

25:56.700 --> 25:57.700
to be published over his name,

25:57.700 --> 26:00.700
and which, uh,

26:00.700 --> 26:02.700
suggests his actions

26:02.700 --> 26:03.700
on my part,

26:03.700 --> 26:04.700
is not true.

26:04.700 --> 26:07.700
Uh, that was the

26:07.700 --> 26:08.700
hardest thing of all,

26:08.700 --> 26:09.700
for me to say,

26:09.700 --> 26:10.700
uh,

26:10.700 --> 26:12.700
and, uh,

26:12.700 --> 26:13.700
and, uh,

26:13.700 --> 26:15.700
the other, uh,

26:15.700 --> 26:17.700
the other, uh,

26:17.700 --> 26:18.700
uh, investigations,

26:18.700 --> 26:19.700
I think,

26:19.700 --> 26:20.700
I suspect,

26:20.700 --> 26:21.700
which,

26:21.700 --> 26:22.700
be clear,

26:22.700 --> 26:23.700
it's just one time to decide

26:23.700 --> 26:24.700
whether they should be

26:24.700 --> 26:26.700
in here or come out.

26:26.700 --> 26:27.700
Uh, what's the memorandum

26:27.700 --> 26:28.700
you're referring to?

26:28.700 --> 26:30.700
I'm referring to those memorandas.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.700
Uh, probably some 12th of March,

26:32.700 --> 26:33.700
therefore,

26:33.700 --> 26:35.700
uh, which refers to

26:35.700 --> 26:36.700
actions on my part,

26:36.700 --> 26:37.700
the work of the shine,

26:37.700 --> 26:38.700
actions,

26:38.700 --> 26:40.700
fishing of action.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.700
You feel that you're going to

26:41.700 --> 26:42.700
develop something

26:42.700 --> 26:43.700
in the future with respect

26:43.700 --> 26:44.700
in Mr. Carr?

26:44.700 --> 26:45.700
Well,

26:45.700 --> 26:46.700
do you feel that you've

26:46.700 --> 26:48.700
developed something in the future

26:48.700 --> 26:50.700
with respect in Mr. Carr?

26:50.700 --> 26:52.700
I don't think I understand

26:52.700 --> 26:53.700
the yet.

26:53.700 --> 26:54.700
Well,

26:54.700 --> 26:55.700
there are any charges

26:55.700 --> 26:56.700
that you plan to make

26:56.700 --> 26:57.700
against Mr. Carr

26:57.700 --> 26:59.700
or that you haven't yet made?

26:59.700 --> 27:00.700
No, sir.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.700
Because, if they were,

27:01.700 --> 27:04.700
I think you should make them now.

27:04.700 --> 27:05.700
And they aren't,

27:05.700 --> 27:06.700
and is that correct?

27:06.700 --> 27:07.700
He says they need

27:07.700 --> 27:08.700
to annihilate his needs

27:08.700 --> 27:10.700
and this is the memorandum.

27:10.700 --> 27:11.700
Mr. Carr?

27:11.700 --> 27:14.700
Oh, specifically,

27:14.700 --> 27:16.700
on December 9, 1953,

27:16.700 --> 27:18.700
I noticed a memorandum

27:18.700 --> 27:19.700
from Frank Carr

27:19.700 --> 27:21.700
to send him a car to

27:21.700 --> 27:22.700
him.

27:22.700 --> 27:23.700
He says again today,

27:23.700 --> 27:24.700
John Adams came down here

27:24.700 --> 27:25.700
after the hearing,

27:25.700 --> 27:27.700
and using clever phrases

27:27.700 --> 27:29.700
trying to find out

27:29.700 --> 27:30.700
what's there for us

27:30.700 --> 27:31.700
if he and Steven did

27:31.700 --> 27:33.700
something for shine.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.700
He refers to shine

27:35.700 --> 27:36.700
as our hostage,

27:36.700 --> 27:37.700
or the hostage

27:37.700 --> 27:39.700
whenever his name comes up.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.700
Is that statement

27:41.700 --> 27:42.700
of Mr. Carr

27:42.700 --> 27:43.700
and his memorandum

27:43.700 --> 27:44.700
to a fall?

27:44.700 --> 27:45.700
First fall.

27:45.700 --> 27:46.700
There.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.700
I would like to state one thing

27:48.700 --> 27:49.700
further.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.700
The first time in my life.

27:51.700 --> 27:52.700
Correction.

27:52.700 --> 27:53.700
And it's not the first time in my life.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.700
The first time in relationship.

27:55.700 --> 27:56.700
And with Timothy,

27:56.700 --> 27:57.700
the life and remember

27:57.700 --> 27:59.700
having heard the word hostage,

27:59.700 --> 28:00.700
was when we were

28:00.700 --> 28:01.700
more than meeting.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.700
A hostage in so far as a concern.

28:03.700 --> 28:04.700
Shine.

28:04.700 --> 28:05.700
Was when I was

28:05.700 --> 28:06.700
more than meeting.

28:06.700 --> 28:07.700
Suddenly,

28:07.700 --> 28:08.700
went through a meeting of

28:08.700 --> 28:10.700
some of the members of the community

28:10.700 --> 28:11.700
on January 22nd.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.700
With some of the friends

28:13.700 --> 28:15.700
who were still shines

28:15.700 --> 28:16.700
as a hostage.

28:16.700 --> 28:17.700
I tell them,

28:17.700 --> 28:18.700
Frank Carr,

28:18.700 --> 28:19.700
if you may,

28:19.700 --> 28:20.700
then I have to tell them,

28:20.700 --> 28:21.700
if it was truly spread

28:21.700 --> 28:22.700
great concern.

28:22.700 --> 28:23.700
I was very shocked to death.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.700
You know, I've never heard of this before.

28:25.700 --> 28:26.700
But I can remember

28:26.700 --> 28:27.700
that it did get to

28:27.700 --> 28:29.700
a very hard point to taste.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.700
It was an entirely new

28:31.700 --> 28:32.700
movement of the entire

28:32.700 --> 28:33.700
disaster.

28:33.700 --> 28:35.700
Carr says,

28:35.700 --> 28:37.700
is it that he had heard

28:37.700 --> 28:39.700
the word hostage?

28:39.700 --> 28:40.700
He said,

28:40.700 --> 28:41.700
something to be affected

28:41.700 --> 28:43.700
on the force and trade.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.700
He thought the time to talk

28:45.700 --> 28:46.700
about the economy

28:46.700 --> 28:47.700
was not coming around.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.700
But I hear it from my

28:49.700 --> 28:51.700
friend, which is much earlier.

28:51.700 --> 28:52.700
I have to lie down today.

28:52.700 --> 28:53.700
I just cannot

28:53.700 --> 28:54.700
think and file a

28:54.700 --> 28:55.700
back-to-bind recall.

28:55.700 --> 28:56.700
You want to participate,

28:56.700 --> 28:57.700
my next question.

28:57.700 --> 28:58.700
Did you ever use the word

28:58.700 --> 28:59.700
hostage to Mr. Carr

28:59.700 --> 29:00.700
with respect to Shine?

29:00.700 --> 29:01.700
Well,

29:01.700 --> 29:03.700
I think we'll find

29:03.700 --> 29:05.700
the line further on January 22nd.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.700
It may have been used

29:06.700 --> 29:08.700
if we entirely, once you

29:08.700 --> 29:10.700
try, because we saw some

29:10.700 --> 29:11.700
iron and that's who

29:11.700 --> 29:12.700
that is who that is.

29:12.700 --> 29:13.700
That's the Democratic.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.700
But prior to January 22nd,

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
I had insofar

29:16.700 --> 29:17.700
I can recall it was never

29:17.700 --> 29:18.700
used.

29:18.700 --> 29:19.700
Do you remember any

29:19.700 --> 29:20.700
specific time when you did

29:20.700 --> 29:21.700
use it?

29:21.700 --> 29:22.700
No, I don't.

29:22.700 --> 29:23.700
Do you remember any specific

29:23.700 --> 29:25.700
time when you used it with Mr.

29:25.700 --> 29:26.700
Cohn or send him a

29:26.700 --> 29:27.700
copy?

29:27.700 --> 29:28.700
Well, I'm not sure if I didn't

29:28.700 --> 29:29.700
do it with too much of

29:29.700 --> 29:30.700
the official.

29:30.700 --> 29:31.700
It's for the business.

29:31.700 --> 29:32.700
Cohn, I wasn't

29:32.700 --> 29:33.700
just done with him.

29:33.700 --> 29:34.700
So your recollection is

29:34.700 --> 29:36.700
that if you use the word

29:36.700 --> 29:38.700
hostage, you only use it

29:38.700 --> 29:39.700
for Mr. Carr and you're not

29:39.700 --> 29:40.700
sure whether you use it

29:40.700 --> 29:41.700
at all.

29:41.700 --> 29:42.700
Is that correct?

29:42.700 --> 29:43.700
Yes, Sharon, if I use it

29:43.700 --> 29:44.700
for Mr. Carr,

29:44.700 --> 29:45.700
the consequences

29:45.700 --> 29:46.700
January 22nd, which is

29:46.700 --> 29:47.700
the first time we've ever

29:47.700 --> 29:48.700
brought into the picture

29:48.700 --> 29:49.700
insofar as I can recall.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.700
And as we've only

29:51.700 --> 29:52.700
been when we were alone

29:52.700 --> 29:54.700
together because we both

29:54.700 --> 29:55.700
saw the same sort of

29:55.700 --> 29:56.700
iron and knew

29:56.700 --> 29:57.700
the development.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.700
Now, Mr.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.700
do you think that

30:01.700 --> 30:03.700
I don't want to ask a hypothetical

30:03.700 --> 30:04.700
question, and I'll leave it up

30:04.700 --> 30:05.700
to you whether you

30:05.700 --> 30:06.700
believe it is once.

30:06.700 --> 30:07.700
Do you think that just

30:07.700 --> 30:08.700
because Mr. Carr

30:08.700 --> 30:10.700
charges you with wrong

30:10.700 --> 30:12.700
doing, that you have to

30:12.700 --> 30:13.700
write to charge him with

30:13.700 --> 30:14.700
wrong doing, even

30:14.700 --> 30:16.700
not just up to that time,

30:16.700 --> 30:18.700
you did not feel that he

30:18.700 --> 30:19.700
was guilty of any wrong

30:19.700 --> 30:20.700
doing.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.700
Well, sir.

30:22.700 --> 30:24.700
It is kind of a

30:24.700 --> 30:25.700
hypothetical question, and I

30:25.700 --> 30:27.700
can only answer it

30:27.700 --> 30:28.700
in the same manner

30:28.700 --> 30:29.700
that I've answered

30:29.700 --> 30:30.700
a month, and I'm

30:30.700 --> 30:31.700
thinking of a fear

30:32.700 --> 30:34.700
that will not satisfy you.

30:34.700 --> 30:35.700
By the time

30:35.700 --> 30:36.700
Mr. McCarthy

30:36.700 --> 30:37.700
charges were out, I

30:37.700 --> 30:38.700
reviewed all of the

30:38.700 --> 30:39.700
incidents in the past

30:39.700 --> 30:40.700
two months.

30:40.700 --> 30:41.700
They seemed to be

30:41.700 --> 30:44.700
a valid pattern, which

30:44.700 --> 30:45.700
on the occasion

30:45.700 --> 30:46.700
be a service of anyone

30:46.700 --> 30:47.700
that the incident has

30:47.700 --> 30:48.700
not gotten me.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.700
Mr. Carr, what

30:49.700 --> 30:50.700
did you first do

30:50.700 --> 30:51.700
on the Army?

30:51.700 --> 30:53.700
As an employee?

30:53.700 --> 30:54.700
What?

30:54.700 --> 30:55.700
Why did you first

30:55.700 --> 30:56.700
do on the Army?

30:56.700 --> 30:57.700
Well, I was

30:57.700 --> 30:58.700
convinced he needed

30:58.700 --> 30:59.700
me.

30:59.700 --> 31:00.700
I was convinced he needed

31:00.700 --> 31:01.700
me.

31:01.700 --> 31:02.700
I was convinced in the

31:02.700 --> 31:03.700
Army as an officer.

31:03.700 --> 31:04.700
When I graduated

31:04.700 --> 31:05.700
in the College of

31:05.700 --> 31:07.700
History in 1934, I

31:07.700 --> 31:08.700
went to activity in the

31:08.700 --> 31:11.700
Army in 1942, early

31:11.700 --> 31:12.700
World War II.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.700
When did you leave the

31:13.700 --> 31:14.700
Army?

31:14.700 --> 31:15.700
I served on an

31:15.700 --> 31:16.700
activity for about three

31:16.700 --> 31:17.700
and three quarters.

31:17.700 --> 31:18.700
Years, I think my

31:18.700 --> 31:19.700
separation papers are

31:19.700 --> 31:20.700
about the first

31:20.700 --> 31:21.700
of January 1946.

31:21.700 --> 31:22.700
What brand is the

31:22.700 --> 31:23.700
service we

31:23.700 --> 31:24.700
win?

31:24.700 --> 31:25.700
My biggest

31:25.700 --> 31:26.700
French

31:26.700 --> 31:27.700
infrastructure.

31:27.700 --> 31:28.700
Well, now, I

31:28.700 --> 31:30.700
just want to

31:30.700 --> 31:31.700
come back to the

31:31.700 --> 31:32.700
Department of

31:32.700 --> 31:33.700
Defense.

31:33.700 --> 31:34.700
I can do this

31:34.700 --> 31:35.700
problem with the

31:35.700 --> 31:36.700
Census, the

31:36.700 --> 31:37.700
Football Service.

31:37.700 --> 31:38.700
I was a

31:38.700 --> 31:39.700
Attorney

31:39.700 --> 31:40.700
Disclosure, so I want

31:40.700 --> 31:41.700
you to take a

31:41.700 --> 31:42.700
very advanced

31:42.700 --> 31:43.700
on about the Census.

31:43.700 --> 31:44.700
I was supposed to

31:44.700 --> 31:45.700
serve the

31:45.700 --> 31:46.700
Army in 1949.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.700
Where

31:48.700 --> 31:49.700
you went with the

31:49.700 --> 31:50.700
Army?

31:50.700 --> 31:52.700
I was going to

31:52.700 --> 31:52.700


31:52.700 --> 31:53.700
information.

31:53.700 --> 31:54.700
I was going to

31:54.700 --> 31:55.700
get the information.

31:55.700 --> 31:56.700
I was going to

31:56.700 --> 31:57.700
get the information.
