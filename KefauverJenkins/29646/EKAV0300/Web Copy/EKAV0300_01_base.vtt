WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
The declaration of the true registration about our third largest force of india.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
So it is as I've introduced that we inform ourselves for the confirmed existence of our life

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
shuttle.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Today I have with me in the studio Mr. Adams, this is our life shuttle.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
If today it had more than a quarter of a century of the English government service and

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
the field of transportation.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
The biopsy system is our life service given in new name and 1960s.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
It is composed of two very old and underpriced systems of the US government.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
The Bureau of Biological Survey and the Bureau of Statistics.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
This is directly to the today's.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes, this time we will talk about the service in one of the oldest signs of the English government service.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
So we will be right back in 1971 because the year of the British Times,

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
the British Times is really popular with the German sports and the most effective.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
And that institution, the most effective way of working in the first year,

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
is the biopsy system, the 1885s, that is the problem in the first year of the wild life.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
The mighty bloodthirsty, the pyramids, the big game of life.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
The Bureau of Autocomstines is the most effective for the first year of the British Times.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
And it is a full-of-action.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Well, the work of the service must have increased considerably since the early days

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
as it was held in the previous sessions on wildlife by extended civilisation.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, the problems are getting a greater.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
Special wildlife service is very consistent with problems with the rest of the most effective.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
And the very likes of the C-Lion is very serious, that's the most effective.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
And maintaining our silent face during the sports race and the patients are really developing

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
to this and this and this and this and this.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
One of the greatest problems is the loss of wildlife habitat.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
A lot of power, especially in something that is left behind in the drop of the sea.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Many of them are in the sea of a lot of different species and less than that.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And they are really, really, not that much of a problem.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, I can remember when some of the sport-tooliest things that exist in most of the time

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
are like the extinction of the special species.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
I believe the situation wildlife services is very important for saving a lot of our good ones.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes, it's kind of very important.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
A lot of power is also to the common sense.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Very great things.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
That's in the drop of the sea.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
That's one of the most effective.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
The climate is engaged in large projects for the rest of the ocean and habitat.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And that's the most effective.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
The animation of the rescue thing is backland.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
The most effective is the impact species and other things that survive.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, what do you do today when the country is the one part of the country?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
One more than I have shared.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
So, it's effective loss that our basic activities with Canada and Mexico are designed to see

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
what the first-fire care of most of the snow is.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
We have more sports and sportsmen in our conservation.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Most of them are more industry than saving a lot of snow than they are until in the past.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And that's the most effective.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
And that's the most effective.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, you're certainly right, Mr. Cigillo.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Like you have a lady in sportsmen who's cooperating every way to save wildlife.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Yes, they understand that there's a force that they're supposed to do and why they're supposed to do it.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
The public waterfowl meetings with you and other services officials have conducted.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
I've been rewarded from the point of view of education.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes, they have.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Public meetings with our other agencies who don't take care of the flyers.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
You know, they bring a lot of value here.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
That's necessary.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
They can't do it in the last year.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And our own other states.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
And then how the birds fly south along with these old flyers.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
That's the most natural lake that we've ever used to be coming from.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
People who attend these meetings don't put much stuff in the front of the bird.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
And then we can move to the place where I'm so hot.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And then that waterfowl population is fine.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
People have lots of lots of other infections.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
And other activities.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
So, well, I've heard some of the, let's count.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
But when people learn that stuff, they see on their marches,

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
rather than waterfowls, such as common biolipetians.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
They won't be threatened for clothes.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Well, we are talking about the flyaway refugees,

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
but what does the service have in kind of things?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
All the French and wildlife services,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
the Madagascar, the official application of partnership and the city.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
We can see national wildlife services and the real professional wildlife services.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And in addition, there are two important firms, one of their biolipetians,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
the Cacino, the Cacino, the Cacino, the Cacino, the one of the Alabama.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
We call it the UN National Wildlife Service.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
So, other things, the refugees must be major important in the management of their work.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
So, migrating motorfowls on the phone, these may are an addition to providing water and grass.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
They want to power out, so it has to bring good energy to the house.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
How about this, to go?

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, these refugee groups, together with the refugee groups,

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
the E.A. 501, the Maliya 501 project, the E.A. 401 stopman.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
And already it's about the thousands of refugees who raise their lives

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
and that's no longer for a lobster, but a few words.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
These refugees are in a very busy place to protect the motorfowls.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
They do much better than they do at the same time,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
they share the contribution, the production, the better management, the waterfowls.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
But I'm aware of good funding around the kind of cities, refugees.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Three separate areas, besides the many sea water and projects that are clean,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
that's not right.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Yes, Canada, in the fall when the sea water is being stopped by,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
and the flood is being being dominated by public shooting.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Another project of interest is the kind of sea support that would be the work of the federal

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
505 actually at third, but in the unicorns and the sea,

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
that actually is primarily concerned with the raising of the stop.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Yes, I'm very happy with this, I'm very happy with this,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
I like the fact that it's not really a country of water.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
My other place is in the most multi-national area of the forest.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Well, the conservation department of North Carolina and Tennessee

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
also share the work of fishing, stopping and moving mountains,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
national parks and that part of the country is going through.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yes, they do.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
And the federal courts are talking about the use of various nations, fish, stuff, and stuff.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
But some of the recent and made available some $74,000 for a three-year expansion

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
for the urban capture.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
How much of that will be used this year?

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
About 21,000, that's the biggest fanfishing and actually not a fish program.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Everyone has to be one of the first to have this year back in the 1990s.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
And we also spend about $4,000,000 years here in the last year in an operation.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
200,000, 300,000 stops to do each year.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
Well, I find that about 183,000 yearly is made available to Tennessee

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
by the shipment of weapons, the weapons from the federal age

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
and wildlife restoration process.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And that's about state funds.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
It makes $244,000 for the system and the Robertson government Tennessee.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
But you tell us on this today about that work, its objectives and what it does in their life.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
The Tennessee and the Hudsonrabbit, the Columbia and Thomas, is the one who has been holding on to this.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
The latest market in the head in the country is the Batman's Manor.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
The best wildlife business in the nation.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
We've already mentioned the water carriers.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
There's a few of them out of the country, and we're using the planning to buy a box of food.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
So how about the farm game, Tokyo?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
The Batman and others in the country are used there too.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
The project is very useful for planning.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
We have to be the motor for a road, the flying and plants and the equipment.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
The good dog has to be active to be planning to help the world of equipment and games find a lot of things.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
And the Batman Robertson government, Tennessee, is also a local concern of adults.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So the study is difficult to study.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And yes, the identity is one of them.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Thank you for your time.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
You're not under the upon and doubt is going to be finding numbers.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
That is very, very good.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
You think that is not the good man of the city.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
It's a funny measure.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
You think that that's right for the hunter as well as for the dog.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Well, adult season is always good for an argument amongst hunters.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
He wants an early season.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
He wants to see a later season.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
But do you think that the hunter has come in now and you should have the right to the bottom?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
The third time the chance is on the next day.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
So I'm going to take a look at the top.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
We have to think about the top part of the better.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I love the students.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
But I'm sure you're right about that.

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
We'll be looking forward to the result of the 10 days of studies to see what it recommends in a way of contemplation.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Thank you very much for joining me and this filter and this is the director's day.

09:31.000 --> 09:41.000
And now, in the brief time remaining, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make a brief report on fully and situation as the bio-tiered watching.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
There is great confidence in official specials here in Washington that there's a full-eaten action in the field.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
It's really a minor work there.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
The United Nations organization will be successful, but it will take time.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
Very soon, the iron color is failed us and we've been taken over completely by the time.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
And well as it is required to get them in and materialize and to report them.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
And this is accomplished by an expert.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
It's stopped at positive times because the mixed-poly is invasion.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
Then we'll follow the moving back up a North Korean Communist time in 38th Carolina.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Many of our parties here feel that this bill is confused before we unaction.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
But of course, no one can tell this picture.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
It has to be, and I've known it as full-entred for four or six months.

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
In this work, we all know that we have a problem in a Southern folio with a communist agent behind a spline

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
that we are doing sabotage, causing fear and distress among their Southern folio and brothers.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
It's not the case, our problem and the fully-inventual are very great.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
Our people cannot be alarmed over the order of the President, really, in order to drive, if it is needed.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
The men who were fighting for real will come simply by my observation system.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Our armed services have been going along with a minimum of personnel.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
They just left the territory, replaced our observation booths.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
And they have taken from the stand and then taken here in the United States.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
And they replaced these numbers by our armed services that we received.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
Always, always, we must guard against the possibility of an incident by the stolen incident, with its full-rein fighting.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
We must guard against the new act, by the communist and legal lobbyists and those that are Germanists or some other partners.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
It's a question that at the end, being taken our state-guarding, that we would be foolish to do otherwise.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Even the boys out, knows that we must be prepared.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
It is more and more evident that our local teams will never be superior, and we can still be convicted on law.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
We still have that in mind and must be focused and ready.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
The greatest service, our people to ruin, is the physical failure, which is the biggest concern, hopefully, along.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
It's again buying up some modifits, which we must need at the moment.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And to be the victim of the war is still.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
And now, well, instead of disdaining, we are not supposed to reward the days.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
And we were before the invasion of the South Korea by the time.

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
Our perhaps, as Mike did by the days, we would just be supposed to go to the world before the people started in the North Korea as we are today.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
After a little too long, and as well as the manner and just the threat of the United Nations as national powers in the Middle East.

12:34.000 --> 12:44.000
At least we know that the massacres in the Middle East, they are full of spirits that will come along with an act of treatment of the threat we still have along with the people.

12:44.000 --> 12:59.000
Let me say also that this lead has had the opportunity of sitting in front of the meeting of Senator Dan Sterling, who is the lead in holding hearing reports in general, sadly, and others who are not necessarily leading.

13:00.000 --> 13:13.000
Not really, but I think it is a real life confidence that our armed establishments, I think maybe in the army, in the lean and the air force are in the very best of this confidence.

13:14.000 --> 13:23.000
The last time is up again, and again, I think Mr. Albert M. Zayn probably experienced it yesterday, because he spent some time sitting in front of the seats.

13:24.000 --> 13:32.000
Until next week, this is serious, and I hope you will be seen in this patient for involvement from your Finishes Office in our nation's capital.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Here and I, I will do it now.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Let's go on there, grateful for you.
