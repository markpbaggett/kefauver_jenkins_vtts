00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Do you know where the HMC in 1953 had investigated Fort Mama?

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
I have learned where that Fort Mama was investigated prior to the summer of 1953.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
When did Secretary Stevens come into office?

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
The State Archivist came into office and they either specularized or early March of 1953.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Do you know where the HMC in 1953 had investigated at all?

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
He was designated agency to investigate Fort Mama.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Any time I came into office.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
I know that the Secretary had Fort Mama very thoroughly investigated in the fall of 1953.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
I don't know whether he had investigated prior that summer.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
The right to Senator McCarthy had initiated his investigation.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I believe it was. Yes, I believe it was.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Senator Senator had initiated his investigation. I believe that so.

01:02.000 --> 01:23.000
Do you know whether or not the investigating agency of the Army discovered the presence of any communist or those with communist dignity as well as out of its investigation and in addition to the 33 that were uncovered by the McCarthy Committee?

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I certainly am not trying to stop anything and my answer to this question.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
But I am not in the chair of the Army for a million with the details of the Fort Mama's investigation.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
I didn't get your answer. I am not personally familiar with the details of the Fort Mama's investigation.

01:42.000 --> 01:51.000
I was... started about the time. At least the first time I was concerned about the time that I was relieved this case of life-saving.

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
The Army discovered none of the communists, no persons will question a little background in 1953.

02:00.000 --> 02:19.000
And the Senator McCarthy Committee and his staff discovered 33 with this U.S. Army man considered that a reflection of the efficiency of the investigating agency of the Army.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Mr. James, I don't have to answer that as a hypothetical question.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Because I don't believe those things are true.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I don't believe that. I don't have to answer that.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
I would say that we have been remissioned in our very important things.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
Would you further say, like that question, that I am the same you, the state general?

02:43.000 --> 02:57.000
That's the Pentagon. You, you're all received approximately a thousand calls from weepers from Senators, congressmen, others in connection with the First Medal of Army.

02:57.000 --> 03:06.000
Not a thousand calls, but Jack and a thousand cases of weep are in connection with all of the activities of the Army.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
It doesn't involve solely personnel, all the activities.

03:11.000 --> 03:25.000
How many calls from the average of weep that you say the Army received with respect to some favor our preferential treatment, whether a commissioner leaves a reference to otherwise?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Of anyone in the Army?

03:28.000 --> 03:37.000
Based on my experience, I would say that the Army received very few requests for faith.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
We get a tremendous number of requests for information.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
A very large number, but very few requests for faith.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
The chairman has no further questions. I call on him and I call on him.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
Just one of them questions. If I send it to our congressman, all you would respect.

03:59.000 --> 04:09.000
To gain a soldier, a leave of absence to go home on the count of illness and in the family, do you regard that as asking for preferential treatment?

04:09.000 --> 04:21.000
I certainly do not. Do you regard it as asking for preferential treatment? If an applicant applies for a direct submission, if he has the qualifications?

04:21.000 --> 04:30.000
I certainly do not. He is not his wife. As an American citizen to apply for a position in the Army, if he possesses the qualifications?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
His wife is privileged. I hope he does.

04:33.000 --> 04:45.000
Though, as to making applications or as to making requests, under many circumstances, there is no request for preferential treatment.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
No, there would be no request for preferential treatment in this case.

04:52.000 --> 05:03.000
Insofar as the application was concerned for a direct submission, that is not a request for preferential treatment.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
It is not a request for preferential treatment to apply for a direct submission.

05:07.000 --> 05:15.000
When we open the applicants fails, but that is the request for qualifications and in.

05:15.000 --> 05:24.000
Someone insists that disregarding those lack of qualifications that he decommissioned, that is they make requests as it is not for preferential treatment.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I would consider it a request yet.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
In the year, yesterday, the one I was generally the only one who could keep the record straight, I asked you a little out of control.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
When Senator McCracky, I think that Senator McCracky asked me from the room.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
When is somebody else, under staff, under Mr. Colton?

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
I had to call you with respect to the shy incase and I thought you answered with no.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
That was my answer, Sharon. It's still my answer.

05:54.000 --> 06:03.000
I know that in the memorandum that has been filed in the committee, that Mr. Colton is making his non-mentioned until the year 2nd of October.

06:03.000 --> 06:13.000
So I wondered about the first question to which you responded whether, as far as you had contact with Mr. Colton, as well as with others on the shy incase.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
As I understood the first question, the first question was merely, did I know Mr. Colton on a July?

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
My memory was incorrect and I admitted frankings.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That's all.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Any questions?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm just a bit nervous.

06:29.000 --> 06:47.000
For a long time, I raised about one Mr. Carl, I went towards the committee. I think it would be well to have in the record the big slam the announcement was made that he was the busy, new staff director and Blanney, formally, went towards full of the committee.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
Madam, Mr. Chairman, I don't believe you have the opportunity to hear my request.

06:58.000 --> 07:16.000
I suggest that in order to keep the record straight, that there be some evidence that this has to when Mr. Carl was appointed the announcement, when the announcement was made obvious appointment and when he formally went towards full of the committee.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I have the, that should be submitted more.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I have the committee with me.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Thank you.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Senator, I am over.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Senator, what's that?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Tanks, sir.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Nothing further.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Senator McCartney, Mr. Colton.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I have a few further questions.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Mr. River, you said that I have to call you.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I forget the date that you said you were late.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Just to refresh your recollection, actually, I have not called you.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Someone from my staff, I told you, and asked you to drop me off of the convenience list of my tracks.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
That is correct, yes, sir.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
That's my name.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Work hard, God bless.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You have the drive me to come to your office.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
And when you came to the office, I told you that Mr. Shien told you his incredible information.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I asked you what I not he was in your opinion.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
It's still how you apply for it.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
You told me about the witness background.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
He wasn't had more commission.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You told me how he should apply.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Is that correct?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
That is correct.

08:19.000 --> 08:28.000
I did say that in view of the service that I understood him to have for the Army Transport Service in 1946, I thought he was properly.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
So you don't feel that I was asking for any special consideration for him?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
No, sir.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
I can't say that you were an officer in the press.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
I told you that I would be too busy to keep the track.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
The list of Mr. Shien was the rightful personal friend of Mr. Cohn.

08:47.000 --> 08:55.000
I wish you would have your office notified Mr. Cohn if any progress was made.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
And if Mr. Shien is not entitled to a commission, I would ask you to know how Mr. Cohn is.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
Is that a report of time that you requested that I keep Mr. Cohn in my office to Mr. Cohn, posted on a private ticket?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
No, no.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
Mr. Wells asked you whether or not you were keeping aware of the fact that Mr. Cohn was the chief counsel for our commission.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
You answered it yet.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
But you tell us why you were keeping aware of that.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
I know that I know in general the function of your committee.

09:32.000 --> 09:40.000
I know that Mr. Cohn had that spring I believe and appointed as chief counsel of the committee.

09:40.000 --> 09:48.000
And I know that as such he would have a great deal of I should be in private and private in my own mind.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
He would have a great deal with the Army and of course the month's follow-up made it.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
He's firmly doing your work.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
Well now that he's about to send over the river's activities as major will keep the aware of the fact that Mr. Cohn was chief counsel.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Now a step.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
You know that Mr. Sam Reaver was a superior to Mr. Cohn.

10:10.000 --> 10:22.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Shien, we're sent to Europe by me to inspect the libraries that your brother, Mr. Sam Reaver, repeatedly made a tax upon line

10:22.000 --> 10:32.000
that your brother, Mr. Sam Reaver appointed a man to shuttle them throughout Europe and keep the press informed as the brother was going to be, whether it's stopping.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
They were aware of that at the time that you were making a great effort to get the situation as you say for Mr. Shien.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
That's the time I'm here to share.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Please, gentlemen, I'm not I'm not that family chairman.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
I must object to the question that any answer there has been long ago.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Just answer it specifically for me or other message to the issue.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
Mr. Chairman, I cannot show a buy-up and prejudice in the part of my witness.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Then that's the last and overrule of law.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
But I know that Mr. Jackson said I've got to respect for your ability to lawyer.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
I think that you are trying to do it from which the show is not there.

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
The more about you, you know, and the different from rules of law, especially when I've been interpreted by me as any buy-up and your price.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
But this, uh, General has been before the committee before.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
He's been before us when I tried to get him together information about those who cover up communist and government.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
That was his first time like the Mr. Cohn.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm not saying that my man has made Mr. Cohn, I'm not saying that.

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
I'm just saying that Mr. Cohn has made his statement that we, uh, felt that Mr. Cohn was using improper pressure.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
If they some Mr. Cohn was doing under my instruction, then my opinion is completely false.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
And I think I'm entitled to show a little bit on the part of this with him.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
I don't know if I realized the normal feeling of Jim Ann Hall's brother.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't attribute any evil, uh, more of an impact.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
Uh, after the trip to Europe, which is rather a special fact about Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn,

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
and it's that we have no knowledge of the relationship.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
The Mr. River came to my office, my discuss.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Man, I'm going to say it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Mr. River came to my office, my discuss.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
The question of what are not Mr. Cohn and Logan Pattler or commission?

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
Mr. River said he wasn't telling anyone his, uh, uh, judgment.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
When I face the fifth, when I finish my fifth, you're giving testimony.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
Mr. Ruffman, if I have a right to object in time, I say, I'm just going to move my question.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
But let's let me take my position, will you?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Well, I don't want your testimony.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
A lot of facts here, like you want to take the right thing.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I don't mind your saying it.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't want to see what's the right question.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
That was objected to.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
I am making the position now that I am entitled to ask the question.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
The show moves on the part of this witness.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
That's all right.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Uh, I, I, I, I, I read today's Mr. Jackson's.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
I, I mean, I tell you, I know that, uh, the very able chunk of Mr. Jackson did not commit other patients or late.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
He does not know that I had a great deal of trouble with this particular witness,

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
both before this committee, and in instructions of the new year, which is in New York.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I want to do it in all of those matters.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
So, that is the counsel's check.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
It is marking that Senator McCarthy, as they write to ask of this witness,

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
any statement designed or calculated to show a motive on his part,

13:40.000 --> 13:49.000
the color or the starkest testimony, but not to make a statement of fact as the senator was saying,

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
he will put his statements in the form of questions.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
Then on that of me, he has he right to show a motive on the part of any witness,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
the speech was made by the law of due reference to the senator.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
He was not doing that.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
He was making a statement of fact.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
That is the basis of my objection.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
We have some of the journalists, many of them, but actually, well taken.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
That's questions.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Very clear.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I think the attention is well taken.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Mr. Chairman, I think may be counsel.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
The question was well taken.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I will refer to the senator.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I will refer to the question.

14:24.000 --> 14:34.000
Mr. Chairman, at the time, if you were processing the application of the gentleman,

14:34.000 --> 14:42.000
and signed for a commission, were you aware of the fact that he had had a very unpleasant experience

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
with your brother with the acting and acting commissioner in terms of it?

14:47.000 --> 14:55.000
I was not aware, Senator, of any specific experience with my brother.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
I know that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Shine had had specific difficulties with the Department of State

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
during their trust to Europe in the spring of 1953, but I was not aware of any specific experience with my brother.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
You have brought the new furniture brother with the acting commissioner,

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
at the time, at the time.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I guess.

15:15.000 --> 15:25.000
And you have a new set of stories about the statements that your brother and my brother have made about Mr. Cohen and Mr. Shine.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
I do not, for the best of my ability, recall, see any specific statements,

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
or shavings of my brother in the newspapers about Mr. Cohen and Mr. Shine.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Now, from your brother's office.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
I do recall statements, yes, from the office to the high committee.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
No, sir.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
No, sir.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
If they get expired, you can go around the table and connect to you.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Is there any other questions?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Do you have any further questions, Mr. Kentles?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
No more.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Chair has none, Senator Michelle.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Anybody on this side?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Any other questions?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Do you have another ten minutes?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I think Mr. Wilson's...

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
A private room.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yes, sir.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
I have another set.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I'm sorry.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
No.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Gentlemen, gentlemen, general...

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
General, when you were...

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Uh, told our officer, when you had the straighter express,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
and...

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
nothing from what Shine, in the extent that he's a private,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
just know to your think that you're still shabby.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
At least, uh, told me about the fact that you were the brother of a man

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
who had all this difficulty with Mr. Shine.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I needed to worry.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Sir, your McCarthy, his right hand, was strighted by this.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Is that so?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
That...

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
Uh, any difficulty that Mr. Carter and Mr. Shine had had with my brother,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
would have expected my actions in this case.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I certainly would have told you.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
I did not have a slightest idea at that time,

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
and I have not had that idea up until the first moment that...

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Difficulties with the high-clamation in Germany,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
would in any way affect my conduct

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
of the processing of Mr. Shine's request for a commission?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Well, in any way affect your testimony, Your Majesty.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It certainly would not affect my testimony.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Just to reach out to your testimony, if I may,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
and anything that you're testimony is left,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
that you're called my office.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
And I ask you whether or not that's man with a title of a commission,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
because of his background, having had a...

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
What do you call him?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
A similar definition to the Army.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
His experience in an as-and-nuffigator,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
that time you told me you thought he would be in title of a commission.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Blayhere, you discovered that in your opinion,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
he was not in title of one,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
so that as far as your concerned,

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
private Shine has received no special consideration.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
As far as questions can be found.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I would like to say, first, Jack,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
and I base my statement.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
My ignore office,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
that he had prepared any mightiestimation on the information

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
that was printed me at that time,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
which to the best of my recollection was,

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
that Mr. Shine has served as a Hill-Mershift's office.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Mr. Shine did not so serve.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
If he had served, there was a Zionist-gender regulation

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
in my event of the nation.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I believe he and I should have discovered later

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
he was not in title of a commission.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
That's right.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
And he did not get a commission.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
He did not.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
He's in title of a commission.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yes, he is.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Have you seen the reports in the transfer of the effects

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
that he was deniring,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and the missions were certain schools,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
which on the other hand,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
he had been previously connected to this committee?

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
I have seen numerous stories in the press.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I believe I have seen a story somewhat to that effect.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
So that if you have seen that story is true,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
this would be rather ranked as a combination of the instrument

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
because he had worked with the committee.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
That's many.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
I so have to answer that and start with the hypothetical questions.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
If that story was for who it was,

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
certainly, we have indicated that he was not

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
using special consideration in front of our other world.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
We both saw that story in the first and we

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
had heard the unruly,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
not that true or false.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
So the story is that he was deniring,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
consideration,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
which he would otherwise be entitled,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
because he had been connected with the committee.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Now, if that story is true,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
that would mean, instead of getting special consideration,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
he was discriminated against

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
because of his connection with the committee.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Yes, guys.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
If you have a high statistical question,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
keep that story true.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
You would indicate that he was been discriminated against.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Now,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
it's a general...

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
And I'm Mr. Truman.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
I am...

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
The unaddressing mic,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
itself, to the press of the world.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
And I want to make it clear I'm not trying to indicate

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
any of the intent upon the part of this general at all.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I do think I'm not going to request the notice.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
General, you were before this committee.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
The number of times, I've asked.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
When I was chairman.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I actually only testified

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
and the McCarthy once on the 8th of September of 1953.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
I did in my capacity as he was a legislative liaison,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
in front of me.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
You are the greatest of estimates.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Time is up.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Well, at the last time we...

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
had films that were called a...

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
for people to request a number of times,

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
and that you are not yourself, that they committed.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
It should be entitled to the reasons

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
of individuals in the Pentagon who had protected

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and covered up coming.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
That's how my difficulty getting an answer from you,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and I help you this question to pay,

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
because I am firmly convinced the reason we're here,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
finding our time on the question of whether or not

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
a kind of...

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
received special consideration

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
because we're getting close to the mayor of Senna.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
In the Pentagon, the old civilian politicians

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
sort of passed by and probably get covered up.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
But now, I want to ask you today

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
whether you see your results as committee.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
When we get to this celebration show,

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
should be entitled to get the names of those, for example,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
who received the cases of individuals

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
that were suspended from court normal.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm not speaking now of the 33th suspension

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
during our investigation.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
I'm speaking of the suspension that remained long before that.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Well, the past 36-10 years by Conference of Manning Officer,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I believe that they give us 35, I'm not sure.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
But every time I answer, they were found on the list

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
by the first Army-Lawd-E-Board,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
because of the communist background.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
They apply it to a screening board

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
and a field board, a lawyer,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
a lawyer, and a lawyer who doesn't know what to call it,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
and the Pentagon.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And also 35 and 33th,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
that is the Army-Lawd-E-Board.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Can I try to finish this question,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
which I'm going to talk to you about.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
You have right to include the staff

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
and staff that the cabinet expires.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
So you may continue to make your message to them.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
But also 35 and 33th.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
We're going to reinstated,

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
put it back to support the amount of the district

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
that's not specified where our work is.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
I have no idea.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
The question I had asked about it.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I had no idea.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Thank you.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
From Washington ABC Radio,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I've been re-ing you for the last hour and 25 minutes.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
All the scene coverage is in the Carthi Army here.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
The committee is expected to reset in a few minutes

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
and plans to resume the hearings this afternoon.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Statements of facts.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
If we're not to list it,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
any information pertinent to this inquiry,

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
including any motive on the part of this witness

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
to swear falsely or to distort this testimony.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Chair is inclined to approve the objection

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
as the members of the committee is still otherwise.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
The family is fired,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
can I answer all of your questions?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
None.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
None other.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
The committee is now expected to recess in two minutes

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
and plans to resume the hearings this afternoon.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
There's always a guest that you stay tuned to your ABC station.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
ABC Radio, we're again,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
we're prepared to bring you on the scene coverage

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
of the hearings over many of these days.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
We'll hear this afternoon.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
This program came to you from the Senate Office Building

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
on Capitol Hill in Washington.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
This is ABC Radio Network.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
You
