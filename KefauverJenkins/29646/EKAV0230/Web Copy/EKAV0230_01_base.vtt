WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
I know he had submitted those to the State Department and to other agencies and have discussed them with those agencies.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Well, Mr. Cohen, you thought it'd be a good man to have, didn't you?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
I did, sir.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
And you wanted it.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
I did, sir, and I think my judgment was indicated in what he did in that investigation.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
And you hired it.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
No, sir, I didn't.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Somebody did? Who did?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Well, the chairman of the committee had it.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Why didn't you pay him?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
We didn't pay him for this reason, sir.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Who didn't?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Who didn't pay him to do?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
I thought he said we did pay him.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
No, sir, I didn't pay him. I beg your pardon. Now why didn't you pay him?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
I started saying so. We did not pay him for this reason.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
He had financial means of his own.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
When the question of payment came up, he said, I do not want any money.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
I am glad to do the job. It's a privilege to do the job.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I will fill it without any compensation. I don't need the money.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
It's a period and we were not going to post them on our own.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Now, I'm just going to throw it up and pass.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
And I don't tell you or so, is?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
But you have financial means to go on too.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Don't you?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Yes, sir. I do have certain financial means.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
And you take your pay and I think you should.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, maybe I'm not as unselfish as you are.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
You did it quite a few times, sir, that he was not least

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
or subject to discipline that he worked for as if he were paid?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Point of order, sir.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Can I have the counsel from the small town of these towns

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
while they're not using receiving pay?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, he is working for nothing at the same time.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Now you've got me there.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
The answer is there is, but I am working for nothing.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I had a talk to both you and Mr. Shun, so I'll pick.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Please.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
More, two shades for the sentence.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Where are your numbers?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Three, two, three, orange and pink and pink.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Now, where did he come to work?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I think it was about three weeks after I came.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
And who did he report for his first job?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
He report.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
I think at the beginning, sir, for a series of...

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
No, my question has been in the deep regard.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm trying to answer it, sir.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I think at the beginning there were a series of meetings

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
between the Senate and McCarthy, Dave Shine, myself.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't think there was anybody else from the state

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
there at that point.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Any guy?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Any guy from the side of the set, right?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Well, what we did at the beginning, sir,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
was discuss just what the general problem was

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
and how to go about the investigation.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Did he move to Washington?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
He spent the voice of America's located in New York.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
He spent a lot of time in New York.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
He spent a lot of time in Washington.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
What?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
My question is did he move?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Well, when he was in Washington, he looked there.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
When he was in New York, he looked there.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I just wanted to establish it.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Did he keep his home in New York and come down here

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
when he wanted to work here?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That's what he did.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
So the answer is he did not move to Washington.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
No, so he did not give up his New York.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Right.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Now, under whom did he go to work?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Under whose direction?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
In the senator?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yes.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
And nobody else?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I would say that's right, sir.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Did that continue throughout his tenure?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, there were changes in the situation.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Mr. Walch, as there were changes in the staff set up.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, did somebody else start in giving him orders at some time?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
That's so much a question of all of this, Mr. Walch.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
When we started out with the committee,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I was the chief counsel, but in addition to myself,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
there was another gentleman who was the general counsel.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
There were sort of two teams which were working.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
Separately on different investigations and different projects.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
There came a time when there was a change in that setup.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
We had a new staff director came who sort of consolidated both teams.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I haven't thought I would make the conclusion answer.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Yes, I say new staff director came who tried to consolidate both teams.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
He didn't stay long and then Mr. Carl came.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And he first was a tool man.

03:51.000 --> 03:59.000
Chair, while opening, open the afternoon session by again welcoming the guests who have come to the committee room.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
The purposes of seeing and hearing these hearings.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
We're sure you, on behalf of my colleagues, that you are most welcome.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
We are happy to have you here as our guests.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
And to remind those of you who have been here before and who have quaint those of you who are here for the first time.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
I was the fact that he is now making his speech.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
We'll meet with you, Mr. Mayor.

04:22.000 --> 04:31.000
Any manifest statements of approval or disapproval of an audible nature at any time or of any time.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
And the uniformed officers that you see before you.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
And the plane closed people scattered through the audience,

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
they have standing instructions from the chair and the committee to remove immediately from the room politely.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
But firmly and without any further instructions from the chair.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Any of our guests, for reasons best known to themselves,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
you left to violate the terms under which you entered the committee room.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
And we need to refrain from interrupting the hearings by any manifestations of an audible nature of approval or of disapproval.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Translations are believed you are going to have three special short witnesses before this afternoon.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Mr. Chairman, this is Mr. Chairman of this time.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I have a bizarre recall of the next witness.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Hi.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Could I make a suggestion about these witnesses?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I think, Mike.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Make our job very much shorter.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Yes, sir, you may.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
I've already disclosed to Mr. Jenkins what the witnesses would wish that are here and what they have.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
There are three witnesses here who took an humanitarian call between Mr. Stevens,

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
Mr. Adams, on the one hand, and the various senators,

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
seated at this table on the other, including Senator McCarthy.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Please.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
telephone monitor telephone call that is involved has been submitted to Mr. Harlow with,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
as Mr. Jenkins knows.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
It is proposed by me, Mr. Jenkins, that the three witnesses be called,

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
but they identify the telephone calls that are in Mr. Harlow's position as having been taken and transpired by them.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
And that they swear to their accuracy.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Let's be certain what I am about to move Mr. Wale.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
Mr. Wale and having had them sworn as to their accuracy, they could be arranged in chronological order,

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
after their sworn as to their accuracy, and rather, fees by one of the witnesses, or by someone other than the witness.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
The point seems that they're all dumbled up as to chronology, as between the three of you follow.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Mr. Wale said this time, I intend to put on Mr. Pax for the purpose of proving,

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
the very first monitor telephone call between Senator Munt and the Secretary of the Army.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
Mr. Wale, calm his question, I mean, he's tight.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
The very first, I'm going to introduce Mr. Rowe and has the earliest one.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
The doctor, I'm sorry, is developing to get whoever's willing to monitor his call,

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
because the first order of the witness was agreed to be the introduction of my call appropriately,

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
and he surrounded with the necessary legal provisions, and the suggestions helpful made by my senior colleagues from the market genre.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
So if it helps, Ms. Pikes, fine, if that's Mr. Lucas, okay, or if it's Mr. Rowe.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Wherever it was, it was listening in.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Let's not want to see the third party in the telephone conversation so we can get on with the work.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Let me put it to you this way, so we'll understand each other.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
On the 20th of February, there were seven telephone calls here being offered.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
The first one was to Mr. Dirkton and is in evidence that has not been sworn to.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
That?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
This is a much more interesting one.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
No, I beg your pardon, is it sometimes as something intentional about that?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
It's a breach of money.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
It's a breach of money.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
It's a breach of money.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I'll be here.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I don't think so.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Seven of them are in there.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Then look, Mr. Dirkton.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
I think we will explain that to Walsh if you would have Mr. Lucas, Mr. Rowe, the Miss Pikes, House Chiefs.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Okay.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
We'll have to be clear.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Out of the way, we'll be inside an additional chair.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Out of work.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
We'll clear it and we will put the board over there.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
We'll be clear.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
We'll bring them on all together.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Well, the three Montecreas teams are exhumed with this map.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yes.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Very well.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
All right.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Yes.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yes.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yes.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yes.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yes.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yes.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
That must be the map.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yes.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
The name is Pike.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Yes.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
And Mr. Lucas, I recognize and what is the name of the tower on that?

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Mr. Rowe, will you all please stand, please, and be going together.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
You're right, Anne.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You saw him before, and he touched him on you.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
He was just too close to the house.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
He said nothing but the children.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
So how did you get it?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Thank you, and you never did it.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
You have a need, Mr. Chancelle.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Please tell the committee your full name.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Jane R. Hart.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
Miss Pike, about the official position of anything you've told us within a while.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm Secretary Alton Defeb.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
I'm going to hide with you.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
Please tell the microphone, I've a little closer to you, so that all of us are extremely busy.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
You're all alone.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Secretary, you're the Secretary.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
You are Secretary to the Secretary of the Army, Mr. Stevens.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
That's right.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I have such these six things in your hand, Miss Pike.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
I do.

09:36.000 --> 09:44.000
I will ask you whether or not the politicians use monitors certain telephone calls between the Secretary of the Army and others.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I do.

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
Have or not you want to see just monitors certain telephone calls between the Secretary of the Army and the members of the State Committee?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Yes, sir.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
And the Secretary of the Army and the chairman of the State Committee, the State Committee, Senator Monk?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yes, sir.

09:58.000 --> 10:08.000
Please say whether or not the Miss Pike, on February 20th, 1954, you monitor the telephone calls between Senator Monk and the Secretary of the Army and the State Committee.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
I do.

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
Do you have any exact copies of the transcription of your notes before you?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yes, sir.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I will ask you, Miss Pike, is it Mr. Mrs.?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Mrs. Mrs. Mrs.

10:22.000 --> 10:31.000
I will ask you to now read to the members of the Committee the context of that telephone call of February 20th, 1954.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yes, sir.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
Now, this time, my attention has been called to the fact that you still too far away from the micropowering time.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I'm just waiting to be not here.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Now, Mr. Stevens, I look forward to seeing you.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Before you read, may I inquire whether this is a good thing?

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
The transcription of the document, Mr. Stevens, the document, is to me.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, Senator Monk, I am a Secretary and try to get down as much as I can.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I do not believe this always, of course you understand.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm only not a Secretary.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I'm going to have a disease, whatever you have.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
But I would like to know, from my own benefit, whether it is the well-being of the transcription, and every two minutes.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And yes, Mr. Lucas just arrived.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
Sometimes, even if it's the Stevens' self-president, or if somebody else is, if you sit together all, he's getting put down a little bit.

11:21.000 --> 11:32.000
So if you overlook something, you're sitting together, and you leave it, and we should be in the case of that, because you're at that place, so that if my grammar is worse than usual, I'm not going to tell you overlook something else.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I'll absolutely, my semantics will come back.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
I don't try to take it for a bit, because I just can't.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
And not being used to taking two sides of a conversation, that way, I do not try to get it for a bit.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
I do try to be, of course, as accurate as possible in getting the stuff that's in.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
You are understanding what you are about.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
The disease is not an actual term, so you cannot understand what it notes for the sort of reason.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
So not for this, or some of you, couple says about the two parts.

12:01.000 --> 12:10.000
This is my ability. It is not for later, as I say, but the name's that right.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
All right, every chance of maybe, but I wanted to be sure you won't have to mention any dust, because it isn't that right.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
There's no mention of this, and we're interested in some issues.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
February 20, 1964, in November, A.M.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
Can't give you a full mic, little mirror.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Can you put that up there, folks?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Now, fly the full louder.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
I may ask the control man if he can turn it up a little bit more.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
February 20, 1964, in November, A.M.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
Senator Paul Montrecurne, Secretary of Army Paul, earlier this morning.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
Secretary of Army, Secretary of Army Paul, calling a post conversation of yesterday afternoon,

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
that he had tried to find out and wasn't able to until this morning, where Joe was,

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
because he saw the only right and distance and fair, that he should call him on the phone,

13:11.000 --> 13:19.000
and tell him he called on as many members of the subcommittee to take the fine and express his concern.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
Secretary indicated he did not give you an opening.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
As they went on with the conversation, Joe got madder and madder.

13:29.000 --> 13:37.000
Senator McCarty asked, do you mean to say General's Wicker is not going to appear before the committee on Tuesday?

13:37.000 --> 13:46.000
Secretary replied, I am going to try to keep him from doing this, because I feel that the man has been cooked through, should not be repeated.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
Then he brings his good army and asks if I would accept a patina for Tuesday morning at 10.

13:53.000 --> 14:04.000
I replied, I will take it under advisement. He asked, are you receiving? I said no, I am not accepting or receiving.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
Senator McCarty said, new of the pinnacle for 10 Tuesday morning and hung up the phone.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Senator McCarty questioned the refusal to accept the patina.

14:15.000 --> 14:24.000
Said if they would be released, they will power a patina to executive departments, might as well close up Congress as a shop.

14:24.000 --> 14:33.000
Secretary said when a patina is served, he certainly will appear, but did not claim it necessary to state his position on phone.

14:34.000 --> 14:49.000
Senator McCarty could not put the pinnacle by phone anyway, indicating he had not seen him for a while, but he seemed to be carrying on a one man's preserves because of something that happened last fall.

14:49.000 --> 14:58.000
Then he asked where he will be, and Secretary said Senator McCarty didn't say, but he proved to be walking to.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
Senator McCarty indicated he had tried to get transcript, but it hadn't come down.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
Secretary said incidentally, the pat I had close arms had been taken from records.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Senator McCarty said he didn't speak close to mention.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
Secretary said they were in the ball for more time, which walked the only type or he knew of.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
And decided to get the end of the concessions.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
There's a J.P. in the ballroom.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
That's my fair.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
May I ask now whether you have other monochic telephone calls to my constituents?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Of you, sir?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yes.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
I do not.

16:04.000 --> 16:16.000
Mr. Chairman, could I just for the record now, and I intend to answer my calls already, and also, could I show that the time on this monuxe call is 11 a.m. at the 20th of February.

16:17.000 --> 16:25.000
I think that's the Secretary told you he shouldn't find me, but I have a monochic telephone call with Senator McCarty.

16:25.000 --> 16:32.000
I have 10 a.m. so that he had close to me one hour before he told you he couldn't find me.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
I missed the car.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Hi.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Hi.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Hi.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Did I understand you had never wondered with any other call?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh, no.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm not.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm not.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
I mean, the purpose of all this is to disclose our souls entirely.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
And I want to know whether I'm just subject to you.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
You have no other call, is it mine?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Can I go out to have you be very sure?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I either say yes, or no.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm the country of virtual subjects.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
I suppose you can come to the greater with Senator McCarty, or the committee, or General Dricker, or the hearings you know I'm talking about.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
No, sir, I have not.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Tomorrow is the chance of the call with the tutor on the search right now.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
No, please.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
And Mr. Jenkins, that there are other people who want to be in telephones.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Yes, sir.

17:20.000 --> 17:29.000
Or if you're Mr. Chairman, and it may be, I think, is correct that this young lady monitor calls between the secretary and other members of the subcommittee.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
But I don't have any other one side or any other side of the office at this time.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
I'm trying to break the document with you.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Oh, yeah.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I have no further questions.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
I have no further questions.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
You may say, there, because some other Senator Maymond, if you will find another monitor and proceed on the appeal.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
I assume Mr. Chairman, that no one else has any questions to ask.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Is it like I will ask him not to stand aside.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I don't have a...

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Just wanted to brief, but...

17:51.000 --> 18:00.000
I wonder if it was enough to work out in the feet of Senator McCarty on these calls that we conclude the calls that have come in from each senator first.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
The men have to run it around the table fine.

18:03.000 --> 18:11.000
Mr. Chairman, we'd like to have his whole discussion spread out in public view at one spot, so that his gathers through hundreds of papers.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I think that's an early way with Mr. Chairman.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
Mr. Chairman, I think it's the right way to move out of exchange since Mr. Rhodes.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Mr. Rhodes, what are you following, please, sir?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
They are our role, Junior.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I think you were sworn along with Mr. Pike and Mr. Lucas.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Yes, sir.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
What position do you hold at the Pentagon, Mr. Rhodes?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I'm a short-hand reporter for the department of the Army.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Do you or not, you sometimes take monitor telephone calls?

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Yes, sir. I substitute for Mr. Lucas on weekends occasionally and when he is on leave.

18:47.000 --> 18:55.000
They will or not, you sometimes monitor telephone calls, picing the theme effect there, the Army, Mr. Stevens, and particularly members of the subcommittee.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Yes, sir.

18:56.000 --> 19:04.000
Mr. Rhodes, please, you are not held before you a copy of a monitor telephone call on February 21, 1954.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
Between the six years of the Army and acting chairman of this committee, Senator Monk?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Mr. Jenkins, did you mean the 20th?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
No, I mean February 21st.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
I'd like to find you.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I just have to find one of the 20th Mr. Rhodes.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
I follow you.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
I get a hold.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Yes, sir.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Is that correct, Mr. Rhodes?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yes, sir.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Would you monitor that telephone call?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Yes, sir.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And you can describe this to type?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Yes, sir.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Is it accurate?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yes, sir.

19:34.000 --> 19:47.000
Is it a birth later report, or does it support to substantially contain the context of the call between Senator Monk and Mr. Stevens?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
How much that is as verbatim as it is.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
It is called for data.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I will now ask you to read it in the record.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
A minute.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
It's here as that.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
That is that answer.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Is it a hundred percent verbatim?

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
I can't very well say, sir, because the interruptions in the room, Mr. Acquers, is at previously pointed out.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm just wondering if the cover truth is all.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yes.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Is either a hundred percent verbatim or is it not a hundred percent verbatim?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Are you under oath?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I want you to tell me the truth.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
This is the first time I've met you.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
This is the other time we talked together.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
I didn't see you.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
So, I would like to know, sir, is it a hundred percent verbatim report or not?

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
I can't say that it's a hundred percent.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Is your answer no?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yes, sir.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
It's just your best to take it down as I understand it.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
A hundred percent verbatim.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
There have been interruptions in the room.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
There have been interruptions on the phone, sir.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
Could have been words that were indistinctly ugly.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
At one side or the other, but you made a hundred percent effort.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yes, sir.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Now, number two.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
At the places where it is not a hundred percent verbatim,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
you followed the fact that Mr. Lucas said he followed it,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
putting down a little box.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
No, sir, I did not.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
So, let's see.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Poor fellow who didn't know him as being monitored,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
he's never going to know whether or not he has some particular juncture.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
He's hearing himself or hearing something that you put down.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
If you find him, I'd accept him because of another revolution in the room.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I had, I put down what I have on my note, sir.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
And I think the content is all there.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
If you're no way, then you didn't follow Mr. Lucas's very fine practice.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And I recommend this to the faithful monitor,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
because it's going to become a career around the town,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
but we should follow that as well as the code of ethics.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Do we get all?
