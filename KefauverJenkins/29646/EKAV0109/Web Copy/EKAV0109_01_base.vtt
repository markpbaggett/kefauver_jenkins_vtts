00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
I'll let you tell you something about him.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
I don't know.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
She is the mayor of Roblowee, which is the home of general, the goal of the President

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
of France.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Since 1956, she has been a member of the parliament, either in the Senate or the Chamber of

00:54.000 --> 01:14.000
the United States, because she is the head of the chairman of the Franco-American Friendship

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Group in the Assembly.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
She has always been very thoughtful in looking at her as the American will become France

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
and building ties between the United States and France.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
But I've asked her not to bat you, I don't have no.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, Mr. Stanton, I'm sorry.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And I believe what we want to thank you for, your friendship, but she's a member of the

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
NATO parliamentarians, of course, it's a very important part.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
Well, let me ask, how do you think things were getting along in the France-Dutors?

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
Well, they were getting along smoothly, and on the border around the wild.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Well, I think you agree with me.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I think we've been having a very successful NATO parliamentarians' problem.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
We remember that still following new illustrations, but in Medin-Belderard, Wild Act,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
we came to know the termination, not even to condemn the resumption of the Soviet

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
of the Republic lasting.

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
We remember that the communist nation's Mavicale, the other day, fell out, but here by a determination

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
to have freedom and cooperation, blocking things out, I think, these 15 nations

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
have been standing together for peace and decency in the world.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
I know you were interested in what we can do to work closer together in connection with

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
the helping the people in the developing nations.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
Yes, Senator, I think that you said something that was very right when you spoke about

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
cooperation.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
I think that more we can cooperate over free world, more we will be strong.

03:08.000 --> 03:18.000
And I think that in the peaceful coexistence between lived in these years, the important part

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
of the real challenge is what's going to happen to the unbevaled countries.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
And we must cooperate to help them first to make them understand that they will be happier

03:34.000 --> 03:44.000
in our without civilism and freedom than if they side on the Soviet system.

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
And that is why the difficult part, but I think that on the Soviet side, being

03:54.000 --> 04:03.000
to the leftarian countries, they have no public opinion, no parliament, no press, so they

04:03.000 --> 04:14.000
have no obligation to convince people of what their government can do towards those countries,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
either in a public way or in a state of the world.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
So, for our three countries, we, the opinion with us, and all the countries must be together

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
and they are not because one has one country or one group of countries, they are not

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
helping others, and there is no real question.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Go ahead, you go ahead, Maria.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm sorry, but the public must excuse my foreign English.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
And I think that in the near future, because I think we have not so many years to realize

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
that object, is that we also have, we, the three countries, a real pool of our goods

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
and of the way of this thinking, of course I am not in the communist life of the ancient

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
government, but in things so extraordinary that in our behalf of the country,

05:13.000 --> 05:21.000
essentially, we haven't found the system to give possibilities of living decently to people

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
that are hungry and that many of our countries, we have too many goods that are very expensive

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
or very expensive to do, to do, to do, to do any help.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
So, I think that we ought to have a kind of pool and maybe a martial plan,

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
a new, an international three-world martial plan towards those underdeveloped countries.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
Well, I think what you said about joining together to help the people under development countries

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
in their own is very important.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Of course, we've passed several resolutions here in the NATO problem, and Terry is about it.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
And we are trying to do something about it through OVCD, but we must coordinate our efforts.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I know that, OVCD.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I think you're right.

06:14.000 --> 06:24.000
It's the organ now affected for that kind of work, but it isn't strong enough and not sufficient.

06:24.000 --> 06:34.000
I think it must be a real publication, and it must be proportioned to the wealth and to the population

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
of those three countries, and it must be really effective.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
Then I think that in that plan, there is the problem of the warm material.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
I think for the underdeveloped countries in South America, in Africa,

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
in other words, the going up and down of the warm material is also...

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
But they have fluctuation in the parts of command.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
That's what I mean.

07:04.000 --> 07:14.000
It's also a very serious problem, because some of those new countries make one winter or one year absolutely ruined

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
by a very low course of that warm material.

07:21.000 --> 07:29.000
So that also also be underdeveloped by the wealthy countries, so that there should be a kind of equalization

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
or, as the word is, steady-setting, I don't know it.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, that's a very good thing.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
That's in English too, it's a stabilization, I take it.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
And then, I agree with you, and I think we're making some headway, but we're not going past enough,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
and I certainly don't.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
You don't go past enough, or could the others go then?

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
One of the resolutions that we passed in this Congress was a strong position,

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
condemning the Communist Party, building an illegal wall in Berlin,

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
and demanding that we continue to have free access by air, water, and land to Berlin.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
And we have pledged our 15 nations to support the foreignation agreement for a free Berlin.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
I think that's a good step, and I will be very helpful to you.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
Oh, yes, I think that the Ling is beginning of the end of a new world.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Well, I want to say, and I think you agree with me that after this conference coming to an end,

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
we have made great headway in bringing about unity, cooperation, facing up to these problems.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
It's good to have thoughtful legislators and women like you who are so interested.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
I want to congratulate the American delegation on being a very hard-working one

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
because they told parliamentarians conference.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
And thank you, Madam Patno, for your courtesy and for the contributions you have made.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
And Mr. Santor, we are always very glad to meet our American colleagues,

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
and unfortunately, the 5,000 kilometers of distance doesn't exist.

09:04.000 --> 09:15.000
It's all the unfortunate way that we cannot meet as often as we would like to.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
And this was a very good opportunity for all the colleagues French and American

09:21.000 --> 09:30.000
belonging to the NATO parliament delegation to have contacts, and to talk, and meet,

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
and try and say what they thought about all our different problems that are after all the same.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Thank you very much, and we'll be coming back to see you when you come to see us as a whole from now.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Thank you.
