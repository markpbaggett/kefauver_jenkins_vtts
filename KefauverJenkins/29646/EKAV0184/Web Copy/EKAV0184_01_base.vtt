WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
You're going far beyond my thinking.

00:03.000 --> 00:09.560
I ask you if the Army had received any such derogatory information who

00:09.560 --> 00:14.160
respected graphs or any dishonesty, what would the Army do with respect to that

00:14.160 --> 00:15.560
member of the Loyalty Board?

00:15.560 --> 00:17.360
Can you give me a short answer to that?

00:17.360 --> 00:19.120
I think sure they would take him.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.600
They would relieve him from the Loyalty Board.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.160
If the charges were serious, they would suspend him and at the same time and immediate

00:26.160 --> 00:30.160
investigation of the charges would be undertaken by proper authorities.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.160
Thank you.

00:31.160 --> 00:36.800
Now, let's add, is the Army attempted to sway the members of this committee not to

00:36.800 --> 00:43.160
depend in the membership of the Loyalty Review Board in question?

00:43.160 --> 00:48.160
Read the question again, please, sir.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.160
Did the Army attempted to sway the members of this committee not to depend in the membership

00:53.160 --> 00:58.160
of the Loyalty Review Board in question?

00:58.160 --> 01:02.160
The Chairman and I, on family time, is up now having to answer this question and then

01:02.160 --> 01:05.160
I'll have just...

01:05.160 --> 01:10.160
That's all for a general answer, apparently.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.160
That what you want, Senator?

01:12.160 --> 01:16.160
I would like to short an answer always in the possible midst of the Council and give the

01:16.160 --> 01:17.160
answer.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.160
I think, sir, that the...

01:19.160 --> 01:25.160
My previous testimony has been that I did call from certain members of this committee

01:25.160 --> 01:32.160
and that I did ask that these individuals not be treated.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.160
Chairman, I have a lot of questions.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.160
I'll wait for my turn.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.160
Mr. Wooddeck, please go out.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
No way.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.160
Turn the committee into the call.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.160
Mr. Chairman, we have...

02:01.160 --> 02:09.160
This morning, he was on a spike in the last one years, he was a development.

02:09.160 --> 02:16.160
I don't know whether any further questions Mr. Adams will be of any benefit.

02:16.160 --> 02:26.160
We find now that the Adams of the conference with the ambassador for the administration,

02:26.160 --> 02:32.160
which gets pretty general, the deputy attorney general, the labor of the ones supporting

02:32.160 --> 02:40.160
the Adams in the case of the incident, which gets with the trial and the outcome.

02:40.160 --> 02:45.160
We find now that the trial and the case with the trial were a complete thought upon the committee.

02:45.160 --> 02:50.160
But the army's case is in this, and that was just with the trial.

02:50.160 --> 02:56.160
I frankly thought all along with the madam, Mr. Hems over to the people who had been together this.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.160
Now there's no way of knowing who this.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.160
There's no way of checking more.

03:03.160 --> 03:08.160
We have the attorney general who is responsible for that conference.

03:08.160 --> 03:14.160
Moving upon, what documents can be admitted never?

03:14.160 --> 03:22.160
And what's unusual, ruling this morning, as he says that a document is not authentic but verbatim.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.160
I don't quite follow that.

03:25.160 --> 03:30.160
We ask you what the portion to list to be made available.

03:30.160 --> 03:39.160
Obviously, portions have nothing to do with security, but would be extremely embarrassing to those charge of security.

03:39.160 --> 03:55.160
I would like Mr. Chairman to have the entire retirement of recess to find what we should confirm with Mr. Carr and Mr. Cohn.

03:55.160 --> 04:04.160
The people who should do under this unusual situation, which we can only hear the evidence about that conference,

04:04.160 --> 04:09.160
which might be damaging to Mr. Cohn with the car myself.

04:09.160 --> 04:20.160
And suddenly, halfway through the testimony, we have to complete the story.

04:20.160 --> 04:33.160
I would like Mr. Chairman to have about a 5 minute recess to the chairman, but that's where I should take and view of this unprecedented, completely unusual,

04:33.160 --> 04:37.160
almost unbelievable situation we're confronted with this morning.

04:37.160 --> 04:41.160
I may have a firm in the recess to consult with Mr. Cohn with Mr. Carr.

04:41.160 --> 04:53.160
I think the testimony is very requested, as this was unexpected and unanticipated development, and we'll declare a 5 minute recess and return.

04:54.160 --> 05:05.160
You have just heard the chairman declare a brief recess. The ABC television network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army controversy.

05:35.160 --> 05:42.160
The president has regularly $59.75, now $39.75. Save $20 with the quiz.

05:42.160 --> 05:48.160
He's Senator Carl Mont, who granted this brief recess.

05:48.160 --> 05:58.160
So that Senator McCarthy might be able to infer with his cold principles in this case.

05:59.160 --> 06:05.160
Senator Mont, chatting with Senator Porter, is really blocked.

06:06.160 --> 06:27.160
The governor's was right in the register, pointing from the Senate office room here.

06:28.160 --> 06:41.160
In recess, there will be a recess for approximately 5 minutes to give Senator Joseph McCarthy and Mr. Cohn Carr and Mr. Roy Cohn an opportunity to confer on the developments that have occurred here this year this month.

06:41.160 --> 06:47.160
What has actually happened is that the first document was introduced from Attorney General Brown now.

06:47.160 --> 06:52.160
It was an answer to a letter by Senator Carl Mont, who was the temporary chairman of the committee.

06:52.160 --> 07:01.160
Senator Mont had written the Attorney General to ask him about whether or not this material contained in a reported letter from J.A.J.

07:01.160 --> 07:05.160
who might be introduced in the record. This was up to request the Senate to McCarthy.

07:05.160 --> 07:16.160
The Attorney General ruled today that no part of the document produced by Senator McCarthy reviewing a secret FBI paper on possible subversion should be made public.

07:17.160 --> 07:34.160
And after that, I was read into the record the letter from President Eisenhower, which was sent to Secretary of Defense Wilson and in charge of been transmitted to Army Secretary Stevens and also to Mr. Adams.

07:34.160 --> 07:44.160
And the Eisenhower letter formally barred the door against disclosure of what went on in the meeting of some of his top level advisors as January 21st in connection with the Army's role with Senator McCartney.

07:44.160 --> 07:51.160
And now there's Gunner Back with Senator Jackson of Washington. Let's switch now to Gunner.

07:51.160 --> 08:09.160
This is Gunner Back again from the Senate caucus room. And just as we had the camera turned on, I was chatting with Senator Jackson once again to find out whether or not I had made a rough analysis of the dilemma which now seems to have been from Senator McCartney.

08:10.160 --> 08:29.160
I'm wondering Senator Jackson whether this is your thinking on that. It seems to me that the question now is whether or not the responsibility for issuing that series of charges can be rightly attributed or put on Secretary Stevens and Mr. Adams or whether the question is whether the responsibility goes higher now.

08:29.160 --> 08:43.160
That's exactly right Gunner. There's no way of knowing at this stage of the proceedings whether the statement of charges came as the resolve of the meeting of January 21st, the meeting in Comterbury.

08:43.160 --> 08:50.160
The meeting that the President has said that we cannot get any information.

08:50.160 --> 09:00.160
I think that we have a very serious situation because part of the testimony regarding this meeting in conference is in the records.

09:00.160 --> 09:19.160
We have no way of knowing now whether the statement of charges initially made were made at the instance of the meeting held in the Attorney General Brown-Elz offers or whether the statement of charges were initiated in Pollywood by Mr. Adams.

09:19.160 --> 09:38.160
That's exactly right. That means that Senator Jackson, the McCartney's side in this controversy is maintained that this report was put out in retaliation because the loyalty board members were going to be to see it as far as the motivation.

09:38.160 --> 09:49.160
Now does it mean that the Attorney McCartney might have to take the view that the President and Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams were just acting unordered and therefore were not well for witnesses in their own?

09:49.160 --> 10:01.160
Well, I don't know what view he may take. Of course, of course, the inference can be drawn because there's no direct testimony on this question.

10:01.160 --> 10:08.160
Well, would you say the Senator McCullen's questioning this morning indicated fairly clearly that there was a decision about that meeting?

10:08.160 --> 10:29.160
I think on the basis of speculation, Gunner, that and based on what's the bigger information we have in the records, there's every indication that there is a decision at a higher level beyond that of Secretary Stevens in connection with the presentation of these original charges.

10:29.160 --> 10:36.160
Well, at least that's a reasonable inference to be drawn in due to the fact that other information cannot be obtained.

10:36.160 --> 10:51.160
Well, I don't want to put you on a limb that might be set off, but I'm just wondering whether this is considerably, this may be in the remote instance, the Labor Attorney McCartney asking which charges we were thrown.

10:51.160 --> 11:07.160
Well, anything could happen as resolved as this, and I'm not going to do as you as I was suggested because it's difficult to even venture a guess to what might happen at this juncture of the proceeding.

11:07.160 --> 11:22.160
I think the administration made a serious mistake in letting this thing ride for so long before imposing an objection if the administration had given orders at the outset of the hearing.

11:22.160 --> 11:29.160
We would not have this thought. Now, however, we have part of the testimony and can't get the rest of it.

11:29.160 --> 11:35.160
Well, the unique situation is like the greatest. This is another one of the many unexpected turns which we've encountered.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.160
That's right. Anything we...

11:37.160 --> 11:42.160
Never a dull moment. Thank you very much. That of course was Senator Jackson, Democrat from Washington.

11:42.160 --> 11:47.160
This is Gunner Back reporting again from the Senate's caucus room, and that's the way it looked to me at this time.

11:47.160 --> 11:55.160
The ABC television network is bringing you the complete hearing into the McCartney Army controversy.

11:59.160 --> 12:04.160
The panel is calling the question to what?

12:10.160 --> 12:12.160
May the police come to order?

12:18.160 --> 12:24.160
We will resume the business of the hearings, and at the time of the recess,

12:24.160 --> 12:27.160
Senator McCartney has the floor under the...

12:27.160 --> 12:33.160
And then it will recognize that Senator McCartney or Mr. Colton?

12:36.160 --> 12:38.160
Mr. Terminer 8,

12:39.160 --> 12:42.160
Not that much, but...

12:43.160 --> 12:48.160
...time for the law to do with this moment.

12:49.160 --> 12:54.160
One of the subjects of the inquiry is to find that...

12:55.160 --> 12:58.160
...could was responsible for...

12:59.160 --> 13:05.160
...exciting and following off the hearing of some of the central questions in the government.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.160
The hearing has been called off. No one can trust him.

13:11.160 --> 13:19.160
I fear that maybe in my mind I was doing injustice to possibly the matter of Mr. Humsfeld.

13:20.160 --> 13:25.160
I strongly felt all along that they were the men responsible for it.

13:26.160 --> 13:30.160
At this point I find that there's no way we're getting up the truth.

13:31.160 --> 13:38.160
Because we do find that the charges were conceived, instigated,

13:39.160 --> 13:44.160
out of meetings because testified to Mr. Adams.

13:45.160 --> 13:48.160
Now for some fantastically strange reasons,

13:50.160 --> 13:55.160
the iron curtain has pulled out so we can't tell what happened at the meeting.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.160
I don't think the president is responsible for this.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.160
I don't think his judgment is that bad, Mr. Chairman.

14:02.160 --> 14:08.160
There's no reason for anyone to be afraid of the fact that truth,

14:08.160 --> 14:11.160
the one on that meeting is a very important meeting.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.160
It doesn't have to do with security matters,

14:15.160 --> 14:17.160
it doesn't have to do with national security.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.160
It really has to do with...

14:20.160 --> 14:22.160
...file these charges were filed,

14:22.160 --> 14:29.160
we find now that admittedly the charges against Mr. Carr were complete,

14:30.160 --> 14:32.160
crawled upon the committee.

14:33.160 --> 14:36.160
The case of Mr. Adams and his team was in.

14:38.160 --> 14:42.160
They admit they have no evidence against Mr. Carr.

14:43.160 --> 14:51.160
Last week I couldn't understand why Mr. Welts and Mr. Adams would not agree to withdraw their charges against Mr. Carr.

14:52.160 --> 14:58.160
I find now that maybe they were not free agents, I don't know.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.160
At that meeting there was one individual who was not...

15:06.160 --> 15:08.160
...remember the White House, by out.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.160
He was confirmed by the thought to a position with the UN.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.160
I'm back with her to the UN.

15:15.160 --> 15:19.160
If he were there as the secretary of the president,

15:19.160 --> 15:27.160
if he will testify under rule for giving us a statement that he was there representing the president,

15:28.160 --> 15:34.160
I frankly would have the same system of unlawing him,

15:34.160 --> 15:41.160
but I don't believe that that can be established, but it's not his function.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.160
The question is how far, how far can...

15:44.160 --> 15:47.160
I'm not talking about the present occupants and the White House.

15:47.160 --> 15:51.160
We've got a tremendously important question here, Mr. Chairman.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.160
That is not far from the president's goal.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.160
Who will all say any order not to testify?

15:58.160 --> 16:01.160
If you can order the ambassador to the UN,

16:01.160 --> 16:05.160
not to testify about something having nothing to do with the UN,

16:05.160 --> 16:11.160
but a deliberate smear against my staff than any president.

16:11.160 --> 16:16.160
We don't rule the president in 1966, 1960, 1960.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.160
Or any president.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.160
I won't repeat that.

16:36.160 --> 16:40.160
And any president can...

16:42.160 --> 16:47.160
by an executive order keep the fact that the American people,

16:47.160 --> 16:57.160
as I say, I think that I don't believe that this is the result of President Eisenhower's own personal thinking.

16:57.160 --> 17:01.160
I'm sure if he knew what this was all about,

17:01.160 --> 17:06.160
that he would not sign an order saying that you can't tell the summit committee,

17:07.160 --> 17:14.160
but went on when they cut off those charges against Mr. Cohen, Mr. Karn myself.

17:15.160 --> 17:19.160
Mr. Chairman, there's also another very important aspect of this.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.160
We find that the deputy attorney general,

17:23.160 --> 17:28.160
whom I know wrote the letter the other day, I don't know what the one today,

17:29.160 --> 17:35.160
was one of the individuals advised Mr. Adams to write out these charges.

17:37.160 --> 17:43.160
Well, that the attorney general is deputy must every day pass upon questions.

17:43.160 --> 17:50.160
The questions of evidence, they must open up the decide who is lying.

17:50.160 --> 17:56.160
And the testimony will be completely contradictory here, no question about that, so somebody will be lying.

17:56.160 --> 18:02.160
I think it's on a curve that you have an attorney general,

18:02.160 --> 18:06.160
calling on a smear such as, if they did, that they did not,

18:06.160 --> 18:09.160
they should have been telling you that, the evidence they did,

18:09.160 --> 18:16.160
and then have them passing upon all of the important questions.

18:16.160 --> 18:31.160
Mr. Chairman, we ask that you're totally completely impossible for me to question the witnesses now until the committee meets and determines what the ruling will be.

18:32.160 --> 18:39.160
So, as for example, individuals not connected with the White House like Mr. Lodge,

18:39.160 --> 18:44.160
and others are exempt from coming down here and telling us the truth,

18:44.160 --> 18:50.160
merely because the President says they should not sound.

18:50.160 --> 18:54.160
If the President can order Mr. Lodge, for example,

18:54.160 --> 18:58.160
so as nothing to do with the White House far as we know,

18:58.160 --> 19:04.160
and see how he's lived, then the President can order any witness we have.

19:04.160 --> 19:09.160
Now, we've heard the case of Mr. Stevens-Mr. Adam.

19:09.160 --> 19:13.160
We find that, if you pardon me for some slight repetition here, Mr. Chairman,

19:13.160 --> 19:20.160
we find that they have in no case that all against Mr. Cairn, except that he gave Mr. Adam a friendly advice.

19:20.160 --> 19:25.160
We find that Mr. Adam said Saturday, after all of he said something to me,

19:25.160 --> 19:28.160
and I said, what did Mr. Cohn do to the wrong?

19:28.160 --> 19:32.160
The only thing that he did except Todd,

19:32.160 --> 19:42.160
according to Adam, was to fail to persuade me to call off the subpoenas of the loyalty board.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.160
Now we're getting out of the meet of the case, Mr. Cairn.

19:45.160 --> 19:52.160
And that is who, who was responsible for the issuance of this clear

19:52.160 --> 19:57.160
that has held this Committee up for weeks and weeks and weeks,

19:57.160 --> 20:05.160
and has allowed Cunters to continue in our defense plan for Mr. Chairman,

20:05.160 --> 20:12.160
handling top secret materials, as I said before, with a razor poised over the jugular vein of this nation.

20:12.160 --> 20:18.160
Who was responsible for keeping all these army officers down here, and all the Cunters tied up,

20:18.160 --> 20:22.160
while the world is up going up in flames?

20:22.160 --> 20:26.160
And I do think, Mr. Chairman, that we should go into executive session,

20:26.160 --> 20:31.160
I must have a ruling as to what will be behind an iron curtain,

20:31.160 --> 20:36.160
and what fact we can bring out before I can intelligence like questions of which we should,

20:36.160 --> 20:44.160
and I do think that someone, for his own benefit, should contact the President immediately

20:44.160 --> 20:49.160
and point out to him perhaps, that he and I and many of us,

20:49.160 --> 20:58.160
campaign and promise the American people that if they were to remove our Democrat friends

20:59.160 --> 21:08.160
from the control of this government, that then we would no longer involve engage in government

21:08.160 --> 21:11.160
by secrecy, quite force and cover up.

21:11.160 --> 21:15.160
And I think that these facts should be brought to the President,

21:15.160 --> 21:19.160
because the American people will not stand for this, Mr. Chairman.

21:19.160 --> 21:23.160
They will not stand for a cover up, cast away through a hearing.

21:23.160 --> 21:27.160
I have asked, Mr. Chairman, I have asked that we dispose of this

21:27.160 --> 21:29.160
with all these links of hearing.

21:29.160 --> 21:33.160
That was turned down, turned down, but the representatives of the executive,

21:33.160 --> 21:36.160
once it was turned down, I say, let's go through,

21:36.160 --> 21:39.160
let's fly all the facts upon the table.

21:39.160 --> 21:46.160
And we can't fly the facts upon the tables if we're going to...

21:46.160 --> 21:48.160
...draw an iron curtain.

21:48.160 --> 21:54.160
When we're halfway through the hearing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask for an executive session,

21:54.160 --> 21:57.160
a meeting in the committee, so I will know.

21:57.160 --> 22:00.160
I will know just...

22:00.160 --> 22:07.160
...what extent the committee is going to honor this order, or any other order, like?

22:07.160 --> 22:15.160
Chairman, I move that we recess until tomorrow morning at Kenneth Fox,

22:15.160 --> 22:22.160
and in the meantime, we have the executive session to take up the controversy that's known to few.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.160
Yes, sir, I'd like to hear it all.

22:25.160 --> 22:29.160
Ah, and this is the conference hall.

22:29.160 --> 22:34.160
I think in view of the fact that I have some questions,

22:34.160 --> 22:37.160
trying to place the responsibility,

22:37.160 --> 22:41.160
but I should make my position clear at this time,

22:41.160 --> 22:45.160
before this motion is passed on.

22:45.160 --> 22:51.160
For the present, at least, I'm not disagreeing with these.

22:52.160 --> 23:01.160
The executive is directed with respect to conversations that may have taken place at this meeting,

23:01.160 --> 23:12.160
because it may be within his rights to say that you cannot inquire him to.

23:12.160 --> 23:19.160
How a decision was arrived at in the executive branch of the government act,

23:19.160 --> 23:22.160
of the president's level,

23:22.160 --> 23:25.160
but I do not agree,

23:25.160 --> 23:28.160
or I hold a disagree,

23:28.160 --> 23:35.160
and I challenge this upon making this record clear,

23:35.160 --> 23:43.160
with respect to what was the result of the decision made at that time,

23:43.160 --> 23:48.160
whether responsibility shifted from the Secretary of the Army

23:48.160 --> 23:50.160
to higher authority.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.160
That we are entitled to know,

23:53.160 --> 23:57.160
because unless we can get that information,

23:57.160 --> 23:59.160
we will not have the evidence here,

23:59.160 --> 24:02.160
upon which to make a decision.

24:02.160 --> 24:07.160
That will place the responsibility.

24:07.160 --> 24:12.160
The Secretary is acting under orders from higher authority.

24:12.160 --> 24:17.160
The Secretary cannot be sentient for carrying out those orders,

24:17.160 --> 24:21.160
without regard to how the decision was arrived at.

24:21.160 --> 24:25.160
If the decision was made at that time,

24:25.160 --> 24:27.160
this committee is entitled to know it,

24:27.160 --> 24:32.160
and entitled to know where the responsibility lies for what occurred,

24:32.160 --> 24:36.160
their efforts in carrying out that decision.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.160
I shall ask if the executive hearing,

24:39.160 --> 24:42.160
the New Testament, the chairman of this committee,

24:42.160 --> 24:44.160
the chairman whether we are going in this,

24:44.160 --> 24:47.160
or answers the wrong questions,

24:47.160 --> 24:51.160
ask the result of the conference,

24:51.160 --> 24:55.160
and not how the decision was arrived at.

24:55.160 --> 24:59.160
Your second is a motion made by the governor from Michigan,

24:59.160 --> 25:05.160
Senator, I will oppose that motion.

25:05.160 --> 25:11.160
Because my opinion is the duty of this committee

25:11.160 --> 25:14.160
to get the truth, if they can't get all the truth,

25:14.160 --> 25:18.160
then it is still the duty of the committee to get as much

25:18.160 --> 25:21.160
as the truth as possible.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.160
And I do not believe that the hearing should be recessed

25:24.160 --> 25:25.160
or postponed.

25:25.160 --> 25:30.160
I believe that the hearing could proceed at the same time

25:30.160 --> 25:35.160
that these problems are discussed and adjudicated as well.

25:35.160 --> 25:39.160
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I,

25:39.160 --> 25:44.160
therefore, Mr. Chairman, I move the 10 minutes or 12

25:44.160 --> 25:48.160
as a substitute motion that we adjourn and reconvene

25:48.160 --> 25:50.160
at four o'clock.

25:50.160 --> 25:54.160
For recess and reconvene at four o'clock.

25:54.160 --> 25:58.160
The intention of the chairman temporarily to夥 it

25:58.160 --> 26:01.160
is suggesting that we simply recess now,

26:01.160 --> 26:04.160
as I'm in ten and not having any recognition

26:04.160 --> 26:06.160
and needed to or should.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.160
I didn't say that, Mr. Chairman.

26:08.160 --> 26:12.160
I said that instead of recessing until tomorrow,

26:12.160 --> 26:18.160
that now we recess and reconvene at four o'clock.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.160
The afternoon has an enormous procedure

26:21.160 --> 26:25.160
so that we proceed with these hearings.

26:25.160 --> 26:30.160
The correction of my distinguished colleague,

26:30.160 --> 26:33.160
Mr. Chairman, is that a remarkable source of justice

26:33.160 --> 26:37.160
that we make it to 30 in order that we have full time

26:37.160 --> 26:39.160
for an executive hearing.

26:39.160 --> 26:46.160
I would modify my substitute motion that I extend, Mr. Chairman.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.160
I have seconded the substitute motion.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.160
The sentiments for justice and the assumptions.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.160
The assembly is a charity point for the reckoning

26:53.160 --> 26:56.160
to the motion, certainly the motion is made by a standard time

26:56.160 --> 26:59.160
and has been seconded by the chairman of the council.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.160
I remember you from the...

27:01.160 --> 27:03.160
I wonder if you could make it in the two-thirty

27:03.160 --> 27:05.160
if you wouldn't make yourself the motion clear-fought

27:05.160 --> 27:10.160
because it will take a sometime to try to solve these problems.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.160
I think we should give ourselves push and find.

27:13.160 --> 27:17.160
Mr. Chairman, it's absolutely good.

27:17.160 --> 27:21.160
Every consideration possible for the union setup was counted.

27:21.160 --> 27:25.160
I will now further revise my substitute motion

27:25.160 --> 27:27.160
and recommend that we, the Minions,

27:27.160 --> 27:32.160
that we reach that until 25% in the midst of this year's government

27:32.160 --> 27:36.160
and the private sector and the private sector

27:36.160 --> 27:38.160
are accepted in the model.

27:38.160 --> 27:44.160
Mr. Chairman, I think this is a major question

27:44.160 --> 27:47.160
to be with that to the staff.

27:47.160 --> 27:52.160
No, I feel that it would be full hearty for us

27:52.160 --> 27:56.160
to walk into this and act quickly, I think.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.160
I think I know it's one number of the committee

27:59.160 --> 28:01.160
that's a serious question.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.160
And rather than to set a fire on this,

28:03.160 --> 28:06.160
they will meet at two thirty or two at Keirth Park.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.160
There's no need of a coming back here.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.160
The Minions until this question has been resolved.

28:11.160 --> 28:14.160
So I would like to suggest that I don't care whether

28:14.160 --> 28:17.160
the trade brought about a morning.

28:17.160 --> 28:21.160
But I think the main question is to resolve the economy.

28:21.160 --> 28:26.160
So I would like to suggest that we recess now

28:26.160 --> 28:28.160
and we register session and some back-to-the-college

28:28.160 --> 28:32.160
to chair after the session is made by the committee.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.160
Mr. Chairman, when you say I can speak to that,

28:35.160 --> 28:37.160
I do not agree with Mr. Potter.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.160
I believe that these hearings should go on

28:39.160 --> 28:43.160
and should go on regardless of whether this matter is

28:43.160 --> 28:46.160
a due to get into the satisfaction of the committee

28:46.160 --> 28:48.160
or anybody else.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.160
So I would like to ask for an emotion

28:50.160 --> 28:52.160
which has been moved and seconded,

28:52.160 --> 28:55.160
I believe, is now before the committee.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.160
Very relevant in question.

28:58.160 --> 29:01.160
The Chair and the Senate are motionally repeated.

29:01.160 --> 29:04.160
That's the candidate for an emotion that does not further

29:04.160 --> 29:06.160
discussion.

29:06.160 --> 29:12.160
It is that we recess now and reconvene at three o'clock

29:12.160 --> 29:15.160
and that the Chair and all of these seconded sessions

29:15.160 --> 29:19.160
are raised in the interim for the purposes of discussing

29:19.160 --> 29:25.160
the situation as a reason with regard to the executive order

29:25.160 --> 29:29.160
on the testimony of this adaption.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.160
Any further discussion?

29:31.160 --> 29:34.160
I read it for the vote.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.160
Madam Chair, it's made before the vote.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.160
That if it's resailed, he will call the executive session

29:40.160 --> 29:43.160
in room 357.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.160
To work to the two-part.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.160
120 to the orange.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.160
130 to one-two.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.160
One-two.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.160
How about one-one-one-one-one-one-one?

29:52.160 --> 29:54.160
It's been a year, it's an hour, 20 minutes.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.160
I've got to make it.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.160
Give us one.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.160
That's a one-two-three-five.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.160
One-two-three.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.160
We've got our 130 to one-two-three.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.160
One-two-three.

30:01.160 --> 30:05.160
The Chair will follow the seconded session in room 357.

30:05.160 --> 30:08.160
130 gets the motion prepared.

30:08.160 --> 30:11.160
So in favor of the motion made by Senator Simonton,

30:11.160 --> 30:14.160
the seconded by Senator McAllen will signify by

30:14.160 --> 30:15.160
do I roll call?

30:15.160 --> 30:16.160
What are your calls?

30:16.160 --> 30:17.160
I don't know.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.160
You can't maybe cancel by.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.160
Very well.

30:20.160 --> 30:24.160
I roll call vote, Senator McAllen.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.160
All right.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.160
Senator Jackson.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.160
Senator Jackson.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.160
All right.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.160
Senator Parks.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.160
No.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.160
Senator Simon.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.160
All right.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.160
Senator works.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.160
The Chair goes by the motion prevails in room 130.

30:37.160 --> 30:40.160
We can be in a three-fifth off here.
