WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Committee will please come to order.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Chair, would you again like to welcome the guests

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
who have come to the committee room today?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
We're happy to have you here observing

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
one of your congressional committees tonight.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
And Chair would like to remind the audience

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
of the Standing Committee rule,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
which many of you have heard many times before,

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
and to the effect that there are to be no audible manifestations

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
of approval or disapproval of anything

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
that is carried in the committee room.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
That includes the fall,

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
unnecessarily loud laughter and things of that type.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
The uniform members of the Capitol Police Force,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
did you see before you,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
and the plane closed,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
people scattered throughout the audience.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Have been requested by the committee

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
to carry out their rules,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
to remove from the committee room immediately,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
firmly but politely,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
any of our guests who for reasons best known to themselves

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
might elect to violate the terms of the conditions

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
under which you entered the room,

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
namely to refrain from any behavior that would in any way

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
interfere with the conduct of the hearing.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Chair would like to acknowledge the presentation

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
of this little model of a ship,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
which is the model of the ship from which the picture

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
of the cane immediately was taken and expressed

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
to the members of the committee's effect

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
that he has been advised by Columbia Pictures

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
they are inviting the members of our council

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
and the members of the committee next week

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
to have a previewing of that picture here in Washington.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
So you may expect a letter to the mail

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
which is not a subpoenae sooner or later.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
That's a pretty good version, yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Now, if we are ready to begin with the last other question

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
which asks by Selenger May Salen,

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
does the Markman German?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Uh, a gentleman's?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Did you say the cane or the corn mutiny?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Cain.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Cain.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Cain.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I am not going to recognize Mr. Cohen

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
on the point of question to reference on that.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Bill Filth, the chairman, I do have a point of first

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
when privilege I'd like to raise here,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
not a matter of two serious,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
but like the record straight.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
May I say to the Prime Minister of the Prisons?

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
I know the one lawyer is extremely busy trying a case.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
Oftentimes he has shoved before him papers.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
And at first glance, the may misconstrued the importance

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
of the particular document.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
I think that perhaps happened this morning

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
as far as Mr. Welfth was concerned.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
While he and I have differed on a number of locations,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm sure that he would not, uh,

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
at all, uh, attempt to, uh,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
misconstrued the document.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm seeing this all serious.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
Uh, this morning, Mr. Welfth asked me whether or not,

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
I had testified that I had not seen or seen the Cain application

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
for a commission.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Uh, he read my testimony to the effect that I had not.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Uh, Mr. Welfth apparently looking through these documents

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
of the opinion when he saw the name,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Joe McCarthy, him the folder that I had,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
uh, I would like to now either make it clear

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
or let Mr. Welfth make it clear that I did not fix my name.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Do any application by Mr. Cain for a commission?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Uh, no recommendation for a commission.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Uh, I think Mr. Welfth was, uh, justified

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
and making this mistake over in that my name is affixed

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
as a witness to Mr. Cain's loyalty, oh.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
The loyalty of the effect that he does not belong to,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
oh, there's a vast number of communist fund organizations.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
I raised this up in criticism of Mr. Welfth

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
because I saw the folder, uh,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
show before him just a couple of minutes before he raised his question.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
And I, uh, this is not a big kind of well-stay in his sense.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
But I, uh, I feel this was a very, very honest mistake.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Kevin, uh, I, well, I think perhaps a comment from me is

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
the hardest senator.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm sure I'll recognize you, but the,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
also that you, red thumb,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
it is true it's the so-called loyalty author

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
and figure-turing respect to the, uh,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
subversely, a blister of names on it.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
It is signed, D. David Cain,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
and then there's a blank where it's a signature of what makes things,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
what does he not, sir, and Roy M. Cohn signed it.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
And the perfect.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
And Senator, if you ask me why I'm the dick and your name appears

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
to be what it does, it's more than I know.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Uh, frankly, it's more than I know, too.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I apparently was asked, uh,

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
apparently Roy and I were asked to witness this, uh,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
loyal to you, which had passed the day of didn't belong to any of these subversive organizations,

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
uh, and, uh, as you know, as a lawyer,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
uh, what's the thing a document is,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
a matter of, uh, form?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Uh, I don't even recall when I witnessed this,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
this is definitely my signature,

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
but it does not have anything to do whatsoever with his application for a commission,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
other than the usual loyalty or what you would say.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Uh, I believe in requesting any position government.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I think we're pretty well in the agreement,

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
if you'll add that the loyalty or the company is the application for a commission.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Yes, I think we should, I think also on Mr. Weld.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
So we will agree that, uh,

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
uh, while this is now attached to the balance of the file,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
at the time, at the time this was handed to me,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
this is merely a loyalty old.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Now, there was no application for commission attached to this.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Uh, there's nothing except this, uh,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
certification that he did not belong to these various communist organizations,

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
and, uh, period.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
May I say one other thing to, uh,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
when I have my next 10 minutes,

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
I will ask you certain questions based on the application itself,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
but I've seen no point in offering an evidence.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
If you desire to enter into the paper that you have before you'll be offered an evidence,

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
it may be.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Uh, no.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
As you wish.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
No, I, I think that the, uh,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
members, as many might want to see it,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
if any of the members of the press care to see it good.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
It's a single sheet, but why don't we mark that in evidence?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
And I assure you that that's the rest of the application.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I would have no objection with this going in evidence.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I think that the answer is, the exhibits are given to proper individualism.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
They're all missed well.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
That's just fine, it's a moment, yes.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yes.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Uh, Senator Jackson, I guess your next sentence.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Vendor Jackson, there's Senator.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Ah, perhaps a little.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Uh, Senator Oche.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Senator Simon.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Senator McCoy, I see.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I have a string of questions here, uh,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
about Pam Poo, if you'd help me with a short answer,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
it's possible.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
I appreciate it, I'd like to get over it.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
For some time when I get the gun on this appropriate bill for defendants.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
The next question.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Are senators who are not members of either of these committees,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
nevertheless entitled in your opinion,

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
to receive confidential documents as authorized persons under the espionage act?

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
As authorized persons on the espionage, right up to our deck.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
I don't think these stamps on a document, uh,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
it's been following, uh, Senator.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I'll try and give you short answers, but as I said,

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
it's, uh, John Jones has embezzled $50,000.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I don't think he can protect himself by a stamp of secrecy.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Uh, I don't think that any information,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
and again, I'd say I hesitate to do the long answer,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
but any information was written.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I've been exposed to the name of informants,

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
and let's get a technique, or anything with my, uh,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
the name of the National Security should be,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
and anyway, may it be public, other than that.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Other than the American people said of all the information available.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
There's one I think that's based on your previous testimony, I like it.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Just be sure I have it in the record.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Is the chairman of the House on American Activity Committee,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
and you're also in title to receive classified documents?

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Uh, Mr. Femmingman answers the same,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
doesn't the question of the,

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
the stamps on the document get the trust of the information within the document?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, I'll be sure I understand if a man has a classified document,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
and believes that any can prove wrongdoing of his superior,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
has either right to bring it to the chairman of the House on American Activity Committee.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
Not only the right, but the duty of he knows the superior is you'll be wrong, though.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
If he thinks his superior is wrong, he may think it's not knowing.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Yes, right.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
How about the other members of the House on American Activity Committee?

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
I think under the act of 1912 Senator Femmingman,

09:27.000 --> 09:36.000
every man working in government has a duty to bring information wrongdoing to any son of any kind.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
All the members of the House of Representatives also authorize to receive confidential documents.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm pardoned.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I think that the congress thought I was going to mention,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
not not going to mention any of these.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
All other members of the House of Representatives also authorize to receive confidential documents.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Senator, when you refer to a confidential document again, may I say,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
pass it by any information,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
let's not stick to that, any information having to do with wrongdoing,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
regardless of how it's classified,

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
any representative of the people of the handle have.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Next question.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
Do you think it members of the staff of this committee are also authorized to receive confidential documents?

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
I think the members of this, I just think it keeps going over the whole and over the rest,

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
but the members of the staff and not only have the rights of the duty to get any information

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
with second-guet about any wrongdoing, any person in government.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You're talking about all the staff,

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
regardless of the particular stamps of the press upon the staff.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
You're talking about all the staff members of just some,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
all of the staff members.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Even though it might not have been clear,

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
when we talk about being clear at some point,

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
as far as I know, no one on my staff has been refused any clearance.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Originally, we have an explanation.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Originally, we asked for clearance from the defensive park.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
I mean, running a judgment, I'm only asking for information.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I would like to explain to you in protecting every member of the staff.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
If I don't give it a picture.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
Originally, I think that I asked for clearance from the defensive parkman

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
for all members of the staff

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
when we discovered later that, as far as I know,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
we're getting no secret material anything like that from the defensive parkman.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
The question of clearance hasn't had much meaning.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
I myself have been satisfied that all members of my staff

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
are good, honest, decent, loyal Americans.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, I have no choice to doubt that, Senator.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
But I wouldn't like to ask that.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
When I was, for example, chairman of the National Security Resource Board,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I was constantly in the Tomic Energy Secret.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
And not only myself, but my secretary had to have two clearance,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
which is even higher than Tomic Secret.

12:05.000 --> 12:13.000
Now, if some member of the Tomic Energy Commission came to a member of this staff,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
who did not have clearance or had been refused clearance,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
do you think they have the right to see that information?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Any information of wrongdoing is...

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Senator, can I just take 30 seconds of your time?

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
You and I discussed in an executive session.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
And I think you were very right in the position you took at that time.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
When it's just the question of whether or not we should have public hearings

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
on alleged communist infiltration of atomic and hydrogen bomb plants,

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
you took the position at that time, and I think rightly so,

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
that before we made that decision, I should take the matter up at the White House.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
I don't think it was a public session, but it was an executive session.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Without discussing any of the evidence we had, as you know,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
I did take it up with some of the White House A's

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
with the man from the Justice Department,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
with one of our high elected officials in the executive.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I don't mean President Eisenhower.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
I paid enough to the United States.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
And I was convinced at that time that it would not be in the national interest

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
at that particular time.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
I am implying that particular time to hold any public hearings on atomic energy matters

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
and other questions that you bring up, but they're not.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
There should be a few questions.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
I would say this if we can work out any kind of a workable arrangement

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
with the executive, whereby we can get information,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
which may be classified as Secret Top Secret.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Then it would be of the utmost importance that all members of the staff

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
get clearance of some kind, either through atomic energy,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
defense department won't have you.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
As of now, I have paid very little attention to any clearance.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
As I recall, no one has been refused any clearance,

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
but we haven't been getting Secret Top Secret material,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
so the clearance doesn't much...

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Here's my point.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I'm sorry, I did too much time on that.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah, I'll try to make my point.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
If I can, in the executive department,

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
all people who are cleared for classified documents are allowed to see.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
And one of the most important things in the executive brain to the government

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
is not to allow people who have not been cleared to see classified information,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
see classified information.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
Every member of the executive branch is found by his instructions

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and by his old ineffective act.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Now, what worries me about this, and it's an object of discussion,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
it has nothing to do with personality,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
what worries me is that, apparently, from this testimony,

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
it's beginning to appear as if you think that members of the staff

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
of the Senate and the House have a right to classified information

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
with other government employees, including members of the military,

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
have not, based on their orders.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I hope I didn't...

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
If I can give you the order, I question one upon one I said,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
my review to this over and over,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
that is all members of this committee,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
all members of the staff,

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
I think are entitled to every piece of evidence

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
about wrongdoing any place in government.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
I think the Americans people are entitled to that.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Now, as one of the...

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Again, if I may take another ten seconds.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Don't take this too much.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I'll talk to you later.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
The UNI and Onder are two theories.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
One is that it's a favor to the Americans people

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
look to know what's going on here in Washington.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
The other is that they're entitled to information with the rear

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
or they're hired man on the fight.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I subscribe to the latter theory.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I think they're entitled to know what's going on,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
and I don't think, Senator,

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
that you can teach that from the Congress of the American people

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
by stamping something classified.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Well, now, next question,

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
would you think you were authorized to receive the classified document?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
If the document, which was delivered to you,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
that the two-in-a-quarter paid,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
had originated in the Army rather than with the FBI.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I presume you ran into that based on three of the testimony with the A.

16:25.000 --> 16:32.000
I felt that I was not only authorized to get the document,

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
but I had a duty to act upon the information contained therein.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
I did that as a result of that,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
as a result of the work of the committee, I should say,

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
from 35 people who were then working in the radar plan

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
or no longer working there.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Next question, would it make any difference

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
if the classified documents had born in Army stamp of secret

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
or pop secret instead of the FBI classification of confidential?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
The stamp on the documents, Mr. Simon,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
can to me have no importance whatsoever,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
because you can any clerk,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
any one of the two million person government,

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
can pick up a stamp marked secret and rubber stamp of document.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Suppose the document requires two clearance

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
by the atomic energy commission.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
The answer would be the same, wouldn't it?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I don't think I understand your question.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
Well, suppose the document had been one which required few clearance to see,

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
you would still feel the same way about it, wouldn't you?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Some of the Senator,

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
we are not talking about how we're getting atomic secret.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
We are not trying to do that.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
We're not talking about getting defense secret.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
We are only talking, can I make money?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
We're only talking,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
so if my answer is not set up,

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I hope the Senator can ask another question.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Senator, we are not talking,

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
here about getting the nation's secrets.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
We are now discussing the right of our committee to get him from mission,

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
showing that people in positions of power are abusing that power,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
our dishonors,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
are serving the communist power,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
our fellow defenders, fully made.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
And we can pull it down this way.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I'm curious.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, my only chairman has been good enough to tell communist.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
There was a time in the hearing when one of the members of your staff,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
as our members said, that there was communist infiltration in the atomic energy plant

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
and an hydrogen plant.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Actually, both hydrogen plants would come under the atomic energy commission.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The presumption they'll follow with these,

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
that they'll choose, there would be information which would be given this committee.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
And I don't believe based on what Mr. Carr said,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
that you have two clear points on the committee.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
If I'm right, if I'm wrong, I'm not that correct.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
Well, you are both right and wrong under a list of respect.

19:01.000 --> 19:07.000
That we do not attempt to get the atomic hydrogen secret.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Our committee does not deal with the ability of the e-bomb,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
or the H-bomb as a manufacturer.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
However, if we find there's evidence that there are Twitter's

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
in the e-bomb plant, then we want that information.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
And that is the kind of information that, you know,

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
in effect, we specialize in graph, shrub, and communism, what have you.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
We don't, our committee does not.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
It looks for the military or air-age bomb thinker.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Thank you, Chairman.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
I think I can close my questioning, and I can make a grand.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Great.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
It's going to be any questions?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
I just want to talk about my cabinet.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I only take that.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
I don't think it's possible to go my syrup and nothing.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
Senator, you testified at age 6247

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
to subultry to refer to you as a refrigid with this warning

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
that you had not read state signs application for commission.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Is that right?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
That was correct, and that is still my testimony.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
And we now know from examining if there's no indication

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
of read it or endorse it or anything else.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
That's right, that is correct.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
You have not read it?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yes.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I have not read it.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
You know, I only say this to Mr. Moon,

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
I grant that certain portions of the first time I've seen him.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
For any event you're not familiar with, the contents of the application.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
I am not, no further question.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Mr. Walsh, your cabinet.

20:34.000 --> 20:46.000
Senator McCarthy, in reference to Jean-David Stein's application for it,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
can I ask your mic as a reward for once again?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Yes.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Is it?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
It was all right now, I think.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Yes, sir.

20:54.000 --> 21:03.000
I think you have a copy of, or did at least, have a copy of the Jean-David Stein's application

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
for a commission at your desk today.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Mr. Coln, out of copy, I ain't...

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
Somebody's from Mr. Walsh, that's very pretty.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I think I've been referring to you.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
Well, in any event, I think, for my purposes, it's satisfactory if I read a portion of it,

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
which reflects his experience.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Can I follow that, as you read it, Mr. Walsh?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm reading from...

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
I may say that, Mr. Walsh, but I don't think that you read badly, read correctly,

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
but this morning, I made a statement of you said that if you said that I assigned the application

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
to take your words for that, you were of the opinion I had of that time.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
I made the mistake of not checking the application's address, and I like to check what we read.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Now, what's paid to you reading from?

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
I'm reading item 36, that something headed application for appointment in the Office of Reserve

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Corps, which is the first sheet.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
It should be the top sheet of what you have before you.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
And that's on the second page, a block of type writing.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Thank you, Mr. Walsh.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
The first is the six-foot-foot-foot.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Beginning with the words, when I was 17.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I left.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Have you looked there?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yes, sir.

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
When I was 17, Thomas, I joined you as Naval Mountain Reserve,

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
and at that time, had a one-year training program followed by C.V.D. Thomas,

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
and I was a midshipman, Thomas, inactive for several months, curious.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
When I reported a San Francisco to begin training, Thomas,

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
I discovered that the program had been linked to four years,

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
and I volunteered for immediate C.V.D. in the Army and Transport Service.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
I was excited and served as transportation officer

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
in the transportation office, period.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
Duty-sweetly help handle all ships' business, such as payroll,

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
requisitions, customs, immigrations, and health matters, Thomas,

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
voyage repair list, personnel and properties, EEC.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
While in the Army and Transport Service, I made several voyages

23:16.000 --> 23:22.000
as a ship's officer with ranks of new tenants to such places

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
as Japan, Korea, Philippines, Hawaii, Panama, and Germany.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
Service extended from June 1946 to June 1947.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
Psychological Wear, W-A-R-E, but I take that to meet war.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Psychological warfare is my field.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Do you agree that that should be the need you have as senator, sir?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I think that's a little more clearly.

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
I think it must mean it's my field, I'm from also business and management.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
I noticed in that typewriting a reference to voyages,

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
a ship's officer with ranks of new tenants.

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
And you have an occasion spoken in this room of the rank of simulated new tenants,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
or some similar phrase, is that correct, Senator?

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
I think the correct phrase is simulated rank.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Estimated or stimuli?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Simulated.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Yes, I am doing this.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
About a few minutes.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Yes.

24:30.000 --> 24:39.000
In any event, you do not understand that the Missission had a full

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
rank of new tenants unfold, while in that service, do you?

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
Yes, I do, Mr. Rose.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
You're fairly of the rank of the tenants in the Army Transportation's Purpose.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
You do, if you can mind that all I know about this is what I have heard.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
Did you ever hear that one of the difficulties about his being commissioned was

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
that he turned off that he actually didn't have a rank of new tenants?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Did you ever hear that, sir?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
No, I did not.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Also, I was interested.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Some days ago, you said something about G-Day that's shining,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
making him in some way with Korea.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
And I have heard here that he was on a ship, which made voyages

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
to such places as Japan's Korea, Philippines, Hawaii, Panama, and Germany.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
Were you basing what you said about G-Day that's shining in respect to Korea

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
on what is stated in this paragraph?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
No, but what Dave told me, and I made it very clear to you the other day

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
that he did not serve in the Korean War.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, I told you he was over there in the Army Transport Service.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Some period of time before the war, and there was no question I'm sure

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
anyone's mind about that.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
It feels like a record.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
I don't think you had any of the impression that he fought in the Korean War, sir.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Why not?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I'm not suggesting that he did.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I made it very clear positively.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I made a statement that he had not served in the Korean War.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
And the only connection with Korea that G-Day but China had is for

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
I Juneau and I know whether it was the occasional landing there

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
when he was on this in this transport.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
This?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
As a little comment from the Army Transport.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
I want now just to direct your attention to two or three places

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
in the record having to do with the matters that have been under discussion

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
so heavily this morning.

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
And see if we cannot close the references to this matter

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
with what I now which is called to call to your attention.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
In volume 10, in volume 10 at page 1-8-8-0,

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
I just want to volume 10 at page 18-8-1.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Here it goes.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Where your name first appears, Senator Matrati,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
and the phrase, the first sentence is, I did not,

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
I drop down three lines and then read your testimony.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
I will never put Mr. Hoover in the position of either saying yes or no

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
as to whether I should make use of this material.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
I don't think he would want to speak put in that position.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
I have never discussed with him.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
And while I don't, I don't mean to skip it, I'll go to your last sentence.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
I have used my own judgment and the ones that I thought should be used.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I have used.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
There's no doubt that that's the correct statement of your presentation is it Senator?

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
Let's correct statement I think.

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
And again, in another volume which is volume 11,

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
at page 204-0, when you would just be supposed to move.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
I know.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Just before.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I mentioned.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
Page 204-0, the first, the second paragraph on the page,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I read you the first five lines.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
I don't think that a congressional committee is bombed

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
if I may have the chair's attention.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
I don't think that any congressional committee is bombed by the opinion of anyone

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
in the executive as to whether or not they are entitled to certain information.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
That remains your stand today.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I'm sure that did not.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
You are correct.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
And on page 305 of the record in volume 18.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
Volume 14th, volume 18.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
Volume 14th, volume 18.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Yes, Mr. Drill.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
About six lines down the first long answer,

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
I'll read only the first two lines.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Senator Maccarrity.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
I say that I don't think this committee is bombed by any letter from the attorney general.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
That was represented your view then and now that it is not.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Great.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
One more point in this connection.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I think it would be helpful if we had in the records,

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
the old suboffice that a military officer

30:04.000 --> 30:10.000
signed on joining the military forces

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
and being assigned to the Pentagon.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I would have no objection with that.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
It's short.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
I, with a blank for the name,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
having been appointed an officer in the Army of the United States

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
and indicated above in the grade of blanks,

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
against all enemies for and domestic,

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same,

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion,

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
upon which I am about to enter, so help me God.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
There are therefore three things that he says he will do,

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
first that he will support and defend the Constitution,

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
secondly that he will bear true faith and allegiance to the same,

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
and thirdly that he will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
upon which he has about to enter.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
You and I understand Senator and we have different views about it.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
And I am not a better, but you and I have different views.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Because I do it, Tom, in the last time he was old,

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
where he says he will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
upon which he is about to enter.

31:35.000 --> 31:42.000
He does at that point that the legends would appear on FBI documents,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
making them confidential or secret,

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
make them front this officer,

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
and he under his oath of office must obey the orders of his superior

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
as to whether or not he reveals those documents.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Is that correct sir?

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
You are incorrect, Mr. Wilson, but our military established the documents

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
in the Dernberg's files left.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
No man could use any legal documents.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Thank you.
