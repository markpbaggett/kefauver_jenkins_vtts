WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
That was very definitely established.

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
I drove with all of Mr. Roestring, all the trials,

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
found there at T.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
That, no matter what order, a superior officer gave you.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
He could ask you to perform an illegal act.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
You could not use that as a defense to any trial.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Now therefore, you can't do anything.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
You can't do anything.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
You can't do anything.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
You can't do anything.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
You can't do anything.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
You can't do anything.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
You can't do anything.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
You can't do anything.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Therefore, that must apply as a day

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
because we've never changed that, which means that if someone in the military knows of

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
a prison, a espionage, a communist infiltration,

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
there's no order of any superior, which can justify his refusing to give that information to the proper official.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Thank you very much.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Thank you very much.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Is this the end?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm Carol Cash, I'm your miss Allen.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm your lover.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I was a 12-year-old document.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Please go.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
There's someone.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Anop.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
There's someone.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
There's 100.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
And I can.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
I read the first sentence, and then be belated, and that year it was the 10th.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
To include Frank Carr in the smear by alleging in the latest drug documents,

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
but Mr. Carr sought influential treatment for try to shine as dishonest.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I call your attention to their word dishonest.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Did you mean it when you said it then, and do you mean it now?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Yes, sir.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
That is hard to the act of a honest man and a man of integrity as a senator.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
I think Mr. MacMillan, that's the inclusion of Frank Carr with no evidence whatsoever against him.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
I was one of the fellowest things I've seen for a long time.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
And I would be a poetically, bluntly, the good jury who has seen the evidence against him.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
I want to make it clear, Mr. McCullum, that I know those who are responsible for that.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
They finally move in fact, and I'm not saying the document of Mr. Welch,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I assume he got his information from someone else.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
I assume that any lawyer, he relied upon that information.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
But who gave him this information, I don't know.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm not accusing Mr. Welch of dishonest to hear.

02:40.000 --> 02:48.000
He was voted in this case as an attorney to try an extremely difficult case, if I may say that.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
And I just assumed that he took the facts of the government.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, whoever gave him the facts of the one that we were the oldest responsible, right?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I should say.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
And whoever did, who ever gave him those facts committed an act of dishonesty.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
No question about that, according to your allegation.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
No question about that, but we've only had the evidence in now, and there's nothing proven against the fact that he was filing for an attorney.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
We asked some other prosecutor, we asked some others in here, where dishonest is used without reference to Mr. Car.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
So I mentioned those, mentioned that one simply to keep the record straight and to discuss.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
The record, and I call your attention on to your paragraph 15,

03:37.000 --> 03:47.000
will recently confide the camp to direct file at the chairman and to accuse him of attempting to secure special treatment.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
For a private sign is branded as false by reference to the written record and through the file,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Stephen Adams report itself.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
In fact, as false, you would hardly can screw that to be the act of an honest man and a man of integrity.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
No, I think Senator Simon can still do it.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
No, first of all, I think that Senator, I'm sorry.

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
I think the budget I do, I think it's a highly improper and entirely dishonest.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
I think it is for the charges where file for the purpose, which they accomplished, namely,

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
calling off our investigation of those who are protecting the senator in order to have solved Mr. Wells.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
Now, those charges were made in that memorandum of phonologically advanced people, Mr. Wells, that in case.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
I need to absolve Mr. Wells to charge him with anything.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I don't know.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, that he ran.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I know nothing about what parts Mr. Wells took in this.

04:50.000 --> 04:59.000
I may say that I was a bit disappointed Mr. Wells as a lawyer when the case Mr. Adams and Stephen go then.

04:59.000 --> 05:09.000
And he was asked by one of the centers so that he would agree that the case against Mr. Carter had fallen and he refused to say yes.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Now, again, I don't want to, should there be any...

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Well, that says, not as mortal as he was.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
He's got a client. He may have had to do that.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
If you don't, let's get back to the question there.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I certainly ask you.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
If this wasn't contained in the chronological documents, five of the time Mr. Wells said it's the case.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
I think we have to refer to documents, Senator, I would rather not present it.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
There wasn't an accusation in that document about the special treatment of five of the time.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
We know that the woman I'm looking back at it.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm not sure that close to all that.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Mr. Wells said that.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Mr. Wells did not in the case of that time.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm very happy now.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
That's what.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
Now we go to number 16, if we may please.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
I read the last sentence for that paragraph.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Secondary Robert T. Stevens.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Then communicated with the chairman and commence.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
A series of efforts to interfere with the investigation.

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
To stop the hearings and to prevent various of his appointees from being called by the subcommittee.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
You have testified all that, or that is true.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
And that the secretary and Mr. Adams did turn the picture into here with the committee investigation.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Is that correct?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I think the record is straight.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
We talk about appointees.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
We're talking about appointees of the secretary of the Army.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
I frankly don't know which of those appointees who are Mr. Stevens' personal appointees.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I'd have a fund for a chair.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I didn't think that would have.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I would have a pay over a immediate acquisition.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
He is fine to prevent them from just fine when the president strikes them.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
So that charge is a charge that you now maintain is true.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Just wouldn't you say that?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Yes, it's true that it's highly improper.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes, Mr. Stevens was not the actor but honest, straight, the audit secretary of the Army.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't like to mention that they trust them.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Bob Stevens is a lawyer.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
It's a lawyer.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Let's let them say that if they're friends with Bob Stevens.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I don't like these.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I've been marching my stance to make short answers.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I've been making long as they have.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I have had a lot of experience.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
I'll contact with Bob Stevens.

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
I failed as he was number one trying to a good job as secretary of the Army.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Up until the threat something was issued.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
I knew of nothing which I could consider dishonest in his record.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
He appeared to be trying to give us full cooperation while we're taking out individual companies.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
I do know that something happened when we tried to get the names of those responsible for these liquor trodling

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
and those tried to get the oil-y board for the committee to find a fine of five days since

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm not coming to truckers back to the radar plant.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Now I don't want to say that Bob Stevens is not patriotic, not honest.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I would say that just in case.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
I think secretary Stevens has had the experience that has a number of people have had.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
He came to Washington.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
The business man, no background in politics.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
No experience down here.

08:29.000 --> 08:38.000
And just couldn't cope with the rather rough, grand of politics played in Washington.

08:38.000 --> 08:46.000
And that connection may I say that it appears now as soon as I'm going to know that Mr. Clark Clifford,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
the advisor of the Democratic party was advising him.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Now I think Senator Smith had a men mistake in getting Clark Clifford to do that.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
He and I have a different.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
I assume Senator Smith himself, that maybe it was a great service with party.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
If he could use his political advisor to steer the course of Mr. Stevens.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I think it was a great there.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
I think it was a disservice to both parties, but I'm not accusing Senator Smith of any improper motive.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I think he was doing something extremely clever at that time.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
I don't think it was.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
I mean, I mean, I mean, I meanronic of actually, I mean I can't even talk about Stevens' mind.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
I think the common guy to him, two days before the charges were made.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
He very honestly, very frankly said that there's nothing to these charges, two days later he made them.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I think it was highly improper.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So, Senator, look at the date of this.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
I asked you about it.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
September 7th, 1950, when he convinced all this action.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
And when you started off on this little divergent air presentation,

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
I thought you were ten points as the chicken lunch and a number of animal regreement lunch

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
and when there were just a group of Republican politicians present and Mr. Stevens.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
So, in that tender and solicitous care, were you?

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Well, I might say that we got along very well when we had those four Republican presidents.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
We agreed on a few things that I think the UNI could agree on now, Senator.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Namely that the too many of us in battle have wished to come before it,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
and we've been entitled to have information about wrongdoing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
That was a very simple agreement.

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
I may say that after you, Senator, after you following that meeting

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
and after you called Senator Samington, now when I read those monochrome calls,

10:37.000 --> 10:46.000
I began to understand that my Democrat friends were not exactly concerned

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
with any harmony or cooperation with involve Stevens and the committee.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Why you wouldn't say I wasn't cooperating and trying to be a friend to him

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
when I told him he should have known better when they get over there with that gang?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
You believe?

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
But when you're having a big fight, let me wait, let me wait, let me wait, let me wait, let me wait.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
You may answer the question, Patrick.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
He's advising the secretary about how he should handle the campaign,

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
and I'm not saying that's a bad advice, but not exactly indicating that we were having too much harmony

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
to speed him to the punch.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
I wasn't punching, but I also have here, first of all, the way to the government gang.

11:29.000 --> 11:37.000
Senator McClellan says, I never was so surprised when you got off over there

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
and I was never so surprised when you got off over there in that gang without anybody with you.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Of course, I told you they wanted to work things out.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I may say that I think that it's my good Democrat friends on the committee

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
that have not been advising secretary Stevens that we would be investigating coming in the South of the Dancin.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
We didn't invite him to ask him gold all of a sudden.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
He got my message before we came to us.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
We could have kept him out if he was sending me the sooner.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm going to say to the senator an answer to that question.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.000
The president of the committee has made the senator McClellan five days before he came back on the committee.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
The senator came back on the committee.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Senator, you have died because that column guy sure went back on with the member one.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
By me, can the Republican first move the Senate?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I think I won't do that.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Before the next question is asked, let's return to it.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm glad our esteemed friend from Arkansas came to the Republican post room for a little gospel.

12:47.000 --> 12:56.000
This is the 35th day of the hearings and I still honestly hope that it can be completed today.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I think I will see a little of this in my duty.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
In the course of these long hearings, I did not raise at least one point of order.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
If members search me correctly, I have not in all this time.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I'll be in my self without privilege.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
I raise at least one of order today, Mr. Chairman, only for the purposes of clarification of the record.

13:18.000 --> 13:27.000
Certainly, in any litigation, there is something that should be ignored by the jury because so childish that you will do.

13:28.000 --> 13:37.000
Now hopefully in all the discussion and I must confess my own violation of the rule of that connection about this so-called two-in-one photo page document.

13:37.000 --> 13:47.000
I felt from the outset that it was irrelevant to the issues it is before us and as such, you're just only on that subject, you should be ignored entirely.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
I think the only way that we can clarify the record is that this point says a major as the opinion of the council of this committee,

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
who was hired for that purpose and who is of very distinguished lawyer and whose legal capacity I have to go to the conference.

14:03.000 --> 14:13.000
So Mr. Chairman, I would like to raise the question now as to the relevance of all the evidence and testimony on the two-in-a-quart of page document about the list.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
The opinion of the council at this point in the record was respect to the doctor.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Chair, first of all, here we have the counsel.

14:22.000 --> 14:30.000
As you all know, Mr. Chairman, I have a good being much of a mafe in the Senate of Illinois. I did not raise that question approximately a month ago.

14:30.000 --> 14:40.000
I want to be covered with my ink and say, and I say without any talk of criticism of any member of the committee, any council or any party in interest.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
That in my opinion, long, long ago, I have found all the bars insofar as evidence is concerned with any of the issues of this controversy.

14:47.000 --> 15:05.000
The issues are well defined and ideas from the senators, this is just a dismorning that perhaps it is a fine thing and a fine thing insofar as the public is concerned to have ingested these new issues in this controversy since it began.

15:05.000 --> 15:15.000
And particularly since it has been said that the aluminumic, certain constitutional questions which cannot be decided for this subcommittee,

15:15.000 --> 15:27.000
but we have got to be long ago fully exploited and illuminated, and which I emphasize all of them know-wise as part of the issues of this controversy.

15:27.000 --> 15:38.000
And again, I emphasize that the fact that they have been made issues, mixed with my full approval, I've been able to understand this from the Zorro this morning,

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
is that in his opinion that one of the candidates would be one of the Saturdays results of this investigation.

15:45.000 --> 16:01.000
And I highly endorse that statement, Senator, and placing all the specific questions raised by my distinguished friend from Illinois, I think that the question of the two-and-a-fourter page document is not relevant.

16:01.000 --> 16:11.000
I feel that it has been fully and thoroughly exploited if I may be presumptuous enough to do so I should like to suggest that at this point,

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
we pose the door on any further in, very insofar as that non-relevant issue is concerned.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
Well, can I take that as my way?

16:23.000 --> 16:33.000
It comes as an amazing thing to me that we're going to start to enforce the rules of relevancy on the last afternoon of the hearing.

16:34.000 --> 16:46.000
I've been in a lot of styles, but I have never heard of a rule that makes relevancy retroactive over several weeks.

16:46.000 --> 16:59.000
I would say that if we're going to enforce the rules of relevancy, Mr. Chairman, there's been a lot of what the lawyers call Blacksheet, L-A-C-H-E-S.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
And I'm amazed to find that as we pose, as that's what we're going to start enforcing the rules of relevancy.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
I want to say this. Let me just finish.

17:09.000 --> 17:19.000
We will be here for many more weeks, going through the record to take out the irrelevant material in the record.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
I'll just be logical, let's be consistent about it. I mean, if we're going to enforce now, the rules of relevancy will have to go through the leak.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
And it's awful lot of material. I think it's comfortable to visit me on that.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
No, Mr. Chairman.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
No, my friend, the Washington H. H. careful attention to the language. I don't think he would have raised that question for two reasons.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
In a first way, I asked only for a ruling as to whether or not that information was relevant.

17:45.000 --> 17:55.000
It is necessary for this committee to prepare a report, and the question is whether it's going to be considered as a relevant issue having direction from the bearing upon the issues before.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
No, well, let me just say. The second thing is, the council did not suggest the enforcement of the rules with respect to relevant things.

18:02.000 --> 18:12.000
He merely suggested that he hold that perhaps the door would be closed and I would be the last at this stage of the proceeding to ask that the rule on relevance may be enforced.

18:12.000 --> 18:24.000
The door has been opened as wide as a 48-year field, and probably that's probably the issue with whom with somewhat dubious grace at this late hour in the junior college of the middle of the night, would be the last to ask that it be enforced.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
May I just respond by further statement?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
No, no, no.

18:28.000 --> 18:40.000
It was my understanding that the document was introduced by Senator McCarthy to establish the time when the hearings got underway with reference to the Army.

18:40.000 --> 18:57.000
I think it is highly relevant. It goes to one of the key issues in the controversy whether the hearings investigation into the Army started in the spring April 9th, although they started at the end of it, the application held a commission by Mr. Schum.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.000
No, I think that's, I think, to the whole point of its introduction was to establish the fact that the investigation of the Army had been underway for quite some time.

19:06.000 --> 19:25.000
Chair, I'd like to give a little bit of a center here from Washington has taken the words of the chair's ruling differently out of his mouth, because the chair's memory corresponds precisely without a sign of rejection, as to the reason why the Florida Page document was first writing to the committee room by Senator McCarthy.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
I think this introduction certainly was relevant.

19:28.000 --> 19:47.000
Nobody would deny that some of the discussion of scholarly introduction has been irrelevant, but we are all in agreement that there has been much clearer of the discussion during each hearing due to the fact that they have brought them to include a collateral country mercy as to the authority of various branches of the government.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
I agree with our assumption, but I think that discussion has been illuminating.

19:51.000 --> 20:03.000
I think that it has been fruitful and constructive because it points towards the future as to what we're all going to have to wrestle with in the months and the years ahead.

20:03.000 --> 20:20.000
And so the chair will have to respectfully decline the final part of council suggestion, and we're not, I will currently rule out any further discussion which flows along that line because I think by now it has become embedded in the testimony and in the discussion of the country racial points before.

20:20.000 --> 20:31.000
Let me just note an exception for the record tonight. I just note an exception for the record to the chair's ruling and let it stand at that because on confidence we will be discussing it at a later date.

20:31.000 --> 20:41.000
We're quite correct and there are a great many items of testimony, which certainly are going to be irrelevant to the ultimate findings that we should be proud to make in our report.

20:41.000 --> 20:56.000
And I think none of us expect to write in this report whether we have, as the chair has suggested, just perhaps too optimistically at times, a single package report in which we can all agree on whether we have two reports or perhaps even more than two reports.

20:56.000 --> 21:08.000
I think that none of us is going to endeavor individually or collectively to adjudicate the lines of authority which we expect to have followed both by the insurgenties and by investigating committees in the future.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I know that they can just send it out and thank you.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Senator Jackson, can you?

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
Senator McCarthy, I wanted to say that I think the advice of Senator McCullough and Gabe was pretty sound advice.

21:20.000 --> 21:31.000
I have the feeling that it may not always be too wise to exclude a thought of everything.

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
Maybe it was wise for us that we did not get into that chicken lunch.

21:38.000 --> 21:46.000
There are just one or two questions that I want to straighten out. I may have misunderstood your testimony.

21:46.000 --> 21:56.000
I had understood you to say that you felt that all of the staff, that is the investigators and lawyers and so on, I'm not talking about stenographers.

21:57.000 --> 22:06.000
I take care of the moment, that all of the staff did not need clearance because they're not handling secret material or something of that effect.

22:06.000 --> 22:18.000
The first question, Senator Jackson, you've come under on the fact that you thought we should have included you in the meeting that Secretary Stevens last Saturday.

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
I think it is very, very clear now, but I don't want to start a hassle here in this last day of the hearing.

22:24.000 --> 22:33.000
I think it is very, very unfortunate for the country. That's my three Democrat friends who come back on the committee.

22:33.000 --> 22:41.000
If they had not, I think we would be investigating communists today instead of wasting all of our time and money here,

22:41.000 --> 22:51.000
by investigating charges that have improved and completely false. Since my Democrat friends came back, and as you know, I leaned over backwards to give you everything you wanted to introduce you to come back,

22:51.000 --> 23:01.000
culture coming back to help us. I find out that it's not true and I think there's no doubt that anyone's mind about the fact that my three Democrat friends here will have their report.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
I could write that report for them, I believe, right now. I know what they're going to say. I think they decided that before the hearing started.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
Now the second half of your question was one of those. Let me, now wait a minute. Let me just...

23:13.000 --> 23:25.000
Damn it, are you? Isn't it a back senator that the members on the Democratic side left the committee over the right to vote on the assignment of staff members that was July 10th?

23:25.000 --> 23:34.000
And all of the matter of this investigation relates to that period about the day or two after we left the committee up until we returned.

23:34.000 --> 23:44.000
What? Well, since you are not giving the correct picture, let me tell my Democrat friends, we held a vast number of hearings. We get a bit of a big number of comments.

23:44.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm talking about the investigation we're discussing here. All the trouble that we have handled for the incidents all took place while the Democrats were not on the committee. Isn't that correct? Let me finish my question.

23:54.000 --> 24:01.000
I'd like to chart over there. Let me finish my answer.

24:01.000 --> 24:21.000
Mr. Jackson, while my, the Democrats were off the committee, we were less getting comments. We find out that six days or five days before you came back on the committee, some advised Mr. Adams to go and talk to the ranking Democrat members,

24:21.000 --> 24:38.000
we found that he came back on the committee. We find that Mr. McClellan, I'm sorry, Mr. Simon, got the chief political advice to the Democrat parties who succeeded in disrupting things, misadizing Bob Stevens.

24:38.000 --> 24:58.000
The result is that all of the funds that were voted for are committee Mr. Jackson, are being disupplied in this investigation which everyone knows is a complete part. Instead of investigating comments, I am very, very much disappointed.

24:58.000 --> 25:17.000
I am disturbed about the future of the committee. It's my three Democrats' friend who's taking the position of the future. If they take him since they get back on the committee, it means it'll be almost impossible for us to dig out any subversives. Now to answer the second half of your question, let me just finish that part of it.

25:17.000 --> 25:28.000
I think your own countercharges relate to incidents that just place during all this period between July 10th and the latter part of January when we heard something must have been going on while we're off. Isn't that what we're investigating here?

25:28.000 --> 25:41.000
Mr. Dirkton, you listen to the testimony. As I've testified, there was an attempt from the part of Mr. Stevens, the part of Mr. Adams, to try and induce us to call off the hearing.

25:41.000 --> 25:56.000
I have testified, Mr. Kohn has testified, I believe, that there's nothing unusual about that. That's the head of any bureau. Normally, it doesn't want any of the bureau being investigated. However, it was only after the Secretary of the Army.

25:56.000 --> 26:08.000
I got in a tonne hack with the Democrats who then went out on the committee, who came back on the committee. It was only after he did drafts that these fraudulent charges were issued.

26:08.000 --> 26:24.000
I'm not saying the Democrats who were responsible for these fraudulent charges, all I know is that they were issued after the Secretary had voice to the upon him, the chief political adviser of the Democrat Party.

26:24.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm surprised I brought this up because of your comment. I'm surprised that you're not trusting for the subpoenaer Mr. Clifford.

26:33.000 --> 26:41.000
We Democrats try to help you, and I'll get that witness up here for you. The first day you...
