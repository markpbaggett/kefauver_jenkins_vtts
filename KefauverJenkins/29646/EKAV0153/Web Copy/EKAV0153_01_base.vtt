WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I was half the audience's raise many audience will come.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
I don't know whether we have a radio audience or not,

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
but I was disturbed by someone's back of a room.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
And what the hell could do the things people could allow me

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
to talk to them about this?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Right.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Now?

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
But you have a repeat request for that.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Would you, Mr. Welke, have the request go out and record it?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
What does the court and the recorder would you eat at this side, sir?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
I've got it.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Yes, sir.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
And now, if you get it, it's ruined.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
You're unable to tell us all of the information you have been able to make last night.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Whether or not this letter is a carbon copy of any letter actually in existence.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
I am unable to make that statement because my examination last night was directed at one purpose and one purpose only.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
And that was to determine the authenticity of this particular document with documents in the bureau file.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
All right.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Now I want to file some more simple language with on you, sir.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
You know what we have here for parts to be a carbon copy of a real letter, don't you?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
It is a carbon copy of a letter.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Now, if I were to use the simple work which I think you would understand and say to you,

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
is this document the real recording or a pony?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Which of those two words would you use?

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I would put a pick, neither, Mr. Welke, I say to you, then, sir.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
But, suppose I ask you to choose between her two words.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Which would come more nearly to the point?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
What is the definition of this in your chair until it comes?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I need to recognize that.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Mr. Welke, I must say that Mr. Collier has answered that question that you have just asked him.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
And I do not think your last question is a proper question because it has getable benign, sir.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm a scholar.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
I do.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Mr. Brown, I think I can play a way.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yes, Mr. Brown.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
I think the service that is just upon certain rules of honestly on the part of Council for which it is not a problem.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
If you would like Brown to document that you consider yourself occupant of that,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
please, questions of the young man, because he would say it on the second page,

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
it very clearly indicates that there is a limit of security and information.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
You know that I should not, and as I say, there should be certain rules, even on your part of the wealth.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Certain rules of honestly in public knowledge.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Mr. Chairman, I am not sure if you're welcome.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
You're welcome.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm not sure if you're welcome.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
I suppose you may go under some distance.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
We do.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
I have a minor standard to my own conduct in respect to these documents,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
so the cemetery is fat-hav.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
I do not think it is proper for Mr. Collier to read it, and he is declined to read it.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I do not think it would be proper for wealth to read it, and he is declined to read it.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
And I await with much interest the cemetery's explanation of how it would be to stand and when he will.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Mr. Chairman.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Mr. Collier, please welcome Mr. Wells.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I have.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Chairman.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Mr. Chairman, can I have a negative idea?

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
May I make a very clear at the beginning of the first time concerned with a Truman directive.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
No directive will preclude me from examining material bearing among the security of this nation.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
I am very surprised that I'm Mr. Wells here worried about disclosing information on communists.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
Sitting back and slightly approving the violation of the law in so far as easy to drop things as concerned and monitoring.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
So there is no question about Mr. Collier.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Mr. Chairman.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
There will be no personal and confidential material for a show that someone is covering up and hiding coming.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
Mr. Collier, I'm going to ask you, Mr. Wells' buttons, to examine the second page of this letter to top of it.

03:42.000 --> 03:51.000
I'm not going to ask you to read what you find there, but ask you whether that does not indicate that there has been a method of background security information on employee.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
The frowns had a good question.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm only a fan able to say whether anything's been omitted because I have not examined the original document.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I will ask you to examine the copy that you have.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Look at the top of the page and see if you do not find in parentheses.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
The explanation for that security information on a certain employee has been omitted from this letter.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Mr. Chairman, I think the apology of Mr. Wells?

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Yes, Council to rule that whether or not this witness may properly examine this document, it's not in my province to rule.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Mr. Chairman.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Mr. Chairman.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
I may the chair suggest to send him the copy that if we succeed as we hope we will in getting from the Attorney General.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
The material which is very question.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
We will then all have before it the documents and we can make a comparison.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Mr. Chairman.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Mr. Chairman.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Mr. Chair, Mr. Wells, you are very prepared of it.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
I am asking a simple question of whether or not the documents on its page doesn't show that security information was omitted.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
It does not show that this never could deceive anyone to indicate that all the FBI security information was included.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Mr. Chairman, I ask this question of the witness.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
I will insist that Mr. Chairman let the answer, unless the committee votes me down a month.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
There is no reason why anyone should be afraid of the truth insofar as a document of concern.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
Mr. Chairman, I say that I as a system of counsel Mr. Jenkins on here to get the facts.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
I don't think it is our purpose or our right to draw conclusions in any form.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
I have examined this document as I have so testified at the beginning and at the end in order to establish what kind of evidence is that I am committed to.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
What kind of document it is in order to identify.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I have not read the contents.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
The part you speak of is on page two.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
I feel that in view of the security requirements I should not read that second page.

05:40.000 --> 05:49.000
I am asking you to look at the top of page two which contains nothing in regards to security, but shows that the security information was omitted.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
I ask you to look at that parenthesis on a good question.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
It is very important to establish that fact now.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
And to use the repeated statements, Mr. Wells, that this was a phony.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Has anyone had a right to believe that all of the security information was in it?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Mr. Chairman, it is important to get the proofs this right now.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
I am going to come across the I. Feel that I must respectfully decline to read it and determine those facts.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
I am going to ask the Chair to explain the confidential information that is in the present.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I am very happy for the already indicated.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
If you need no divine.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Mr. Chairman, there is nothing for a higher standard.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
You can't get no cover. We might say the point is that the Secretary is not a good one.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Mr. Collier, let me ask you this question.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
Dropping down page two to the end of paragraph two, so you find the statement that the...

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
...in effect that the information concerning the individual's list has been omitted.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
No, sir. I have not made that observation.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
I have looked at page two. I find that on page two there are a list of names.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
If you look at page two before you have something refused, look at it right now.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I only looked at it to determine what it looks like.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I can identify page two by the list of names on it and nothing more.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
And I don't know the names. I merely know that there are a series of names on the page.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Mr. Chairman.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
You were appointed by Mr. Jenkins to find out whether or not.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
This is a duplicate of information, or summary of information.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Your guide to the Communist of Fort Monmouth, and the military.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I now ask you to look at page two. You'll find a list of names.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm not asking you to read those names off.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm asking you to tell our further note. This copy does not show clearly.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
Fairly show that there was a minute from page two.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
All of the FBI reports on these individuals that their names were merely listed.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
And the notation after it as to what was shown.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Drogatory or not the racket.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Senator McCarthy. Or as I'm concerned personally.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Now that goes to the substance of the memorandum itself.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
And without a ruling by the Attorney General,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Mr. Hoover has suggested that the committee secure.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I do not feel entitled to read the document for the purpose of asking the fact you could get.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Mr. Collier, you mean to tell us you did not read the document?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I purposely avoided reading this document and it's in par.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
And I have so much to say.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Mr. Chairman, I wonder how ridiculous we can get here.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
I am trying to have this young man just look at the letter.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
He's trying to know he's caught it all night.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And tell us whether or not on page two.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
It hasn't made very clear that there has been a medicine from this document.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
The FBI Security Information.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
And if there is no security information in this document.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
It's very simple. We're supposed to make Mr. Chairman.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
How's the government quite able to get around?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
What is that stated?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And the timing has been quite a while.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I bow to Chair.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
The witness has stated that he's defined it to read the letter

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
and that he has been accepted by the...

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
Hoover's has contained information, which is identical to the information which he felt the Attorney General should rule upon.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
And the Chair is not going to order the witness to do something that he thinks he did not do.

08:59.000 --> 09:10.000
Mr. Collier, you say that the director told you that the language was identical in some respects.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
That's right. That is correct.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
In some respects.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Did he tell you that the language was identical in practically all other respects.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
All respects.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
They all accept the commit.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Except that the three-page document on the metastas.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
The Security Report, fronted by the FBI.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
The other than that, the document is complete.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
No, sir. He did not... he did not say the math way.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Well, what did he tell you?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
He told me that the language is identical in some respects.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And that it relates to the same subject matter.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Both documents relate to the same subject matter.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
And that is as far as he felt, and he would have been vital to go.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Did he tell you that there any...

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
There's any twisting, any distorting, any violation of the language used in the report he sent over except to...

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
The elimination of the security regulations?

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Absolutely. No comment concerning this language. He did not characterize it at any matter.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Mr. Collier, weren't you interested with you when you went over there and planning out,

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
whether or not this did in any way twist or distort or violate any of the original language?

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
Yes, I was originally, but when I determined that the director felt that the documents was of a security classification,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
and if he deferred the judgment of the Attorney General as to whether or not that should be read by anyone including myself,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I did not pursue that line of inquiry.

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
May I ask counsel for the Army that the Attorney General will know the attitude of the parties that it's a few,

10:32.000 --> 10:42.000
but the counsel for the Army will consent to having the 15-page documents with the security information related,

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
and this document made public so that the press on the public can compare the two documents.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Thank you, Senator, for finally referring to me as counsel for the Army.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I don't know if that was the mistake.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I think he'll live in a family.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
Mr. Wilkins, before it is not in my jurisdiction, sir, to pass on the security matter.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I know that our general will have to do that.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
I don't think it's further not. We can transmit to the Attorney General the information.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
That both counsels Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams, as well as Senator McCarthy, request.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Lastly, make the 15-page documents public actually have deleted any security information,

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
and that we also make public the documents which I have submitted after deleting the name on page two.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
I have not read the documents that is referred to. It has been possible for me to form any judgment of that sort.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
If it's a matter of life, we have to be left to the Attorney General.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I think I get your answers very clearly.

11:35.000 --> 11:47.000
Mr. Caliore, I assume that you are unable to contact General Bowling to see whether or not someone in his office had ever made a summary of the 15-page report.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
That is correct. I did not make that plan very easy.

11:52.000 --> 12:02.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask Mr. Caliore to be designated to contact General Bowling's office to find out whether or not they made a summary.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
It's the distribution of that summary.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Another and this is an accurate summary made by Bowling's office.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
The chair will take that suggestion along with the one earlier made by 100 Jackson and bring them before the security meeting,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
and I will take that suggestion along with the one earlier made by 100 Jackson and bring them before the security meeting.

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
In any event, Mr. Caliore, is it your testimony that you are the impression and you are not accompanying Mr. Groover but your own personal impression?

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
After talking to Mr. Groover, this is a summary of the 15-page document.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Again, may I say that Mr. Groover did not go characterized if he did not make any comment upon it?

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I was asked for my personal opinion and I give a hand.

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
And my personal opinion is that this document is probably copied in the nature of a summary of the 15-page document.

12:49.000 --> 12:58.000
Mr. Caliore, may I make it very clear that in my bigger explanation of you, I do not want that to be considered by anyone who,

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
I mean, they do not have confidence in your ability. I am fully aware of your background.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I think that you would make an excellent addition to any fan.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Thank you.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Mr. Colin, I'm from France.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I use any of these things. I have two questions.

13:12.000 --> 13:21.500
Mr. Caliore, is this much very clear from what you are able to tell us at this time that on the day Senate and Macaw

13:21.500 --> 13:28.500
he mentioned yesterday, January 26, 1951, there was transmitted under the name of John Edgar Hoover,

13:28.500 --> 13:32.500
so Army Intelligence, a document.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.500
I will repeat it as shown.

13:34.500 --> 13:42.500
On January, under date of January 26, 1951, a 15-page FBI memorandum was prepared.

13:42.500 --> 13:50.500
The original of that memorandum was transmitted in general bowling office, the Eiffelayson, on January 27th,

13:50.500 --> 13:55.500
and the Carbentopy to General Caliore's office, the Eiffelayson, on the 29th.

13:55.500 --> 14:01.500
Sir, did this memorandum go to the Army under the name of John Edgar Hoover?

14:01.500 --> 14:08.500
Yes, sir. Only memorandum form there are the printed words to date two from in subtle.

14:08.500 --> 14:15.500
And if I had the word two, was the identification major general, A.R. bowling assistant chief of staff,

14:15.500 --> 14:19.500
he had to do the part of the Army, the Pentagon, walking in the easy, and beside the word from,

14:19.500 --> 14:22.500
John Edgar Hoover director, Federal Bureau of Investigation.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.500
You say, sir, is what they not type written?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.500
They were type, type written words.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.500
John Edgar Hoover director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, that is correct.

14:30.500 --> 14:40.500
And sir, is it a fact on the basis of what you can tell us now, the subject matter of the 15-page memorandum from Mr. Hoover to the Army on that day,

14:40.500 --> 14:45.500
was Aaron Coleman, then at 400, that S.B. and I.

14:45.500 --> 14:52.500
I'll say this, that after the word from, and the designation, John Edgar Hoover director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,

14:52.500 --> 14:55.500
there follows the word subject.

14:55.500 --> 15:00.500
And pipe there on, was Aaron, Simon Coleman, S.B. and I.R.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.500
And for your information, they are for us.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.500
They are for us.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.500
They're going to the time, as it's fire.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.500
Is the council any further questions?

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
No further questions.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
Chair, I am Senator McClellan.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.500
No questions.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.500
Any questions?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
No.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.500
Any questions?

15:21.500 --> 15:23.500
Yes, just one question.

15:23.500 --> 15:30.500
The type written document that we have had in the courtroom this morning does not purport to be a summary of anything, does it?

15:30.500 --> 15:33.500
Well, I think the document speaks for itself.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.500
I heard it.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.500
It doesn't purport.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.500
It doesn't say at the top of it.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
It doesn't.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.500
No, sorry, does not.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.500
It just looks like a letter beginning with a salutation, is that right?

15:41.500 --> 15:42.500
A salutation, sir.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.500
And ending with the one clearly yours.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.500
Is there a letter?

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
Right.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
Mr. Cohn, or it doesn't look right.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.500
Mr. McClellan, the council member of the council member of the council, is very excited to help.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
We continue to discuss this before the lunch hour.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.500
Mr. McClellan, this is not a pair to be a summary.

15:57.500 --> 16:01.500
Again, I ask and I assume that Mr. Cahair would receive.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.500
The view of Mr. McClellan's question is whether this is not a pair to be a summary.

16:05.500 --> 16:14.500
I ask you to look on page two and tell us whether or not it does not clearly appear to be a summary that you have in front of these, the definite information,

16:14.500 --> 16:19.500
that there have been relations with some of this document of security information.

16:19.500 --> 16:26.500
And view of the fact, you, as soon as you can answer that, Mr. Cahair, I will say to the record that that is the case.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.500
And I hope all the centers are like that.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.500
Just one other question. I ask you the chair.

16:32.500 --> 16:37.500
And it's the chairman of your, Mr. Welch's statement that this was a pony.

16:37.500 --> 16:48.500
I ask that the chair write a letter to the director of the FBI, Judge Hoover, and ask him whether or not this is not an accurate summary, really having deleted the security information.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.500
Chair, I thought you paid it that he would take up.

16:51.500 --> 16:57.500
Your earlier suggestion, the suggestion of vendor Jackson, and now your presence of the defendant, that the executive meeting we have called for to look on.

16:57.500 --> 17:10.500
I think we left at this point, Mr. Cahair. This memorandum sent under the name of John Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, to the Army on January, dated January 26th.

17:10.500 --> 17:17.500
I believe you say, delivered on January 27th, that's correct. There's the head of Aaron Coleman, SB and I are.

17:17.500 --> 17:23.500
And you're an Aiman, Aaron Hymans, Coleman, SB and I are. And you now tell us the word are same for a Russian.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.500
Mr. Hoover told me that I could say that the R stands for Russian.

17:27.500 --> 17:38.500
So you can tell us this morning that the 15 page memorandum was a communication from Mr. Hoover through the Army concerning Aaron Coleman and Russians at the United States.

17:38.500 --> 17:44.500
That's a fair statement. That is what the two on the firm read and the subject is Aaron Hymans, Coleman, SB and I take off.

17:44.500 --> 18:02.500
And can you, Mr. Cahair, as having been present in the room and a member of Mr. Jenkins, tell us yesterday, tell us on the testimony yesterday and the public records that on the day this memorandum was sent over by Mr. Hoover, Aaron Hymans, Coleman, while the section had in the secret radar laboratory at Fourth Amendment.

18:02.500 --> 18:21.500
Mr. Cahair, I cannot tell you that of my own personal. I would ask the Senate to take judicial or chairman wise notice of the public records of the hearings of this committee of the Public hearings of this committee of December 8th, 1953, which indicates that I believe I read the job that Mr. Coleman into the records yesterday.

18:21.500 --> 18:50.500
Now, sir, can you tell us whether the number of the stated was complete accuracy yesterday that this 15 page memorandum, that this memorandum by Mr. Hoover was a warning to the Army that at the secret radar laboratory that brought one of the group of the associates of Julius Rosenberg and people with communist records were operating on a secret link and change radar project at that time.

18:51.500 --> 18:58.500
I cannot tell you of my own personal knowledge. I was busy on the mother matter that was in the matter of the room.

18:58.500 --> 19:18.500
Now, Mr. Cahair, I think the record was secret. I think a key question at this point is this. Have you also, as a saying, whether or not the Army has in its file at this time, the originals of this memorandum from Jay Edgar Hoover concerning Russian, S.C. and I and Aaron Coleman of the radar laboratory at Fourth Amendment.

19:18.500 --> 19:28.500
I did not ascertain that Mr. Ceeblings was asked to print that information this morning if I recall his testimony, whether he had not found this document, but he did not say whether it was not his document.

19:28.500 --> 19:35.500
I only know what the record of the FBI revealed. That is the document was delivered on January 27th.

19:36.500 --> 19:59.500
Mr. Cahair, at this time, might we request that an additional theory of documents which we have reasons to believe, with transmittance to the Department of the Army over a period of time from January 3, 1951 up to the present date concerning communist activity of people employed at Fourth Amendment.

20:00.500 --> 20:11.500
The memorandum, such as this, from John Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI to the Army, may we answer those likewise, be produced by Mr. Ceeblings, here that's one of all that's afternoon.

20:11.500 --> 20:26.500
That's there being made upon a record be with health until, thus, time has a request was made of the Attorney General, but that the documents be made available and held in rage so that the public may have the story of the FBI warning to the Army on its side.

20:27.500 --> 20:39.500
Mr. Cahair, if you have a sign of McCarthy, make that request of necessarily a security session. We have already announced that we will subpoena all records, all documents, all individuals connected with this case, provided with questions, no security, regulations of violence.

20:41.500 --> 20:55.500
Mr. Cahair, in the film question, in the film thing is matter with Mr. Hoover, did you get the impression that time they say I have gotten, that the FBI transmitted all of the information which they had in regard to Russian or communist espionage.

20:56.500 --> 21:17.500
To the property park, and any failure to act, any failure to remove, people like Aaron, former, or anyone else, was not the fault of the FBI because they gave all the information to my hand, which did not consider our investigation, but was the fault of the people involved as a superior to the suspected espionage.

21:17.500 --> 21:34.500
Mr. Hoover did not make any such statements to me and did not talk about that to me. I will tell you from my personal experience in the FBI that all information of security nature is promptly forwarded to all interested government agencies, and that it is not evaluated as merely furnished as facts gathered.

21:35.500 --> 21:39.500
The FBI does not make any evaluations if merely furnished is the information as it is contained.

21:39.500 --> 21:59.500
Just to one further question, I ask this because so many people try to blame the FBI when we find communist and various departments. It's true that if not that the FBI has no power to fire a fire anyone, they are only power to send down the report, conduct the investigation, and hope that the security agencies involve the life.

21:59.500 --> 22:27.500
The FBI does not have any power to fire or fire anyone other than its own personnel. If any of this is gathered information, factual form, is forwarded as that information either in reports or memorandum to the interest of government officials and the clerics, is incumbent upon the government to properly evaluate it in line with the desires they have to use in the information.

22:27.500 --> 22:39.500
One other question is, they think that the memorandum had the notation, FBNR Russian, would indicate that it is a report upon Russian FBNR.

22:40.500 --> 22:46.500
Again, may I speak from my personal experience, I am not attributing this in any way in the situation.

22:46.500 --> 22:56.500
I am not attributing this in any way in the situation. On my personal experience in the FBI, since preparing a report and gathering information is not necessary to specify it.

22:57.500 --> 23:11.500
I say we, the girl, arbitrarily, has put up certain classification in terms of security, and then the R, which is a misdemeanor for Russian, identifies the immaculability group.

23:11.500 --> 23:24.500
So, that there to be no doubt any was mine, that this report, from a man who is head of the important section in a way from the secret radar laboratory, was being reported on a 15 page report, and that had to do with Russian FBNR.

23:25.500 --> 23:39.500
Well, I don't want to leave any false information. The FBNR is routine. It is not abnormal in any way to be on a document. That is used under the proper designation and is a routine classification place thereof.

23:39.500 --> 23:51.500
The routine by routine you mean if it deals with Russian FBNR, it would be routine but the R, that's right. If adults with any other types of FBNR, it would not be routine but the R, so all these proper designation would be put up.

23:52.500 --> 24:00.500
So, the new set of the routine when we get this right. We are dealing here now with the secret radar laboratory, dealing with a report on a man who is head of one of the important sections.

24:00.500 --> 24:12.500
Like we know that many of them, they are indicated that the information in the 15 page report, dealt with Russian FBNR and also dealt with their informants.

24:13.500 --> 24:24.500
Well, that's hard to answer because you say a dealt with Russian FBNR, the FBNR is an arbitrary designation that is given to the type of investigation.

24:24.500 --> 24:33.500
Now, it might well be that investigation starts out with the allegations that there was espionage and would turn into some other types.

24:34.500 --> 24:43.500
The espionage R is merely for filing purposes and for the use of the Bureau in determining how to remove the FBNR.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.500
This is not an unusual option. It has been an espionage R.

24:47.500 --> 24:59.500
Mr. Chairman, I know the chair has ruled on this by some extent before. I think this testimony makes a doubly important that we strongly urge the Attorney General to make available for the public.

25:00.500 --> 25:06.500
Those parts of the document would show that this did deal strongly with the communists espionage of the secret radar plan.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.500
No further questions, Mr. Chairman.

25:10.500 --> 25:14.500
No further questions, Mr. Crosby?

25:15.500 --> 25:20.500
Mr. Crosby, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chair, you have an excellent witness. We appreciate you, Mr. Crosby.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.500
Decide to answer as you have made. Thank you, sir.

25:24.500 --> 25:31.500
Mr. Council Member of the Committee, I believe we have a 12-10. We have an executive meeting at 2 o'clock, but we're in place.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.500
Two times this afternoon, the executive meeting may all be to 2.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.500
Thank you.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.500
And so this is the 10th day of the hearings of the Army McCrantees' dispute.

25:44.500 --> 25:48.500
Recess, following an explosive session this morning from 10 years ago.

25:49.500 --> 25:55.500
At 2.30 this afternoon, Eastern daylight time, the FU Montelevision Network resumed the hearings over most of the same stations.
