WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Many will come to order.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
The chair was detained by Carl from the Senate's floor, stating that the sergeant of arms

00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
are looking for senators that they need to smear for a live forum and I relayed the message on behalf of the committee that was very much like to get out of the hearings.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
You were all trying to expedite the hearings and be wondered if it would be possible to do so.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
The position goes, right?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Don't know.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
So I would suggest that Mrs. Lock that we start.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Call the Senate and find out because it's possible we'll have to go but enter for a forum call.

00:42.000 --> 00:55.000
Otherwise the committee will come to order the chair would again like to remind the audience to comply, but the committee will move to be paying them all manifestations of approval or disapproval during the crisis of the hearings.

00:55.000 --> 01:12.000
As a group, you have been magnificent throughout the week and I trust that nobody will soak and dump himself or hurt himself today that the officers have to carry out the standing rule of the committee to invite you to leave the room because you have violated the conditions under which you entered.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Namely to refrain from all manifestations of approval or disapproval.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Can anyone come to order?

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Yes, Mr. Caliabend, we call the committee as a presentation.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
It's becoming before you resume.

01:26.000 --> 01:38.000
And I just like to be persistent about the matter, but I have made several cute little attempts to get Mr. Hensel relief from attendance here.

01:38.000 --> 01:54.000
Obviously he has a principle in this controversy cannot ask to be relieved. He's not under subpoena here of course, but in view of the mounting workload at a time like this, it seems to me the committee should take cognizance of that.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
And he should be relieved of attendance here, but certainly he could be represented by council.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
And that ought to be sufficient until such time as Mr. Hensel might be called.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm going to take a reminder of that.

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
Now, will the extended margin of the chair for a moment he has been advised by Mr. Lott that the size of the bottom of his forehead can get too thin.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
So, my group can come over, they can make it quorum, until they have his bottom check.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Mr. Caliabend, Mr. Caliabend, I have already had one big letter from my time.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
You have a reach date, he has requested.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I was then with Mr. Hensel, with the deck and the guitar.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I think my credit card is from the owner.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I don't know what he is.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
At the time, we can head back to the bar.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
We think we could reach that today and also, if we have a run.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
You have the request from my colleague who will not probably be alive at all for long.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Thank you.

02:55.000 --> 03:23.000
Mr. Hensel, I have this morning I suggested that perhaps Mr. Hensel ought to be relieved of the tenement here, without any prejudice, west of ever the jammer to the hearing, because of the mounting workload and the face of certain international tensions.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
And I don't believe that the committee ought to have him to make a request to the committee to be relieved.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
I think it's the committee's duty as he can be spared to let him resume his legacy.

03:38.000 --> 03:49.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Caliabend, supplementing what Senator Daxon has said, I wish to express my ideas with respect to that subject.

03:49.000 --> 03:58.000
First of all, none of us is unmindful of the importance of the work that should be transacted by Mr. Hensel at this time.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Number one, Mr. Hensel is represented by Able Counsel.

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
Number two, at the end of each session, his counsel is first with a transcription of the entire proceedings.

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
Number three, no evidence can be introduced here, touching Mr. Hensel, save all two points.

04:21.000 --> 04:33.000
One day, he and sight, procure, are instigated the bringing of these charges by Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams against the MacArthur Committee.

04:33.000 --> 04:50.000
Number two, while Senator MacArthur's committee investigating Mr. Hensel, and his place activities to the knowledge of Mr. Hensel, those matters are more or less collateral to the main issues involved.

04:50.000 --> 05:03.000
And I see no earthly reason why Mr. Hensel should not leave if he so desires, leaving his Able Counsel here to look after his members and attend to the matters to which Senator Daxon referred.

05:05.000 --> 05:14.000
Mr. Hensel, I think I also have a hot tip of mind in the position Mr. Hensel does, but he's got much more important work to do with him to sit here listening to his testimony.

05:14.000 --> 05:30.000
However, I think it will be a mistake for us to, in any way, pressure Mr. Hensel to leave because the involvement of Mr. Hensel in this, I think, is greater than Mr. Stevens gave him.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
I do think that Mr. Hensel could be back to his work, but his counsel representing the counsel seems to be extremely confident I know nothing but his back-end.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Thank you, Senator. I'm having a judge for a long time, and I get the impression that you're very confident, Mr. Hensel here.

05:42.000 --> 06:00.000
On the same line, Mr. Chairman, if we could possibly cut down the number of fine, military personnel sitting back here doing nothing except warming their heels, not for their own size, but because of orders from the civilians of Pentagon.

06:00.000 --> 06:16.000
I think we should release them. Take for example, General Reaver, who apparently has a pretty good record over in Europe, is in command over their nouns, that of being over there, they should be quoting Senator Potter with a world about to go up and play him.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
I'd like to see General Reaver back in his command.

06:22.000 --> 06:45.000
General Young is here, General Young is charged with tremendous responsibilities, and not suggesting we deprive Secretary Stevens of any assistance which he needs that I do think we are wasting just too much confident men power in this committee, and I may be getting off your press and some redirection, but number one, I've got no objection at all.

06:45.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm not going to cancel anything, and I think it should be made clear that he is not leading because he feels that in any way agrees with the specifications we set forth, but he's leading because he's the competent counsel representative.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Right, Mr. Hensel? Yes, yes.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Yes, my right, Mr. Ryan?

07:02.000 --> 07:12.000
Yes, in response to the Chairman's question and Senator Dirkson's suggestion, which he's most gratefully received.

07:12.000 --> 07:27.000
I would like to say that Mr. Hensel would like to attend to his duties, and would be leaving if he did for the reason that he has important matters that require immediate attention.

07:27.000 --> 07:41.000
I'd like to make only this one statement, but if, while I am here representing, and any issue comes up, which relates to him, on which I require consultation with him.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
I'd be given an opportunity to do so before that issue is pursued.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Very reasonable.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Any other question, Mr. McIntyre?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I think that's a very reasonable question.

07:52.000 --> 08:06.000
Very reasonable, if I have any questions, I think Mr. Hensel would be very careful, and maybe share with me again, because we want to be thinking of the stuff that is trying to be our concern.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
The only people who attend this is required in the room, as long as you appear on the witness desk.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
They are entitled to have with them what's comfortable and advisers they deserve ahead.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
But the committee does not want to assume the responsibility of retaining in the room.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Anybody else except those under subpoenae, and those on the witness desk.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Everybody else is here, according to the distance, and we don't touch them.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
But the conscience of all of the associates with them.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Mr. Chair, could I say a word on behalf of the Army?

08:36.000 --> 08:44.000
General Reaper is not many around my orders or anyone's down to orders, and it's continually spread to the West.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
You go back to the European command.

08:46.000 --> 08:57.000
In the strength of what has been said here, I am going to object General Reaper, and now understand he made me even that nobody has any notion of calling his stand again.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
I have settled out issue right now, and I will find out whether anybody else has any committees.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
A council for any side desires to again call Mr. Reaper if not we will dismiss him, permanently as the witness.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Is there any objection to the permanent dismissal of General Reaper as the witness?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Chair here is none, he's dismissed, he can go back to your room.

09:15.000 --> 09:26.000
The other Army officer is here, and this goes for Secretary of the Army as well.

09:26.000 --> 09:43.000
My observation of him is the Army's work is being done, we work nights and weekends, and I on the whole, while it's very, it's double up there work, I think I can assure the country that the Army is being run by what you might call overtime.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
And another River before the leave, I think that you can carry with you the well wishes of the end-half minute.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Sure, that's the right thing to have me say.

09:53.000 --> 10:03.000
All right, find the next room, or you accompany something, and basically, this is the nature of exposition, and I don't know, but I hope it is.

10:03.000 --> 10:10.000
I think we left off having dismissed Mr. Collier, he's been called back to the chair and defend, he continues to be sworn, or do we have to swear him against him?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
He continues to be sworn, he still sworn.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
You are not sworn, you continue to be sworn in council for the ultimate position to be pressing the detector.

10:17.000 --> 10:29.000
Collier since the members have or not you further conferred with the office of Mr. Hoover, I, during the new recess, talk to Mr. Hoover on the telephone.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
You know that it was Mr. Hoover in person with whom you talked.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
I do, sir, I have other conversations with him on the telephone or at the office.

10:37.000 --> 10:54.000
During the new recess were you specifically requested by Senator McCarthy and his staff through me to obtain certain additional information from Mr. Hoover with respect to the two-and-a-half-page document and the 15-page document.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Yes sir.

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
Are you now prepared to answer the questions asked of me by Senator McCarthy and Mr. Collier in the new hour?

11:04.000 --> 11:14.000
Yes sir. I believe though that I should recount to the committee the conversations that I had with Mr. Hoover at the conclusion of that, of course, any questions.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
You're talking about the conversation between Mr. Hoover and the new hour?

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
Yes. We now relate in detail that conversation, which I think will answer Senator McCarthy's question.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
On your instructions I communicated with the FBI and expressed my desire to talk to Mr. Hoover.

11:30.000 --> 11:43.000
Within a few minutes there, after Mr. Hoover called me on the telephone, he stated that the letter to the General Bowling of January 26, 1951 was classified by the word confidentions.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
And he does not feel that he has any right to declassify it or to discuss its conduct.

11:50.000 --> 12:04.000
May I point out at this time that the FBI in 1951 did not use the classifications normally attributed to the military, that is, restricted confidential secret and top secret.

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
They use either the characterization confidential or personal confidential.

12:11.000 --> 12:20.000
Therefore that confidential in Mr. Hoover's opinion and his statement to me is the highest classification that can be put on a document by the FBI.

12:20.000 --> 12:33.000
He said further that the contents of the two and one-quarter page documents as compared to the 15 page documents are alike for different in the following respects.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
They are different in classification.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
That is, the two and one-quarter page document has a classification personal confidential.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
The 15 page document has a classification confidential.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
They are different in salutation.

12:51.000 --> 13:02.000
The 15 page document carried no salutation, was merely an interdepartmental number and the two and one-quarter page document carried a classification served.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
They are different in conclusion.

13:06.000 --> 13:20.000
In that the two and one-quarter page document concluded with the statements from Silly-Urge, J.H. Hoover, director, whereas the 15 page document had no statement on it.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
They are different in that the 15 page document reflected a carbon copy to the United States Air Force.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
The two and one-quarter page document did not.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Now they are alike or different as to substance.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
That was informed as to substance in the following respects.

13:42.000 --> 13:56.000
The two and one-quarter page documents and the 15 page documents are alike in that paragraph one, two, three, and four are the same.

13:57.000 --> 14:10.000
The paragraph one, two, three, and four are alike in both documents.

14:10.000 --> 14:19.000
The paragraph five, carrying on page one, could it be at this point, Mr. Chairman, for the record of view that I can no longer read this?

14:19.000 --> 14:30.000
In this paragraph one, two, three, and four, means all of page one, so they picture the names, please.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Can you please all of page two down to the...

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
No, Senate, the paragraph one, two, three, and four are on page one.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
You were calling the quotation of the paragraph.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Yes, the paragraph, four to the quotation of the paragraph.

14:45.000 --> 14:56.000
So on page one, you have one, two, three, and four paragraphs, each of which are identical in both documents.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
On page one, there is a paragraph five.

15:01.000 --> 15:08.000
That is different from paragraph five in the 15 page documents.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Page one.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
The last paragraph on page one is a parenthetical statement.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
It's a paragraph on page one.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Well, on the time the eye have it, so well.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Your page must be different.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Your page one is part of my page two, I'm sorry.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm referring to the document I have in my design.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Have you had the paragraph five, please?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
The paragraph five is a term-setic person.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
A very theoretical statement, and it appears as a fifth paragraph on page one.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It's a very well-configured statement.

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
And that paragraph is different in its entirety from paragraph five in the 15 page documents.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Right.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Now on page two, paragraph six.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
You were going to find a paragraph on page two.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
You're going to find a paragraph on page two.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
No, I think we're going to have to have this as well.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
It's just a minute quick.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
You'll have to get this.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Well, I'll definitely get this.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
That's a little clearer.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
The parenthetical question I have assumed, didn't appear in the document at all.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
The paragraph is entirely different.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I think that's all I can say.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Oh, there's no clear answer to that.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Of course, no.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I know the chair is playing the second-hand, I send him a card, he has all committee members.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Mr. Kyle, he's tested by anybody with a soul by Mr. Hoover.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
And has no independent knowledge of resume of where these paragraphs are.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I would like to make that clear.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Very good.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
On page two, paragraph six is the first paragraph.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
That paragraph is identical in both documents.

16:39.000 --> 16:51.000
Following paragraph six on page two is a list of, in the 2-in-1-4 page documents, is a list of 34 names.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Followed by an evaluation.

16:55.000 --> 17:03.000
In the FCI document, 15 page documents, paragraph six was followed by a list of three documents.

17:03.000 --> 17:14.000
By a series of names, following each name, there being a factual statement of security information.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
There was no evaluation placed on that information by the FDI.

17:19.000 --> 17:30.000
And I want to make it very clear to the committee, Mr. Hoover stressed to me, and as well know, that the FDI does not evaluate information merely presented.

17:34.000 --> 17:42.000
On page two, following the list of names is paragraph seven.

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
Which paragraph extends over from the page three and is identical in both documents.

17:50.000 --> 17:59.000
On page three, the last paragraph, number eight, is identical in both documents.

17:59.000 --> 18:16.000
Mr. Hoover advised that he could not make any further comments along the substance of this of either the documents that it is still classified and that he still respectfully refers the committee to the Attorney General.

18:16.000 --> 18:26.000
He further advised that the original 15 page documents was pennies,

18:26.000 --> 18:46.000
to General Bowling's office, by liaison representative on January 27th, and that the original and one copy went to General Bowling's office, and the FDI this morning determined from that office that the original and one copy are in their file.

18:46.000 --> 18:58.000
A carbon copy was delivered by a liaison representative on January 29th, 1951, to the office of Major General Joseph F. Carroll, United States Air Force.

18:58.000 --> 19:06.000
The FDI this morning ascertains that that copy is presently in the files of the Air Force.

19:06.000 --> 19:24.000
There were in addition to those three copies, a yellow pick wear copy, white copy and the file copy, a yellow copy, and both of those are presently in the files of the FDI.

19:24.000 --> 19:33.000
All copies that were prepared by the FDI are present and accounted for.

19:33.000 --> 19:43.000
In connection with the matter of the use of the classification SBNI call, I tried to make that as clear as I could this morning.

19:43.000 --> 20:01.000
Mr. Hoover commented that that is a routine general classification used for investigation, that it does not mean that any of the individuals mentioned in the document

20:01.000 --> 20:07.000
are being investigated for SBNI HR or are guilty of it or anything else.

20:07.000 --> 20:15.000
It merely is a routine arbitrary classification that is placed upon investigation when it is initiated.

20:15.000 --> 20:26.000
And because of this layer does not mean that the names of the individuals or the individuals mentioned in any document are in any way involved in that matter.

20:26.000 --> 20:44.000
It is an out that the Bureau conducts investigations into kidnapping, extortion, and other types cases that when the initial complaint comes in, the cases open, and investigation is initiated, they under the word kidnapped.

20:44.000 --> 20:52.000
But it does not mean that everybody whose name is mentioned in the document is guilty of kidnapped.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Is there any questions in this document?

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
I have no further questions.

20:59.000 --> 21:08.000
Mr. Chairman, I have no one question.

21:08.000 --> 21:18.000
With reference to the number of pages in the document, is this one complete memorandum or some of the pages accounted for as fortifying a record as our other memorandum?

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
Or is it a continuous running document? Are you speaking for 15 pages of documents?

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
It is a complete running document.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
It is all.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
The extent of action and the time is one of the recordings that was assaulting.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
The alarm, if we are at census.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
No, I am very sorry.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
If you take your violin hearing time, the left.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
No questions.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
No questions, the right.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Mr. Welp, any further questions?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
No questions.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Any further questions?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
I have.

21:43.000 --> 21:53.000
The view of the fact that the press sitting here on the television audience cannot follow what paragraph 12345678 is.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
The view of the ruling of Chidnafi Red, and I will certainly respect that ruling.

21:59.000 --> 22:09.000
I would like to, this plan make it clear that Mr. Chali referred to paragraph 1 being identical to the FBI report from J.R. Hoover.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Cargot, 2. Cargot, 3. Cargot, 4. Cargot, 4. And paragraph 5 is different.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I will take it right now.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
The paragraph

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
is the entire letter with the exception of paragraph 5, which I will discuss.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
And with the exception of the list of menus.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I can't turn these up.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Please.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
I'm going to do this, but you're probably going to get the paragraph.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
The paragraph is reading out,

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
constitutes the entire document with the exception of the names, which I listed on this document.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
And the factual security information contained therein, regarding the end of the document.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
As far as the last part of the document was I introduced to concern.

23:02.000 --> 23:09.000
This differs from the original FBI report I understand in that this merely contained the names

23:09.000 --> 23:20.000
with an evaluation after the drugitory or not drugitory, but the FBI report contained the pages of security information about these individuals.

23:20.000 --> 23:30.000
That is true. After each name and the 15-page document there was a factual statement of information of the security nature concerning each one.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
Whereas in this document the name is given and the evaluation of that information is made.

23:37.000 --> 23:46.000
I think I can re-cargrap the file of the violating the chair's destruction.

23:46.000 --> 23:56.000
Well, Senator Carvick, may I interrupt with you, sir, that the chair has ruled that he was in request related by J. H. H.O.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
I have to move the Mr. Carvick, and there's not believe that we should commit any reading of it.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
There's none of the committee members have seen any of it.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Until we hear from Mr. Jenny-Jent.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
That's a lot of point to me, very well today.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm going to be glad to go on with that.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
The transfer of advice is that Mr. Jenny-Jent is in contact with today.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
paragraph 5 is the paragraph that I asked you to read this morning,

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
and with you thought you could not under the instruction from Mrs. Wilburn, I certainly don't.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm looking forward to the other with you on the left.

24:22.000 --> 24:30.000
But I would like to make it clear that paragraph 5 is a perin-fedical explanation.

24:30.000 --> 24:38.000
Employ certain information has been deleted from this letter, and obviously paragraph 5 would not...

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Let me finish Mr. Chairman.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
Chair believes that no reply may be made to the ten of Mr. Letter.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Mr. Chairman, I'll give you the answer.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
All right, but can that suppose and disclose the contents of the letter?

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
Yes, Mr. Chairman, the president referred to as a pony by Mr. Welch.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
That's one of the most serious reflections upon the integrity of the chairman

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
that we've had so far and I have many reflections upon my integrity.

25:03.000 --> 25:14.000
And I think I'm entitled, Mr. Chairman, to point out that paragraph 5 is a perin-fedical paragraph explaining...

25:15.000 --> 25:26.000
I don't even know if one of these public claims, the perin-fedical paragraph 5 explains why certain materials from the FBI report is not contained in this report.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
And obviously, therefore, it should not have been in the original FBI report.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
I don't know, Mr. Collier, can answer this or not. Let me answer this, Mr. Collier.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
You have not read the perin-fed paragraph 5.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
I have not.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
So you don't know that that's an explanation in front of these.

25:44.000 --> 25:57.000
I only know that Mr. Hoover says that the paragraph was different from the 15-page documents and the two-in-one-quarter-page document had a perin-fedical statement in place of paragraph.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
With which the Bureau of Report did not hand.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
In other words, that's correct.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
And so, again, the security information within the explanation in front of this is a parenthesis of what kind of a user.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
I think you've answered this, and I don't want to keep you on the stand-in document like this.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
So when we take paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8,

26:18.000 --> 26:31.000
if you say that's identical to the report of the Edgar Hoover, that is the entire letter with the exception of the list of names.

26:31.000 --> 26:39.000
And in the documents which I supplied, I did not supply the information about each name, which would be security information.

26:40.000 --> 26:56.000
So if we took the FDR report and a fit of the listing names, if we listed the names and the information about each one, then we would have the identical report.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Is that right?

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
The summary of you, aren't the... I'm afraid that's a conclusion, you ask. So I don't feel that I should.

27:02.000 --> 27:10.000
I will say that in substance, the paragraphs are as I stated, the difference in form, I will always say.

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
Well, now, you'll have to pardon me if Mr. Chairman for being repetitious from this, but, indeed, the serious charge has made this morning.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
I think we could have this clear that. And quick, there's once more to be...

27:22.000 --> 27:32.000
If we take out the parenthetic-lect question with paragraph 5,

27:32.000 --> 27:43.000
if we delete from this document, and we listen to this whole questionnaire, if we take out the parenthetic-lect question in paragraph 5,

27:43.000 --> 27:53.000
if we delete from this document, the name... which I'll listen, then if we were to delete from the FBI report,

27:53.000 --> 28:01.000
the name with the latest, plus the information about each one of those names.

28:01.000 --> 28:08.000
The document would be identical, but then I say, give your note that you may not.

28:09.000 --> 28:17.000
From the information in my possession, I will say that paragraph 1, 2, 3, and 4 are the same.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
5 is different, containing a paracetical statement in place of a paragraph.

28:22.000 --> 28:34.000
6 is the same, and following 6 in this document, before me, the 2-in-1-4 page is a list of names,

28:35.000 --> 28:44.000
taking up about a half of the page, whereas in the 15 page document, there would have been the names and factual information taking up many pages.

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
That's there after following that paragraph 7 and 8 are the same.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Just so we'll have this one final question.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
8 is the last paragraph in the...

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
That is correct. And was the last paragraph in the 15 page document?

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
After terminally amicess, I guess and now...

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
The other day I was stated that Mr. Welch speaks for Mr. Stevens.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
Mr. Welch, this morning, to millions of television viewers, call us a complete 20.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
If Mr. Stevens wants to let that stand, if he is statements, well, and good I think,

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
over Mr. Stevens, that would be given the opportunity to say that Mr. Welch does not speak in-prem this morning,

29:27.000 --> 29:38.000
and that it has been a stab, but this is a verb-baton, verb-baton, copy of the report from the ad-regoomer in regards to communist theft.

29:38.000 --> 29:45.000
The Charlotte Ikeman, the senator here that we have concluded, Mr. Collier, was to hope maybe soon, if Mr. Stevens is the next witness.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
Why thought he might be given the opportunity now if he wants to hold himself up?

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I'm continuing with Mr. Collier, if we have complete.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I'm sure Mr. Collier was here, Chairman.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Mr. Chairman, I'll make a point of order.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yes.

29:58.000 --> 30:05.000
There's been as much as we took a long time to find out about the picture, all we're going to consider re-crawling Mr. Stevens,

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
while trying to find out who furnished this document.

30:11.000 --> 30:22.000
Mr. Chairman, I have every invention of pursuing the subject of this document until all of the information's possible pertaining to it has been fully elicited.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
Well then, Mr. Counsel, I would think you were preferable somebody besides Mr. Stevens.

30:26.000 --> 30:36.000
Mr. Senator Saintington, I have not indicated that Chairman I regret to say that State of Mr. Stevens was the next witness of Mr. Chairman.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
I take the responsibility of not having advised you that that is not in accordance with my claim.

30:42.000 --> 30:49.000
The very reason, Charlotte corrects himself a another witness that you just got told between the witnesses and the deceased.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
I tell you that I am not aware of that change of life.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Do you have any further questions?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I have a message from Mr. Collier.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
No further questions.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Thank you.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
I ask you to have any further questions from Mr. Collier and to the defendant, to my right, I have any questions.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Mr. Senator, is there my left?

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Yes.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
There's one question.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
And in the problem, there's one question, Mr. Chairman.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
From what you have seen of the two documents, the one that has been presented here,

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
and the one that you discussed with Mr. Irgelyt.

31:20.000 --> 31:32.000
I'll ask you to state whether it would be possible for anyone to compose or present the document now before us,

31:32.000 --> 31:41.000
that they had access to the original documents or the original papers there have,

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
which still remain confidential and restricted.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Your answer is from my personal opinion.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
From what you have done, I have resolved the truth.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
What is the possible exception?

31:54.000 --> 32:01.000
That the author of the document now before us must have had access to the original or the original copies thereof.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
So I would say that since seven of us are a graph.
