00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I think the next time I saw this, Mr. Welch,

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
when I asked Mr. Driscoe to get from my files,

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
any member of the having to do with the

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Chincon Charm, a crappy matter.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Did you know Senator that she was maintaining that little file

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
that was putting evidence here?

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Well, I know that Mary filed things that she considered important.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Oh, I understand she filed things, but you know that she was maintaining that little file

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
that she put in evidence when she came up to testify.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I don't know how to give you a little file, I...

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
But one, you know what I mean, don't you?

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I assume that she was keeping these members in the file.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
But you know that she had that little file all put together

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
until you last saw her looking for it in March.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Uh, Mr. Welch, I told you,

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
last I knew that Mary Driscoe,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
being an efficient secretary, was saving any member

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
in the... the currency of any importance.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
No, I...

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I don't know.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Well, my question is Senator,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
did you know that she had them all neatly assembled in one file?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I was wondering what she does, and if we don't say it.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
And did you know that she had them all neatly assembled?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I didn't know that they were assembled or not.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Was it a good and a glad surprise to you

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
when you found them all put together?

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
I knew that Mr. Discoe would have the memorandum.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I asked her for them.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
She gave them to me periods.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
There was nothing especially glad about knowing what I've known for years

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
and I've definitely extremely confident.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Did you first say...

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Did you first send my car searching through the files for me?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And did it mark 11th?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I believe I told Frank to check the files.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I think he had these testified.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
The past bad job on him was to just go knowing that she had the files.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Was he the one that had the glad surprise,

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
a finding in the file,

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
and Mr. Discoe's design to all put together over you the ones?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
May what surprise?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
The glad surprise.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I wasn't surprised.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Was he the one that found it or were you?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Mr. Discoe kept them here by the files.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
And gave it to the police first.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Me?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
To you first.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Do all the time in the fire?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
A question shall pass under the left.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yes.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Turn to the right.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yes.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
As long as that's...

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I said, Mr. Welfare,

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I was having a...

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
I will ask Mr. St. Fred to finish the item that he had in hand quite shortly

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
and then I will come back.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Thank you, sir.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
You and I were discussing quite early this morning these

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
the last blackmail attempt of December of January 22nd.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
My memory was that I had asked you whether or not it was not true

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
that the substance of the matter that John Adams was supposed to have blackmailed you with

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
and tried to blackmail you with had already become a matter of public knowledge in the newspapers.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Can you call that?

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I don't know how much of that was in the newspapers, Mr. St. Fred.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
I know that there were some sort of leaked stories that appeared

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
that's what they were I frankly don't know.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Except I think someone called my attention to a column which I referred to

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
after the other day along in December.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
That's right, on December 22nd, the day you wrote the letter to the summer era.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I believe you and I made it.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
That's what raised you about the letter was because you have seen that in the newspaper.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
On that very morning, I don't think that that column, I believe there had

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
another so-called dope story as a nice collect story.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
In addition to last time, they not only had it been in the newspapers

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
but at least four senators know about it, didn't they?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I don't know how many sons were in the allowance.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, you know that John Adams defended the Senate of Dutton?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
No, I didn't know that Mr. Adams had been a city of under Dutton.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Well, you received a call trying to find a card and might have been supposed to blackmail

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
the template was made to that effect that wasn't it?

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
I received a call to the effect that Mr. Adams had either phone with Mr. Dutton

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
or had seen him or something.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I forget to switch it on.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
So here's the man trying to blackmail you with information and drill curves

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
and had in his column that other newspapers had talked about and with all respect

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
to the United States Senate, four senators knew about it.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Which hardly asleep it wasn't.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
He didn't fix things.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
No, I thought he was trying to asleep it wasn't.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Mr. Sinclair, I think that you make a good point there.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
I think that Mr. Adams had discussed us with a number of newsmen.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
And prior to the time he discussed it with me, I didn't realize the extent of that.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
For example, Mr. Adams saw me.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
He didn't tell me that he had had a meeting with Bill Rogers and Brown L

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
and the second other individuals.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
So that much of this, even I know now, I didn't know that time.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
No, but you know it's your parents that read about it?

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
I knew that he had written above it that he didn't have all of the material

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
that was finally produced.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Mayor Sinclair, that you made that it wasn't every sponsor to the question

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
of giving up that time.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Giving up the time Mr. Adams talked to me on the night of the 22nd.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
There was no information that there was a plan to smear a bank car.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Roy Cohn was the target man.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
Frank was brought in later by someone else.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Well now the blackmail that you testified to was Roy Cohn now.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
The blackmail was the threat to Roy Cohn.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
No.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
The two-way report claiming that Roy had used improper methods to get this plan

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
that promoted to the apparatus.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Now, so that as it comes out here was an attempt at blackmail, sir.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I was in the new papers and four senators already knew about it.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And at least you knew about Senator Dertz and now is that very nice

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
because Frank's car falls in the hole.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
All right?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I don't believe all of this information is carried with papers

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
and all the reports that finally exist.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Well, it was such a serious matter, sir, that you gave John Adams some gifts

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
as he left your home that night.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
It wasn't.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
Mrs. McCarthy gave Mr. Adams and as I say, some self-decoder, self-examination, some cheese,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
and my friend Steve has never had much to deal with him.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I hate very much to bring your wife into it.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
I was prepared, sir, that's not much of what you are approval on that evening.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Anything that my wife has done so far,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
especially in the other fact that she is a scared listening to me now

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
and me, so it's my heart, he approves.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I know you would say that, sir.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
So that in all honesty, Senator,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
you don't give gifts to persons who come around the steps of blackmail, you do?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Mr....

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, the answer is really...

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Frank, where I gave Mr. Adams some...

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
...many days.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Well, some days, there were some cheese and some stuff.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
It's one thing people must come to do.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
The blackmail I've done with...

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Oh, I know what you're saying, Claire, that may sound familiar.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Claire, that moment...

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Well, it's a...

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It's a moment, honestly, because...

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
The point is that John Adams had been training to induce us to call off these hearings for some time.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
I felt that he felt out of his job.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I felt that he was doing much too far.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
When he made these bets about...

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
...eachery report about Roy,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I didn't think that way he would do it.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I just couldn't conceive of his doing it.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
First, as I say, there was much to happen...

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
What happened?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Much, much to happen by that time that I...

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
...I didn't know a band that I know now.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
I didn't know, for example, that...

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
...like that.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, do you mean he was getting some of it?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
No, I didn't think he was getting answer.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
No, I thought it's van, but this man has come.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Can anyone at night?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Mr. Pinkler, you may be able to respond with this.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
But I'm trying to convince you that this is short.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
I'm just announcing your question.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Okay?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah, that's right.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I said I didn't think he was kidding.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
I felt that John was doing everything he could...

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
...to induce us to call off the hearings.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Including?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I'm sorry, sir.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Including attempting to blackmail you.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Is that right?

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
I would consider that blackmail the threat to issue...

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
...the type of school that's report...

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
...projected them.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Completely unfound with no basis and fright.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Against Mr. Cormor, Mr. Cron, Mr. Singh Claire...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
...I think we should remember in the following minutes...

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
...of the hope of the police.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Is that free time that they...

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
...only charge of this conduct...

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
...made by either Mr. Stephen's...

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
...proud of the slam on her oath?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Because my chief counsel here was unable...

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
...to induce me to the dissess...

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
...from calling the members of the old human world...

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
...yborid with the sending coming of black prosecutor...

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
...or I never tried to do that...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
...if he had he would have none of them for such.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I must have a rather poor memory, sir...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
...that I have to recall some testimony...

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
...that Roy made some threats.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
But you and I are not now going to argue this case.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't think it's appropriate for any man to make any threats.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm going to make a threat.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm going to make a threat.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Mr. C. Cormor, sorry, sir.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I have a request.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
You know, I'm going to raise the meeting.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
You talked about my chief counsel.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I've got to discuss it.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
You said there were a ton of...

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
...their fault was making threats.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
There was a discussion about...

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
...part-roy threat.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
He was invited down to go through the radar laboratory...

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
...as a fortman.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Who knew you got those?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
He was excluded.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
I think he was.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I think that I would have been much, much more irritated...

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
...if I had been in Roy Cormor's position that day.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
There's also a senator's suggestion...

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
...about a certain automobile ride.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Isn't that right?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
If I'm hooked, I'd be in my arms.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I just tell him the truth.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And that's committee in my view.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Thank you.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Now, as I understand it, this is such a...

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
...souralist...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
...mar against the name of Roy Corm...

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
...that on the same night...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
...you left Mr. Adams giving him gifts.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Is that the way, only?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Mr. Adams had not issued the report up at that point.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
But he had spoken to you, saying.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Since even he...

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
...very strongly in the deal, let me know...

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
...that he had continued with the hearings...

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
...he would issue a report.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I didn't believe any word of that time.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
He didn't believe it.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Because I had listened to John Scott...

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
...forfeiting on for quite some time.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Well, that is...

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
...I didn't believe anyone could be so dishonest.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
As to issue the fall...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
...consultant fraudulent...

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
...since I was very...

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
...experienced in my right.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
But now left, Mr. Corm...

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
...we have to put one more second on my left.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, they are conferring...

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
...and while we have the opportunity...

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
...let's pretend to watch.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Here we go.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I'm welcome.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I'm welcome, I'm welcome.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
One question of the...

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
...with time to change in the South Dakota South...

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
...extend it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Listen to Kathy.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Went in and got those things to join Adam.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
We did not say that.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I don't give them to him.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I didn't like some of the things he said to me tonight.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Is that right?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
No, I don't know.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm just in the words and you don't.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Right.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And the second point is that there's a difference...

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
...between leaking...

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
...a sentence or a tool or something.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
So a columnist...

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
...and issuing a...

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
...long list of charges...

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
...under the name of the...

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
...department of the Army...

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
...has been up and blazing headlines...

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
...on every front page in the country.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
There's something Mr. Colman is saying...

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
...in front of to John Adam.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I think it was unjustified to hear that he said...

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
...one thing to hear the things from you and get some control.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I don't think that John Adam...

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
...would have issued these folks charges on his own.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
At this point, I don't know who's responsible.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I don't think that's done.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Money first.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Well, take over.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I have just a few more questions.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I take it this.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
You will agree to this extent that John Adam...

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
...is never directly said that he was going to issue those charges, all right?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
You never said in so many words.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I wish he was charged as a user-eye phone...

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
...but the conversation made it clear that he was...

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
...mightingly fast.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
You interpret it.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Right.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
And in fact, someone told me that I...

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
...referred.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
In fact, I think I used the term...

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
...at least half a dozen times that night.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
For the term blackmail, I pointed out to Mr. Adam...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
...that while he felt...

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
...he apparently honestly felt it was a mistake...

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
...to us to continue our investigation of the...

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
...the...

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
...the future of the Army...

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
...that every other department would feel the same way.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And I just got within the science...

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
...in fact, something from detail, the fact...

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
...that I had gone out in campaign...

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
...and I think it's men like paintings, men like veterans.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Because I felt that they were placing...

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
...possibly above country.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And I thought no one had a right...

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
...to do any fight-washing.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And I told him the file...

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
...it might temporarily hurt.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
In the end, it was wise...

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
...for ever when we would develop all the facts.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I discussed with him the...

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
...as every call the government's putting off a state.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
I pointed out that there we found a bad situation...

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
...but the newsmead, Mr. Brottonberg...

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
...gave us some quick cooperation.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
When he found that the loyalty board had nothing...

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
...doing his job as a should-bearer factor in those...

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
...then he removed all the personnel in the coming days.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And I suggested Mr. Adams...

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
...what the team of the 50th and 50th students could do...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
...he had a different view of this situation.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Well, let me ask you that, Senator.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Were you trying to accomplish something yourself with this meeting?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I was trying to induce Mr. Adams to work with us...

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
...and let you call the lawyer.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
So that we could...

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
...suffer American people, see these faces in the names...

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
...of those individuals that had been responsible for...

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
...what I, Mr. St. Claire, have told Stephen.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And that's why you invited John Adams here home that night.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
To see if you could convince him...

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
...that you should be allowed to have the lawyer's board...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
...before your committee.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
That may have been one of the reasons I was...

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
...I was also disturbed about the fact that...

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
...he had been giving tonight's concert full statements...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
...for some of the Seniors in regard to Mr. Cohn.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I thought you didn't know about that, Senator McCrady.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I didn't know that Mr. Adams had done it.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I believe he had been giving.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I'm sorry, Senator St. Claire.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I told you I didn't know that...

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
...I believe that Mr. Adams must have been the individual...

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
...and I think the Seniors sitting here...

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
...will know that none of them told me that it was John Adams...

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
...who gave them that particular story as far as I know.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
That's the best in my recollection.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I...I felt it, John.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
What do you know about that?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I thought it was.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I didn't know it was.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Very well. One thing you want to do at the conference...

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
...is to see if you could work out some understanding...

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
...on the lawyer's board.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
What do you want to do with Mr. Cohn?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Well, maybe just get to know. It's getting late, Senator.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
I know it's getting late, but not too late to get to have the fight.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
But when I...

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
...one of the students with the Seniors was to work out...

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
...any situation which we could get the information...

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
...which the American people could have about...

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
...communist infiltration.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
And I believe...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
...not protect those numbers of all the boys.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And I believe it has to be that...

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
...the one thing you have read on is to wait those...

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
...secretary senators in Paris.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I think we did.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I think we did.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
All right.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
The Secretary turned on about February 3rd.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It was all about the way the turn.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
And there's another fact Senator...

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
...that the Secretary of the Secretary of the Secretary...

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
...has not called the law to go ahead.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I am not.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And there was a conservative senator...

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
...between February 3rd and March the 10th or 11th...

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
...when the President and President of the Chamber...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
...longed which he could have done that.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
No, I am not talking about the Lincoln-Berry's...

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
...pick and choice.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
This might have just been the activity from...

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
...the Democratic Chamber.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Very shortly after the third of February...

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
...I think it was the fourth or first...

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
...I was given for...

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
...I don't think so.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I think 10th or 12th is...

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
...I feel back.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
We went to the first case...

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
...and during the first case...

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
...that things blew up.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Well, the President, before your committee...

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
...on March the 2nd of February...

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
...he went before our committee on the 30th of January...

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
...but General St. Wicker...

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
...was before the committee of your holiday's lunch.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I must have come on reminds me...

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
...the first class was not before the committee...

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
...on the open freshman's of February 18th...

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
...he was before the committee on the executive...

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
...Section and January 30th.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
I know, and Wicker was before his right after class.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
So you had some February 18th and tomorrow's test...

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
...to call the lawyer board.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I think that's a surprise.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, you've already got to write, sir, that if there was any...

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
...blackmail, certainly was not effective.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
That was not effective.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Well, the reason then, why he didn't call the lawyer...

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
...is the word must be some other reason.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Isn't that right?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
No.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
No.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
It wasn't the blackmail.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
You say?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
In the...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
...we came back when we were in the press case...

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
...we felt that such a text...

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
...presidents over the following lawyer board.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
During the press case that Mr. Steven called...

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
...what about the date?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
20th of February?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
20th of February.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
And that time, onward, our committee has been particularly immobilized...

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
...I couldn't possibly call the lawyer board.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I still may say, it's not necessarily clear.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
So there's no doubt on the fact that...

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
...anyone that I am going to attempt to call...

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
...the members of that...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
...boy-oldy board.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
When we get through with the hearings...

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
...I hope the committee will go along with me on that.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
I think the American people should know why...

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
...that board of 30 individuals...

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
...became a mind that all 30 didn't fit in every state...

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
...they just picked out random three or five of these kids.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
I think the American people should know why...

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
...over the past number of years...

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
...the members of that board...

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
...consciously sent men back to the radar laboratory.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
My toxic radar laboratory...

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
...even after the first Army-oyalty board had found them on fifth...

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
...and gone to the Royal University.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I hope the committee votes with me on that...

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
...if they do, we will attempt to give the American people a fight.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
All I'm trying to develop Senator is...

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
...your testimony that the attempted blackmail is not effective.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Am I right?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
The attempted blackmail was not effective...

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
...but the issuance of the report...

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
...affectively called off our investigation exposure.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
But it wasn't issued until the Pences March was a senator.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
The attempted level, I believe he level.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
That's right.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
I would call John Adams that the five that you said on the 20th of January...

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
...the Roy Cohn itself involved himself in this matter...

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
...that you could no longer go forward.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
I think so.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Well, it so happened you did not go forward, did you Senator?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Yes, I did.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Well, when did you go forward on the Royalty board senator?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I have never...

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
...I have never had the Royalty board before me...

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
...and I had no freedom to form me...

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
...forging him to produce the Royalty board.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
That was the point of the committee.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I had to do that.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
The direct call I agreed to wait until Bob Stevens got back...

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
...I thought the maybe Mr. Stevens would agree with us.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
On the matter, the first conversation I had with Mr. Stevens...

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
...that we got back was when he called me...

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
...and that monitored phone conversation that you have here.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
And from that time onward, it was incomparable to...

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
...anything our committee has been emotionalized.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Well, the very day before the report of March 10th was issued...

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
...you sent over six names of servicemen who used that...

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
...recommunities, did you know?

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
I sent over a request for the production of six individuals...

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
...with records of communist activity.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
So you had available time to go into the Royalty board, didn't you?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
We had to do it.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
We had time.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
But you didn't do it.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Up to this point, we had not we hoped to do it.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
That's right.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
That's all I have.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Mr. Turner, would you be good enough to...

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
...have I...

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
...is there some of the same time left?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Would you be good enough?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I'll try and give you some justice fire.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
At volume 31,

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
...just to clarify.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I'll tell you the right test.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Tell you the left test.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
And can you come?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
You have?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I have.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Good.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Good.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You have to know.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Mr. Turner, would you be good enough to look at volume 31...

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
...of the record?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Say 6170.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
I know.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
What about this?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
6170.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
6170.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
You were just trying to find out the Atlanta...

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
...that I had been trying to find out.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And four lines from the bottom.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
You say Mr. Conor and Mr. Carl were not in town.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I called my office not for that purpose.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Alone.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
The word is A, L, O, N, G.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
But I think it should be alone.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Do you not agree?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Is that right?

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
Well, you personally read the last money.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Not for that.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Not for that purpose alone.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
But just to make sure that it was not me forgotten.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Because I was leaving the next day.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I dictated a memorandum on the lot of matters.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
And it was brought up the next noon...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
...and we discussed it in late detail.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
May I say.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
And with considerable bigger on the part of some of the participants.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Did you mean by that to say the memorandum was brought up the next noon...

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
...or the subject was?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
The subject was brought up.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
And if this sounds as if the memorandum was brought up...

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
...and I think you're right, that it's you must have meant the other thing.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
What it really should indicate is...

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
...that the subject was brought up the next noon.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Is that not correct?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
That's not the obvious...

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
...weaving of the same symmetry as...

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
...and the next noon means a gaseous respite.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Is that right?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
That is right.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Now, Senator...

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
...you must inform the judge and the lawyer.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
And you are familiar with the rule that a witness to a conversation...

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
...ought to state the subject matter...

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
...and ought to state the substands of what each person said in the conference.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Are you familiar with that rule?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I don't understand you.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Let me put it here.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
There's an important little investigation.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Certainly the conversation should be recited.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
And in substance law, nobody can hope to recall the precise word.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Is that right?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I think it'll be impossible for anyone to recall it.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Now, very in mind, you're training as a lawyer and a judge.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Will you give me the rare creeps there in this rule?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
I don't blame you alone, but will you give me the rare creeps...

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
...of stating in substance what each person said about law and the collapse?

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
Start it anyway you want and give us actually the best you can...

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
...saying that your Adam said in substance I reside in substance or Mr. Conn...

23:46.000 --> 23:53.000
...and actually make a lawyer's ears sing for once by stating it the way I should be stated.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Will you do it, sir?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I don't know if I can make your ears sing, but I have to.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I don't think I'd say...

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
...I don't think I'll be glad to give you the substance of the conversation...

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
...the substance of the words.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Who's got it? Who's going first?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I don't think I'll be the first.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I'll think out somebody. Let's go.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
I won't think out.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
And he said and somebody else said.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I don't understand how I want it.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I will just tell you the substance of the conversation.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Who said Watt's leave?

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Now don't give me a resume, but just tell me who said Watt's leave.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Mr. Watt, you just kept your hearing me that you didn't expect me to repeat for a bit.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
But it's quite a long...

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Who do you say introduced it?

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Conn or Adam's or you on car?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
When you left in the street now?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
First tell me who introduced for substance.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I don't know.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Well, Mr. Conn thought he knew.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Did you hear him testify?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
All right. Who did he think so?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
The other dance moves.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Well, don't you remember what he said?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Well, anyhow, Senator...

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
We're referring to his testimony.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Anyhow, start out in Calus.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
The substance of what he twung fast.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I have an exciting foretell.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
You're an rusty said.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Good. I want to be sure you're going to please me.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Not with the contents of what the cargo of the next appear to have been.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I mean, I'm pleased you, Mr. Watt.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
But I will give you a sample.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
We just go.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Great length.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I don't know who brought up the subject.

25:10.000 --> 25:19.000
Discuss the question of the suggestive breaking of General Watt.

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
That I hope by breaking you, Mr. Chairman, I mean the removal of Mr. Watt and Mr. Mann.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
That's the subject.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
Mr. Conn very vigorously protested.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
So this was taking action against the man because he was a witness before the committee.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Two pointed out.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
Mr. Conn, I think the most of the talking that day.

25:44.000 --> 25:54.000
Mr. Conn pointed out that his break had break a general for cooperating with the committee

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
and getting rid of Communists from the sacred radar labor service.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
That that would mean that it would be almost impossible.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
The broader committee to get testimony in the future.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Some individuals who had wires, families that depend upon their salary.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
That there would be no doubt about it.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
In effect, they also would be broke.

26:16.000 --> 26:26.000
Mr. Adams persisted in saying that it had nothing to do with the cooperation of the port and monolith.

26:26.000 --> 26:33.000
So that's something I do with a statement that Mr. Lawsman had made to some staff meeting.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
There was no...

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
And I think the matter went back and forth.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
That's about all I can tell you.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
I can't give you the words.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I said, went on for some time.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
It's just...
