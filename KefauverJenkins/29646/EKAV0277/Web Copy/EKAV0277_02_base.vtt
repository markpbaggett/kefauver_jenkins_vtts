WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
But our committee would do nothing about it if he were broken.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
He didn't get that assurance.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
That was the means of the conversation.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Was any other soldier's name mentioned besides Watten?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
They'd been me, well have them,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
and have they a conversation of about three hours.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Yes, because the name of any private mentioned.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
I assume you mean private shines.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Their shines name may well have been mentioned.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Didn't he try to bring a shine?

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
I think that there's a recall,

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
and keep in mind that it's impossible to pinpoint these things

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
at the date seven or eight months ago.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
I think that Adam's tried to bring up the subject of shine,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
but Shane looked and discussed to any length at all.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
The means of the conversation was about the breaking of General Law.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
What little problem of conversation,

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
if any, was there about private shines?

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
I can't think of any little problem of conversation about shine.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
We never managed to say Adam's never managed to say

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
a word about him, is that right?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I can't think of no...

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
He was the only one before I could talk about him, is that right?

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
I don't know if anyone else wants to talk about the shine matter.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
The subject there that disturbed me very much, disturbed Roy.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
Frank was the suggested breaking of General Law.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
The last evidence here, and the other thing that's about just to...

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
You talk about a lawyer's evidence.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
Mr. Cohn that night with my full agreement,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
and Mr. Justice called up General Lawton,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
and his aide came down the next day, which is right.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
His aide came down the next day,

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
and we gave him the phone for my son this morning.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
Mr. Senator McCarthy, would you be good enough to pick up your monitor's phone call

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
on the 7th of November 1953?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Hang on.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm back.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I know them.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Have you a sir?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yes sir.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Would you read it along with me?

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
It begins with you addressing the secretary of the Army as Bob.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Is that right?

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
So Bob, did that work all right for your satisfaction yesterday?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes, the did Joe.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
And I appreciate your support.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Yes, the did Joe.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And I appreciate your taking a very broad view of the thing.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
No, sir.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Senator, we both have the same interest, and we are both...

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
And we both are working at the same job.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Correct sir?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
That's the next one's number eight.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Senator, second to the Army, I was worried at first,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
but the way it wound up, I was satisfied with it,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
and I want to thank you.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
Senator, I would like to ask you one personal favor.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
For God's sake, don't put David in service

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
and assigning back to my committee from three standpoints.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
That sounds a little like you, doesn't it, Senator?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I'll figure it out if I can listen.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
One, I couldn't get away with it any more than a week.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
The newspapers would be back on us,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and you would have to send me back if you uniformed anyway.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Two, this thing has been running along so cleanly so far.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
They have not been able to back your brains out.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
There's nothing the left wingers would like better.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
They don't like this cooperation between the committee and the Army.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And the third thing, they would say I asked for it.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
From my desk today, I can pick up letters from perhaps a half dozen letters,

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
from mothers whose boys are in worship from days.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
And it would be embarrassing if hell demeaned.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I think they're Mr. Wilson.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
They say that hell's the need of the right to make sense of paper

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
to a young man who's doing the use of him, miss something there.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, he could get off weekend.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Roy, it is one of the few things I have seen him

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
completely unreasonable about.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
He thinks they should be a general

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
and work from the penthouse at the wall door.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Underclass examination by Mr. Jenkins,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
did I understand you to say that at some point in that sentence

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
been that paragraph of yours.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
You became jockler.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
What you're welcome, you and I not to do any cover-full pregnancy, you know.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Would you just go through that and tell us what you left out

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
when you read that?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I didn't mean to.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Where did you think I left something?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Would you read a senator?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
He left out this statement.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
He is a good man, but there's nothing in the responsible abortion.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Seriously, no.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
I had a copy that had those words that he is exquisite.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Man, good boy.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I think that's right.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
There's nothing you can do to stand up about him.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
From my desk today, I can pick up letters from past

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
and have to send letters from mothers whose boys ran works

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
shape and date, and it would be embarrassing to tell the need.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
That word, hell, you think should be changed.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, I mean, sometimes it doesn't quite make sense

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
to tell the need.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Another three or four dots after indicating

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
that the amendment was monitoring this.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Not after the word B is there, senator.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Yes, after the word, me, three dots.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
If he could get off, we can.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Roy and them two dots.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
It is one of the few things I have seen you completely unreasonable about.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
What was it that Roy was so unreasonable about?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I don't think he was unreasonable.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
Roy and I, different, I had gotten final bar play.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
I came down and attempt to write the various reports.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
How many reports would I have?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Three, what four of them?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Three that they had to do with.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Final bar flag and excellent researcher.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I felt that the final could write the reports

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
merely from the transcripts of the testimony.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Roy didn't think that he could.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
He felt that it took a manhood and living with this working with it

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
as they have had been for a long time.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
It still happened Roy was right.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I thought that he was wrong at that time,

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
but this is one of the few things I was considering that was right.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Then, if I understand you, senator,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
the thing that Roy, that you meant to refer to there

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
that was that Roy was unreasonable about

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
wanting, trying to work on weekends.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Is that right?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yes.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And those are the types of types of types.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Any questions?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
From the head table?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Mr. Khan?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yes.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Have you helped?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yes.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And then senator, the next one.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
He thinks they should be a general.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And what for the penthouse of the wall door?

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
Do you mean to attach that remark to this gentleman in the environment?

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
That's Mr. Wilson's words, obviously.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I completely have a facetious remark.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You think it's the hall hall?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
It's because of that right?

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Because neither Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kohn,

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I ever thought that he's not a general working from the penthouse.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
No, let me go to your next sentence or next paragraph.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
Take that into consideration and ask that he be immediately assigned.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Roy was next to quitting the committee.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Was that funny?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yes.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Was that funny?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Roy was next to quitting the committee?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Yes, there was a funny.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
Were you trying to be for seats as there?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I don't think it would be funny, but it's because of the many of you.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
You weren't trying to be funny.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Where are you, senator?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
No, I wouldn't say that wasn't funny.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Right.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
He thought I had gone back on the committee.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Mr. Wilson?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And then he was only a paragraph.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
What the secretary of the army said, I'm attaching this significance only to what the senator said.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I can read it.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I can read it.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I quit for will.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
I think maybe let me read what you'll meet up in Mr. Wilson.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm interested in your work, but you may certainly read his.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
The secretary, that is where my problem was come from.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
Right from the start, you never have done or said anything that spread me on the situation at all.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
All of them take a friendly interest.

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
I read that, Mr. Wilson, because this completely contradicts any...

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
I have a attempt at getting a special consideration for that.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
And the secretary, Sieben, is not in a very top-off frame of mind.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And he has answered in what you say with the procedures.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Remark, is he?

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Well, this is not a matter of follow.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
What you told me is the other matter.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Mr. Wilson, this is a matter of charges that may have been publicized, that we've been hearing now for weeks.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
I tried to get special consideration from Mr. Shane with trying to hear in this phone call,

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
which was, the manifest not fine me, but Mr. Stevens.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
The secretary says you have never done anything that spread me on other than a take a friendly interest.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Yes.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
But I, would you let your mind, your eye rest on the last sentence that you spoke just about where you are, Senator?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You'll think whatever you want to do.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
Anything, Dave, should be a general, and work from the penthouse of the wall door.

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
If I understand you, contestantly, it is to the effect that you said that with a sort of a choco, is that right, sir?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Well, Mr. Wilson, obviously, I've been said about this.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Well, did you say that with a sort of a choco?

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
Mr. Wilson, well, that is obviously a... a vicious remark.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
But would you argue my question? Did you choco when you said it?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Did I choco?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Did I choco?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yes, sir.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I don't recall having choco.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
Did Mr. Smith say that the secretary of the army choco when he replied?

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I don't recall the secretary's choco.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Well, look at your next sentence where you were speaking.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Take that into consideration and ask the TV immediately to sign.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Roy was next to quitting the committee.

11:42.000 --> 11:50.000
He thought I had drawn back on the committee, and for God's sake, don't tell blank anything of this,

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
because he would go right back and tell Roy.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Was that the thesis?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
No.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That was serious.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Right.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
So that you asked the secretary not to report this conversation to a certain individual.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
Because if he were to do so, bad individuals would turn with go right back and tell Roy.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
That's what it says.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I don't know the...

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
But it's said here and you'll know that there's a lot of dots here and they can think you're left out.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I pointed out to the secretary.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
No, not fair.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yes, sir.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yes, sir.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
You'll find the freedo up here.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Well, the opening of the sentence?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Yes, but that free sentence is back.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm reading the one.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
I'm reading the one.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yes, sir.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
I'm reading the one that says, and for God's sake, don't tell blank anything of this,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
because he would go right back and tell Roy.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
There are no dots in that sentence, either.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
There are dots in my answer.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And the answer?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
And the answer?

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
And the answer is that he left the material out for the word dots.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
So if you say that...

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
I will tell you what Eric Hall was saying.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Well, this tells us what was said.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
No, it doesn't.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Have you any doubts that this object phone call is annually?

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
The amount of the injury, the sudden freeze, the dots in the answer.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I'm sure it was less of...

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
But Senator, let's be fair about it.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
There are no dots in that life sentence, either.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Let's do that for sure.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
No dots in the last sentence, either.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Let's do this for a friend.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yes, sir.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
Would you be fair with me, sir, and look at your documents and tell me, are there any dots in the sentence that begin?

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
And for God's sake, don't tell blank anything of this, because he would go right back and tell Roy.

13:35.000 --> 13:43.000
Mr. Welts, in my statement here, the young man who monitored the call, I guess that's the...

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
He was jacked up.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
So it's a term of a foreeud stopping...

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
He was jacked up.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
We all remember him, right?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
That's the...

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
Where he put dots, that indicated the material was missing.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Now I will tell you...

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
I will tell you what was said here, if you like.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
There was material missing.

14:07.000 --> 14:18.000
I discussed with Bob the importance of having Mr. Shine available to finish many work.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
I did tell him that I thought the joy...

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
And I had different very strong land, and I have used the word unreasonable.

14:28.000 --> 14:37.000
I bought an asset for just being available at all times when he was not in training.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
Now, the Secretary of State, I believe, was Mr. Cohn making available at all times.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
He was not in training.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
I think that was a good thing.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Now, look...

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
I've been to this memorandum now on the Tuesday of nipping with doctor.

14:56.000 --> 15:04.000
How are you meeting things into this memorandum of this block of telephone call to fill in the spots when there are dots?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm just telling you about the conversation where we're going.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But you're giving your resume, have us.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I think we've got the conversation.

15:10.000 --> 15:17.000
You deny that Mr. Cohn said, and for God's sake, don't tell blank anything of this, because he would go back right back until Roy.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
You deny that you're sped.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I think I won't fight for so much.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
I do, too.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Now, do you want to say anything else about us?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
There are no dots in connection with it either.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
Mr. Wilson, don't fight me trouble with me.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I just quanted out that there were dots here showing the parts of the conversation we're missing.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
I told you when I thought those missing parts were.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Let's get on, Senator.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
Would you like to read what the Secretary said to you, because I'm not interested in it, but to me, certainly read it if you'd like to.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Would you like to, sir?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I don't have nothing going to do it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I think as long as we're reading the...

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Oh, yeah.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
...monitor's call, which would read all of it.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I'm not sure that if there's any...

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
...cortancy, but let's sort everything in.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
The Secretary, I would rather not tell anybody anything.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
As far as what you've said, I'm not going to do anything.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
A trip that you have in gold through the regular things.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Maybe a weekend here or there, something of that trend.

16:24.000 --> 16:32.000
Actually, on the two-week thing, I said I had personally arranged this thing because I wanted him to be available to help your committee get...

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
...along further with this thing.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
That is the way the thing was done when there were dashes.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Actually, on the two-week thing, I said I had personally arranged this thing.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
Because I wanted him to be available to help your committee get along further with this thing.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
Then a bunch of dots again, this is the Secretary's nothing.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
That is the way the thing was done when I...

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
...saused out of the proper way to handle it.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
I think in our demean, and I'll handle it in a proper way along the line you have been talking about, period.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
The Secretary used that.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
The IRA, your partner.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
He's hurt me, mate.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
If you put him into service to work with the committee, all hell would break loose.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
And the President would be calling you not to play favor because anyone is on a committee.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
I think for Roy's sake, if you can let him come back for a weekend or something,

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
so he's going to get too long to him.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
Maybe if they gave him a hair off, he won't want to come back.

17:36.000 --> 17:44.000
When the Secretary says, I will take care of it, and I appreciate your whole attitude on it yesterday.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Well, the time has come, right?

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
While they're going around, and the former's to watch the tenures of it.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Mr. Cohn?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
No, I think so.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
I feel like you have another ten minutes.

17:56.000 --> 18:05.000
Mr. Chairman, you will recall this morning that I asked when we had the things to do that was passed off of the Chairman.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
Did I ask for the right to read into the record a statement by the Secretary of the Army?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
It has just come to me and me, and I now read it.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
It is short.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Well, Mr. President, is this...

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Uh, a presentation?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Yes, sir.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Mr. Chairman, is this Mr. Chairman Mr. Wilson?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
We talked about this morning.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
That's right.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
And how long is this?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
It's about two and a half pages.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Oh, yes.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I'm sorry, sir.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Yes.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Our understanding was, I think, this morning that it was become an exhibit in the record.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
No, I need to have a read, Mr. Chairman.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Well, I don't think there's any objection to that.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yes.

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
What I'm curious about is whether it now becomes a subject then for examination and post-intervention.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
It wasn't made a little...

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
The billy board of the Mr. Cohn, the baking statement, has a conference of the combination this morning.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
And that statement is hearing all the diamonds to put it in the evidence.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
I have no objection.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Very, Mr. Chairman.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
I know.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
I don't want to have this wait.

19:12.000 --> 19:22.000
I am told off the proceedings, however, the Secretary of the Army was only standing here for I believe 18 or 18 days.

19:23.000 --> 19:30.000
We had a complete full opportunity to tell us about his conversations with Senator Samington,

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
who was such a quiet quitter, who was advising him.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
He saw a fit not to do this.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.000
Now now, when we find out accidentally, who was giving him that advice,

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
if he puts a statement in the record, unsworn,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
I think it is just highly improper.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
No reason for it.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
He was here.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
He had an opportunity to give us all the information.

20:01.000 --> 20:11.000
I would say this, but if he has information and he wants to furnish in regard to the conversations with our friends from Missouri,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
and with quiet quitter, that's then what we should do.

20:14.000 --> 20:22.000
It's now Mr. Jenkins having sworn with some member of the committee presence,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
and letting him submit that under oath.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
Otherwise, we're just opening up an entirely new field by emphasizing confusions,

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
that the Secretary was not taken by surprise on this.

20:38.000 --> 20:49.000
He was asked in detail who had induced the filing of the fraudulent charges, who was behind it.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
He knew that that was the thing that we were perhaps more concerned about than anything else.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
The Secretary, for some reason, kept secrets.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
He kept secrets that the advice was coming from some of her signings and the Democrats,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
also the Democrats advised Mr. Clifford.

21:10.000 --> 21:19.000
I just think it violates all the rules of evidence and law to put this statement in here

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
at this time on the sworn to.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
We don't know what is prepared by someone that the Secretary of Labor, John DeCronico,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I don't know who prepared this.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
I'd like to have that done at least in deposition forms, Mr. Chairman.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
Well, the Chair would say that the statement is correct, and we have the same status as a statement that the Secretary makes to this fact.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
And of course, the Chair would have no ruling what the Secretary might make to the press and would have that right to make it.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
We recognize that Mr. Wilson is not testifying his attorney, and Chair has no objection.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Of course, the Secretary of the Army making any statement he wants to to the press should be publicized.

22:04.000 --> 22:12.000
This will be publicized, but if he recognizes it is not sworn testimony and consequently will be considered

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
in the nature of the statement that the Secretary of the Army makes to this as well,

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
and depending on it, from here, the statement that he would have a right to make should be made.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
Any time he will be hearing, he can ask for the hearing, does any other official has a right to make it public state?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Can only one suggestion not to enter my side?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
No, only one suggestion.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
That's the Secretary has a statement that he wants to give to the press.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I think he should issue it to the press.

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
So far, we have nothing in the record that is not sworn testimony.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I just don't think it's a wise thing of this to wait.

22:44.000 --> 22:51.000
A moment to put anything in the record which is not sworn to, they can't be cross-examined.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
Now, that's Mr. Wilson, the statement there, we've got all the members of the press here.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
He can remember you've read that.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
And the Secretary has one of the most of the memory of that and things might have been handed out to the press.

23:02.000 --> 23:10.000
But it's now about 4, 5, 5, 15, we're trying to finish tonight.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
I know if there is right into the record, they two and a half-page statements.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
We just won't get through tonight.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
There's a statement.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Uh, something?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
In 1,000,000,000.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
I believe it was in 1,000,000,000.

23:26.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm sure, in an open hearing, before the Senate on Services Committee, I ask the Secretary of Defense.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
Did he, was here in the Committee, follow monitor and telephone call?

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
The record will bear that out.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
I never at any time have tried to hold on monitor call.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
The record will bear it in respect that I have it all time, tried to get the monitor call into the record.

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
It would have been impossible for Mr. Stevens to have testified to respect to the monitor call

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
because at the time he testified, they had not been put in the record.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
Now, I'll grace many statements, and in my humble opinion, this statement for the grace of the suspected situations.

24:14.000 --> 24:23.000
And certainly, one of two steps, if the chairman has an ounce of fairness anymore than this situation, I'm sure he has to be taken.

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
Either this statement should now be read into the record, or Mr. Stevens, and the other people that we have recommended

24:31.000 --> 24:39.000
can be called before the Committee and put under oath, just be called before this Committee and be put under oath for that we can get all the truth.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Mr. Chairman, is one final suggestion.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
No, no, no.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Is there any other one final suggestion?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
I have a meeting.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Does the government make this a guess with Senator Jefferson first?

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
I would suggest the same time as we mark this as an exhibit.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
If they first want to see it, let them see it.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
But as of now, Mr. Chairman,

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
I don't know what a Clark Crookers wrote since, and I'm as whom wrote it, and if it's to be read into the record as part of the testimony,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
it should be done under oaths.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
I have no objection to keeping anything secret that Bob Stevens wants to say.

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
I just don't like to make that part of the official record, to be marked as an exhibit.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That's going to have a period.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Bob, there's a lot of money to share.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
I don't want to hear what the Republican Secretary of the Army has to say.

25:28.000 --> 25:41.000
The chair is disturbed at the moment by this fact, and that is that he agrees that we find a way to determine which Secretary Stevens can make this decision clear.

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
This is just a different statement, perhaps has been given as an exhibit of record, with the being part of the hearings, the people can read it,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
a company by a threat statement might be a solution.

25:51.000 --> 26:00.000
I'm temporarily and presently disturbed by this fact, that at the very beginning of the hearings, I may resolution I think in this use by Senator Mitchell.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
It would say that all of the testimony in these hearings had been taken under oaths.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
We have operate on that basis.

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
Even though the point one time I recall calling Secretary Stevens up and asking him to recite under oaths,

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
a press statement that he had made previously during the fun of intellectual issues before the committee.

26:19.000 --> 26:27.000
Now, seeing it to me, we might be able to arrive at the thing we all want, that is to have Mr. Stevens have his first chance to make his statement.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
The chairman, by offering this exhibit, has been available to the press, and those are Mr. Chair Jarvis.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
Mr. Chairman, Chairman, may I share the document under the record?

26:37.000 --> 26:46.000
I didn't know that I was under a misreferential this morning about this statement, I thought it was going to be submitted and just included in the record.

26:46.000 --> 26:54.000
Now, of course, it's not a rule, it's not a definition. Mr. Stevens wouldn't be here and available for a cross-examination on such a statement.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
We have a slight aside here what's in it.

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
It does make a difference to me, but in the complete interest of fairness, I suggest a five-minute recess that council may confer with Mr. Wells.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
I think at least the committee council, thought to be advised on this statement.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
I shall be in our regard, you shall have your recommendation.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I'm Mr. Wells, and I do not.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
I don't wish to compete with the senator for the microphone.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
I beg your pardon, thank you. I'll resign, I'm Mr. Wells.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Mr. Wells, I'm sorry, I'll get to him, Mr. Wells.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
One senator for the seat, he's the one.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Mr. Wells, I'm the one.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
The fire is destroyed.

27:34.000 --> 27:42.000
In stating that I make the notion that I'll test the moon in this field, be taken or smooth.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
I think some of them will fight this situation this time.

27:47.000 --> 27:56.000
I'd rather go and move Mr. Wells, not Mr. Stevens, or the driver that come here and test the fire through the document.

27:56.000 --> 28:04.000
I know that a senator might have had an hour, but Chairman, I moved the way that motion on the table.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
We are observable, the motion is not smooth.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
We have the voice now, Mr. Stevens.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
Carl Fexer-Jose, he was the witness in cash and motion with the secretary.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
And we have a motion to lay that under table.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
The limit is the exact same.

28:21.000 --> 28:28.000
The motion is obviously not the made of bulletproof, the filament and the jam, or the chair for that.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Carl, I don't want to let you lay that motion on the table.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
I'm going to have a parliamentary inquiry and then I'll come again.

28:34.000 --> 28:40.000
The vote now is a vote for Carl Stevens, and I'm ready to burn over for the vote now.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
The vote not for Carl.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
He will correct this, the part of the situation where I'm interested in the vote now is not to lay it over.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
I lay that on the table, meeting the motion to call in as a witness will not be saved.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I'll be defeated as I go out.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
As I go out, I'll be defeated as I go out.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
All right, so, come to my car.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
No.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Send the text.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Turn the text.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
No.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Turn the text.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
No.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Turn the text.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
The chair goes down.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Turn the text.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
If you ever come up here and tell me this is only a way out of town, I'm very important.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Army business and I knew this morning the end of the goal.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
Knowing that, I ask the chair for the right to file and read this statement.

29:34.000 --> 29:41.000
The chair is not a very long one.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
It could have been a long goal.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
I think it is a certainty that should be extended to the Secretary of the Army.

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
But before the audience to deserve the testimony, this simple and reasonably short statement should be made.

29:54.000 --> 30:01.000
I don't understand the vote this morning and the Secretary of the President's statement before he left on this Army business.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I think I should be allowed to reach this.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
It's a work that's important.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
I don't have even the right to yield to you.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Go ahead.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I don't have the floor.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I don't have the floor.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
I don't have the floor.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
I don't have the floor.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
The floor is not a statement.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
The nature of a rebuttal is not a testimony.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
The principle of the service is to state what comes next.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
It's a very happy part of what was the report.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
I think it is not rebuttal.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
It was a long, passable responding with the senator selling this and that.

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
Here is a member of the government who has been secured and has now been assigned to this committee.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
It's a simple statement on that matter.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
The Secretary of the Army is not a testimony.

30:58.000 --> 31:05.000
The important thing is that the Secretary of the Army is taking his three-minute recess.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
I have comments to make a call at five o'clock in the morning.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
The Secretary of the Army is asking for the remaining.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
I'm asking for the Secretary of the Army.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
The Secretary of the Army is asking for the Secretary of the Army.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
We have a red now.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
We have a red now.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
We have a red now.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
We have a red now.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
We have a red now.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
We have a red now.
