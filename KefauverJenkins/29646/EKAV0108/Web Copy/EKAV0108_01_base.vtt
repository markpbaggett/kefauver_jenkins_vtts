WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we have a great treat in store for us today.

00:09.280 --> 00:13.560
This is the first time this has happened to me and I am very honored that we have with

00:13.560 --> 00:17.760
us one of America's great and fine citizens.

00:17.760 --> 00:23.720
Somebody that you all know or read about or admire, former and every weight champion of

00:23.720 --> 00:26.640
boxing champion of the world, Jack Dumpsey.

00:26.640 --> 00:27.640
Jack Goodesido.

00:27.640 --> 00:28.640
Thank you very much, Senator.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.640
I'm just a great privilege and I'm a great honor to be here with you today and thank

00:31.640 --> 00:32.640
you very much.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.640
Well, Jack Dumpsey is in Washington today.

00:35.640 --> 00:36.640
He's been autographing.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.640
Jack, I see your hands are pretty, thank you.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.640
Yes, I need a little bathroom, Senator.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.640
I'm a busy pen.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.640
Sports Illustrated has a special feature.

00:46.640 --> 00:53.640
The three greatest champions in ten sports and Jack Dumpsey, Shagrid Ray Robinson and

00:53.640 --> 00:58.640
Joe Lewis are the all time champions in the sport of boxing.

00:58.640 --> 01:04.560
Jack's been here autographing sports illustrators and also Jack I want to get a cut on this

01:04.560 --> 01:05.560
role.

01:05.560 --> 01:12.920
But Robert Consta Dyer wrote a great book, Dumpsey the Man.

01:12.920 --> 01:13.920
That's right.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.720
And you've been autographing a lot of books and so if we sell any on this program I want

01:17.720 --> 01:18.720
you to be sure and remember me.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.720
I certainly will, Senator.

01:19.720 --> 01:20.720
Thank you.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.720
How are you feeling, Senator?

01:21.720 --> 01:22.720
Very well, Senator.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
Thank you.

01:23.800 --> 01:28.280
I just got back from Honolulu, where I was out there for the armed forces and had a wonderful

01:28.280 --> 01:30.040
time and a wonderful trip.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.040
A lot of wonderful boys.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.720
I hope we made a lot of people happy because they certainly made me happy.

01:34.720 --> 01:41.280
Well, as you folks know, Jack Dumpsey is spending a lot of time doing charities traveling

01:41.280 --> 01:47.120
around the world, putting on showers without any compensation for the benefit of our men

01:47.120 --> 01:50.120
and the service who are serving abroad.

01:50.640 --> 01:54.240
I know they're always glad to say they showed out of pictures of former fights and then

01:54.240 --> 01:55.960
talk about fighting at these.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.600
Well, we had what they call a boxing clinic.

01:58.600 --> 02:03.240
I had a man named Al Warden, a sports head, who with me first I was introduced and he

02:03.240 --> 02:04.240
was introduced.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.840
But before all else we had pictures of some of the old fights and we had a picture of

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
this year's life.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.680
The picture lasts for about a month, 15 minutes and we talked about a month and we had

02:13.680 --> 02:16.520
about a month after the questions and answers.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.200
That's about three hours, three and a half hours to show.

02:20.200 --> 02:24.120
But Jack, how did you get this title of the man, a manastormowner?

02:24.120 --> 02:28.480
Well, that was given to me a senator but the late Damon Runyon, Damon saw me fighting

02:28.480 --> 02:33.440
Colorado while I was born and raised and when I came to New York in my 16, he called

02:33.440 --> 02:36.200
me the old manastormowner.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.200
So that's how I got this title.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
That's the title as far as you ever said.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
That's what I thought.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.200
That's what I thought.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
That's what I thought.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
That's what I thought.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.200
That's what I thought.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.200
That's what I thought.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
That's what I thought.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.440
Yes, my people, most of my people, my mother was born in Virginia.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.440
My father and less Virginia.

03:20.440 --> 03:25.600
And part of my family were in town in Tennessee and down Kentucky, down through

03:25.600 --> 03:26.600
there.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.960
And you and no about these Tennessee and Kentucky ham?

03:28.960 --> 03:31.480
I said, you do, I was more or less raised on this.

03:31.480 --> 03:37.320
Well, Jack, we were looking over your record here a little while ago and we found that

03:37.320 --> 03:39.320
you fought a lot of times down in Tennessee.

03:39.320 --> 03:45.400
I believe that back in 1918 you fought a Fred study at Memphis, Tennessee.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
Do you remember that?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
Yes, I remember very well.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.400
I boxed on that several times and had a wonderful time.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.440
We used to be a great sports center.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.440
And that's Cepher, W.O.D.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.680
And I just happened to think the name of the old promoter, that was Billy Hack, wonderful

03:58.680 --> 04:01.600
man, a great promoter and a lot of good fighters came around there.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.840
I was sure a lot of people in Memphis still remember him.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.840
Oh, they certainly do, I'm sure.

04:05.840 --> 04:12.360
And then shows you that in 1926 you had four opponents in Memphis and you knocked them

04:12.360 --> 04:14.360
all out in one mile.

04:14.360 --> 04:18.920
That was an exhibition to I remember that too, but they weren't too good.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.760
Well, Jack, where did you win the heavyweight title?

04:21.760 --> 04:27.960
I won the title from Jess Waller, July 4th, 1919 at Toledo, Ohio.

04:27.960 --> 04:32.760
And I remember that I was a high school student at Madisonville and those days that's a little

04:32.760 --> 04:35.280
town over in East Tennessee.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.840
Those days there wasn't any television, no radio.

04:38.840 --> 04:43.120
And all of us went down to the railroad station to get the return of the fight.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.080
That's all we could get around after round.

04:45.080 --> 04:49.280
And I remember when you won the heavyweight champion.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.680
What was that a rough fight?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.200
Well, it was a big thing for me.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.640
Of course, everyone who wants to be a fighter is a fighter.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.320
I had one ambition that's to be tied, but to win the title.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.160
Of course, that was my big day and big thrill.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.200
But after thinking over and looking back all these years, it wasn't a tough fight.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.200
It was an easy fight.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.200
I mean, not a fight.

05:06.200 --> 05:10.320
One of the easiest fights I ever had because it was one sided fight.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.520
Word was big and strong, but he was very slow.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.520
And it'd been all of the game for a couple years, but it made it a very easy fight for me.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.320
What were your hardest fights?

05:18.320 --> 05:19.320
You have a head.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.320
Well, I'd say Sharky.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.120
I should say Tommy twice because he'd like to be a fighter.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.120
Well, you know, Jack Sharky, you fought him a couple of times.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.120
Just one time, son.

05:27.120 --> 05:32.040
You know, I was up in New Hampshire and I saw Jack Sharky sometime back.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.640
I ran for the Democratic nomination up there a few years ago.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.640
You remember him?

05:35.640 --> 05:36.640
I ran across this fellow.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.640
He was a great flycaster.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.640
Yes, he does a good job.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.640
Very well on fellow.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.640
How about the FERPO fight?

05:40.640 --> 05:41.640
Was that a...

05:41.640 --> 05:42.640
That was an LR3.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.640
I was pumped up for the Argentinian.

05:43.640 --> 05:44.640
Yes, I was.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.640
What are you looking at, fights?

05:45.640 --> 05:46.640
I knew that.

05:46.640 --> 05:55.160
I thought I was fighting a fellow couldn't fight very much and so that up when you got

05:55.160 --> 05:56.880
not taught myself.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.760
After the first points, I didn't want that I was in a fighter-foot race.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.760
I knocked out of the ring and came back and, in my effect, I was out about one minute

06:04.760 --> 06:07.280
before the starting of the second round.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.440
I came too, I thought I'd been knocked out, but my manager, Mr. Kern, said I hadn't

06:11.440 --> 06:16.560
and I got lucky and fine knocked him out, but it was a great thrill and I was pretty lucky.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.080
So I remember he used to have a crouching style.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.080
He'd get right down the...

06:20.080 --> 06:21.560
Well, I said, I don't know.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.560
I know that.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
That's right.

06:23.560 --> 06:29.360
And then you held the championship for quite a long time, of course.

06:29.360 --> 06:34.960
And then I believe you lost it to Jean-Tunney and Philadelphia in 1926.

06:34.960 --> 06:35.960
That's right.

06:35.960 --> 06:36.960
Tony, a great fighter.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.560
Tony was a good fighter, so I'd read it.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.160
And then the next year you fought him out at Chicago.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.160
That's right.

06:43.160 --> 06:47.160
And then we were talking about that being the battle of the wrong count.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.160
That's right.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.160
That's exactly what it was.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.160
How did that count, Grew?

06:52.160 --> 06:53.160
Was that the...

06:53.160 --> 06:55.160
Well, it turned out pretty well for me.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.160
I'm fast, the count had very, very slow.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.560
But it wasn't that slow, very exactly.

06:59.560 --> 07:04.760
They passed this new law where a man is going an off-down, so he goes to a nuclear corner.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.760
They had what they called a knock-down timekeeper.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.360
Outside was to pick the count up as a man went down.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.760
The man inside was to put you in a nuclear corner.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.960
Then he'd come back and pick the count up and you were some of the man outside.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.960
Well, I made the first mistake, but I'd go back to the nuclear corner.

07:19.960 --> 07:24.800
And I think the referee made the second mistake, not picking up the new person with a man

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
outside.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.200
The second mistake got up to about eight and Tony had been roughly starved all over.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.200
But I've always contend it was a great break for Jack Dipsy.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.200
Why, Jack?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.200
You're a lot of people.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.200
Well, the reason I say that, a lot of my friends who started fight still think I wanted.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.200
As long as I keep them thanking that, I still say it was a great break for Jack Dipsy

07:41.200 --> 07:43.200
and a tough break for Gene Toney.

07:43.200 --> 07:47.200
Because you're still a champ in the minds of a lot of people and...

07:47.200 --> 07:48.200
Well, I'm not...

07:48.200 --> 07:50.400
I'm able to do you to go out and do something else that you want.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.400
I'm not...

07:51.400 --> 07:52.400
I'm not...

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
I'm not...

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
I'm not...

07:54.400 --> 07:56.000
I'm not going to send me a counter dot.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
In other words, they still remember that fight.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.800
And if I can keep them remembered that and have them thank the way they do, I'm very happy.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.800
You were talking about...

08:04.800 --> 08:07.800
You said something about Jack Kern's a little while ago.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
He was your manager?

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
Yes, sir.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
He was my manager.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
He was with me when I won the title.

08:11.800 --> 08:18.800
We had him before our Andy Trust and Monopoly subcommittee sometime back and he's still very spy.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.600
He said he had fought in Alaska back in the days of Jack London and those old days.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.200
He said who was that?

08:26.200 --> 08:27.200
Was his manager?

08:27.200 --> 08:30.000
I mean, was Jack Kern's manager?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yes, I think.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Was all of the wild boar, the wild boar, his name or wild boar?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yes.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Jack Kern is about it.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Well, I don't know exactly how he is.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.400
I think he's got to be up there because I'm 56 under and he's at least 1500 crony as I'd think,

08:44.400 --> 08:46.200
older than I am, so he must be a lot of...

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
And you're 66.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
You're 66, sir.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.200
You don't look more than 56.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.200
Thank you.

08:51.400 --> 08:56.600
Well, Jack, you've been following boxing all these years since that time.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.400
What do you think about present-day boxers as compared with the...

09:00.400 --> 09:04.800
...fucking the old days when you and Fr. Owen shark you?

09:04.800 --> 09:08.600
Well, Sunder, I certainly need to want to degrade anyone and make anyone look bad.

09:08.600 --> 09:13.000
I think the further back we go on the fight game, the more regular, the better champions,

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
better fighters.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
We have most days because they have more experience in background than the president's modern-day fighters have.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.400
I think the old-time fighters were better.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.400
Right, they have clubs back in the old days, so he should kept them better.

09:25.400 --> 09:30.200
Well, they thought more often, I think they were better seasoned than they had better craters.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.800
In other words, these fellows had long experienced background.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.600
I know what to do, which the modern fighters doesn't get that experience in background,

09:36.600 --> 09:38.600
the old time has gotten.

09:38.600 --> 09:43.600
And, well, who do you think is the best in the fight game today?

09:43.600 --> 09:47.400
Well, I, in the heavyweight division, I would still say Patterson,

09:47.400 --> 09:48.800
because he's still the champion.

09:48.800 --> 09:53.800
But as I said before, I don't think these fellows we have to be compared with the old-timers.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.400
Did you see the old Johansson Patterson fight?

09:57.400 --> 10:01.800
I saw the first two fights, but I didn't miss out, I didn't see the last one, Sunder.

10:01.800 --> 10:08.000
Well, the sunny list in this challenging Patterson, present time,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
how do you think that might come out as a fight?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.800
Well, I don't think Patterson takes a punch any too well,

10:12.800 --> 10:16.400
but at the same time he's a good boxer, he's globally moves wrong, good.

10:16.400 --> 10:22.200
I saw this in one fight and he looked very slow and very awkward with the time he fought to meet him.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.600
I think that was important, Martin, last winter.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.600
Now, if Matzin hits him, of course, he not Patterson up,

10:27.600 --> 10:30.600
but she got a hit on the man before he knocked him out.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.600
And neither of them take a look to the world.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.600
That's right, they won't take a punch too well.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.600
Jack, your own addition to doing all your charities

10:38.600 --> 10:42.600
and your work with the armed services you have a great, big, fine restaurant in New York.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
Sir, thank you for having me.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.600
Thank you, sir.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.600
One time I was there and you came in.

10:47.600 --> 10:52.600
But pretty soon we're going to have hearings about a boxing bill.

10:52.600 --> 10:59.600
We all know that fighting business has gotten in many places into the hands of the recordiers

10:59.600 --> 11:03.600
and improper people and has been degraded considerably.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.600
It's not been your experience here as well.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.600
Mr. Mayor, may I extend to you my congratulations and best wishes.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.600
I only wish we had a few more men who would stick up for the boxing game

11:12.600 --> 11:14.600
and put it back where it was in the old days.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.600
The fight game is just about on its way out.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.600
In other words, it's just ready to be buried if something's not done and done fast.

11:21.600 --> 11:28.600
And I've read you a book and I've read it before we do that for saving you about that.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.600
I think the American people want good clean boxing in the hands of good people and great people.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.600
Like Shesney do.

11:33.600 --> 11:38.600
They want to look up to the world champion and know that there is any funny stuff

11:38.600 --> 11:40.600
that's been going on in connection with that.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.600
I'm certainly going to have a funny, relaxing one, but if the fight game is saved

11:44.600 --> 11:46.600
it's got to be saved through the government.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.600
You must come in and set in and make these laws where we all know what they're all about.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
If we get out of the line, we're not going to play the game.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.600
In other words, you've got to play it on the level.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
We've got to have rules and regulations government,

11:56.600 --> 11:59.600
because these states cannot get together.

11:59.600 --> 12:05.600
Well, pretty soon we're going to have you down here with other great men of the boxing game,

12:05.600 --> 12:10.600
former champions, Jean, Tony and others, to testify in connection with us.

12:10.600 --> 12:16.600
1-4-7-4, which is for the purpose of cleaning out the recorders and the boxing game.

12:16.600 --> 12:21.600
And the managers, promoters and whatnot, so they're the fighters themselves

12:21.600 --> 12:24.600
and the American people can have confidence in it.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.600
You've been studying this matter, what you're feeling about it.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
Well, I think you're 100% right.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.600
I think there's many things to be talked about.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.600
I think there's many changes can be made for the betterment of boxing.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.600
But first, I think you're doing the right thing, but getting rid of undesirables

12:38.600 --> 12:41.600
who do not belong in the boxing game.

12:41.600 --> 12:46.600
Well, then, as you say, some states may have some regulations,

12:46.600 --> 12:51.600
some may have others, and if they have trouble in one state,

12:51.600 --> 12:54.600
they simply move on to another and have the fight failures.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.600
That's correct.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.600
I think we should have unified ruling on all these things,

12:59.600 --> 13:01.600
on a nice sort of boxing game.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.600
I said, whatever you want to call it, to see if these players stay in line.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.600
But that's the purpose of this bill, and you're going to support it.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.600
I certainly am 100%.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
Well, exactly. We have a few minutes left.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.600
Young people, young men, boys, all look up to you,

13:15.600 --> 13:18.600
and know that you're a great fighter, and that you're a fine man,

13:18.600 --> 13:23.600
and you're... what would be a few seconds of your advice to young people

13:23.600 --> 13:25.600
who want to build up their physique?

13:25.600 --> 13:26.600
Why don't you do a little boss?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.600
I wouldn't tell him to go in the fight game right now.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.600
But if they like fighting, in other words, do whatever you want to do.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.600
First, I think the most important thing, Senator, for all children today,

13:35.600 --> 13:37.600
is to get an education, a good background.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.600
If they do that, they'll go through life, which I didn't have,

13:40.600 --> 13:41.600
and I've always regretted.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.600
But I think an education is very important.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
Men live for the golden rule.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.600
Do one to others as you'd like to be done by, and if you do that,

13:48.600 --> 13:50.600
you'll get along fine.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.600
Well, other than mothers and mothers and your churches, you'll be fine.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.600
I wish we could go under this, because I know you have a lot of good advice

13:56.600 --> 14:00.600
to give the young people of the nation, but our time is up,

14:00.600 --> 14:02.600
and thank you very much, Chuck Dempsey.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.600
Thank you, Senator, for the reason it's very busy.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
Appreciate it tremendously.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.600
That's all for now. Thank you.
