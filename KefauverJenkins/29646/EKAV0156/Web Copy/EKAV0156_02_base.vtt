00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Mr. Chairman, the person who the way of knowing, Mr. Stephen is any of them.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
I understand the rule is that any of the assaults of Pentagon, they notify the Secretary.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
That's right, Secretary.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
When anyone is involved with Pentagon, is there not any rule that you or your council be notified?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
I don't doubt any, but you don't know anything true.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Well, let's get back to this.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
As I said, you talk with Mr. Adams first, and then look at the answer.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
As a matter of fact, I went back to the office, and then I went home, and I don't think that I saw anybody,

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
except some of my own staff on an afternoon news.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Now, when did your first discovery of the Secretary of the last time there was completely an error?

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
Well, everything, if you remember, your staff, you actually saw from 21 of the half-man on the Pentagon,

00:56.000 --> 01:05.000
including him, I considered that 17 out of the 21, the members of my staff.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
And how about the other four?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
The other four, I went from the Department of Defense.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
And if, and you were to, when you were just trying to remember your testimony, you said that you did not remember the 21-man meeting.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
I said that I, as I recall it, that I have met with the members of my staff, and that's what I did.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
Now, I spell it out for you in detail as to just what that's meant and who was there.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm just chairman, I think Secretary has been fully questioned with respect to that, and has given anxious willy.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
And it is my suggestion that council now proceed to other points of inquiry.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
What did you do to council, Mr. Henson, on the 21-man last night?

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
I reported to chairman, the candidate expired.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I have no further questions, but thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Chair, I have Mr. Henson in the comments.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I send this to my right.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
And I send this to my left.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I'll file a question.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Mr. Wilk, how far is it?

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
I don't know, Mr. Henson, does this mean that we know in the different stores, what's with you last night?

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
The first thing you discussed with Mr. Henson on the other 20-21, is...

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Yes.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
How much is this council?

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
The council's a committee of the council, the committee of the council, the committee of the council,

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
and they're asking for the next order, the judges, the president, who won when I saw it.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
The one who's the council, the committee of that rule, he's council's chair.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
How about your chairman, his name?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm chairman, secretary, willing to rule, that there should be no more questions about who will then,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
how many will there be the difference between the six and the other members of the council?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
What was that?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Well, I replied to my name, lunch and beer, and...

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
...and senator Henson and senator Henson, and senator Henson, and senator Henson, play.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Did you, that's...

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
...the rest, right now, and will the act, Mr. Henson's public vacation?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
In the case of that was the night.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
To be first heard any two plans against Mr. Cohn, against any of my staff.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Could you tell us who gave you men for me, was the discuss there that night?

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
If you're still referring to the meeting of members of my staff,

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
or four people from the Department of Defense, it was not discussed, not within the afternoon at four parties.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
And now, when Mr. Henson told us not to get further at 24, 1954,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
did I have any information with the party?

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
I mean, I've been having different colleagues with me, and I'm a party, Roy Cohn, etc.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
You said that he did not get that information, or you were a presence.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
That's correct.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
When would you tell us, Mr. Secretary, at some point, someone decided to issue a report,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
charging Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn, myself, and then proper conduct?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
When did that originate?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
When did that originate? Who originates?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
It's down, I don't understand that.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
You're saying you have a red red?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Did you understand, Mr. Secretary? I like how it red.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Roy, go read the questions, please.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
What, were you telling Mr. Secretary, at some point, someone decided to issue a report,

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
charging Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn, myself, and then proper conduct?

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
When did that originate? And who originates it?

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
Well, I testified, uh, a length, uh, on the McCarthy, that there had been many inquiries from the Congress in regard to this whole situation.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
And it has finally headed out on the receipt of Senator Potter's letter.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
And an answer was then made to Senator Potter and to all members of this committee,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
and other members of the Congress who had inquired about it.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
When, when did the, when was the report prepared?

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
So, what's the fair answer, Senator Potter, of the...

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
I think that the report, the so-called analogy, was prepared by Mr. Brown and Mr. Henry Hoffman,

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
along the, I say, starting about the, what's the significance mark somewhere in there that together?

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
The middle, that is the four report, Senator Potter, of the letter.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
That was before Senator Potter's letter.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
So, Mr. Cohn was not prepared as a result of Senator Potter's letter.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
It was prepared as the result of mounting inquiries from the Congress in regard to the matter of Senator Perry Cohn,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
who decided to prepare.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Who decided to prepare?

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know who decided to prepare, but I know that, uh, Mr. Hempel,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I got in touch with me and asked me to see Mr. Brown and discuss these matters with him,

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
and I did that, and I assume that, uh, Mr. Hempel was probably acting under orders of the Secretary of Defense.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't know.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Now, this, uh, this, uh, these charges were put out, uh, and titled,

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Army Judge, and the Department of Justice, uh, you were the Secretary,

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
you were the Secretary when they put out, obviously, the, uh,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
did, did you order them to put out?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
No, sir, I didn't order them to put out.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Well, I couldn't bring Mr. Secretary, sign that.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Cohn was responsible for the making public,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
trying to give Mr. Cohn, Mr. Time, myself.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
You must know that.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Senator, I've tried to cover it to the best of my ability.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Maybe it has been clear, I told you how the thing Evelivis,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
from the inquiries that we received from members of the Senate from the House,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
and it's Evelivis, a law on, and it finally came to its climax

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
out of its somewhere around about the time that Mr. Cohn,

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
probably saying the early part of March from somewhere around the fifth and fourth of fifth,

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
is that period I would say was when this chronology was seen compiled?

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Would you say that Mr. Hensel was telling the truth when he said that he first learned about this,

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
the report that it would be Evelivis, chairman, it's not a proper question.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And I think that's the truth, Mr. Cohn, that's the truth,

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
is a rat-cavinging, Mr. Hensel's bad.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
The fact that Evelivis, that point of our opinion, that's presently clear,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
was that he was always doing what finished my question,

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
and might be about it, yes, he was already in charge of the technical change

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
when he met Mr. Hensel's head.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
And he was just an enlightenment, Mr. Chairman's in paradise,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
to be sure to rule this out, and I will give this to him,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I'll read you for a feeling that this proper question,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
the first that I can speak to this person,

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
that's in the dirty, such very best.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Mr. Hensel, when you say work with us,

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
and preparing this, as filed specifications,

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
saying that the first time, this matter of the so-called Evelivis report,

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
came with attention with the night of the 21-man meeting.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
After U.S., the meeting with Senator Monk McClellum,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I mean, I'm sorry, but the election and the party.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
Is it correct that that is the first time that this matter was brought to Mr. Hensel's attention,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
as far as you know?

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I submit Mr. Chairman that perfectly drops it.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Every time we say it, now how does your first question,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
is the one thing you should ask?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I'll read it from the chapter.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, there was no mention of any such thing as the meeting.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
As I touched the rise, after the meeting was over,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
and I was wound up my duties, I went on home,

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
and I did not seem as careful again for I to take care of it.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
Partively, ten days apartively too late.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Would you try and answer the question, Mr. Secretary?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, the report are reading to the secretary.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You mean that I take from Mr. Hensel at night the answer is no?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
No, I just want you to answer the question, Mr. Secretary.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Will there be a way to read it from you?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
That's right, that's right.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I think so.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Is it correct that that is the first time that this matter was brought to Mr. Hensel's attention,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
as far as you know?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I'm not sure I got the right of even that.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I don't think there's water right there in the answer.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
But here we stay at the end of the question,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
and it's the very time in the end, and it's now at the end of the question.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
But it's not that we're staying at the end of the question.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay, other left.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
Mr. Secretary, we're referring now to the day of February 24.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
That's right.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You were told that the day you had the meeting with the Secretary,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and we had a five-dose.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
You were told that in the day that you met the 21 people from the Pentagon after you left the meeting.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
That's right.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
Now, the question is, is it correct that the insular fire,

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
you know either from your own personal knowledge or from your strength?

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
Is it correct that that was the first day that there was ever brought to Mr. Hensel's attention?

10:23.000 --> 10:31.000
The question, however the possibility of the issue and all they report,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
judging Mr. Kahn that the Department of the Cohn, Mr. Kahn, myself.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
Well, I hadn't heard anything about it, Senator, and I don't know when Mr. Hensel found out about it.

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
When did you first have any knowledge, or any discussion about this,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
the charges against Mr. Cohn and Mr. Kahn?

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, in the form of the so-called chronology, I would say that was about support to such a march,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
but Mr. Brown came properly.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
Mr. Secretary, you have stated a number of times that this originates,

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
and it is not using your strength.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Words with some of your strength at the time, if the fire wrote you a lot.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
It is not a fact that the report or the A-report

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
was in the hands of second newsmen before Mr. Potter wrote you the letter.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Mr. Kahn, part of that.

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
The record is quite a big show that Senator Potter did not write a letter to Secretary Stevens,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
but wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Spat.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
Therefore, some of his questions, his base upon the assumption that Spat's contrary of those evidence,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
have been solved.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
But Secretary, if the statement of letter was written to Secretary Stevens,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and you understand what letter I'm referring to,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
we've made a statement in specify a date of something that will make a statement.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Mr. Secretary, you understand what letter I'm referring to, don't you?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Is that time to Potter's letter?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yes.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
So that there's no deception caused for that question, would they?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
You understand what letter we're referring to?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
There's only one letter to Potter, what's the thing?

12:07.000 --> 12:07.000


12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
As far as I know, my question is this.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
The floor of Mr. Potter's front-right letter, is it...

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Uh, question.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yes.

12:15.000 --> 12:24.000
Is it not to rat the social report for quite some of it?

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
We're already in the hands of certain newsmen.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Well, I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, to McCarthy.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
I didn't have to report myself, and I have no way of knowing how to answer your question.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
I certainly have no contact with any newspaper about it at any time.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Did you have any knowledge?

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Any reason to believe that the report or price of it,

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
were handed to certain newsmen and the former Secretary of Potter wrote his letter?

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
I didn't know anything about that, kind of McCarthy.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I said, rumor about it, and mentioned here during the course of the hearings,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
but as far as I'm concerned, it's been rumored with me,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
and I've had no other no contact with any newspaper myself on.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
Now, I think it's a good mistake, I think we can shorten this point of the inquiry.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Just simple question.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Did you have any of the...

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It is a new question.

13:19.000 --> 13:26.000
Did you have any reasons to believe that certain parts of this report called events

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
have been released in any newsman or any newsman prior to Senator Potter's letter of inquiry

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
to the Department of Defense? Did you have any reason to believe that it is?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
How did it have been released in newsmen?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Well, I heard rumors about it that Mr. Gankin said,

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
I think that there were some indication of it somewhere in the press at some time.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Thank you, Rick. You knew that...

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
First of the report appeared in the press long before Mr. Potter wrote a letter,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
and that is one of the reasons why he wrote that letter.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Absolutely nothing to do with writing the letter.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
You said you heard rumors last week's report had been released.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Prior to the request of the senator,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
have you tried to run down those rumors?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Have you discussed them with Mr. Adams?

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Find out if all they were true or not?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Eyes crossed on Mr. Adams and others are about to hold situations.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Of course, but it's about these rumors.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Let's take a vote for now.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Did you talk to Mr. Adams about the rumors you heard

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
to the effects of the report?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Guaraging my staff of Mr. Tundra went to the press

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
or a section of the Winsor-Ferrick and Elements of the Press

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
before it came to Mr. Potter any other time.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
I think that by my sight, though, that Mr. Adams was the one that ought to testify on that time,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I honestly don't know what he did.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
I thought it was the best question Mr. Tundra's whether he was useful

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
or has taken any steps to run down rumors,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
and he didn't do anything to say no,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
and had dropped it.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Well, I thought, yes, I thought that, Mr. Adams.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
That was, yes.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Right within, and what's Mr. Adams said to you?

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
As I said, any part of any report that has been given out,

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
I got a question that Mr. Tundra may have talked with somebody in the press.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I don't know who.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Did you tell you who he talked to?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I don't recall.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
In other words, he told you he talked to somebody in the press about this report.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
My recollection is that he said that he had talked to somebody in the press,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
but he said that there was no.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Nothing is given out.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
And that's about all I know about it.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I think Mr. Adams can give you all the answers.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
Did he tell you that at least one member of the press

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
had helped him to spare the traitors?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
He did not.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Has he ever told you that?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
No, sir.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
And he told you that he had not given out any part of the report,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
so he had talked to certain members of the press about the report.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
The report, about a little bit.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Same for me, he told me that he talked to one member of the press.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Well, he talked any more and not, I don't know.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And send his time as expired.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
No further questions for the chairman.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Chair, if you're doing a few, the heel pass.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Send him a call.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Send his name, right?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Send him a call.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Send him a call.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
Mr. Secretary, I don't know why the UN have a position to answer this question or not.

16:28.000 --> 16:35.000
But you have knowledge that the release of this report was to be made to certain members

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
of the Congress, both in the House and the Senate,

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
and I believe both of them were not on this committee.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
You have knowledge that this report is irrespective of my letter.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
For us to be sent to those members of the Congress, yes, sir, I'm Senator.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You have that now, Dr..

16:56.000 --> 17:05.000
And you have, and I just may be reputators of the inquiry that just ensued you.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
You also have the...

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
You were a committee with a fact that, as I said before, it's open to six-rate assumptions

17:16.000 --> 17:24.000
that it was for us to be in written or as in written for several weeks prior to my letter.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
I think you've just about the fact that you have knowledge of that to a certain degree.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I don't know what to read.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Well, I'm a part of I was in the far east for several weeks,

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
that immediately pre-treating February 13th.

17:43.000 --> 17:53.000
But when you were fired on my letter, you had heard that certain newspaper articles

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
that the written concerning this so probable point.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
In a general way, after I heard rumors about it, I think I probably think something in the press

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
was referring to some reason.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Point.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Uh, that's all.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
The tender's in my letter.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Any further?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Yes, sir.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
No questions.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
The tender's a crack you have at the point.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yes.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yes, sir.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
The ball is a draw.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yes, we'll make a break.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Trapped all.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Medweg was고요 before I read the news,

18:37.000 --> 18:42.500
And then in one sentence, I'm writing into that introductory written defendment.

18:42.500 --> 18:46.000
I'm worried about theckweet, I need some information...

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
The new march until the mission network is bringing you through the facility,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
and it stops the military hearing.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
We pause now for a station identification.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
This is the new march television network.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
This is WADD, Channel 5, New York.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Fight.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Fight.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Fight.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Fight.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Fight.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Fight.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Fight.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Fight.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Fight.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Fight.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Fight.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Fight.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Fight.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Fight.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Fight.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Fight.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Fight.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Fight.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Go inside.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Man the same hasn't drawn to this.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I beg last to turn the fire on my same minister to introduce them.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Otherwise, I'll take Ignition.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Unlike a Master Act on this, and every drill is out for a certain number of percent of his work.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
In fact, it is.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Hunterасть?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I'd be glad to see you…

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Mar少ge ahead.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
остав with pleasure to finish the act.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Thanks cumMA.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
He had 9B on the wall after you had time lost.

19:37.000 --> 19:37.460
In 2000, US

19:37.480 --> 19:39.000
I representationed use left out in steakuity.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
I was revealed by Freedom and hummachine player,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
şeyben.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
interject.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.500
The only place for this report is thatSP Entely Toronto.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.760
In 2016 I took that DH level 1 in the reception needed to handle the special assigned

19:48.760 --> 19:49.760
more moves for him.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.760
That night.

19:50.760 --> 19:55.760
That's why I remember he mentioned that he had talked to one of the more and I don't know.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.760
Who was that one?

19:56.760 --> 19:57.760
I don't know that.

19:57.760 --> 19:58.760
So you turned it on there.

19:58.760 --> 20:04.760
You said you had these men along with you that I had to use memory.

20:04.760 --> 20:05.760
Doesn't serve you right.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.760
This is the practice of testifying when every call test has been required.

20:08.760 --> 20:12.760
Could you reflect your recollection now and find out who that is?

20:12.760 --> 20:14.760
I don't know who it is.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.760
And I don't think why I testifying on what's going on.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.760
He is in a position to testifying on and on and on.

20:20.760 --> 20:21.760
Not in a position.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.760
I asked you what the special he had with you.

20:24.760 --> 20:28.760
He said that he told you that he has given this information to one newsman.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.760
So you can't remember that newsman's name.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.760
No.

20:31.760 --> 20:35.760
I'm really asked to determine the Mr. Adams and the special recollection so that you will know that

20:35.760 --> 20:37.760
the newsman was, you can tell him.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.760
I think that it would be better to put him in a position where he's in a position that

20:40.760 --> 20:43.760
testsifying on another of his own knowledge.

20:43.760 --> 20:47.760
So what's the point of all here, so I would mean that it is this year's year.

20:47.760 --> 20:54.760
If this is the case, I think perhaps Senator McCruth is in fact the ass you have found

20:54.760 --> 20:59.760
from fur with the statum and to tell him the name of the newsman.

20:59.760 --> 21:04.760
Then, the statum talks with reference to these.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.760
His answer is a part of those who dance.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.760
I think that's all about it.

21:40.760 --> 21:46.760
Mr. Secretary of the night, rather than we were, we had the meetings,

21:46.760 --> 21:50.760
you and Senator Martin, the other 300.

21:50.760 --> 21:58.760
We have got these different abilities being called, the destruction of the order they work

21:58.760 --> 22:05.760
at the committee by the constant release of our owniest stories,

22:05.760 --> 22:10.760
but other stories from the Pentagon and then the party is now tired.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.760
The meetings are very tough.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.760
The meeting, the K-820, the K-820.

22:16.760 --> 22:23.760
And at that time did you not agree that you were, during your trip to stop these unofficial

22:23.760 --> 22:30.760
leaks, reflecting upon the committee and that any release of would be a special release

22:30.760 --> 22:34.760
that you yourself approved?

22:34.760 --> 22:38.760
Well, neither I don't recall after taking a conversation with a civilian line with my policy

22:38.760 --> 22:41.760
because I do everything I can to prevent the attack.

22:41.760 --> 22:51.760
Well, now you return to the Pentagon that night and after this meeting or what was going on,

22:51.760 --> 22:57.760
there was release to the press, the statements that you would have made,

22:57.760 --> 22:59.760
had you not made the agreement with us.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.760
Can you tell us who released that statement?

23:02.760 --> 23:04.760
What's the statement about?

23:04.760 --> 23:06.760
Don't you recall?

23:06.760 --> 23:09.760
Night of the 24th, Mr. Chairman.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.760
Something has been mentioned.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.760
I regret that I have to interpose so many objections, but the question,

23:14.760 --> 23:18.760
please suppose, is the fact that a release is made on the night of the 24th,

23:18.760 --> 23:24.760
has to get to the senator first, has to detect whether or not such a release was made.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.760
As I recall, there is no proof whatever that such a release was made.

23:30.760 --> 23:40.760
I think the point is well made, I assume that the secretary knew all about that,

23:40.760 --> 23:42.760
and we have to cut down the time.

23:42.760 --> 23:49.760
Mr. Secretary, the night of the 24th was very release to the press, the statement,

23:49.760 --> 23:53.760
which you had planned on making.

23:53.760 --> 23:58.760
Has you not made the agreement with Senator Monk, myself, Berkson Posh?

23:58.760 --> 24:04.760
The fact is that I have worked at a fairly yesterday, no, would you?

24:04.760 --> 24:09.760
Well, I think the witnesses in title did express the fact.

24:09.760 --> 24:14.760
I hope that they will include a yes or no, going to question him that he might want to give some explanation.

24:14.760 --> 24:18.760
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I think the witness should be possible.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.760
First, tell us yesterday, no, then go ahead and explain the yes or no answer.

24:22.760 --> 24:27.760
Is it possible for the secretary to present his remarks with the yes or no answer?

24:27.760 --> 24:29.760
In the distance, I answered that yes.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.760
I think it's very difficult to do, who cares, to share it with the side of the product.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.760
There's no one in the shift if you can't do it.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.760
What I want to know, whether you wish it was, whether you didn't wish it was,

24:38.760 --> 24:40.760
and you can say yes or no more.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.760
And I'll say yes, but, yes.

24:42.760 --> 24:47.760
The fact of these, when the General's swaker case came up,

24:47.760 --> 24:52.760
it involved the abuse by the son of the McCarthy of an army general,

24:52.760 --> 24:55.760
and the violent exception for it.

24:55.760 --> 25:02.760
And I ordered General Flicker not to appear at a hearing of this committee,

25:02.760 --> 25:06.760
which was going to take place at Ten of Box, the following Tuesday morning,

25:06.760 --> 25:10.760
as they answered Washington First.

25:10.760 --> 25:16.760
Senator Cuff, the McCarthy informed me that I would appear, which was okay with me.

25:16.760 --> 25:22.760
In the meanwhile, I went to work to prepare a statement that I would use when I came before this committee,

25:22.760 --> 25:25.760
getting all the facts in the flicker case,

25:25.760 --> 25:30.760
and stating why I had instructed a nut to appear at that one hearing,

25:30.760 --> 25:35.760
because I felt that he had been abused on the 18th of February.

25:35.760 --> 25:42.760
Now, that statement was just about complete at the time that we had the lunch.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.760
The Senator Month has referred to.

25:45.760 --> 25:50.760
And when I went home that night, some of my friends came in.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.760
We had the statement there. We looked it over.

25:53.760 --> 25:58.760
I remember that Arthur Hadley was there, a newsweek,

25:58.760 --> 26:03.760
and there was a video of California, and I think that Mr. Hadley,

26:03.760 --> 26:07.760
that the violence himself, I think that he called somebody,

26:07.760 --> 26:12.760
and I don't even know who it was, and read him about street paragraph,

26:12.760 --> 26:15.760
how did that statement, which was the statement as I recall it,

26:15.760 --> 26:19.760
of some 1012 pages that I prepared to use the security.

26:19.760 --> 26:23.760
And there may have been other telephone calls, may have been by Mr. Hadley,

26:23.760 --> 26:27.760
or maybe other friends that were in there that season, that evening.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.760
As far as I'm concerned, I didn't give out any statement myself,

26:30.760 --> 26:33.760
but those are the facts dealing with that situation,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.760
and I hope that you understand, particularly,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.760
you're putting a yes or no answer on it,

26:37.760 --> 26:40.760
but I did put the yes and then ask for the rightful complaint.

26:40.760 --> 26:44.760
We have a complaint to the fact that the portion of the statement is not right.

26:44.760 --> 26:48.760
I think about street paragraph, very well, and I'm going to ask.

26:48.760 --> 26:57.760
Were there any newsmen or columnists at the meeting of the 21?

26:57.760 --> 27:02.760
I think it's fine, but I think it's the meeting of the 21 on the 24th of February.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.760
Were there any newsmen or questions?

27:04.760 --> 27:05.760
No, sure.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.760
You're sure of that?

27:06.760 --> 27:08.760
Yes.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.760
Do you have a diary or anything in your office that you can tell to his presence?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.760
I read just a list of names, it was first.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.760
I've already put that in a testimony.

27:17.760 --> 27:22.760
First is, do you have a diary or anything in your office showing who was present?

27:22.760 --> 27:25.760
Yes, I've gotten the information from the records in the office.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.760
That's how I can tell you exactly who the 21 people were.

27:28.760 --> 27:31.760
So you've got no trouble at all being sure that you're accurate about that?

27:31.760 --> 27:32.760
That's right.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.760
I'm going to ask you to do this, Mr. Stephen.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.760
If you will, he's the last newsman.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.760
You know you can sometimes have someone check that diary again.

27:41.760 --> 27:48.760
And if you want to advise a testimony any further, I think you should be entitled to do that before it goes to the Justice Department.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.760
I go, but let's check it again.

27:50.760 --> 27:51.760
Yes.

27:51.760 --> 27:57.760
Now, Mr. Assume, I have not ran and going into the matter of liquor.

27:57.760 --> 28:04.760
However, the secretary has stated a number of times that what his liquor was abused

28:04.760 --> 28:09.760
at the statement that I can not very well look now for some challenge.

28:09.760 --> 28:12.760
Apparently he claims that liquor is innocent as well.

28:12.760 --> 28:18.760
The chair would suggest that he has something to pay in response to that, that when he redoes the stand,

28:18.760 --> 28:24.760
and makes his preliminary statement, he's very cute, or under interrogation of his own counsel,

28:24.760 --> 28:30.760
which will be available to him, if he says to answer that, because we take this by the secretary, that would be quite...

28:30.760 --> 28:34.760
Mr. Chairman, the secretary has made.

28:34.760 --> 28:37.760
A statement here, I think I should have the right to trust the family.

28:37.760 --> 28:44.760
I'm not the reason I am one of the informed the chair of this, is because I normally would not feel this is a proper proceeding.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.760
We have a testimony of Mr. liquor here.

28:47.760 --> 28:51.760
Mr. liquor's case played a fairly important part in the...

28:51.760 --> 28:58.760
As a general, and the course of the events which culminated in the tragedy of being made against Mr. Cohen,

28:58.760 --> 29:01.760
I would like to ask him a few questions, if he was brief as we can.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.760
Did you get an after-day of Mr. liquor?

29:03.760 --> 29:06.760
Mr. Chairman, may I say something?

29:06.760 --> 29:15.760
I regret very much that all parties who are testifying, all parties who are questioning are sometimes the time,

29:15.760 --> 29:24.760
making gratuitous statements, which constitute charges of fraud, of unfearned and of abuse,

29:24.760 --> 29:28.760
and which are in no wise responsive to the questions asked.

29:28.760 --> 29:40.760
I observed in the secretary's answer to Senator McCarthy's question, and I appreciate the fact that the secretary undoubtedly is exhausted physically and mentally,

29:40.760 --> 29:45.760
that he made a statement which was in no wise responsive to the question asked,

29:45.760 --> 29:49.760
Senator McCarthy had abused General liquor.

29:49.760 --> 29:57.760
How that is a charge? Perhaps the charge other charges have been made here, which are more serious.

29:57.760 --> 30:02.760
And I force all trouble at the time that statement was made.

30:02.760 --> 30:09.760
And it feels the fact that Senator McCarthy has been accused of abusing General liquor.

30:09.760 --> 30:17.760
It may be that the senator is entitled to certainly to some extent go into the fact that...

30:17.760 --> 30:21.760
How that question resolves the whether or not he did abuse General liquor.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.760
May I make this suggestion?

30:25.760 --> 30:32.760
That's a secretary, omittedly, so retracts that statement about abuse.

30:32.760 --> 30:38.760
Perhaps that will avoid just going into the question of whether or not such a thing did occur.

30:38.760 --> 30:45.760
I appreciate the fact that he's already gone out over the radio and television and all that sort of thing.

30:45.760 --> 30:57.760
But that is just what is occurring here and that is in my mind the principal thing that's unlicious there if prolonging these areas.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.760
Am I right or am I not, Chairman?

31:00.760 --> 31:06.760
I think the council is tremendously right. I was a little bit worried when I heard that word of abuse.

31:06.760 --> 31:11.760
I know that involved a nutther and a totally different controversy.

31:11.760 --> 31:16.760
I've been running on between certain elements in the army, certain elements in our domain,

31:16.760 --> 31:23.760
but the shared values both began to keep these areas to the particular issues and controversy.

31:23.760 --> 31:27.760
Recognize the mayor of the council's death.

31:27.760 --> 31:34.760
The charge is made, the senator abused, the general's liquor.

31:34.760 --> 31:39.760
The nutther is offended and the president wanted to interrogate him above the charge.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.760
I don't know if the secretary is.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.760
I'm sure that the union intended this charge at this time.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.760
We have stated that many other places and many other times.

31:48.760 --> 31:51.760
The president knows your position under general's influence.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.760
I think he knows the president of my car.

31:54.760 --> 32:01.760
I wonder if it would be effective for the purposes of this record if we would just agree among our things.

32:04.760 --> 32:05.760
Thank you.
