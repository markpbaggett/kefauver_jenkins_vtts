WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.540
owski being said that the

00:05.540 --> 00:29.600
The

00:29.600 --> 00:50.340
governor

01:29.600 --> 01:41.900
coming

01:41.900 --> 01:53.540
to

01:53.540 --> 02:16.760
coding

02:46.760 --> 02:51.160
that's any time by any member of the audience and at the

02:51.160 --> 02:56.040
officers in the audience have been instructed to politely escort from the room

02:56.040 --> 03:01.440
immediately anybody violating that family's committee rule.

03:01.440 --> 03:05.180
The chair has been advised by a kind of a timing interview I'd like to make a

03:05.180 --> 03:10.360
trust statement that's the time I've been there.

03:10.360 --> 03:16.040
I am a senior college, I'm a counselor and I'm a counselor for any states

03:16.040 --> 03:21.440
and so I may not like to make a parliamentary inquiry.

03:21.440 --> 03:26.840
As this committee has ordered a transcript of it

03:26.840 --> 03:31.720
proceeding from the course of these hearings submitted to the department of

03:31.720 --> 03:35.480
justice for its consideration and effectiveness.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.640
As I have already indicated not although it is beginning and the

03:38.640 --> 03:42.480
interview is enough for the transcripts with the transcripts.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.480
The chair among our now moved that a panel of

03:46.480 --> 03:51.320
special transcripts of all of the proceedings of this hearing to say

03:51.320 --> 03:55.480
be immediately transmitted to the Department of Justice for

03:55.480 --> 04:03.480
such a pension and consideration as it may merit and that future testimony

04:03.480 --> 04:09.640
the transcripts there are all be immediately transmitted to the

04:09.640 --> 04:17.480
department of justice for the same purpose as rapidly as the transcripts become available.

04:17.480 --> 04:22.960
As that seems the motion will be approved in front of the committee policy

04:22.960 --> 04:26.760
which is what if you will add the Department of Justice to the mailing list that

04:26.760 --> 04:30.960
receives the transcripts easing or morning whenever it's mailed but I will take care of that.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.960
Can you send me any one there if you can say when am I right?

04:33.960 --> 04:35.960
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

04:35.960 --> 04:41.080
Mr. Chairman, previous information I presented in these hearings about the

04:41.080 --> 04:46.240
membership of the Intelligence Advisory Committee to the National Security Council

04:46.240 --> 04:51.960
was incorrect and there have been some changes since I left that council.

04:51.960 --> 04:57.960
The Intelligence Advisory Committee is chaired by the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

04:57.960 --> 05:03.960
This membership includes the Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for Intelligence,

05:03.960 --> 05:07.960
the Deputy Director of Intelligence of the Atomic Energy Commission,

05:07.960 --> 05:12.960
the Deputy Director for Intelligence of the Joint Staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

05:12.960 --> 05:16.960
the Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations,

05:16.960 --> 05:21.960
the Head of G2 of the Army, the Director of Naval Intelligence,

05:21.960 --> 05:25.960
and the Director of Intelligence of the Air Force.

05:25.960 --> 05:30.960
In the Title V, United States Code Section 16 raises follows.

05:30.960 --> 05:39.960
Whenever any person is elected or appointed to any Office of Honor or trust under the government of the United States,

05:39.960 --> 05:45.960
he shall before entering upon the duties of his office taken to describe the following rules.

05:45.960 --> 05:53.960
I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States

05:53.960 --> 06:00.960
to all and in foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the thing

06:00.960 --> 06:06.960
that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservations or purpose of evading

06:06.960 --> 06:14.960
and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the Office on which I am about to enter.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.960
So help me, God.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.960
According to testimony presented at this committee yesterday, the Office of Informant

06:22.960 --> 06:28.960
who gave this obviously fraudulent letter to a guilty of sending secret information

06:28.960 --> 06:36.960
to somebody not authorized to receive it, and in so doing, disobey the orders of his superior.

06:36.960 --> 06:42.960
In view of the testimony, Mr. Chairman, I do hope that every effort will be made

06:42.960 --> 06:51.960
to find out who was the informant, but at least it is important to be knowledge on the part of the eight government agencies

06:51.960 --> 07:00.960
who sit on the intelligence advisory committee that they may now have in their midst someone who is willing

07:00.960 --> 07:07.960
for whatever reason he considers proper to distribute secret information to unauthorized people.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.960
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.960
And is there any one of these very good questions that you have to ask?

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
Yes, I would, Mr. Chairman.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.960
Number one, Mr. Chairman.

07:17.960 --> 07:21.960
Number one, Mr. Timon, to know that he may have a false statement just now,

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
because this was a fraudulent letter.

07:23.960 --> 07:28.960
Judge, your group is at all parts of it, but identical to the program memorandum,

07:28.960 --> 07:33.960
with the exception of the deletion of the security matter, so Mr. Timon makes the statement

07:33.960 --> 07:37.960
to use deliberate play-attemptings to please these people.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.960
I may say, Mr. Chairman, when Mr. Timon's been dragged to the left for committee,

07:42.960 --> 07:46.960
I thought for a while it was a loss, when they came back on I thought it was a game.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.960
I discovered now that Mr. Timon's been returned to the committee,

07:49.960 --> 07:55.960
that he's been funding their time trying to obstruct any attempt to decommunise other government.

07:55.960 --> 08:00.960
Why I don't know, I think it was just an entirely directed issue, Mark, to the...

08:00.960 --> 08:05.960
No, I think it was just an attempt to decate my baddest determinants, because there's a term in my word,

08:05.960 --> 08:09.960
and then there's time in which they fall statement, I think I'm entitled to,

08:09.960 --> 08:14.960
the early reasons for it, care-refinite, and it's time I've got to take it.

08:14.960 --> 08:20.960
And I say that this is part Mr. Timon's part of a sequence of efforts from the private ministry

08:20.960 --> 08:25.960
signing in with the director, those tough committees, everything that came back on,

08:25.960 --> 08:29.960
and they came back, I welcome them, I thought they would work with it,

08:29.960 --> 08:32.960
and still have that time that they are doing everything possible

08:32.960 --> 08:36.960
to keep that committee from functioning and taking out comments.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.960
Listen, examples of the signings of this morning, there's just another example.

08:40.960 --> 08:45.960
He is interested in the comments that Mr. Timon mentioned, and it's not enough to read it,

08:45.960 --> 08:51.960
but he's interested in fine-tying to finish the individual that's there to give us information

08:51.960 --> 08:54.960
about espionage and the secret radar laboratory.

08:54.960 --> 08:59.960
Now, with the term of the signings and the fire science and serenity,

08:59.960 --> 09:06.960
any of the oil people who have been exposing them will not be subject to this place of blame.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.960
He will not get there now.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.960
Now, with the other, the different inter-billion care-refinite, again,

09:14.960 --> 09:18.960
that's quite tough, and when we get into the preliminary discussions,

09:18.960 --> 09:22.960
it's not as much as it's for expediting the agreement and it's kind of a delay thing

09:22.960 --> 09:25.960
but Mr. Chair, I can take that and ask him, and I might say,

09:25.960 --> 09:29.960
the amount of time that I've taken for this committee,

09:29.960 --> 09:36.960
in the 11 days, the Secretary of the Evening has been on the stand, has been very, very little.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.960
I did not want it this time to get into any discussion,

09:40.960 --> 09:45.960
but it turned out from what's possible as to whether my record

09:45.960 --> 09:50.960
in attempting to build thought-ins against communist advancement,

09:50.960 --> 09:53.960
issues or its a period ahead.

09:53.960 --> 10:00.960
I would like to note that he got this letter many weeks before I left the committee.

10:00.960 --> 10:05.960
I never saw it until the hearing started.

10:05.960 --> 10:10.960
I would like to say a little note, however, that I believe I'm justified

10:10.960 --> 10:13.960
and saying that this letter is for you.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.960
Its content may be accurate.

10:16.960 --> 10:21.960
I did not read it because I was advised that it would be wrong to read it

10:21.960 --> 10:25.960
from the standpoint of my position in the law of the country,

10:25.960 --> 10:30.960
but I did note in the letter that whereas the undocumented Hoover

10:30.960 --> 10:32.960
has said he said,

10:32.960 --> 10:36.960
said, problems for two general bowings,

10:36.960 --> 10:41.960
problems for today as the Hoover, this broken letter starts off

10:41.960 --> 10:46.960
dear, general bowings, and it's time presumably,

10:46.960 --> 10:49.960
sincerely yours, Jay, and the Hoover.

10:49.960 --> 10:53.960
I do not question whether the facts are right or wrong

10:53.960 --> 10:57.960
with respect to the summaries of the fraudulent letter,

10:57.960 --> 11:01.960
but I do say that whoever puts those facts in

11:01.960 --> 11:04.960
made up a letter when he himself was fraudulent because the

11:04.960 --> 11:10.960
salutation and the final words in the letter were never written by Mr. Jay and Hoover.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.960
I thank the chair.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.960
Chair, help us again.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.960
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,

11:16.960 --> 11:18.960
I know you have your right.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.960
Three people are trying to affect the year of the nation of the chair.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.960
He hears them all, but he can recognize them one at a time.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.960
I think the recognize Council President.

11:26.960 --> 11:31.960
Chairman, I advise the chair to permit no further discussion with respect to that letter.

11:31.960 --> 11:35.960
This group has thoroughly exploited the facts,

11:35.960 --> 11:39.960
hardies here, two in interest, have thoroughly expressed themselves.

11:39.960 --> 11:44.960
I think any further discussions, any further charges, counters, charges,

11:44.960 --> 11:46.960
constitutes a waste of time.

11:46.960 --> 11:51.960
It is my suggestion that the chair now orders the proof to continue in this.

11:51.960 --> 11:56.960
Chair, I'd like to do that, and let's turn the action in his name.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.960
Mr. Chairman, I thank you.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.960
Mr. Chair, I think the President will be sufficiently fair to date Mr. Chairman.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.960
I think it's high time that the chair and get on the track.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.960
We've been sidetracked for a long time.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.960
I'm not surprised by the statement from the Senator of the West Side.

12:12.960 --> 12:18.960
Now, that's an old stock and trade, and you can expect that all to be hearing.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.960
But I think it's high time we get back on the track.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.960
And so let us get down to business.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.960
I'm not disturbed by statements that he may make.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.960
He made a lot of money in a 1952 campaign,

12:29.960 --> 12:33.960
and that blow all the American people against Senator Simon to my cell,

12:33.960 --> 12:35.960
and the people who were treated.

12:35.960 --> 12:40.960
The chair suggests that we get on, and everybody now has had a chance to be heard.

12:40.960 --> 12:46.960
Mr. Secretary, may the chair inquire you before we begin.

12:46.960 --> 12:52.960
You had a day's dress yesterday, which the chair was happy to have you have,

12:52.960 --> 12:58.960
and before beginning this morning, we'd like to inquire whether you feel now that you would like to continue,

12:58.960 --> 13:05.960
or whether if you prefer to get more rest and step aside and have the chair follow someone else in the army space.

13:05.960 --> 13:14.960
The committee would like to ensure that you are refreshed and feel ready and able to check.

13:16.960 --> 13:24.960
I say, oh, Mr. Chairman, that I should please, but for the committee, I carry on to the best of my ability first.

13:24.960 --> 13:29.960
Well, as the chair stated, we recognize this is the teaching work,

13:29.960 --> 13:35.960
and if you, or council will advise the chair, or any members of the committee,

13:35.960 --> 13:40.960
any time, if you feel that you would like a day or two days away from the stand,

13:40.960 --> 13:44.960
there are other army witnesses to be called, the chair of the director of the committee, too.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
Now, you have had this update.

13:46.960 --> 13:51.960
One day, three from that unhappy spot, and the happy shadow is blowing.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.960
I would remind the chair that I was on, and what the stand was today.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.960
Very very sweet, my friend.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.960
Yes, but I was on.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.960
Yes, and it was really nine parties,

14:02.960 --> 14:05.960
and he was also doing a contingent this morning.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.960
It was a great, if not, it was just satisfying some other members of the year's final date

14:10.960 --> 14:13.960
to relieve you for a while.

14:13.960 --> 14:19.960
Well, I'm a subject today, but many were going to give that matter consideration on their own motion,

14:19.960 --> 14:24.960
and I'm supporting the credit for it, abide by any contingent.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.960
We will have a, we will have a, we will have a current situation this morning,

14:28.960 --> 14:33.960
and the chair says, get to the new hour, build a concrete, and the future is good night,

14:33.960 --> 14:38.960
have the afternoon off, I'm sure the committee will have to do the time.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.960
If the Jenkins have you any better statements, make a speech.

14:42.960 --> 14:47.960
But then it's probably a nice, nice to make a corner border and more of information

14:47.960 --> 14:50.960
to the members of the committee.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.960
Now, we've been, this is a fact of week, I believe,

14:53.960 --> 14:56.960
and it's a conclusion, it's a second week of the period.

14:56.960 --> 15:01.960
It is, we're no closer to term-making in the period today,

15:01.960 --> 15:06.960
and we're a week, it's still the proportions of the expression of the whole period.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.960
Now, I'd like to emphasize, remember the late, of the committee.

15:11.960 --> 15:15.960
That's a thing that also has other work, but to divide it,

15:15.960 --> 15:19.960
I'm fortunate to, to the members of the committee, and I'm thinking of,

15:19.960 --> 15:23.960
it's been myself, we have on, on the floor of the Senate,

15:23.960 --> 15:27.960
the half party act, which many amendments are being considered,

15:27.960 --> 15:30.960
or we die as one of the members of the Senate, by the way,

15:30.960 --> 15:31.960
is to the end.

15:31.960 --> 15:36.960
I'm going to have to, I want to, to participate in the debate,

15:36.960 --> 15:40.960
on that, on the amendments to the half party act.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.960
You know that I have to do that, all the time,

15:43.960 --> 15:46.960
to represent the people of my faith.

15:46.960 --> 15:50.960
So I, I wish to, I wish to, together, to the chair,

15:50.960 --> 15:52.960
and to, remember the committee.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.960
That has to, has to want to be prolonged for a week,

15:56.960 --> 15:59.960
and to month, that the member will have to meet.

15:59.960 --> 16:04.960
You allow the members of the committee to take care of other essential,

16:04.960 --> 16:13.960
and, um, become, I say that every effort should be made to bring the interiors

16:13.960 --> 16:18.960
to a conclusion, a particular bottle, to get on with more important work.

16:18.960 --> 16:22.960
Now, the chair, I say, simply, as we try and value the,

16:22.960 --> 16:26.960
I think, as we go, with the object of the suspension,

16:26.960 --> 16:29.960
we bring all parties around the table to see whether the president's

16:29.960 --> 16:33.960
or the president's revocation, we can shorten the hearings by some equitable

16:33.960 --> 16:34.960
procedures.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.960
Uh, the chair, Senator, he could try again, and he's not many members of the committee,

16:38.960 --> 16:42.960
so if you have a formula, it's just, which I might remind council

16:42.960 --> 16:46.960
of the motion unanimously adopted while, if they never found the sentence,

16:46.960 --> 16:50.960
which council to continue to explore, with council for all sides,

16:50.960 --> 16:54.960
the evolution of a formula for expediting hearings,

16:54.960 --> 16:56.960
and I'm sure that council will have heard of it,

16:56.960 --> 16:59.960
and I'm sure that we have heard of it, but every opportunity to do so.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.960
Um, Mr. Stevens, the chair has no questions,

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
Senator McIntyre, no questions, can you get,

17:05.960 --> 17:08.960
you know, any of the centers that I write?

17:08.960 --> 17:13.960
I'm Mr. Chairman, but I might, I'm very pleased to comment on two items.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.960
I've seen a reason why you didn't, because everybody else,

17:16.960 --> 17:20.960
had this morning's a microphone, or two viewers,

17:20.960 --> 17:24.960
or very very, the first one is,

17:24.960 --> 17:28.960
in a telephone conversation this morning,

17:28.960 --> 17:33.960
with Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, director of the S.D.I.,

17:33.960 --> 17:38.960
he authorized me to make the following statement,

17:38.960 --> 17:45.960
quote, in the conversation with Mr. Hoover from time to time,

17:45.960 --> 17:50.960
since I have been an author, he has commented in the highest burns

17:50.960 --> 17:57.960
on the co-operation between his author and the G2 intelligence division of the Army.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.960
That is the end of the quotation.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.960
At this time, I would like to make a correction,

18:08.960 --> 18:14.960
within my testimony, appearing on page 1458 of the record.

18:14.960 --> 18:19.960
At that point, speaking of a conference in my office

18:19.960 --> 18:23.960
on February 24, I stated, quote,

18:23.960 --> 18:29.960
I don't think that I saw anybody except some of my staff on that afternoon,

18:29.960 --> 18:34.960
after I got back from the meeting, from this meeting, unquote.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.960
I expect the record, and first my memory,

18:38.960 --> 18:42.960
and I find that I got back to my office about 3.30,

18:42.960 --> 18:45.960
but I saw the press for about 10 minutes,

18:45.960 --> 18:51.960
the commission for taking, and at 4.30, I met with a group in my office.

18:51.960 --> 18:56.960
I now have a list of the people invited by my staff to be present.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.960
I made a report to them of what has happened at that luncheon.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.960
A list of those presents is a follow-up.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.960
It's a list of 21 names.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.960
Let's check.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.960
I've got the luncheon list.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.960
We've been very now with the luncheon list,

19:10.960 --> 19:13.960
but remember that in the luncheon, that's what I think.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.960
Do you believe in your own means of this?

19:15.960 --> 19:17.960
Yes, I'm glad to read.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.960
Secretary, do you know what I mean?

19:19.960 --> 19:21.960
Do you believe in your case?

19:21.960 --> 19:25.960
No, I think that I like to read the list.

19:25.960 --> 19:32.960
Secretary Cives, Secretary Milton, Secretary Rotterick, Mr. Hensfield,

19:32.960 --> 19:38.960
Mr. Adams, General Ridge Ray, General Wibble, General Lemnister,

19:38.960 --> 19:42.960
General Becker, General Young, General Chudero,

19:42.960 --> 19:49.960
General Adelman, General Palmer, General Muget, Colonel Houth, Mr. Canes,

19:49.960 --> 19:56.960
Mr. Larbus, Mr. Martin, Secretary C. Colonel Beliu, Colonel Delano.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.960
Is that the proof you gave me?

20:00.960 --> 20:01.960
Yes, I think so.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.960
Any defenders, my last question?

20:03.960 --> 20:04.960
No questions.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.960
Mr. Welch, none.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.960
Senator Macrazio, Mr. Holt.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.960
Mr. President, there are the rest of the county

20:12.960 --> 20:14.960
that's the only country in the country I'm going to give

20:14.960 --> 20:16.960
on my third, is that right?

20:16.960 --> 20:18.960
Our last Monday.

20:18.960 --> 20:19.960
Yes, that's right.

20:19.960 --> 20:24.960
Now you're learning about last night and this morning,

20:24.960 --> 20:28.960
there are two witnesses in executive sessions

20:28.960 --> 20:30.960
who testify that you were not telling the truth

20:30.960 --> 20:32.960
in page 14, 50,000 and 58.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.960
I've been in the first half of this list of questions.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.960
Did you learn about last night and this morning,

20:38.960 --> 20:42.960
two witnesses were told in executive sessions?

20:42.960 --> 20:44.960
I read this wasn't the nation.

20:44.960 --> 20:50.960
And their testimony was that the year testimony in page 14, 50,000, 58,

20:50.960 --> 20:52.960
was greatly young, too.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.960
Is that not why you decided to change your testimony?

20:56.960 --> 20:58.960
Did you learn?

20:58.960 --> 21:01.960
I have mentioned this two or three times to counsel

21:01.960 --> 21:04.960
as I wanted to elaborate on the point

21:04.960 --> 21:06.960
that I was not going to ask any of this though.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.960
Did you learn a witness of the following last night

21:09.960 --> 21:13.960
and one this morning and those witnesses

21:13.960 --> 21:16.960
gave testimony directly to the year?

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
No, sir.

21:17.960 --> 21:18.960
You did not learn that?

21:18.960 --> 21:19.960
No, sir.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.960
Have you ever heard of the conversation

21:21.960 --> 21:23.960
with the following note, sir?

21:23.960 --> 21:26.960
Do you notice that this man that's correct?

21:26.960 --> 21:29.960
Didn't learn that a newsman of the following last night?

21:29.960 --> 21:30.960
No, sir.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.960
Never heard of a last note, sir?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.960
Are you as far as this is as far as you were about your

21:36.960 --> 21:39.960
bad meeting on the 24th?

21:39.960 --> 21:41.960
I'd answer the question, I think.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.960
Let me ask you this.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.960
Was not your testimony?

21:47.960 --> 21:48.960
Yes, sir.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.960
Was not your testimony all the time, sir?

21:52.960 --> 21:55.960
That's the teaching that's all the pointing in the newsman

21:55.960 --> 21:57.960
and being called last night at this point?

21:57.960 --> 21:58.960
I don't know why he was or not.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.960
I'll give you a hand.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.960
You tell me if I do it.

22:01.960 --> 22:02.960
I'll give you a hand.

22:29.960 --> 22:30.960
Look.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.960
I'll give it to you, Sir.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.960
Are you alright?

22:36.960 --> 22:39.960
I apologize.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.960
It's not like I'm with you, sir.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.960
I apologize.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.960
You satisfy me.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.960
In those first days of my life, I went for your testimony.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.960
This is my testimony on everything that I've done.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.960
Not at your own service.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.960
I've done what myejage says.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.960
You ask him, he's inside you.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.960
You ask him?

22:59.960 --> 23:01.960
Yes, sir.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.960
Sir, that's not all there is for renewing the difficulty we call.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.960
I'm asking him, Father.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.960
Did it be a death year?

23:07.960 --> 23:09.960
Did it be a death year?

23:09.960 --> 23:10.960
No.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.960
The death year is a death year.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.960
He's an owner of the room.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.960
I must have well-fledged him.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.960
Nothing about a minute's time.

23:18.960 --> 23:19.960
Sir, that's right.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.960
How long have you been with him?

23:21.960 --> 23:24.960
I've been going to the office for a while.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.960
Good morning that he has been called.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.960
And if he's beaten up in the car, what has no knowledge of what he touched the fire to?

23:30.960 --> 23:32.960
Yes, sir.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.960
And here testimony is, for the first time he knew the secret was told.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.960
That's correct.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.960
Well, who prepared the statements he just gave?

23:42.960 --> 23:45.960
Who prepared the statements?

23:45.960 --> 23:50.960
Father, it's a combination of evidence and counsel.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.960
That's right.

23:52.960 --> 23:57.960
So the combination of evidence or counsel is a statement of being told.

23:57.960 --> 24:01.960
The first night of line was the secretary's death.

24:01.960 --> 24:05.960
When you learned, Mr. Chess and the one he was, in actors,

24:05.960 --> 24:08.960
why didn't you immediately send him a card they asked for?

24:08.960 --> 24:10.960
He did not give the witness off to the teacher's acting,

24:10.960 --> 24:13.960
he could have had without off to the teacher.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.960
The lawyer was a deep suspect, he was no opportunity to give it in.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.960
You don't need to be about that, the lawyer.

24:21.960 --> 24:22.960
Question.

24:22.960 --> 24:23.960
You're about to answer.

24:23.960 --> 24:28.960
The first question, there was a combination of effort at your counsel knew

24:28.960 --> 24:30.960
that the secret was being called.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.960
The question I have in mind was, which secretary is this?

24:33.960 --> 24:34.960
I'm proud.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.960
When you learned, no, you need not read any further.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.960
The first question, you need to read the first question.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.960
I think that was a statement.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.960
The first question, you need to read the first question.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.960
The question I have in mind is, what secretary is this?

24:48.960 --> 24:50.960
When you learned, Mr. Chess and the one he was an actor,

24:50.960 --> 24:53.960
why didn't you immediately?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.960
The question, why did that?

24:55.960 --> 24:58.960
An actor, I don't even know if the chairman was for me.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.960
Well, the question is, is the question,

25:01.960 --> 25:04.960
is the senator McCarthy, which you were not given an opportunity to answer?

25:04.960 --> 25:06.960
To answer was this.

25:06.960 --> 25:11.960
Was there a combination effort in the preparation of the statement you'll read?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.960
On the part of yourself in your counsel,

25:13.960 --> 25:18.960
I, sir, your counsel learned that this witness has been called this morning

25:18.960 --> 25:21.960
to testify at an executive section.

25:21.960 --> 25:26.960
Well, of course, I can't testify as to what my counsel knew about it.

25:26.960 --> 25:27.960
You'll have to ask him.

25:27.960 --> 25:34.960
It was a combination effort in my office this morning of the work council.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.960
And it's mainly, I would say, my own work.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.960
Mr. Secretary, did your counsel advise you,

25:40.960 --> 25:44.960
prior to arguing the preparation of that statement,

25:44.960 --> 25:49.960
that he has been advised that this witness was called this morning to testify at an executive section?

25:49.960 --> 25:53.960
He did not. He did not, I think, the chairman that fully explores the matter.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.960
And we should say, that's the same fact.

25:56.960 --> 26:01.960
Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Chairman,

26:01.960 --> 26:07.960
in view of the fact that this statement has made after Senator McClellum

26:07.960 --> 26:12.960
and rightly so, suggested in fact transcript goes to the justice department,

26:12.960 --> 26:17.960
view the fact that it has made after two weeks of testified positively

26:17.960 --> 26:20.960
that the Secretary gave incorrect testimony.

26:20.960 --> 26:23.960
View the fact that Mr. Wells helped prepare this statement,

26:23.960 --> 26:27.960
that the view that's been taken was going to be present.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.960
I would like to ask the Chair of the Secretary of State, Mr. Wells,

26:30.960 --> 26:32.960
so I can examine him on this.

26:32.960 --> 26:36.960
I just won the award,

26:36.960 --> 26:39.960
but on the face, what appears to be surgery is correct.

26:39.960 --> 26:43.960
The only after this known that we have gotten witnesses to testify,

26:43.960 --> 26:47.960
is the fact that the meetings in possible any man of normal intelligence,

26:47.960 --> 26:50.960
and I think Mr. Stevens has at least normal intelligence,

26:50.960 --> 26:55.960
would forget a meeting of 21 of the top people over the Pentagon

26:55.960 --> 26:58.960
until there was no such a meeting.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.960
Mr. Chairman, that is not a point of order.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.960
I think it entirely in sufferers.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.960
As the Senator may have, Mr. Wells sworn at any appropriate time

27:06.960 --> 27:11.960
and cross-examining with reference to whether or not he desires the Secretary

27:11.960 --> 27:15.960
to tire the preparation of that statement that he needs Mr. Stevens' air.

27:15.960 --> 27:20.960
I again suggest that we proceed with the interrogation of the witnesses

27:20.960 --> 27:22.960
on matters relevant to the issue.

27:22.960 --> 27:26.960
Mr. Chairman, I believe that the Council of Statemen is sound

27:26.960 --> 27:30.960
that Mr. Stevens is on the stand and we're trying to expedite the hearing

27:30.960 --> 27:32.960
so that we can get on to other witnesses.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.960
Mr. Chairman, if you want to interrogate Mr. Wells,

27:35.960 --> 27:38.960
if you wish that we have concluded with Mr. Stevens.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.960
Mr. Chairman, may I say that I think this is one of the most important issues

27:42.960 --> 27:44.960
across the year, further enough,

27:44.960 --> 27:47.960
there was criteria or sub-arination of criteria.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.960
We have on following the practice,

27:49.960 --> 27:51.960
the Council of the Senate,

27:51.960 --> 27:53.960
and the Council of the Senate,

27:53.960 --> 27:56.960
I think that the Council of the Senate is not in place

27:56.960 --> 28:00.960
having the Secretary set the sign when a question comes up.

28:00.960 --> 28:06.960
I will not press the point of the Chair once to have Mr. Wells sworn at a subsequent time.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.960
I thought it could be sworn now to give the Secretary a time to prevent that also.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.960
I guess the Chair was for enough time if you were once one of the time.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.960
Chair would like to follow these suggestions and Councils as this plan to conducting the hearing.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.960
On the third of May,

28:19.960 --> 28:23.960
you asked these questions.

28:23.960 --> 28:27.960
Mr. Murkhar, you were unhappy when you stood there smiling and shaking my hand

28:27.960 --> 28:30.960
while the photographers were taking their pictures.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.960
The other ones were unhappy and serious.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.960
We're happy. All right.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.960
Then you got back to the time again.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.960
We could tell us how there was originated.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.960
That particular night the charges against Mr. Cohen,

28:42.960 --> 28:45.960
Mr. Secretary, I have no idea.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.960
President, did you talk to him so last night?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.960
Answer. I don't think I did.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.960
President, do you remember?

28:54.960 --> 28:58.960
I don't think I did. No, I'm pretty sure I didn't.

28:58.960 --> 29:05.960
Now, when did you first request a recollection and remember there was this 21-man meeting?

29:05.960 --> 29:10.960
Well, out of Canada, I have far as Mr. Hensel is concerned.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.960
He was one of 21 of the meetings.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.960
I didn't talk to him personally.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.960
I didn't remember.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.960
You heard my con. What a transpire.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.960
I said, when did you request a recollection?

29:20.960 --> 29:23.960
And suddenly, remember this 21-man meeting?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.960
You did not remember three days ago.

29:25.960 --> 29:29.960
Well, when I get two of the days touched on me, I think about it and try to think of

29:29.960 --> 29:33.960
searched out my memory and see if anything needs correction or expansion.

29:33.960 --> 29:40.960
And I remembered then, I was I was next to my eighth day on the stand,

29:40.960 --> 29:46.960
somewhere in it, and I overlooked that point, and I followed my counsel not once,

29:46.960 --> 29:48.960
but two or three times.

29:48.960 --> 29:54.960
As soon as I got an appropriate opportunity, I would like to elaborate on that return to the Pentagon.

29:54.960 --> 30:03.960
Mr. Stevens, I haven't tried to cut the short to get you off the fan, but when you answered,

30:03.960 --> 30:06.960
I give a long and long answer to nothing you would have thought.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.960
There's no way that I can get you off on a hurry.

30:08.960 --> 30:14.960
My question simply was, when did you first remember about this 21-man meeting?

30:14.960 --> 30:18.960
In your office, the one which you did not remember last month?

30:18.960 --> 30:21.960
When did you first remember? Monday night, Tuesday night?

30:21.960 --> 30:25.960
I'd say it just until I can't remember precisely, but I'd say that probably.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.960
I thought it'd actually be on Tuesday sometime.

30:27.960 --> 30:28.960
I don't know.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.960
So you probably didn't get it?

30:30.960 --> 30:32.960
Mr. Smith or Mr. Stevens?

30:32.960 --> 30:34.960
Yes, that's the only work that's done.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.960
If you're not in direct contact with the other two witnesses in testifying,

30:38.960 --> 30:41.960
it would be a fair cut to your case, those rather important to you.

30:41.960 --> 30:45.960
I think that's the only work that's done instead of making each statement of facts.

30:45.960 --> 30:49.960
You simply ask questions of this witness.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.960
You have made each statement of facts.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.960
But I don't think it's proper.

30:54.960 --> 31:00.960
I think your line of inquiry was proper for proper and for that reason, no objection was made.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.960
Mr. Care, if all is appointed by the prosecutor's secretary,

31:04.960 --> 31:06.960
you were aware of the fact.

31:06.960 --> 31:11.960
You are aware of the fact now that your testimony is under hold on the third,

31:11.960 --> 31:16.960
is directly contrary to the testimony of Mr. Stevens.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.960
Are you aware of that?

31:17.960 --> 31:18.960
Both under hold?

31:18.960 --> 31:21.960
I'm not aware of anything that Mr. Stevens has touched on.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.960
I actually explained it.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.960
Thank you.
