WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
I have an infection infection which, over a little time, it's always a good device.

00:09.000 --> 00:17.520
I would like to welcome my guest to have a send of the hearing this morning and to remind

00:17.520 --> 00:25.200
them of the standing committee rule that any audible manifestations of a true, vulnerable

00:25.200 --> 00:31.560
physical rule of anything taking place in this committee room are strictly forbidden

00:31.560 --> 00:39.040
by the committee rule. The uniformed officers in the room and the paying closings feel

00:39.040 --> 00:46.240
them on you have a prevailing set of orders from the committee to remove from the room immediately,

00:46.240 --> 00:52.680
politely but firmly, any of you who elect to violate the terms by which you enter the

00:52.680 --> 00:58.660
room, namely, to refrain entirely from audible manifestations of a true, vulnerable physical

00:58.660 --> 01:05.960
rule. The chair again instructs our playing closed people and a uniform guard without any

01:05.960 --> 01:10.260
further instruction from the chair without any interruptions of the proceedings to carry

01:10.260 --> 01:16.400
out the orders of the committee. Should there be any violations of those Jews? Our agencies

01:16.400 --> 01:21.920
have been uniformed with courteous and cooperative. We have a chance for this, they will continue

01:21.920 --> 01:30.680
to be that way. As we concluded yesterday, we had finally terminated the long task to

01:30.680 --> 01:35.600
getting the monitored phone calls into the record and Mr. Council, we have Mr. Cohn back

01:35.600 --> 01:40.200
on the stands. We would start our 10 minute go round with you if you have any questions

01:40.200 --> 01:47.880
to ask this time. Senator Jackson, the follow-up, I want to have been discussed in part yesterday,

01:47.880 --> 01:54.280
and certainly that Mr. Cipher, be called as a witness so that the public understands,

01:54.280 --> 01:58.920
I made a motion this morning, executive session that he be called and it was seconded by

01:58.920 --> 02:04.960
Senator McClaum. The motion was defeated by a substitute on a four to three votes, this

02:04.960 --> 02:10.280
wants the public, so they can fully understand what had transpired since the request of yesterday.

02:40.280 --> 02:45.240
Mr. Cipher, I wouldn't excuse you, if you could say that Mr. Welk represents one side

02:45.240 --> 02:51.440
of the country, Mr. Cipher. Certainly, the chair will tell Mr. Cipher again having

02:51.440 --> 02:56.280
to call as one of the witnesses that is the desire of any members of the committee or any

02:56.280 --> 03:00.120
principal to the country, Mr. Cipher. The Parliament will be in court. You may say,

03:00.120 --> 03:06.000
the your statements to me, that Mr. Cipher, this is going to be called and if so, my statement

03:06.000 --> 03:10.560
will stand on your own, that is, oh, do we go nothing? And to that, is Mr. Cipher going

03:10.560 --> 03:15.680
to be called and it's so when? Is the Cipher will be called the committee decide to run

03:15.680 --> 03:21.880
the hearings beyond the specified number of witnesses suggested by the army side of the

03:21.880 --> 03:24.960
country, Mr. Cipher, as you'll remember, of course I couldn't answer that question, but

03:24.960 --> 03:30.760
the chairman, a lot of charges were made against Mr. Cipher yesterday, and I would suggest

03:30.760 --> 03:36.000
that now that you can tell us whether or not you are going to call Mr. Cipher or whether

03:36.000 --> 03:40.880
you're going to continue on their roles, which was a body line role 43 not to call it. There

03:40.880 --> 03:45.320
is no such role not to call a member to direct the record. Because the role of other

03:45.320 --> 03:50.360
witnesses is published and we should have the record accurate. The vote is passed through

03:50.360 --> 03:54.320
the four to three vote points that will be continually jacked through the proceedings

03:54.320 --> 03:58.440
of the procedure we have powered up to now. And that is, Mr. Cipher, Mr. Cipher,

03:58.440 --> 04:03.800
I'm advised to tell you how they share well then, to feed them and the first table up here.

04:03.800 --> 04:08.840
Ah, just as it has come up, I might give a word as to a background of a transparency

04:08.840 --> 04:15.000
executive meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether or not it was impossible

04:15.000 --> 04:21.920
now in the interest of trying to terminate these hearings at some foreseeable age to

04:21.920 --> 04:30.640
agree upon a list of witnesses to be called and having agreed upon that, it's at a target

04:30.640 --> 04:37.600
base for the complete adjournment, signly die of these hearings. It is brought up by some

04:37.600 --> 04:42.120
of the committee members and the chair thought of complete validity. And before they could

04:42.120 --> 04:48.880
vote intelligently on such a motion, they should have an opportunity to read the executive

04:48.880 --> 04:55.880
meeting. The chair is today having ten tribes and a little bit of the council's role. All

04:55.880 --> 05:04.560
of the testimony of all of the witnesses who have appeared in executive session. When

05:04.560 --> 05:10.840
committee members have had a fair chance, then sales of the executive council to examine

05:10.840 --> 05:17.400
that testimony, the chair is then ready for another executive meeting of the committee.

05:17.400 --> 05:24.400
Go around the table and find out just what witnesses. Those principals involved of committee

05:24.400 --> 05:31.400
members feel should be called before we can have any details. And at that time, I am

05:31.400 --> 05:37.400
right also, we can agree on the list, however large or however small, so that we won't have

05:37.400 --> 05:42.400
to be held here incriminately and forever by the committee hearings we have attended to

05:42.400 --> 05:49.400
the spread and to expand without any guidance whatsoever unless by now we can put down

05:49.400 --> 05:55.400
a national degree on the witness to be called. At that time, certainly the name of Mr.

05:55.400 --> 06:02.400
Trippard will be called and if decided to go beyond the witness of these Mr. Walsh,

06:02.400 --> 06:08.400
now thousands, he wants to have calls and have the committee present his final case, then

06:08.400 --> 06:14.400
certainly Mr. Trippard will be called. Now, you have no questions, the chair has not

06:14.400 --> 06:19.400
been used in the sentence and it will come, it has been in three years. But the call I

06:19.400 --> 06:24.400
feel re-worked to your committee, document again, we are going to go through this as rapidly

06:24.400 --> 06:35.400
as we can. For in my documents, we were on page 16 and you are charged with specification

06:35.400 --> 06:50.400
number, one day through. I think we are going beyond that too. I mean we are going

06:50.400 --> 06:58.400
further, we were discussing 24-hour-one-way concluded the trial was closed directly. I thought

06:58.400 --> 07:08.400
of a memory that you would ask me about 31 and on 31. I will recall that just to get

07:08.400 --> 07:20.400
a connection, you stay here. The one he stopped the clinic, I believe he said you make him

07:20.400 --> 07:25.400
specifically and Mr. Adam stopped the clinic, he was going to allow, that's the outstanding

07:25.400 --> 07:30.400
example. That's the outstanding, that's the sufficient and I thank you. I thank you.

07:30.400 --> 07:35.400
We would need this, then, a lawful should be a witness here. We've reviewed that charge

07:35.400 --> 07:42.400
was support, so few. I think general lawful should be a witness here, either through support

07:42.400 --> 07:48.400
that charge or to refuse it. Also, I think the record is, I think it will be fine to have

07:48.400 --> 07:52.400
him tonight, I'm sure he's going to make the record was Adam. But I think the record is

07:52.400 --> 07:57.400
made, sir, Mr. Steven, Mr. Adam. I know, you don't want him to be heard, he's a man of

07:57.400 --> 08:02.400
his friends. I didn't say I didn't want him to hear. But I think he should be here, and I think

08:02.400 --> 08:10.400
he should be there, maybe he could be. All right, let's go to number 32. You saw

08:10.400 --> 08:19.400
where that's the Medov-Tobus in January 1954. The Medov-Tobus in January 1954, Mr. Adam

08:20.400 --> 08:26.400
though, on numerous occasions, to secure it from the Germans and the U.S.

08:26.400 --> 08:35.400
staff, a promise of violence, it's the end of the statement to both, both general lawful,

08:35.400 --> 08:42.400
demanding general at fourth moment, and the need of his demands. Yes, that's true. Yes,

08:42.400 --> 08:48.400
it is. You regard that as a serious act, serious threat. Yes, sir, I think that's general

08:49.400 --> 08:53.400
lawful as passage. But at the end of the statement, much more reference to Bill and the

08:53.400 --> 08:58.400
President of General, as he was sent into operating and trying to get commoners out of the

08:58.400 --> 09:05.400
army. That's it. There it is, isn't it? All right, let's go to number 33. All right, about

09:05.400 --> 09:12.400
October 21, 1953, and all the media decisions that have been made. Mr. Adam, he used every

09:12.400 --> 09:17.400
effort to discover the names of persons, including instances of commoners in the location of the

09:18.400 --> 09:24.400
self-divitage, stating that if he discovered any of the departments, he would have that

09:24.400 --> 09:33.400
here. Is that statement true? Yes, sir. Do you regard that as public commoners, if

09:33.400 --> 09:38.400
you? Well, both I get into this question of informants, that we've asked so much to say.

09:38.400 --> 09:43.400
I understand, but it's true. I'm talking about Adam's action. I think he was quite wrong.

09:44.400 --> 09:50.400
That would be probably the problem with that. I couldn't wait to know that if you can tell us

09:50.400 --> 09:58.400
under the end, tell us what it is. I think it's an advantage for Mr. Adam, sir. I have to

09:58.400 --> 10:09.400
say that at that point, he was going to get the head of anybody working for him who was

10:09.400 --> 10:14.400
giving information through the testimony. What point? You've played all of October 21.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.400
You're not at this point, you're talking about it. I'm sorry, sure. Was that, and that was very

10:18.400 --> 10:23.400
early, then, when you were playing him for him, wasn't it? Yes, sir. He took the position

10:23.400 --> 10:28.400
that he found any people in his department who were giving us information he would have their

10:28.400 --> 10:35.400
head. He did not tie that in with any statement on his plot that he thought coming, it should

10:36.400 --> 10:39.400
be suspected already from the wrong road lines. I have to say that, it's a hamlet to him. He didn't

10:39.400 --> 10:43.400
say that, but he said he'd get the head of anybody who gave information about this point

10:43.400 --> 10:48.400
while he did not want people in his organization to give us information. Yes. Well, that was

10:48.400 --> 10:53.400
an obstruction for me, or do you think I was wrong? I thought he was wrong, sir. If I was wrong,

10:53.400 --> 11:00.400
then. Did that continue on after that date? Yes, sir, sir. All the way to your

11:00.400 --> 11:05.400
point of argument with your relations with Baltimore, please, you follow. But, I remember

11:05.400 --> 11:10.400
October 21, I remember a few incidents there after, certainly continue to be tempered.

11:10.400 --> 11:19.400
All right, let's go to 34. Yes, sir. I reached from the bottom next to the last

11:19.400 --> 11:26.400
center. He was, he was not driving. He was full of immunoventilation with both of

11:26.400 --> 11:33.400
the three and the subcommittee have a human person with commoners wreckage. I've been

11:33.400 --> 11:38.400
praying for this board, and I've seen you speaking about the loyalty board. That's right.

11:38.400 --> 11:44.400
Yes, sir. I've been praying for this board, three eight one. Sir, so it's the top one before

11:44.400 --> 11:49.400
it. The top one before it. A white watch was, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

11:49.400 --> 11:56.400
top. At very time in the December and January, he told us the phone and the power that he

11:56.400 --> 12:04.400
would stop at nothing, he produced the subcommittee from going into this. Is that true? Is

12:04.400 --> 12:10.400
there a guard that is a threat? I regard it as a space, that he was going to do everything

12:10.400 --> 12:14.400
he could to stop us from examining the members of the world. You said, and just trust

12:14.400 --> 12:21.400
me. Yes. Reckon did just the committee's work. He said he did not want us to have any

12:21.400 --> 12:26.400
members of the world before. That's correct. All right, now let's go to number 36. He's

12:26.400 --> 12:33.400
following days, and I assume that the far as to the statement in the previous paragraph

12:33.400 --> 12:42.400
and right January 19th is mentioned. He does it. Yes sir. He's following days Mr. Adams

12:42.400 --> 12:48.400
communicated with other members of the subcommittee and stated that unless the chairman was to be

12:48.400 --> 12:54.400
on the farm, the doctor's investigation and not to issue the seniors for those in the

12:54.400 --> 13:00.400
lower as it's that up. Mr. Adams, you have calls and embarrassing reports to be circulated

13:00.400 --> 13:07.400
about Mr. Cole. If you regard that as a threat, it is true. Yes, I think the testimony of the

13:07.400 --> 13:11.400
Republican candidate here is the Sabbath that's there. It is true that he's gotten to

13:11.400 --> 13:18.400
issue a report against you unless, unless the convenience for the law is the board will

13:18.400 --> 13:21.400
as well. I think that's a set out. How are you making the members of the committee?

13:21.400 --> 13:25.400
That's the event too. I made that set. What's the record? I put this testimony here of

13:25.400 --> 13:32.400
Senator Jackson, Senator Monk, and particularly also I don't recall. Are you in

13:32.400 --> 13:37.400
that testimony? I was collaborating that side. He gave me a check if it was there. Yes sir.

13:37.400 --> 13:41.400
I do. That's the way you end up. I do. That's the testimony of the senator.

13:41.400 --> 13:50.400
Yes I do. Number 29. I mean number 307, I'm sorry.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.400
Number 40.

13:56.400 --> 14:06.400
Number 25. All about January 27, 1964. Mr. Adams told Mr. Cole.

14:06.400 --> 14:12.400
That Mr. Adams had to present the appearance of those connections with the law to proceed with.

14:12.400 --> 14:20.400
And that this was one issue on which he was stopped at Metins. That's true. Well, that was not told to me personally.

14:20.400 --> 14:25.400
That was told to Mr. Coggy told it to me. Then it would be a burden that the car passed the file

14:25.400 --> 14:32.400
on that point. So I don't think it's a joke. I can tell you that Mr. Cog told me that it's such a conversation for a late time.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.400
And I know Mr. Coggy is record in the FBI. I'm sure it's a mistake.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.400
And then we follow down here. I'm sure you familiar with him.

14:39.400 --> 14:45.400
Number 41. Number 42. And number 43 where you mentioned other things.

14:45.400 --> 14:53.400
That Mr. Adams had taken about the same position. Are they all correct? Yes sir. I'm sure they are.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.400
All right, 40.

15:03.400 --> 15:10.400
Well, correct. Number 43. And number 35. You have heard of this document which you now hold in hand.

15:10.400 --> 15:18.400
The original audit of the original audit which was distributed to members of the committee and later released.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.400
Number 45. First document which is.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.400
That is very important now in advance.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
That Mr. Adams.

15:28.400 --> 15:34.400
The staff, the staff committee and investigation is common within location and in the army.

15:34.400 --> 15:40.400
You make that charge now and they the staff will be very important.

15:40.400 --> 15:44.400
All right. The document which is. I'm sure a lot of the purpose for which it was.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.400
Mr. Jesse. So you make that statement now.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.400
40 states whether and it succeeded at least before.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.400
Yes sir. If you take it.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.400
40 bad states.

15:56.400 --> 16:05.400
As established as a fact that inside of numerous instances of actual intervention and military assignments by public officials.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.400
Number 4 will set you the fourth issue.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.400
Do you charge now that it was issued in bad states by Mr. Barby.

16:13.400 --> 16:17.400
Second there of the army and by Mr. Adams.

16:17.400 --> 16:24.400
Uh, coming to McClellan. I not only do that. I think that Mr. Steven Stacey and the telephone conversation with some of the findings that I'm watching.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.400
If the whole thing was closely exaggerated and there was nothing to it.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.400
His ample demonstration of the fact that it was issued in bad state.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.400
I understand it. I understand it.

16:35.400 --> 16:43.400
Mr. Chairman. I would have no further questions to ask Mr. Claw.

16:43.400 --> 16:52.400
And I. I'm not afraid too much of my time because I like to long to have more time at top.

16:52.400 --> 16:58.400
I would like our little explain.

16:58.400 --> 17:07.400
One thing to the people that are here and the people that might be dropping on fellow.

17:07.400 --> 17:12.400
We've had several four to three days.

17:12.400 --> 17:21.400
I would guess that a part of the conversation that I was put on is heard.

17:21.400 --> 17:26.400
I would guess that all of our action is kept free.

17:26.400 --> 17:34.400
Now this is a twenty-nine days of this period.

17:34.400 --> 17:39.400
Here in the post are they hearing there are many strong men that are up to the top.

17:39.400 --> 17:43.400
There are telephone conversations. We never wouldn't go that far.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.400
There will be a big effort made to keep the telephone conversations up.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.400
What if telephone conversations are in the back?

17:49.400 --> 17:57.400
Now, on these days, the period has to come to an end.

17:57.400 --> 18:02.400
We have eight staff. We are busy people.

18:02.400 --> 18:08.400
We are lucky to have their state to represent them in the center of the United States.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.400
We are tied up here for twenty-nine days.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.400
And ladies and gentlemen, the end is still not in sight.

18:16.400 --> 18:26.400
Now I'm wondering whether we are paying our responsibility at this public service.

18:26.400 --> 18:33.400
By not trying to find a method to bring these hearings to an honorable conclusion.

18:33.400 --> 18:43.400
I say that certain days after twenty-nine days and a day's plan to follow Senator Hathen in the party

18:43.400 --> 18:56.400
and the card to give their testimony, it will go back and pick up everything that I remember.

18:56.400 --> 19:04.400
I would like to have heard. Never think that would like to.

19:04.400 --> 19:09.400
We will be here on November 4th.

19:10.400 --> 19:17.400
I don't wish to forget that our friends on the other side of the table

19:17.400 --> 19:22.400
would like to have you here and continue on to the front.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.400
But I will say it's the one on the side of the table.

19:26.400 --> 19:31.400
I am convinced we can ask the thing that's our job.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.400
And concludes these hearings.

19:33.400 --> 19:38.400
And a matter of days, if we look for the single-knit-the-purpose seducer.

19:38.400 --> 19:44.400
There's no doubt that these hearings will begin.

19:44.400 --> 19:52.400
From the basic issues of that thing in the past, we have a personality conflict

19:52.400 --> 19:55.400
that will become in contact by the moment.

19:55.400 --> 19:59.400
Sixth place in the moment, there's no one.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.400
And he goes.

20:02.400 --> 20:10.400
So I would like to just forget to my colleagues, I'm both of them.

20:10.400 --> 20:16.400
Take your conscience and your good needs.

20:16.400 --> 20:26.400
A method to advocate the facts that are put into this investigation in the counter.

20:26.400 --> 20:39.400
And then bring these hearings to a conclusion so we can carry out the other functions of our duties as a subject.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
Get that.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.400
Thank you, Senator Potter, for those lies and dispression, the ways to counter.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.400
Before the next senator has an opportunity to question the witness,

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
let's return to our studio across the country.

20:50.400 --> 20:57.400
Why did I just add a word to do to the very fine remarks of my good friend,

20:57.400 --> 21:01.400
the thing that's been the senator from Michigan?

21:01.400 --> 21:13.400
I think that probably the hardest thing to practice sitting here before so many people is restraints.

21:13.400 --> 21:23.400
I know that I find it difficult to follow what I should, being a human being.

21:23.400 --> 21:37.400
I would like to say, however, that names are brought in to this controversy, not by some of us on this side of the aisle.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.400
So I think any of the people that they have people here, the members of the committee,

21:41.400 --> 21:45.400
senators, both Republicans and Democrats,

21:45.400 --> 21:52.400
so I think just simple American fair play requires that the other side be heard.

21:52.400 --> 22:03.400
Now if you want to cut down and be lefty hearing, then let's avoid bringing in additional people.

22:03.400 --> 22:11.400
I think everyone, not lawyers, not experts on evidence or anything else,

22:11.400 --> 22:16.400
but every American be high or low.

22:16.400 --> 22:25.400
Certainly understands that when an individual has been discussed that great lengths to fall millions of Americans,

22:25.400 --> 22:28.400
that individual has the right to be heard.

22:29.400 --> 22:34.400
And the way to avoid adding what this is not to bring in the additional name.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.400
I think there's an all of you on that.

22:36.400 --> 22:40.400
And I think all of us who are sitting in judgment on this,

22:40.400 --> 22:47.400
try to put on a Republican and Democratic side, will want to bring in additional names.

22:47.400 --> 22:52.400
If we're going to bring them in, then fair play is a joke case that they have an opportunity to be heard.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.400
That's why I made the motion.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.400
Just that simple.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.400
What reference to Mr. Tarkifer's?

22:59.400 --> 23:01.400
I'm referring.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.400
Mr. Collin, now that he's been approved,

23:05.400 --> 23:11.400
got out of the way our cabinet has made the cost now,

23:11.400 --> 23:16.400
and I confess to that, and I think all of us who are sitting here.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.400
To do my television network is bringing you through,

23:19.400 --> 23:29.400
may I revert greatly now to complete my interrogations regarding Mr. Tarkifer's and where those things start.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.400
So, that with the crack is not the way to think that is.

23:33.400 --> 23:41.400
Well, I know, but when he was the first name you referred to in the document was introduced for the thousands of names,

23:41.400 --> 23:48.400
I think you have stated that he did not give any indication of people and radar laboratories in that,

23:48.400 --> 23:54.400
and I think that is statement about people in chemical laboratories.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.400
I think the long-lost lines, I don't see the word radar used in your correct in that.

23:58.400 --> 24:02.400
I know that he did discuss the signal for our radar situation.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.400
Was that him and Memorand in your correct the word radar?

24:05.400 --> 24:09.400
Well, I only have to go and Memorand, by the way, did you make a memo, boss?

24:09.400 --> 24:12.400
Your conversation with Mr. Tarkifer?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
No, I didn't. Dave Shinesaw from Mr. Krauss.

24:14.400 --> 24:20.400
He has claimed that Memorand is trying to claim that Memorand in which you had sent it from and back in life.

24:20.400 --> 24:26.400
I thought that Mr. Krauss on several occasions, I don't think I have ever made a Memorandum of my conversation.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.400
I am not good at making Memorandum.

24:29.400 --> 24:38.400
Well, I wouldn't try to challenge you on that because there are a number of Memorandas that were,

24:38.400 --> 24:46.400
it's released to the press a while back and I believe that was one more than in March.

24:46.400 --> 24:59.400
So, at least I think it's logical that I have a question about Memorand because Memorand had been released to the first press relating to conversations that some of the staff had with different people.

24:59.400 --> 25:06.400
Show it. Now, wasn't it important for Mr. Shines to make a note of the fact that he had mentioned that,

25:06.400 --> 25:12.400
what do you say, chemical and the largest organs? I think that didn't report.

25:12.400 --> 25:18.400
Well, I've looked over this report and thousands, they just make it a blank, it's already a copy of that, sir.

25:18.400 --> 25:23.400
Well, I have, I'll let you have the only one I have.

25:24.400 --> 25:39.400
And a thousand names are given in the Army, which is pretty indefinitely. Mr. Tosh having left his company in the party on the stand in 41 or 42.

25:39.400 --> 25:50.400
I think what we need, Mr. Toshone is from Memorandum from the files which would indicate that the hearing was initiated back in March.

25:50.400 --> 25:57.400
Well, I think you have this Memorandum which came from what, sir, and you also have, I think it's a fact that it's...

25:57.400 --> 26:01.400
I can also give you some testimony if you wish about other people too.

26:01.400 --> 26:10.400
Well, 95% of Mr. Toshone's Memorandum relates to Memorandum. It relates to Russia in 1927 and 1928.

26:10.400 --> 26:22.400
I have what I want, sir. It's on page three of the Memorandum. I believe it says I had an eclectic, the Navy, I was recommended, been collecting the Navy's and civilian workers in the Unition and Chemical Industries.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.400
That's the sense, which I had reference.

26:25.400 --> 26:32.400
Yeah, but the moment he doesn't mention specific places, he just makes an statement that the Communist was infiltrated.

26:32.400 --> 26:41.400
No matter fact, it's not true, Mr. Toshone, but under the draft act, a member came out, being excluded from the draft, if he's a member of the Communist Party.

26:41.400 --> 26:47.400
I believe you're right. He can't be excluded by the election service. I don't think that's Toshone's been taking any action.

26:47.400 --> 26:59.400
Well, when he says there are a thousand in the Army, you would automatically say that if there are 25 or 50,000 Communist in the United States, when they have children, then of course that was raised the question of commissioning them as officers.

26:59.400 --> 27:04.400
The question of their treatment and observation, once they are instructed into the Army.

27:04.400 --> 27:08.400
Well, let's get back to one of those any Memorandum files.

27:08.400 --> 27:17.400
You mentioned, I think in your earlier testimony the other day, that you were someone of the staff, I think someone of the staff that talked with an Army officer,

27:17.400 --> 27:21.400
Yes sir. About an investigation army, when was that?

27:21.400 --> 27:24.400
That I think was in late February, if that's taken care of the case.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.400
Well, you have a Memorandum on that?

27:26.400 --> 27:27.400
No, I don't.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.400
I have a recollection on it, sir.

27:29.400 --> 27:43.400
Well, let me, do you have any Memorandum at all with reference to the initiation of the investigation into the Army other than the Paul Proc document?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.400
I think probably we do, sir, yet.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.400
Well, can we get that? I think that's very important.

27:49.400 --> 27:55.400
As you know, to the question of when the investigation of the Army got underway?

27:55.400 --> 28:03.400
Well, one thing with Joseph, well, of course, as I say, you have here a Memorandum, I'm timing this infiltration of the American Armed Forces, dated March 1953.

28:03.400 --> 28:13.400
In addition to that kind of transaction, I believe you have sent in a majority testimony that the two-in-a-quarter page, summary of FBI information obtained from the Army,

28:13.400 --> 28:17.400
seemed to us back around this period of time, maybe a month or two.

28:17.400 --> 28:27.400
Thereafter, that's another thing we did, your right, sir, talked to an Army intelligence officer, toward the end of February.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.400
I will not like to repeat it, name me. Mr. Stevens knows.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.400
I'm not asking for his name.

28:31.400 --> 28:37.400
No, sir. Mr. Stevens knows his name, because I sent this Army intelligence officer over the statements of Stevens in September.

28:37.400 --> 28:53.400
I think I know who he is, but I'm not asking for his name now, but I would like to have the Memorandum available, which would indicate the follow-up on the conversation with this Major and anyone else that was interviewed on.

28:53.400 --> 29:01.400
Mr. Stevens, I still have that. I hate that important. I had an e... I spent quite a lengthy evening with that Major and discussed these things.

29:01.400 --> 29:09.400
So, at the end of February, actually, if I think I had someone call him and find out when, as it was, the end of February. I remember where it was.

29:09.400 --> 29:14.400
I don't recall that I made a Memorandum of that meeting, sir. I don't think I did.

29:14.400 --> 29:21.400
Well, was any Memorandum or any follow-up made of the two-in-a-quarter page document?

29:21.400 --> 29:26.400
Yes, I did. It gets back to the other things, sir. There was a follow-up, because I know I saw, for instance, to this Major.

29:26.400 --> 29:34.400
I have thought from, again, since that date, I was aware of what he knew and so it stayed shine.

29:34.400 --> 29:42.400
I think he might have supplied some documentation at that time, or shortly thereafter, or told us where to get some documentation.

29:42.400 --> 29:53.400
On the FBI's Memorandum, sir, when I got the name Aaron Coleman, as I think I explained, I checked that fact against the record in the Rosenberg case.

29:53.400 --> 29:57.400
I think I bought a copy of the record in the Rosenberg case.

29:57.400 --> 30:01.400
Well, we followed up this.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.400
You said you had documentation. Can you supply that?

30:04.400 --> 30:07.400
Well, you got the Christ Memorandum, sir. You have the...

30:07.400 --> 30:15.400
Well, the cost Memorandum, Mr. Cohn, is... I've read all the way through it. It's just a general statement about the fact that the communist...

30:15.400 --> 30:23.400
... would find himself a state of the Army. He based that on a conference that he had in the Soviet Union in 1927 and 28.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.400
Yes, sir. It's something that... I've read it. It's very carefully.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.400
I've read it.

30:29.400 --> 30:38.400
I can't say that if there is any Memorandum in the file, you are welcome to it. I doubt that you'll find much because I was in Wisconsin.

30:38.400 --> 30:45.400
A verbal contact with Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn, every day, but if there's any there, you are more than welcome to it.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.400
I will order my spare price this month to...

30:48.400 --> 30:50.400
... earn a certain...

30:50.400 --> 30:53.400
... given land there pretty much immobile, I have for a relatively long time.

30:53.400 --> 30:59.400
Well, I didn't say any important of this case that we have, the Jacksoniest Sand Mile, one of the six off Memorandum...

30:59.400 --> 31:03.400
... relating to this, and if we can have it by right after lunch, that shouldn't take long.

31:03.400 --> 31:08.400
You won't be brought up for lunch. You can't go through all the files. You can get everything you're right after lunch.

31:08.400 --> 31:16.400
Well, we were told before that the senators, when these matters were brought up, such as the two-in-the-quarter page document...

31:16.400 --> 31:18.400
... we could get them without any trouble.

31:18.400 --> 31:22.400
I believe that the drones would help over those days, the trial.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.400
When you get more than the band, you might get to it ever more than that.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.400
Well, don't we have someone in the office who can get to it?

31:28.400 --> 31:32.400
Well, we ever pay for the information when we need it, then if we...

31:32.400 --> 31:37.400
... get it the same judgment, you'll get what you've asked for.

31:37.400 --> 31:43.400
But you know very well that the smittiest and frequently immobileized by the hearing that I am now...

31:43.400 --> 31:48.400
... in such a mess that proceed to go through the file and try and get to know what you want.

31:48.400 --> 31:54.400
You want Memorandum in regard to the initiation of the Army cases, and I don't see why they've sacked it...

31:54.400 --> 31:57.400
... mobilized it apparently working on this.

31:57.400 --> 32:01.400
So, there's the rocket we pay in. There's from time, and in order to make such a minute...

32:01.400 --> 32:04.400
... it's practically for the smiles to those they can get for you.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.400
And this time, it's time...
