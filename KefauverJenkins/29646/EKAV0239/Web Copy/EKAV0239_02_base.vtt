WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm going to start here with the drop pass.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Here, well.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Now, you first send them across.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Yes.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Send them across.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
Well, Mr. Chairman, normally out of the terrible number of persons, however, in order to give

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
them the drop pass to drop the term and that put us with us in detail.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
I'm going to pass the look of well, but we pay one of the reasons for that is Mr. Cohn,

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
who's been called in the service Friday, is being ordered to make his record command, and

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
mentally.

00:41.000 --> 00:51.000
And I would like to have Mr. Cohn, however, an opportunity to examine the look of before Mr.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
Cohn, who goes down and gets that preferential treatment under pressure.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn, Mr. MacPathy has told me informally that it was his intention to pass repeatedly

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
today so that Mr. Cohn and I could take progress with this with us.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
And in that context, Mr. Cohn, your father's asking down the table for your smiling face.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
It is the intention of the state where I must do well to do better for everyone concerned

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
than anyone could dream of.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
While the events of this morning's executive session are not being made public as of now,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I understand.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
The consequence of that session was that I was still with our arms left as we would be sometimes

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
in a German or a recess without having at least some opportunity of these witnesses that

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I deemed essential.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
For the election, I'll furnish you much deeper.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I think there was no justice whatsoever made by anybody.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
There'd be a recess before the witness is suggesting record.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
I understand that time flies and the days of the hearing build up.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
And I want to make it clear that the state clarifying, I both wish to see the senator on the stand

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
and we wouldn't see Mr. Cohn on the stand.

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
The consequence is that Mr. St. Clair and I are prepared to drop out of our Christy nominations.

02:28.000 --> 02:38.000
Laboriously planned and built up great gods of it so that we may proceed and at least have

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
some time with the other two witnesses that we have in mind before something happens to

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
these hearings.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Mr. Cohn has had my assurance that one large item or an item in his cross examination is

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
going to be dropped.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
And Mr. Cohn, I now make good on that arrangement with you.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
You suggested to me last night that your military record was reasonably long and that it was

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
immaterial.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
As a lawyer, Mr. Cohn, I cannot differ with that last point.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
We fell into the habit in this room of talking about people's military careers, as you know.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
And when you stated your military career in the national die has seemed to me that you stated

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
less than all of it.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
But even so, whether my supporters, if I have any likeness, or hate me for it, I have decided

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
that I have told you for the sake of not to go into that somewhat long.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
So I'll let you know if I say that if I'm a first for fair to answer any question you want

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
to put to me about anything.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
You and I have talked sometimes a time after a discussion about the elimination of various

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
matters which might be immaterial and might take a long period of time and I'm ready to

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
trust you at any time about any of those and eliminate any matters or add any matters or

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
feed any matters to keep these hearings through age conclusion.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Thank you sir.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
And Mr. Cohn, it is quite clear I think that you and I have matters to discuss.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
A more important than my military career which was trivial in World War I or Mr. St. Clairs

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
which was reasonably notable in World War II or your sir.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Sir, I might say you say you've gotten in the habit of doing it.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
I know that neither Mr. Cohn and Mr. Julianne have been able to say fine records and so much

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
final.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And I do not have a lot of people here who have not gone in today.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I do not wish to preclude you from making some statement about it, some have some time

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
if you wish but I have already said what I will do about examining you.

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
Now Mr. Cohn, let us turn to the things that I think are some important in this hearing.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
First I want a little discussion with you as a lawyer.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
We have been sitting in this room trying to walk on the face of it looks like a dispute between individuals

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
who do not agree.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
One in substance saying, kids and one in substance saying, kids.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Sure, that's right.

05:23.000 --> 05:32.000
In the course of that, kids and kids, so I would like to suggest you Mr. Cohn that we

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
have revealed and illuminated certain constitutional problems.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
And may I say to you Mr. Cohn that probably you and I were different as to how those problems

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
should be solved.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
No, that's not.

05:50.000 --> 05:59.000
But I would like to believe that we are in reasonable agreement as to what it is that we have revealed

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
and illuminated.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
Let me see if I can say to you.

06:07.000 --> 06:15.000
Mr. Cohn, we have in this hearing revealed a what you might probably call a constitutional

06:15.000 --> 06:24.000
question as to the line of demarcation between the executives and the legislators have we

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
not.

06:25.000 --> 06:36.000
And we have constantly found ourselves in a position where executive, directives or orders have been

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
squarging, sometimes deported by a cabinet.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
And the question is, where is that line drawn?

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
And what a senatorial investigating committee may do about it is something that you and I know

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
can be revealed and illuminated in this room.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Is that right?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Yes.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
But it cannot be decided.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
I'm sorry, I'm sure there are a lot of things we can't decide in this room.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
Now the second thing that we have revealed and illuminated is this.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.400
We have the question of the right of a senator whether on this committee or any committee to

07:22.400 --> 07:29.400
receive top secret documents from governmental employees and give them immunity from ever having

07:29.400 --> 07:32.400
their names known.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
We have that question, don't we?

07:34.400 --> 07:35.400
That's a question for you.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.400
Right.

07:36.400 --> 07:43.400
And then the subsidiary question part of the big one is to whether or not a government employee

07:43.400 --> 07:51.400
who hands a top secret document to a senator has violated some part of his oath of all.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
That's the question that there isn't about that.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
That's right.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.400
Now there is a second.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.400
You know my viewers.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.400
I'm a senator.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.400
As I take a picture, you know mine.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
Yes sir.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.400
My viewers are calling so that we will understand each other.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.400
That is, is this.

08:07.400 --> 08:15.400
Is Jay Edgar Hoover's top fan from the top of a confidential of a document, the word secrets and confidential?

08:15.400 --> 08:19.400
For Welch, that goal, you understand that, don't you?

08:19.400 --> 08:20.400
Yes, I do.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
That goal.

08:21.400 --> 08:31.400
And I do not understand that there is honest, some invisible things which says to whoever has that document,

08:31.400 --> 08:39.400
secrets and confidential, but, and then the invisible things, if anybody that sees the same senator

08:39.400 --> 08:43.400
martyred he ought to have it, is okay to give it to him some nice.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.400
No, sir, I don't think it's that simple.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.400
Well, I like to make things dramatic.

08:49.400 --> 08:56.400
But it is the fact that according to you and the senator, those words to be a little magic and a little impassive,

08:56.400 --> 09:03.400
hot, secret, are said these can be weighed by anyone that has the document.

09:03.400 --> 09:08.400
If he thinks that not enough action is being taken in respect to the document,

09:08.400 --> 09:14.400
and when the person weighing the action gets higher than weight,

09:14.400 --> 09:20.400
you and the senator believe that the person the government didn't call you,

09:20.400 --> 09:26.400
tired of waiting, may comment, see the senator or you and hand you the document.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.400
You still correctly say, you have a very fine way up to the dramatic.

09:30.400 --> 09:36.400
I do think that on the issue here, that's not that simple and maybe it's not that dramatic.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
Well, let's try to make it still.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
The judge has come down to that.

09:40.400 --> 09:47.400
When the government implores you to look day after day, here's a heard copy of this top secret document,

09:47.400 --> 09:50.400
but can't see any action.

09:50.400 --> 09:57.400
I understand it's a cemetery position in yours, that when that person, male or female,

09:57.400 --> 10:00.400
runs out of patience.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.400
It's time then to give the documents to the senator or to you.

10:04.400 --> 10:09.400
I might say very briefly on that, I think the question is this.

10:09.400 --> 10:14.400
This committee that's a well-general legislative organization act as a mandate,

10:14.400 --> 10:20.400
we're in business to investigate instances of dereliction of duty, of lack of duty,

10:20.400 --> 10:23.400
of failure to act on the part of the government agency.

10:23.400 --> 10:31.400
Now, the FBI has been warning a government agency about the presence of a communist or a self-communist

10:31.400 --> 10:34.400
or a spy or a self-scibe in the agency.

10:34.400 --> 10:41.400
And we learned that those FBI warnings have been ignored by people in the heads of that government agency.

10:41.400 --> 10:48.400
That is an example of lack of duty on a part of the executive, which we are not only privileged,

10:48.400 --> 10:52.400
but it's our sworn duty to investigate.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.400
And it's a goal.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.400
I have to be in complete agreement with that, sir.

10:56.400 --> 11:05.400
I think when this committee finds a situation where we, by some curious accident,

11:05.400 --> 11:13.400
we've got a government agency with us, and nothing is done about it, and this committee knows that they are moved in.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.400
You don't think I disagree with that, please.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
You don't think I, sir?

11:18.400 --> 11:21.400
Senator Knoth, Senator Simon, you may answer the question, Senator.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.400
I'm not sure.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.400
I don't think you disagree with that.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.400
I think the world is as if when you say no to it.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
I am.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
Well, I want to go just one step further and say this.

11:28.400 --> 11:34.400
This is a big problem, and it's probably the only problem I know anything about in this world.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
I do know a little about it.

11:36.400 --> 11:41.400
It's a very complicated problem, and it's just that it's not that simple.

11:41.400 --> 11:47.400
Mr. Cawd, I think you and I are sure that this is having the agreement that you won't make a speech at the end of the 10th and the mysterious.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.400
Yes, sir.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
Oh, I see.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
I see.

11:51.400 --> 11:56.400
You're just giving Mr. Welch as much time as possible, Senator.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.400
Put him in the comments.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.400
Oh, Mr. Cawd.

12:00.400 --> 12:04.400
I think we're down to the number 46 and the document.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.400
I read it.

12:10.400 --> 12:18.400
It's pattern followed by a secretary's season and Mr. Adams is here.

12:18.400 --> 12:33.400
As long as only individual comment was the object of the subcommittee's investigation, they made continuing offers of cooperation with the investigation.

12:33.400 --> 12:56.400
But as soon as the folks turn to the infinitely more important questions, who was responsible for protecting communist infiltrations, and protecting commoners who had infiltrated as the conceivable obstacle,

12:56.400 --> 13:01.400
was placed in the path of the subcommittee's search target group.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.400
Is that true?

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
Yes.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.400
Who placed those objects that obstacle in the path?

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
Apparently a lot of people said.

13:08.400 --> 13:17.400
Plains are not, oh, I think Mr. Adams is certainly one of those who I can give you at the not spending time.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.400
They can give you an instant season, they can do?

13:19.400 --> 13:23.400
Yes, I can say that even if the seasons do not want us to go into this.

13:23.400 --> 13:39.400
Well, you saw it there, that the place is perfect, conceivable, obstacle in the path of the subcommittee's search group.

13:40.400 --> 13:46.400
I didn't want to raise the staff for us to find me can left.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
What if the target was?

13:48.400 --> 13:51.400
That's a moment of service, not saying that in my plan.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
I'm saying that's the my question.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
It's a point of order.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.400
I would like to raise the point of order.

14:00.400 --> 14:12.400
I'd like to raise the point of view yesterday, for example, we found new places in foreign testimony responsible for placing out people's map.

14:12.400 --> 14:21.400
It's impossible for this young man to name all the places he just can't do as they're new and strapping up every day.

14:22.400 --> 14:27.400
The following security is not asking the two names he introduced into the country.

14:27.400 --> 14:34.400
I'll say I'm not the same as Mr. Adams, but I'm not objecting to new names that they have any more.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.400
I definitely can't. They have you swear to the sword that you've made.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.400
I don't object to that, is it?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.400
There's none as well, sir.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.400
I think you want matters within my own personal knowledge.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.400
That's all I'm asking you, sir.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.400
I ask you them specifically.

14:50.400 --> 14:57.400
I've been charged 36 times for Apple, Mr. Adams and the Secretary of State.

14:57.400 --> 15:06.400
I think I have read all of this substantial charges in your statement made against Mr. Hemsfield in part three of these.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
Will they have met our thoughts?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.400
They will be here within your personal knowledge.

15:10.400 --> 15:17.400
I haven't asked you about any statements in your that a policy will not within your personal knowledge.

15:17.400 --> 15:21.400
I want to ask you no more for calls.

15:21.400 --> 15:31.400
How do you now agree with me that these charges are serious?

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
Yes.

15:32.400 --> 15:37.400
These are new names for many good states because you thought they were serious.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.400
We stated the fact that we knew them to be so.

15:40.400 --> 15:45.400
Well, if you say the fact that the third man is prominent and prominent, that's the charge against the men.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.400
Don't you so end up to get those all over you?

15:48.400 --> 15:50.400
Certainly, could the interpreter just touch her yet?

15:50.400 --> 15:53.400
I have been trying to make very clear to you, Senator McCollum.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.400
We did as a record, I think.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.400
It makes we are not only by me, but a lot of other things that have happened.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
We did not stop this.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
We wanted to continue.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.400
I'm there. That's the difference.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
That's the beauty of me, too.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
I want to ask you a question about it.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.400
Are you saying now that I have not said any issues this statement?

16:10.400 --> 16:18.400
That you and a never revealed to the country that we did have a secondary of the Army.

16:18.400 --> 16:25.400
And a key counsel of the sovereign communist, would we never know about it except that the Army should be popular?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
You have known about it, sir.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.400
When?

16:27.400 --> 16:31.400
Oh, I think when the testimony on the threat case came in and we found out who promote it.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.400
But you have never made a job.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.400
Oh, I think we were done under the normal laws of its committee, sir.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.400
A lot longer than you do along here.

16:38.400 --> 16:43.400
You've bought it out and all the more making number answers of these things.

16:43.400 --> 16:51.400
Didn't you think it is in 400, these facts were proved to expose it immediately so that we could get it to top?

16:51.400 --> 16:58.400
Sure, at the beginning, Senator McCollum, we had a situation where Mr. Steven and Mr. Adams didn't want us to investigate the problems.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.400
They wanted us to go up with that.

17:01.400 --> 17:07.400
I must say frankly, it was not an unusual experience until far as this or any other investigation was.

17:07.400 --> 17:13.400
The people who were being investigated would be much happier if you would go someplace else and leave them alone.

17:13.400 --> 17:20.400
I did not feel that there was any need of making any formal charge if we could take care of ourselves when we put up a shifty investigation.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.400
We did it.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
The formal charge is there any formal.

17:23.400 --> 17:34.400
Did you think it was important to the security of this country to expose Mr. Adams and the full secretaries, Steven, that these charges against them were proved?

17:34.400 --> 17:35.400
No, I didn't think it was important.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.400
The security of the nation did not tell but it was supposed to be seen from the throughout the country.

17:39.400 --> 17:48.400
I thought it was important for the security of this nation that this committee should continue its sworn obligation to investigate everything that should be investigated.

17:48.400 --> 17:55.400
And if people who were being investigated didn't want us to do it for us, I thought we should go out there with their privilege to try.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.400
A lot of others have tried.

17:56.400 --> 18:12.400
Yes, but you said they were trying by means that indicated that they were attempting blackmail not indicating that you tried by means of blackmail and by holding a private in the army as a hostage.

18:12.400 --> 18:23.400
When that blackmail, the citizens came about and when Mr. Adams went to see the son of a copy that night, I thought he was going to get the right to do that.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.400
Well, all right.

18:24.400 --> 18:30.400
Then you did have the knowledge that according to your charges and your personal interests.

18:30.400 --> 18:49.400
That Mr. Steven, or Secretary Steven and Mr. Adams had gone to that extreme to try to present an investigation of commoners and scientists who used your case, trying to prevent you from finding out who was responsible for the perhaps case.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.400
They were going to that extreme.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.400
Yes.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
That's true.

18:54.400 --> 18:54.400


18:54.400 --> 19:07.400
I don't just think it is possible that if we have some demand that the enemy army of this country, that it be told immediately so that it might be taken to remove it.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.400
The fundamental problem we just got out had immediately.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.400
As soon as the facts and the arrests case and the conduct, they came on.

19:12.400 --> 19:22.400
Senator McCarthy wrote an open public letter, setting forth both of the facts he knew and charging, stating that there had certainly been misunderstanding and misconduct.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.400
He made that letter public.

19:23.400 --> 19:27.400
I think two days, if the forensic vehicle are committing an executive session.

19:27.400 --> 19:41.400
From that time on, Senator McCarthy took a considerable number of steps to bring these matters under the rules of this committee through the attention of the public in the form of a regular subcommittee investigation.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.400
But as I understood you, these charges would have never been made.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.400
There's not so much documents in this.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.400
Is that true?

19:49.400 --> 20:07.400
So certainly, I'm not just right, but the first matter and the role of certain people in the army in trying to cover up those who had been responsible for the promotion and honorable discharge of commoners.

20:07.400 --> 20:11.400
It would have come out, even if it were not for these charges.

20:11.400 --> 20:20.400
You're supposed to something else while it will enhance it to a tiny wealth for 14 hearings that's going to be up.

20:20.400 --> 20:33.400
Don't you agree with me that if your testimony is true, that you have pointed out to the country that you have at the head of the United States Army or the Secondary of the Army, a man who is,

20:33.400 --> 20:37.400
a problem commoner to whom he's signed the Paseco-Bucco Paseco-Bucco Paseco-Bucco Paseco-Bucco.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.400
I would answer that in this way, so far, as paddling communists are concerned.

20:41.400 --> 20:48.400
I have never heard Mr. Stevens say anything to me, who is the President of the United States?

20:48.400 --> 20:55.400
I wanted to say this, sir. I've never heard Mr. Stevens say anything to me, which led me to conclude that he likes communists any better than I do,

20:55.400 --> 21:02.400
or that he wanted to protect communists in any way. I don't believe for a moment that he wanted to do that.

21:02.400 --> 21:07.400
I haven't you charged any business? I think we say this, sir.

21:07.400 --> 21:17.400
That on the question of uncovering individual communists and getting them out of the army, we are sure we were sure that Mr. Stevens was so sub-angous to do that as we were.

21:17.400 --> 21:42.400
On the second question you raised, Senator McClellan, in South Ours, protecting the people who did cover up these communists, we have had differences of opinion with Mr. Stevens and we have felt that people have been trying to get him to enlist his aid in withholding information from Mr. Smith's committee, which would uncover people who have been subtling these communists and we have felt that he has been mistaken in that.

21:42.400 --> 21:49.400
Yes, Mr. Doney, is South Ours being charged? He seems sort of a good person. I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I have a very striking impulse to me.

21:49.400 --> 22:04.400
He's a true or a false person. And if that's true, I assure you I have no interest in this thing except to try to get the two-solving and nifty to, I don't think the sun should go down before action should be taken.

22:04.400 --> 22:15.400
Yes, I agree with me. Yes, I want to say this. I certainly don't want a spoken or pardon any charges. I want to give you the truth and what was said to me and I want to give you the facts.

22:15.400 --> 22:25.400
I have taken your statements. I have asked you to die the question of whenever, George, you have made against Mr. Stevens and you have answered in the affirmative.

22:25.400 --> 22:35.400
Yes, I have. So we may face the language of your charges as your testimony now, as against Mr. Stevens and against Mr. Adam, as being true.

22:35.400 --> 22:41.400
Yes, I would want to stand on the testimony I have given here, particularly. I will be glad to read it firmly and just as I haven't seen you since.

22:41.400 --> 22:47.400
You've given me answers to these when I ask you if that statement was true. Yes, that is law.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
Yes, of course.

22:48.400 --> 22:55.400
Now, before the senator starts questioning and let us return to our observation, I'd rather address Mr. Wells.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.400
Then to the witness.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.400
I just want to say that.

22:59.400 --> 23:05.400
Only to round out the little I think the line of questioning that Mr. Wells is the student.

23:05.400 --> 23:12.400
I would rather subscribe as to be a general thesis.

23:13.400 --> 23:30.400
If you have a whole tale of revelation of the immediate executive language of confidential material, you could develop like a fool, a kind of anarchy, and a lack of devotion, and feel the desire to be a minister to the government.

23:30.400 --> 23:39.400
But a fact is also in a situation that comes into the picture and we had evidence in others, the information with the senator's permission.

23:40.400 --> 24:00.400
I think nearly everyone knows that Senator William DeGelowe can interpret over a period of time and in figures, ladies and gentlemen, in the confidentialization and in addition, although it seems to even government who may evasion or avoid responsible and in some cases, with guilty of criminal commites.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.400
Now the senate finance committee took out this in touch.

24:04.400 --> 24:14.400
They found to rule that this is exactly in my mind a phenomenon, but at least it put a limitation on the disclosure that it's being made.

24:14.400 --> 24:20.400
Senator William, however, as I was told all went by the hand that it is disclosed as on the senate board from time to time.

24:20.400 --> 24:33.400
And all those disclosures were faced upon confidential information that was disclosed to him by someone in the internal atmosphere who is on the rules of the government.

24:33.400 --> 24:49.400
Now the very practical problem that arises is this. If the disclosure had never been made, obviously neither the evasion tax payers, nor the electric governmental service who made it possible could have been dropped to justice.

24:50.400 --> 24:57.400
So the question is, is the practical matter always? Number one, where do you draw them on in a second round?

24:57.400 --> 25:08.400
Where is the limit beyond which, among investors or the body of the Congress cannot draw when it's common people from the executive branch to come and get justice?

25:09.400 --> 25:19.400
I must confess that the problem offers some different things, but I do believe that in connection with your line of discussion, that the practical aspect of a must be revealed otherwise.

25:19.400 --> 25:26.400
Otherwise that introduction may take place separately would not have come to the life of Jason.

25:29.400 --> 25:36.400
Mr. Colm, I don't have too many more questions. I'll soon be through. Good way to Mr. Welch.

25:37.400 --> 25:51.400
I just wanted to follow up on one point. You stated an answer to a question by Senator McCollum with other departments, besides the Department of the Army, attempted to stop investigation.

25:51.400 --> 26:01.400
I believe that was your response. And I also stated that in response to a question that I put previously, that you don't like many memos.

26:02.400 --> 26:15.400
Now, why were the memos written in connection with the Army Chief? I mean, there were the theories of memos. I said I don't like many. I certainly know he's also the file.

26:15.400 --> 26:28.400
You will find a, but you might consider a considerable number of memos written by me. You will not find memos each and every conversation I have had with everybody about everything.

26:28.400 --> 26:41.400
I did not write a memo on each and every conversation I have with Mr. Stevens, Mr. Adams or other people over there. I think I have already set aside it to the circumstances of the writing of these.

26:41.400 --> 26:48.400
Well, I understand that's a thing, but the memos were quite complete. On the Army, commencing about the time when... No sir.

26:48.400 --> 26:55.400
I think we're getting a little hot. No sir, I don't think they were. They were not? No, I don't think so. We've got a long series of them.

26:55.400 --> 27:01.400
No sir, I think that a lot of very significant events were not recorded in the form of memorandum.

27:01.400 --> 27:14.400
Now, one thing that I think should be clarified, in the midst of first program, may create an F-2 about the memorandum.

27:14.400 --> 27:21.400
And you responded on June 11. I think that was March 10th, wasn't it?

27:21.400 --> 27:28.400
You replied, and I think it was the 14th, but it was only one.

27:28.400 --> 27:37.400
March 14th, 16th. I have a right here. I'll give it to him. No, I don't.

27:37.400 --> 27:44.400
Mr. Colne has a comment. I'll take it enough to say. Well, let me just say, I did a question.

27:44.400 --> 27:52.400
May I say that to Mr. Colne, I think if you stand by all the ideas and memorandums for the documents from a party then,

27:52.400 --> 28:01.400
to come, one or two, I believe, only were dictated by me. Others were from some of the McCarthy to Frank's car by subversive.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.400
Now, actually, there are four that you dictated. It was not correct. Skip it.

28:06.400 --> 28:13.400
Whatever I said here, I have to count them up again. Whatever I said here, somebody else came up and I went through them and counted one by one.

28:13.400 --> 28:17.400
I think it came to three or four. Whatever I said is accurate.

28:17.400 --> 28:23.400
Yeah, two of the memorandums that were released to the press, said from you to somebody. Well, they were certainly prepared.

28:23.400 --> 28:35.400
And then two of them without any designation are more than two, maybe, but you state now that two of those that did not have any tag on them were dictated by you.

28:35.400 --> 28:39.400
Yes, I know them, but this one, for instance, was.

28:39.400 --> 28:49.400
I was in other areas, and then all these two are in connection with the testimony of a ton of blocks.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.400
Yes, sir.

28:52.400 --> 29:04.400
If I understand it, you state that you did not request that five of the time be taken off KT on the weekend of January 10th.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.400
No, sir, you don't understand it.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.400
Pardon me? No, sir. I don't believe that's quite accurate.

29:11.400 --> 29:17.400
Well, what is your version of? Find the case directed into it.

29:17.400 --> 29:30.400
No, I don't believe it's my version. I believe it's the fact. The fact is that as far as we were concerned, and as far as I was concerned, private-Chang Hity on KT or all night long or anything like that, we didn't care.

29:30.400 --> 29:39.400
We had an arrangement made with Mrs. Stevens, but he would be available all the weekend to work on these reports and do this committee work.

29:39.400 --> 29:44.400
And that more committee was committed to. Yes, sir. And that nothing would interfere with that.

29:44.400 --> 30:02.400
I think that in all the time he was down there, there were one or two, probably this is the only one. One occasion on which he was given some duty on a Sunday when he was going to work with us on these reports.

30:02.400 --> 30:14.400
I called for tenant plan and asked if they couldn't let him do that same thing on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday some other time.

30:14.400 --> 30:21.400
And let him be available during the day for Smith to see when the fix to do this with.

30:21.400 --> 30:33.400
But you told him you wanted him for committee business that week. Well, the tenant plan was intended to act in the only reason we ever get the arrangement with the cost committee business. And the only reason we ever wanted was on committee business. There's never any doubt about that.

30:33.400 --> 30:42.400
Well, let me reach to you the policy that took place between Senator McCarthy and the tenant blog. Now that's on page 3523.

30:43.400 --> 30:55.400
3523, the transcript. Senator McCarthy. This is what the policy was with the tenant blog. Didn't he tell you that he made arrangements for day signs? It's come back.

30:55.400 --> 31:03.400
The understitute he was coming back that weekend that he was coming back for the purpose of putting in writing some of the intro.
