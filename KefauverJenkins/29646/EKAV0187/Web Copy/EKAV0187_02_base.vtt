WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.280
Well Mr. Brown, I'm Mr. Hensville's office that's the work in connection with the

00:08.280 --> 00:10.280
separate for that chronology.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.880
What is this you've never ordered?

00:12.880 --> 00:17.520
Anyway, you must be able to prepare the charges.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.520
You have to get through now.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.320
Well, I can't answer that yet, you know.

00:23.320 --> 00:28.680
I've seen that you did issue the order or you did not issue the order.

00:28.680 --> 00:35.000
Well, I ordered the relief to the members of this committee and to the other senators

00:35.000 --> 00:37.160
and congressmen who were in it.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.760
That's my responsibility.

00:39.760 --> 00:40.760
All right.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.600
Now we know that you're the relief.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.000
The question is, did you order the preparation?

00:45.000 --> 00:48.440
Did you order those formal charges prepared?

00:49.440 --> 00:55.440
Well, I certainly was, uh, probably connected with it from the time I got back from, uh,

00:55.440 --> 00:56.440
from the party.

00:56.440 --> 01:00.840
Well, Mr. Secretary, someone must have ordered them prepared.

01:00.840 --> 01:05.080
I am asking you the simple question, was it you?

01:05.080 --> 01:07.480
I think the big affair assumption it was made.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.480
Well, it can't be an assumption.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.880
It can't be an assumption, we can't assume things.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.880
Here we want to know.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.880
If you don't remember it now.

01:16.880 --> 01:22.840
I'm telling you that I am responsible for the, uh, for the fact that we supply this information

01:22.840 --> 01:26.680
to the members of this committee and other members of the congress now, by the responsible

01:26.680 --> 01:30.720
for that, I'm saying that it's responsible for having Dr. McIrry a lot.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.920
Mr. Secretary Steven, I am not asking you to do in the line of command as responsible.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.720
I am asking you the simple question.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.760
Did you order these mirrored charges prepared?

01:42.760 --> 01:43.760
Right the words were.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.760
Do you order these charges prepared?

01:45.760 --> 01:47.760
Yes, I would say I did.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.760
So you would say you did?

01:48.760 --> 01:51.760
Who did you order to prepare?

01:51.760 --> 01:55.760
Well, naturally I talked with Mr. Adams about it also.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.120
I talked with Mr. Hensel about it and Mr. Brown about it and others.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.120
Did you tell Mr. Adams to prepare the charges?

02:03.120 --> 02:10.760
No, Mr. Adams had a lot of material as we used in the preparation, but he didn't prepare

02:10.760 --> 02:11.760
it.

02:11.760 --> 02:17.760
And there came a time when the so-called formal charges were prepared, right?

02:17.760 --> 02:21.760
The charges that you filed with the committee.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.760
At some time they had to be prepared.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.760
That's right.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.760
Now I merely want to know who ordered them prepared.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.760
Did you?

02:29.760 --> 02:39.760
Are you talking about the original analogy or the, you know, the one that was later prepared?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.760
I thought I made myself clear.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.760
I said the charges that were filed with the committee.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.760
I assume that.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.760
March 11th they were filed and believed that's the correct date.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.760
There's two papers and I'm just trying to look at that.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.760
I was just waiting.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.760
All right, just the one confused and let's take the chronology.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.760
Who ordered that prepared?

03:03.760 --> 03:08.760
Yes, that was my responsibility for getting that prepared.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.760
You told me that ten times and we get to talk about that.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.760
I don't want to know if you issued an order.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.760
I didn't issue any written order, but I said I wanted to prepare.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.760
All right, who did you tell you wanted to prepare?

03:19.760 --> 03:21.760
I told Mr. Adams and others.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.760
When did you tell him?

03:23.760 --> 03:26.760
Sometime after my return from the faries.

03:26.760 --> 03:27.760
All right.

03:27.760 --> 03:33.760
Now do you know that the testimony is of the preparation of the command, according to the testimony of Mr. Adams,

03:33.760 --> 03:37.760
long before your return from the faries?

03:37.760 --> 03:41.760
I thought we'd covered that a while ago, but because they, when we said that,

03:41.760 --> 03:45.760
Mr. Adams has a confident lawyer with getting together to remember around him,

03:45.760 --> 03:49.760
some raw material and a file on this project, which he later showed to me.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.760
Everybody came back.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.760
Mr. Secretary, I'm going to read your testimony.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.760
You're under open.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.760
I know a few.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.760
Page 1949 and a few four six years ago.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.760
We get it.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.760
Page 1949, volume 11.

04:01.760 --> 04:06.760
First question.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.760
Do you have that, counsel?

04:09.760 --> 04:10.760
First question.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.760
Who decided to prepare it?

04:13.760 --> 04:16.760
First, my son, I'm a father.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.760
Who decided to prepare it?

04:18.760 --> 04:19.760
Secretary Steven.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.760
Who decided to prepare it?

04:21.760 --> 04:23.760
Son, I'm a father yet.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.760
What's your day of slavery?

04:25.760 --> 04:28.760
I don't know who decided to prepare it.

04:29.760 --> 04:34.760
I know that Mr. Hentel doesn't touch with me, and asked me to see Mr. Brown

04:34.760 --> 04:36.760
and discuss these matters with him.

04:36.760 --> 04:43.760
When I did that, I assumed that Mr. Hentel was probably acting in the orders of the Secretary of Defense.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.760
I don't know.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.760
Now, were you telling me to suit them, Mr. Secretary?

04:49.760 --> 04:51.760
Well, this is no laughing matter.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.760
We ask you them who prepared these charges.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.760
Thirdly, I don't know.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.760
Now, when I asked you when you were telling the truth, you grim and smart to laugh.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.760
This is too serious for the laughing matter, Mr. Fakter.

05:04.760 --> 05:10.760
First, is where you're telling the truth when you said I don't know who decided to prepare it?

05:10.760 --> 05:15.760
He was probably acting in the orders of the Secretary of Defense.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.760
You say I don't know.

05:17.760 --> 05:23.760
Now, the day you said a few issues in the order, we must find a hot day you're telling the truth.

05:23.760 --> 05:30.760
I think that's a bit unfaulful, I'll lie on my side, so, Senator.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.760
You're all right.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.760
Let's be clear, Mr. Fakter.

05:34.760 --> 05:39.760
You told us that the day you said a few orders, the charges were prepared.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.760
The charges were 1929.

05:41.760 --> 05:46.760
The last time you said a few orders, I don't know who decided to prepare it.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.760
I assumed Mr. Hentel was probably acting in the order of the Secretary of Defense.

05:50.760 --> 05:55.760
So, let's go one of the pro-Nomple's sentences.

05:55.760 --> 06:03.760
The question, too, is the truth that as you said a day, you ordered them prepared?

06:03.760 --> 06:09.760
Or is the truth that as you said the last time you were here, I don't know who decided to prepare it?

06:09.760 --> 06:16.760
Well, I know Senator McCarthy that I talked with Mr. Wilson about this, when I talked with Mr. Hentel about it.

06:16.760 --> 06:28.760
I never issued any written order to prepare these charges, but I feel as the responsibility for the issue of the committee is completely long.

06:28.760 --> 06:38.760
And if it is a fact that Mr. Wilson has knowledge of the situation, please meet Mr. Hentel there and serve me either.

06:38.760 --> 06:53.760
And I am flying to the best of my ability, put before this committee, the fact that I feel in my heart that my responsibility was completely long.

06:53.760 --> 07:02.760
Although I did, the best of the matter was Mr. Hentel and was the Secretary of Defense.

07:02.760 --> 07:09.760
Mr. Hentel was a year alone, flying to get me into the one person.

07:09.760 --> 07:16.760
I don't enjoy keeping him in the fan and definitely what I've got to find out if I can.

07:16.760 --> 07:25.760
Other than that, it is true that you don't know who decided to prepare the order to the charge, as you said.

07:25.760 --> 07:39.760
Well, however, as you said a day, you ordered him to prepare. Now, if you're just repeating the responsibility of yours, I know that the Secretary of the Army, the Senate, the Mayor of the responsibility, don't give yours.

07:39.760 --> 07:52.760
The charges were slightly different, the appropriate for the charges. But, as we know from the time the money before you returned to the party, you don't know who ordered the charges.

07:52.760 --> 07:59.760
That was not the, that was not the, uh, preparation of charges. That was raw material, memorandum, for the file.

07:59.760 --> 08:06.760
All right, that's nothing to do with charges. One final answer, Hentel.

08:06.760 --> 08:16.760
Who made the decision? Who each of the order were more otherwise? That's the formal charges.

08:16.760 --> 08:27.760
The one file on March 11th of the committee, we prepared. Was that you, do you remember who it was? If not, no.

08:27.760 --> 08:34.760
Well, Senator, I can only do to the subject of the best of my recollection of ability.

08:34.760 --> 08:42.760
And that is, Mr. Wilson, I talk with him about this. I talk with Mr. Hentel. I talk with Mr. Brown.

08:42.760 --> 08:48.760
There was no written order, every issue is the far as I'm aware of where it's connected with this matter.

08:48.760 --> 08:58.760
But, may I never issue any? I believe that it was my responsibility, and that undoubtedly I did, order them to be made up.

08:58.760 --> 09:03.760
You've been under the living room for so long.

09:03.760 --> 09:10.760
I've signed very, very hard to recall, kind of a part of the work. If you can't control what I'm doing is, uh,

09:10.760 --> 09:18.760
accessing the responsibility for those charges. Mr. Mr. Wilson, you cannot cover up any of my touching responsibility.

09:18.760 --> 09:23.760
I'm not trying to cover it right now. If you don't remember, there isn't anyone to cover up.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.760
But I've signed it. Give it all the names and all the facts that I can't reconnect with this matter.

09:28.760 --> 09:40.760
This is like at a one final attempt. Do you remember for the U.H. of the order of the charges to be prepared?

09:40.760 --> 09:44.760
I know that someone has to issue that order.

09:44.760 --> 09:55.760
Senator, if you'll just take a little bit of background here. What perhaps we have these interlates from senators, members of this committee, and otherwise.

09:55.760 --> 10:03.760
senators and congressmen, and some kind of an answer to their inquiries had to be prepared.

10:03.760 --> 10:20.760
Now, that's what was done in connection with this thing, including efforts to answer the first things inquiries that we have from the Senate and the House in regard to private beach at the time of the day of the chance.

10:20.760 --> 10:26.760
And that's how the thing was started. The start of the answer to inquiries from up here.

10:26.760 --> 10:33.760
It wasn't started as an issue of charges.

10:33.760 --> 10:40.760
But look at the review from your formal charges.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.760
Formal statements about it.

10:42.760 --> 10:49.760
The statement about the types of the army in the garbage used to be in the state of the 20s.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.760
Now, as the Congress charges, I urge them to go ask for the military in the air force.

10:54.760 --> 11:04.760
When I will give you a blackmail, I call your attention to the fact that these charges are nothing whatsoever to do with each other raised by some of their partners, luckers.

11:04.760 --> 11:13.760
As the fellow undoing, influential views by Senator McCarthy and his staff, sub-dain preferential statements for private shines.

11:13.760 --> 11:28.760
The former refresher recollection, like all your attention to your testimony on the end of the year, in 1940, has been extradited because it will take some time to identify the facts.

11:28.760 --> 11:45.760
The statement in all the plan is to vote under McCarthy and the Secretary of the Army, unless they speak to the Army, as not given the direct answers to a direct question.

11:45.760 --> 11:51.760
I would say that critically, I say that in all punishments.

11:51.760 --> 12:04.760
And it may be the thought of some of the members of the committee that your fingers give a direct question to many, I insist accounts for the fact that you've been on the witness stand for long.

12:04.760 --> 12:33.760
And I think it is a proper question. And I think in the ancient direct statements, it isn't a question of whose responsibility it was for the cooperation of these charges that were released on March the 11th, with the senators entitled to know and the members of this committee are entitled to know whether or not you directed the preparations of that chronological statement of the ranch release on March the 11th.

12:33.760 --> 12:40.760
And pursuing the senator's question, Father, I call your attention to this.

12:40.760 --> 12:47.760
Secretary Steven, will you identify the patient of the page number 1949?

12:47.760 --> 12:52.760
If that's the case, you will identify the number you were reading from.

12:53.760 --> 13:01.760
And I don't, if you're testimony of Mr. Secretary, I don't know who decided to prepare.

13:01.760 --> 13:08.760
I know that Mr. Hinton got into the UNFD to see this brown and discuss these matters with him and I did that.

13:08.760 --> 13:14.760
I, in the defense, who was probably acting under orders to the Secretary of the Defense, I don't know.

13:15.760 --> 13:27.760
Now Mr. Steven, the time is saying this morning you say that you direct in the preparation of this front of 34 page chronological statement of the ranch.

13:27.760 --> 13:34.760
The electorate, I said that I had responsibility for Mr. Jackson.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.760
And I know, I'm not talking about responsibility.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.760
You were soon for responsibility and let's get away from that.

13:42.760 --> 13:52.760
We've all got the responsibility for certain acts of our subordinates and sometimes they do an act that I direct him and sometimes they do it on their own initiatives.

13:52.760 --> 14:00.760
But we're talking about a 34 page document released to the public on March the 11th.

14:01.760 --> 14:07.760
The question now is, did you or not him and then I think he's the nice to me with a yes or no?

14:07.760 --> 14:20.760
Did you or not direct our order or suggest the preparation of that 34 page chronological statement of the ranch?

14:20.760 --> 14:24.760
I suggested it. You did suggest it.

14:25.760 --> 14:30.760
And so now are we to assume that it was done?

14:30.760 --> 14:33.760
How do you suggest it?

14:33.760 --> 14:41.760
Well, and others, Mr. Jenkins, because as I said Mr. Wilson was fairly familiar with this thing.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.760
And so was Mr. Hempel.

14:43.760 --> 14:53.760
And I think Mr. Smith, as I said here on page 1949, I think Mr. Hempel got in touch with me probably the suggestion of Mr. Wilson.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.760
And then Mr. Hempel and I discussed the matter together.

14:56.760 --> 15:00.760
Well, now Mr. Secretary, is this final question?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.760
Focus, final.

15:02.760 --> 15:07.760
You say you suggest the preparation of that 34 page document?

15:07.760 --> 15:13.760
How do you reconcile that statement which you just made that you suggested it?

15:13.760 --> 15:20.760
With your statement on page 1949 of the record in which you state that you don't know?

15:21.760 --> 15:27.760
I tried to explain this to Jenkins to the best of my very limited ability.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.760
There was no written order about it at all.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.760
Mr. Wilson was familiar with the thing.

15:35.760 --> 15:48.760
So as Mr. Hempel, we discussed it together, and Satan knew about it, and it's just exactly who in the final analysis said what to do?

15:48.760 --> 15:52.760
It isn't as clear as I would like to be able to make it.

15:52.760 --> 16:02.760
It just isn't, but I'm prepared to say that I suggested it, and I think it may have been suggested by others too.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.760
I think that's all I can do.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.760
Here is no question this time.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.760
Senator Trello?

16:15.760 --> 16:21.760
While they're going around, let's return to our studios across the country to permit our station to identify themselves.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.760
This is ABC Television Network.

16:30.760 --> 16:36.760
This is WABD, Channel 5, New York. Money is the root of all.

16:36.760 --> 16:40.760
It's an idea. Can't we have a little honor?

16:40.760 --> 16:43.760
No, it's not.

16:43.760 --> 16:49.760
Mr. Hempel, is anybody in the White House to put these orders together or tell you to put them together?

16:49.760 --> 16:50.760
No, sir.

16:50.760 --> 16:55.760
Did anybody in the Department of Justice ask you to put them together or tell you to put them together?

16:55.760 --> 16:56.760
No, sir.

16:56.760 --> 17:01.760
Did anybody in any other executive for the Fourth of the government ask you to put them together or tell you to put them together?

17:01.760 --> 17:03.760
Except the Pentagon building, no, sir.

17:03.760 --> 17:08.760
Then what is I understand your testimony, and I'm just trying to get ahead with this thing?

17:08.760 --> 17:12.760
There were discussions in the Pentagon building with respect to these.

17:12.760 --> 17:16.760
In your opinion, improper action.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.760
Is that correct? Yes, sir. Or pressure.

17:18.760 --> 17:24.760
And that's that discussion properly. The Secretary of Defense was there sometimes and sometimes he was not.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.760
That's right.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.760
And probably Mr. Hempel and Mr. Brown were there sometimes and sometimes were not.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.760
That's right.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.760
And you were there sometimes and sometimes were not.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.760
That's right.

17:34.760 --> 17:45.760
And you discussed it as a matter of an internal problem in the Pentagon with all the people including your chief, the Secretary of Defense Wilson.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.760
Is that right? Yes, sir.

17:47.760 --> 18:00.760
And at a point it was decided that based on the notes that Mr. Adams got up and based on other information that you got up and based on information that Mr. Hempel got up and Mr. Brown got up and very possibly Mr. Wilson got up.

18:00.760 --> 18:04.760
And at that point it was decided that these charges were to be published.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.760
Is that correct? Where to be supplied to those who would ask for it?

18:07.760 --> 18:12.760
Now is there anybody in the Pentagon who will not take responsibility for putting these charges out?

18:12.760 --> 18:15.760
Who will not take it? That is correct. I don't think so.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.760
Everybody in the Pentagon believes before a human law in the story that they should be put out? Yes, sir.

18:19.760 --> 18:27.760
But you're coming before this committee and saying that in the Secretary of the Army they will put out under your authority or with your responsibility.

18:27.760 --> 18:32.760
Is there any way that anybody wants to take it at this side of the table? Is that correct? That's correct.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.760
I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.760
Mr. Wilkins?

18:38.760 --> 18:45.760
Well, I would only like to point out that Mr. Jacobs was sure we could do this in a few minutes by...

18:45.760 --> 18:52.760
I told the Secretary he'd be here very short time. I would like to conclude it at some reasonable time.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.760
Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Cohn. Mr. Cohn.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.760
Mr. Secretary, I just want to answer a few questions. You're right.

18:59.760 --> 19:12.760
Vice-Senator Simon's questions to you. And I want to suggest to you, sir, that some of the answers that you've given him are directly contrary to previous born testimony given and previous born testimony given by Mr. Adams.

19:12.760 --> 19:20.760
Now, if you tell Senator Simon's been a little while ago, sir, that the decisions can...

19:20.760 --> 19:35.760
And so far, the Army is concerned relating to this controversy could be made only by the Army or the Department of Defense and not by the White House or the Department of Justice or Advisors' most two plays.

19:35.760 --> 19:40.760
I don't think I said that. Well, could we have the record on that, Mr. Chairman? I think that's very important.

19:41.760 --> 20:05.760
Yes, sir. The President of the Desigmey Commission, we punch the wish, Mr. Seaman, said that the decisions were all made by the Department of the Army and the Department of Defense and by him, and that they were not made at the direction of the Department of Justice or Representative from the White House or anyone on the outside. He was going into the chain of commissation.

20:05.760 --> 20:11.760
Well, that's what you just said there. I think quite different from what you said previously, and I think it's a good thing to have it read.

20:11.760 --> 20:17.760
Fine, I like to... Would you tell us now to say it's time just like you've missed? I like to have it read so that I can see you.

20:17.760 --> 20:26.760
Because my understanding of what you said there is the first time, the difference, once it's taken down, is well, in order to have them both read and say you say the same.

20:26.760 --> 20:31.760
So I will try to get you a good time to question you and read on until the end of the conversation.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.760
No.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.760
That way, it's fine to have read. That's the point.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.760
That's right.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.760
You don't need to read in place.

20:59.760 --> 21:07.760
Just so the reporter will know what to look for. If you'll start and send her to signing the first round of pressing,

21:07.760 --> 21:11.760
the answer is something that's like the no one except I could give a note of the order.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.760
And there are no things about Mr. Cohen.

21:17.760 --> 21:23.760
It's probably far down in the reporter's notes and it's probably been sent down, spare, four.

21:29.760 --> 21:34.760
Mr. Cohen, I'm only capable of handling one subject of the time, please.

21:34.760 --> 21:40.760
I want Mr. McKesting to do an answer until it's the time I've been going on for another topic.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.760
You want to wait?

21:44.760 --> 21:49.760
Anybody in the Pentagon will not take responsibility for putting up the answer at all.

21:49.760 --> 21:50.760
That's right.

21:50.760 --> 21:51.760
That is fine.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.760
The first round of the year is serious.

21:53.760 --> 21:57.760
I'm trying to point out the fact that I feel like that is fine.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.760
I'm trying to do that.

21:59.760 --> 22:08.760
The no one in the White House and the White House, if nobody just at the bottom puts the towel to the bottom of the only one until the sole lawyer would have to come from the department of the department.

22:08.760 --> 22:13.760
And those at the bottom of the only one in each case, if they just follow the other.

22:13.760 --> 22:20.760
You were bringing into question much earlier when Senator Simmons was talking about the line of command and that's right.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.760
For example, the line of command, I think, somewhere else.

22:25.760 --> 22:34.760
Well, in order to try to expedite Mr. Coroner's plan, that the person in the United States to give any order he wants to to the Army at any time he wants to.

22:34.760 --> 22:35.760
Yes, I'm sure that.

22:35.760 --> 22:45.760
We were trying to be one that he reported, or advised us to chair the early around the question, have been sent down to the typewriting room.

22:45.760 --> 22:54.760
So I would suggest Mr. Coroner, we phrase these questions and start over and then perhaps you can proceed without having to be down in series.

22:54.760 --> 22:59.760
I'll certainly try to do that. Mr. Stamins, in your statement, submit this morning.

22:59.760 --> 23:13.760
Did you say I wish to make it perfectly plain that the decisions and acts on the part of the Army concerning the controversy presently being heard by the Senate, not committee, were the decisions and the acts of the Department of the Army all along.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.760
That's the mistake.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.760
Correct.

23:15.760 --> 23:34.760
Full made the decision that Mr. Adams should call on members of the subcommittee on January the 23rd and January the 22nd and tell them that they should help out getting these opinions for the loyalty for a kill and telling them in the alternative about this business about myself and Mr. Shine.

23:35.760 --> 23:36.760
Full made had decisions.

23:36.760 --> 23:45.760
I can't subscribe to all of that language that you had in there, but I'll take a part of it and say that Mr. Adams undoubtedly made the decision himself to go and call on the senator.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.760
He made that decision himself.

23:47.760 --> 23:55.760
Was that decision made by Mr. Adams as a result of suggestion made to him at this meeting with White House Advisors and Justice Department officials?

23:55.760 --> 23:57.760
I suggest you ask Mr. Adams about that.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.760
Well, didn't he tell you about that, sir?

23:59.760 --> 24:00.760
I was out of the country.

24:00.760 --> 24:08.760
Well, there's this statement you make this morning applied to Mr. Adams as well as yourself, namely the decisions and acts with all of the army and the army all along.

24:08.760 --> 24:11.760
That statement stands as a part of the army alone.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.760
And that applies to Mr. Adams as well as the future.

24:14.760 --> 24:15.760
Sure.

24:15.760 --> 24:29.760
Now, what's possibly very much for Mr. Adams, both of the subcommittee under oath, the other day, that I might read, that might be better than my power statement.

24:29.760 --> 24:39.760
He described the meeting he ascended with the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the top presidential assistant, another White House assistant, and the UN ambassador.

24:39.760 --> 24:43.760
He said, to the tools, I recounted the details about the loyalty for ultimatum.

24:43.760 --> 24:51.760
And at Mr. Rogers' express, I described the problem we were having over a private shine and how the two matters seemed to meet the Bay Relay.

24:51.760 --> 25:01.760
After this meeting, Governor Adams asked me if I had a written record of all the incidents with reference to private shine, which I had discussed with them that day, and which I have recounted here.

25:01.760 --> 25:06.760
And when I replied in the negative, he stated, he thought, I should prepare one.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.760
Then I particularly call your attention to this, sir, if I may.

25:09.760 --> 25:27.760
The meeting finally concluded with the decisions that I should call on the Republican members of the subcommittee, the Democratic, the Democratic members were not the members, and point out to them the two problems which I had discussed in the Attorney General's office.

25:27.760 --> 25:51.760
The fact that Mr. Adams was set under oath that a decision was made by the two White House advisors, by two justice department officials, and by the UN ambassador, that certain steps that the taken in connection with this controversy, I think that was completely a suggestion, and I think Mr. Adams acted completely in the pomegranate.

25:51.760 --> 25:59.760
Do you think that his words, the meeting finally concluded with the decision that I should call on the Republican members?

25:59.760 --> 26:05.760
I think Mr. Cohen, when you're on this ban, they have the day for a long time.

26:05.760 --> 26:10.760
It's just fairly possible, once in a while, to use the wrong words, maybe to use the wrong word there.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.760
You think he might have used the wrong words.

26:12.760 --> 26:21.760
Mr. Stevens, do you feel that you used the wrong words when you categorically denied under oath at page 1949 that you had ordered these charges to put out?

26:21.760 --> 26:31.760
I've tried to explain to you that this is who was in this thing, how it's developed, and how the decision was finally tightened to the best of my recollection.

26:31.760 --> 26:43.760
And I'm suggesting, because I know you appreciate this, it's a very important matter to us here, that there is directly contradictory testimony, which cannot be reconciled in which things will go on even further apart this morning.

26:43.760 --> 26:50.760
Now, specifically, you said, page 1949, I don't know whose decided to prepare it.

26:50.760 --> 26:55.760
I know that Mr. Hensfield got in touch with me and asked me to see Mr. Brown.

26:55.760 --> 27:05.760
Now, if you asked Mr. Brown, or if somebody said Mr. Brown to you, and suggest that you give Mr. Brown the facts within you know, Mr. Hensfield got in touch with me about Mr. Brown.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.760
So that was Mr. Hensfield right here, and that your idea.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.760
That's right.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.760
You didn't say, send Mr. Brown down, I've ordered to release the certain charges of the drawing up and setting up the date.

27:13.760 --> 27:13.760


27:13.760 --> 27:14.760
Based on Mr. Brown to you.

27:14.760 --> 27:15.760
That's right.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.760
Then you went on to say, nothing abnormal about that.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.760
I don't think the discussion I don't know.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.760
Mr. Brown, we're just trying to get the facts here.

27:22.760 --> 27:29.760
Now, you said I assume that Mr. Hensfield was probably acting under the orders of the Secretary of Defense.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.760
The writers, I don't know.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.760
That's right.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.760
Well, the right factor is question of who gave all orders.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.760
You said they had categorical issues.

27:37.760 --> 27:42.760
That you did not give the orders that somebody higher up gave the orders.

27:42.760 --> 27:50.760
You don't seem able to understand that sometimes in an administrative department or an executive branch of government or even in a business,

27:50.760 --> 27:55.760
that people have to get together and exchange views and come to some conclusions.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.760
And it very frequently happens that there's no written order that comes out of that.

27:59.760 --> 28:04.760
Or that no one single person has issued the order.

28:04.760 --> 28:08.760
It's that it's that it's a get together of the different types of views.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.760
And I've indicated to you that Mr. Wilson knew about this.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.760
Mr. Hensfield was to Brown, Mr. Adams and myself.

28:14.760 --> 28:25.760
And I want to take the responsibility for the decision and apply to explain to you the very best way I claim as to how some of these executive departments decisions are reached.

28:25.760 --> 28:33.760
I'm sure that's an I'm very sorry that this has taken this long, but we still don't have an answer to what is the crucial question which causes me to adjourn for a full week.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.760
Now that question is who did give this order?

28:36.760 --> 28:42.760
Now you were very desperate when you were here the last time and I might leave this to you to reflect your recollection.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.760
Did you order them for that?

28:45.760 --> 28:48.760
That was a question by Senator McRath, Secretary T.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.760
No sir, I didn't order them for that.

28:51.760 --> 28:56.760
We did not put them out, Mr. Cone and I have explained that at least 25 times.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.760
We did not put them out.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.760
How did you mean by the words put out when you used them on that date?

29:01.760 --> 29:08.760
Not. I was explaining to you repeatedly that what we did was to answer inquiries that we had for members of the front of the house.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.760
We didn't put them out.

29:11.760 --> 29:18.760
Well, maybe if we could do a different thing, could you tell us what you meant by put out here?

29:18.760 --> 29:19.760
Let me give this to you sir.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.760
And then this is awfully important, sir.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.760
We could get it directly in.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.760
Who decided to prepare?

29:25.760 --> 29:28.760
We're getting back to the preparations with these charges with the pages these years.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.760
Who decided to prepare?

29:30.760 --> 29:31.760
Secretary C.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.760
Who decided to prepare?

29:32.760 --> 29:34.760
Senator Mataji, yes.

29:34.760 --> 29:38.760
Secretary Steven, I don't know who decided to prepare.

29:38.760 --> 29:44.760
I know that Mr. Hensel got in touch with me and asked me to see Mr. Brown and discuss these matters with him.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.760
Hensel sent Brown to use.

29:46.760 --> 29:47.760
And I did that.

29:47.760 --> 29:52.760
I assume that Mr. Hensel was probably acting under orders of the Secretary of Defense.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.760
Yes, ma'am, he won't do it.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.760
Somebody else gave you an answer.

29:55.760 --> 29:56.760
I don't know.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.760
Or...

29:57.760 --> 30:00.760
But are these charges worth put out?

30:00.760 --> 30:01.760
And title.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.760
All these charges are something to that effect.

30:03.760 --> 30:04.760
You would say they're the worst.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
Or if they're in a McCartley, they were wrong.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
He used the words put out.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.760
They're not my words.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.760
Well, you said on reading your answer.

30:10.760 --> 30:11.760
No sir, I didn't.

30:11.760 --> 30:12.760
What of them put out?

30:12.760 --> 30:14.760
Why did you send them a copy, man?

30:14.760 --> 30:15.760
I didn't.

30:15.760 --> 30:16.760
I didn't know what them put out.

30:16.760 --> 30:23.760
I ordered just the answers to the inquiries that we'd have to remember the committees and the Senate and the House.

30:23.760 --> 30:28.760
The patient has answers to their inquiries in regard to the matter of private charge.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
Why did you send them a copy, man?

30:29.760 --> 30:32.760
Why did you think they're sending them a copy, man?

30:32.760 --> 30:36.760
When he sent following the questions I've raised, you sent you orders and referring to the charges.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.760
But make it a public.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.760
Make it a public.

30:39.760 --> 30:40.760
Uh, that was...

30:40.760 --> 30:41.760
Is that what you meant, Hensel?

30:41.760 --> 30:43.760
That's exactly what I thought he meant.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.760
And I did not say that.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.760
And I did not say that.

30:45.760 --> 30:52.760
Can you tell me any place in the records at this point, when sending them a copy, use the words and make them public?

30:52.760 --> 30:54.760
Well, I don't know that's a long record.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.760
Well, it's in the case, sir.

30:55.760 --> 31:03.760
But when he used the words put out, I understood that what he meant was that we'd given them out to the public, which we did not do.

31:03.760 --> 31:10.760
Well, sir, as far as we were trying to do was answer inquiries from the Congress in regard to private charge.

31:10.760 --> 31:11.760
We didn't put anything out.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.760
I think.

31:12.760 --> 31:21.760
Now, uh, to go on and answer many, you said, you said in your office, you said in the previous committee, that the issue was raised by Senator Partis left.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.760
That's true.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.760
The I-4-3-2-5-20.

31:24.760 --> 31:33.760
The issue raised by Senator Partis left as to whether undue influence was used by Senator McCarthy and his death to obtain professional treatment.

31:33.760 --> 31:38.760
There were many inquiries that have come to us before it's under the... before it's under Partis left.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
Many inquiries.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.760
Did you reply to those other many inquiries there?

31:41.760 --> 31:42.760
Yes, we did.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.760
Did you release the charges?

31:44.760 --> 31:45.760
I'm sorry.

31:45.760 --> 31:46.760
I'm sorry.
