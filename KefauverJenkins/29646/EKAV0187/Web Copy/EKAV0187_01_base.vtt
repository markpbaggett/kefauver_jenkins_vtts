WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.560
These charges were punished to members of this committee, and other interested senators

00:10.560 --> 00:15.760
and Congressmen, as they resolved their increasing interest in the subject of privacy, the

00:15.760 --> 00:16.760
G. David Shaw.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.960
Right now, I'm going to bring something up with that I just want to bring out.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.560
In fact, I just want to be one of our accountors here at the table about this.

00:25.560 --> 00:33.160
At the time we just got to, we didn't feel as if it's significant to over-view the conference

00:33.160 --> 00:37.040
of the 21st, I considered, are considerable significant now.

00:37.040 --> 00:47.920
This, my assets, and views your assessments, who did it today, as the charges and made public

00:47.920 --> 00:51.920
as a result of our trust from Senator Parker.

00:51.920 --> 01:01.160
If you were to learn now that the charges were written, that they suggest that Mr. Adams

01:01.160 --> 01:07.240
of the White House left, and Mr. Rogers of the Attorney General of office, if you were

01:07.240 --> 01:13.440
to learn that the force of Senator Parker rules that letter, you received a call from

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
the president.

01:14.440 --> 01:19.440
I am the executive department, I'm not speaking about the Pentagon.

01:19.440 --> 01:25.120
Asking him if he would include his right-side letter, so the charges could be made public.

01:25.120 --> 01:32.080
But if it was you to be used as a vehicle for that, would you still fix your trust relief

01:32.080 --> 01:38.200
that you and you alone were responsible, me and I say I'm not going to ask another

01:38.200 --> 01:45.200
matter, anyone else, the name, the executive of special, I have very high respect for the

01:45.200 --> 01:53.200
individual involved, I'm sure he didn't do it in the dawn, but can you answer the question,

01:53.200 --> 01:54.200
is that too involved Mr. Parker?

01:54.200 --> 01:58.200
I think it's too involved, too complicated, too hypothetical.

01:58.200 --> 02:05.200
I think Senator Parker should make it too worthwhile.

02:05.200 --> 02:16.200
I'm not going to clarify the question, the question which Senator asked Secretary Stacy

02:16.200 --> 02:25.200
about somebody in the high position of the State of America government, is asking that

02:25.200 --> 02:35.200
the letter be directed to Secretary of Defense to secure this information, I agree that

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
that occurs.

02:36.200 --> 02:43.200
However, I think the purpose of the letter was not in accordance with what was done there,

02:43.200 --> 02:48.200
a state purpose of the letter, as well as the members of this committee.

02:49.200 --> 02:55.200
As my understanding is that it is complicated to provide official relief, executive

02:55.200 --> 03:02.200
and to government, then you get Mr. Parker's want to be ready to bring it to members of the

03:02.200 --> 03:12.200
other public in the Congress, but there have been always one from the majority side of

03:12.200 --> 03:20.200
the public committee, and it all turned us for us to have to assume you responsible.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.200
And we should have a confidence in thought.

03:23.200 --> 03:30.200
So, what is to be used as an example, one that was not to be used as a vehicle for security,

03:30.200 --> 03:39.200
but it was to use the effort to get to this floor at least as soon as other members

03:39.200 --> 03:40.200
were asked.

03:40.200 --> 03:48.200
So, I think to be all furnace to the official working fellowgers, alludes to that we should

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
clarify that.

03:49.200 --> 03:54.200
And they turn and fire you around the wheels, Senator.

03:54.200 --> 03:59.200
And while they are going around the table for more questions, let's return to our studio

03:59.200 --> 04:02.200
to cooperate to amend our stations to identify each other.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.200
This is 18th television network.

04:33.200 --> 04:39.200
The next part, warming up the sort of thing he told us on the radio was not a 70-footing

04:39.200 --> 04:40.200
or a 50-footing.

04:40.200 --> 04:47.200
I think always we'll be there, but he certainly reports directly to me, and is one of my

04:47.200 --> 04:53.200
facts, but as I understand it, you told Senator Stammington in response to one of his questions.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.200
That's right.

04:54.200 --> 05:04.200
Mr. Adams received his orders and certainly orders pertaining to the preparation and

05:04.200 --> 05:06.200
prosecution of each other directly for me.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.200
That's the right one.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.200
That's right.

05:09.200 --> 05:16.200
Now you were away from the country, and in the party, as we understand it, on January 21.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.200
That's right.

05:17.200 --> 05:31.200
Did you know of a meeting between your counsel, Mr. Adams, and the attorney general, Mr.

05:31.200 --> 05:37.200
Brown, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Chairman Adams, Mr. Henry Cabas-Motton, before you returned to this

05:37.200 --> 05:38.200
country to see this?

05:38.200 --> 05:40.200
No, I'm not sure if I forgot facts.

05:41.200 --> 05:48.200
I knew that when, third February, the third day of preparation, which would be some

05:48.200 --> 05:54.200
approximate mid-Saham hour 12 days, that's the one to the meeting of January 21.

05:54.200 --> 06:03.200
Now you were as opposed to the testimony of Adam and his red, and we stated that on January 21,

06:04.200 --> 06:14.200
a suggestion was made to him by Mr. Chairman Adams that he prepared a statement of all of

06:14.200 --> 06:19.200
the events concerning the day's desire of collecting this message.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.200
I'd like to have that question read back for you.

06:23.200 --> 06:31.200
You have heard that certainly a part of the testimony of Mr. Dunkey, Adam Drey, in which

06:31.200 --> 06:33.200
the testimony was made to him.

06:33.200 --> 06:40.200
That Mr. Chairman Adams suggested to him on January 21 that he prepared a statement or a

06:40.200 --> 06:44.200
memorandum of all events concerning the day's desire.

06:44.200 --> 06:53.200
Mr. Chairman, the word is, the word and records, is very well, that he prepared a written

06:53.200 --> 06:54.200
statement.

06:54.200 --> 06:58.200
You've got Mr. Wilson, I can't believe he's saying these.

06:58.200 --> 07:03.200
A long way concerning the day's desire, you've already said testimony read.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.200
Yes, sir.

07:04.200 --> 07:19.200
And Mr. Secretary, do you know as a matter of fact that two days there is on January 23,

07:19.200 --> 07:28.200
Mr. Adams began the preparation of that statement just yesterday.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.200
Well, he did not begin that preparation of that statement.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.200
Did you suggest you made it?

07:34.200 --> 07:36.200
No, I was out of the country.

07:36.200 --> 07:41.200
I only gave you another excerpt from the testimony of Mr. Adams.

07:41.200 --> 07:46.200
Page 26, 25, Mr. Wells.

07:46.200 --> 07:52.200
Mr. Adams, when did you begin dictating this memorandum which was conceived by Mr. Rogers?

07:52.200 --> 07:58.200
You understand we're referring to Mr. Rogers, the assistant attorney general of the Mr. Brown

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
L, is that correct?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
Yes, sir.

08:00.200 --> 08:09.200
Mr. Adams, on the following morning, which was the 23rd of January, I've been very disturbed

08:09.200 --> 08:13.200
about the substance in the meeting in Senator McCrarty's apartment and I have been disturbed

08:13.200 --> 08:16.200
about the events of the week.

08:16.200 --> 08:22.200
You probably learned upon your return and you certainly know now that Mr. Adams had a conference

08:22.200 --> 08:24.200
with Senator McCrarty in the apartment.

08:24.200 --> 08:31.200
One evening of January 22, one day, I served his meeting with Mr. Sherman Adams and others.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.200
Correct, is it?

08:32.200 --> 08:33.200
Yes.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.200
Are you being out of the country?

08:36.200 --> 08:42.200
Are you not letting me give suggestions to Mr. Adams that he's been given the preparation

08:42.200 --> 08:44.200
of this memorandum?

08:44.200 --> 08:51.200
Mr. Adams, 25, decides that on the 21st day of January, Mr. Sherman Adams, the gistens

08:51.200 --> 08:56.200
of his info and perhaps Mr. Rogers, the gistens that he's been told.

08:56.200 --> 09:04.200
Would you not now say Mr. Secretary, in all fact, that Mr. Adams prepared our studies of

09:04.200 --> 09:13.200
preparation of all events a written document of all events pertaining to the David Shine

09:13.200 --> 09:19.200
artistic gistens of either Mr. Sherman Adams or Mr. Rogers?

09:19.200 --> 09:22.200
Well, he does not prepare some to be served.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
Stephen?

09:23.200 --> 09:28.200
Well, I was looking at Mr. Adams' custom on me here and he says he was very much disturbed

09:28.200 --> 09:35.200
and I think he simply began to put these things down, get it from shape so he can report to

09:35.200 --> 09:41.200
me when I got back and seem to me to be a very natural thing to do.

09:41.200 --> 09:48.200
He further says that two days prior to the preparation of this statement, Mr. Sherman Adams

09:48.200 --> 09:50.200
said he suggested he did it.

09:50.200 --> 09:57.200
Mr. Chairman, once again, Mr. Statement Mr. James, in favor of me, he will read on page 262.

09:58.200 --> 10:04.200
He will find that what Mr. Adams did as a result of the suggestion was to dictate a whole series

10:04.200 --> 10:09.200
of memorandum for his files about the events.

10:09.200 --> 10:15.200
And on a later occasion, those were all told together and were used in some places

10:15.200 --> 10:19.200
for the full-called places of events that were sent to Senator Potter.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
Now, what's Mr. Adams?

10:21.200 --> 10:24.200
He's, I'm not sure what he's going to talk about as an author.

10:24.200 --> 10:29.200
Not the funny thing was to dictate as any lawyer might a whole series of memorandum

10:29.200 --> 10:35.200
arose in his diary and he's a resume of his telephone call and gets together what

10:35.200 --> 10:40.200
human suggestions and I would call the role material for his files.

10:40.200 --> 10:47.200
Now that unquestedly took place, but that, sir, is one step, one long step removed

10:47.200 --> 10:52.200
and one long step prior to the preparation of the paper had its events.

10:52.200 --> 10:59.200
Did he not further statement to us that statement of the event which he began to prepare

10:59.200 --> 11:09.200
on January 23rd was used as a basis upon which this homological 34-page statement of events

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
was prepared.

11:11.200 --> 11:18.200
I think he must have thought that he must have thought that he must have thought that he must have thought that very well.

11:18.200 --> 11:25.200
And now, Mr. Stevens, again, you were a way to give him the files that he prepared

11:25.200 --> 11:34.200
in the raw statement, Mr. Welch calls it from which later the 34-page document was prepared.

11:34.200 --> 11:43.200
And Mr. Adams says that he was advised by Mr. Sherman Adams and Mr. Rogers to scold him.

11:44.200 --> 11:57.200
Now, question now is, isn't it a file of such a, that's the basis upon which the 34-page event was prepared

11:57.200 --> 12:05.200
was prepared by Mr. John Adams, that's his suggestion of Mr. Sherman Adams and Mr. Rogers.

12:05.200 --> 12:10.200
Mr. I personally don't feel that way about it.

12:11.200 --> 12:18.200
Now, I think that as a good lawyer and a man who was very much discerred was the events of the trip place

12:18.200 --> 12:23.200
such as the meeting of his report with Senator McCarthy, Senator McCarthy's home.

12:23.200 --> 12:30.200
I think he was in an orderly way, getting things together, having some kind of a file on this situation

12:30.200 --> 12:33.200
to discuss with me when I got back.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.200
And, certainly, he did that on his own initiative.

12:37.200 --> 12:43.200
But perhaps as a result of a suggestion, but certainly not as a result of any order.

12:43.200 --> 12:52.200
They will. Now, do you think, if he's conceded to Mr. Adams as a good lawyer, he was conferring with good lawyers?

12:52.200 --> 13:01.200
I'm sure you can see that. Mr. Brown, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Adams, Mr. Adams, and your fellow margin others,

13:01.200 --> 13:04.200
he was conferring an advising museum.

13:04.200 --> 13:14.200
He states in his testimony under oath that they made his suggestions that at least two of the parties present.

13:14.200 --> 13:22.200
Good lawyers, Mr. Sherman Adams don't let his lawyer not, Mr. Rogers is the lawyer.

13:22.200 --> 13:30.200
They made his suggestion that he prepares Mr. Wells says in the role a statement of all events concerning

13:30.200 --> 13:38.200
G-David Chai. Now, that's conceded, isn't it? That's his testimony. He already made this morning.

13:38.200 --> 13:47.200
And it is conceded that on the 23rd day of January, two days later, he began the preparation of such a statement.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.200
You heard that, that's his testimony.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.200
That's correct.

13:51.200 --> 14:00.200
Well, Mr. Stevens, do I now understand you just say that perhaps being the good lawyer that Mr. Adams is,

14:00.200 --> 14:12.200
and having consulted with good lawyers, he began the preparation of this statement from which the 34-page document was mainly drafted,

14:12.200 --> 14:20.200
as the suggestion of Mr. Sherman Adams and Mr. Rogers. Is that a fair assumption, Mr. Secretary?

14:20.200 --> 14:26.200
Well, as the suggestion was made, what do you think of this bureaucratic holiday?

14:26.200 --> 14:35.200
I believe it was influenced by it to any extent in the preparation of this statement in the role of Mr. Wells Colton.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.200
Well, I think it's better as Mr. Adams that question.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.200
But I wasn't in the country. I don't know exactly.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.200
Wasn't Mr. Adams how he reacted and not set a certain standard?

14:47.200 --> 14:59.200
Well, we're trying to find out who inspired the preparation of the first link in the chain of events that led to what's occurring here today,

14:59.200 --> 15:02.200
this investigation.

15:02.200 --> 15:16.200
And I thought I understood you just say while ago you make correct me a fireman error that you said that perhaps are no doubt that Mr. Adams was following the suggestion.

15:16.200 --> 15:21.200
All those parties were meeting for it on January 26th.

15:21.200 --> 15:32.200
I'm a writer and a wrong. He certainly apparently had that suggestion and as a good lawyer he commence to put this law material together to no doubt about Mr. Jackson.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.200
In that case, pursuant to that suggestion, not necessarily.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.200
Well, I'm not going to say anything.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.200
But was he influenced in your opinion?

15:41.200 --> 15:44.200
Well, maybe he took the Jenkins in all fairness.

15:44.200 --> 15:50.200
I think you'd have to ask Mr. Adams what went on to his mind and I kind of have no further questions.

15:50.200 --> 16:19.200
At the same conference on January 21st, Mr. Adams testified that the deputy Attorney General Mr. Roger suggested that he just go this situation concerning Colin and Shine and concerning also the subpoena of the lawyer directly.

16:19.200 --> 16:30.200
With one of the Democratic members of the committee, I should say a Democrat who was formerly a member of the committee, he was not a member at the same time, then the McCleller.

16:30.200 --> 16:43.200
And he, Mr. Adams, acquaint you of that fact that he had been asked for the deputy Attorney General to discuss the situation with the former ranking Democratic member of the committee.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.200
I learned about that.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.200
He follows up to get the chairman.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.200
Yes, the chairman Colin and Judge Rihanna DeRome.

16:51.200 --> 16:55.200
Would you mind going over that conflict again so he could hear it?

16:55.200 --> 16:59.200
Are you happy to have the report or are we decoliqued?

16:59.200 --> 17:09.200
Yes, I am.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.200
Chairman.

17:10.200 --> 17:23.200
At the same conference on January 23rd, Mr. Adams testified that the deputy Attorney General Mr. Roger suggested that he just test the situation concerning Colin and Shine and concerning also the subpoena of the law of the record.

17:23.200 --> 17:32.200
With one of the Democratic members of the committee, I should say a Democrat who was formerly a member of the committee, he was not a member at the same time, but a member of the committee.

17:32.200 --> 17:42.200
Mr. Adams, acquaint you of that fact that he had been asked by the deputy Attorney General to discuss the situation with the former ranking Democratic member of the subcommittee.

17:42.200 --> 17:46.200
Mr. Stevens, yes, I learned about that later.

17:46.200 --> 17:53.200
Mr. Adams, the chairman, that illusion is apparently to a conference with Senator McClellan.

17:53.200 --> 17:59.200
I think the right to chose that conference that plays fire to the meeting after the problem of justice.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.200
On the 19th of January, I believe.

18:02.200 --> 18:06.200
I didn't, it wasn't until the 20th century, the country made it to get to it.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.200
Very well, I thought it was all at the same time.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.200
Thank you, sir.

18:10.200 --> 18:14.200
Thank you for correcting me. The next question would be equally valid either way.

18:14.200 --> 18:24.200
What it seemed to me a logical assumption that Mr. Adams followed the suggestion of Mr. Rogers in the first instance, he might well have followed it also in the second instance.

18:24.200 --> 18:30.200
I'm not sure I understand that.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
I thought it was better.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.200
Two different events.

18:32.200 --> 18:41.200
There's a theme of logic for the assumption that Mr. Adams followed the suggestion that Mr. Rogers made about going to the senator McClellan.

18:41.200 --> 18:48.200
He would also have followed the suggestion that Mr. Rogers made to reduce the writing of this chronology.

18:48.200 --> 18:57.200
I think Mr. Adams, like myself, is amenable to suggest him for trying to accomplish something.

18:57.200 --> 19:02.200
I think that the entire logical assumption on this in 21 is put up the record.

19:02.200 --> 19:06.200
There were no order, he didn't, there were no order, he didn't do anything wrong that long.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.200
He's not an order, he can accomplish something in the public.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.200
That's right.

19:10.200 --> 19:16.200
Yes, this was the testimony here.

19:16.200 --> 19:22.200
Mr. Adams is a reading from page 261-8, Mr. Welk.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.200
Mr. Adams, the testimony.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.200
Just for that reason, I requested an interview with the Attorney General.

19:30.200 --> 19:35.200
Mr. Rogers arranged for the next day, which was the 21st of January.

19:35.200 --> 19:44.200
Later that afternoon, the 21st of January, Mr. Rogers telephoned me and asked me if I would go and see Senator McClellan.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.200
Later on, the front page, sir.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.200
261-8.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.200
The front of the page.

19:49.200 --> 19:55.200
I'm beginning of the first complete new paragraph, by the words, for that reason.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.200
For that reason, I would find it.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.200
We're apparently confused here someplace Senator on date.

20:00.200 --> 20:10.200
For that reason, I requested an interview with the Attorney General, which Mr. Rogers arranged for the next day, which was the 21st of January.

20:10.200 --> 20:16.200
Later that afternoon, Mr. Rogers telephoned me and asked me if I would go and see Senator McClellan.

20:16.200 --> 20:21.200
Who I did not know and tell me the story and how these matters seem to be related.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.200
He arranged for your point.

20:23.200 --> 20:28.200
I went to see Senator McClellan about 6 o'clock in the evening of January 20th.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.200
So I've done that that I quoted as the... I like to correct my date.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.200
I said January 19th.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.200
Yes, but what he wanted today.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.200
Right.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.200
I have no further questions.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.200
Senator McClellan.

20:40.200 --> 20:46.200
The life of our names is taken in vain while I was there for the Jews and the Walsh.

20:46.200 --> 20:53.200
The same as the Adams related to you that he had had a conference with me at the instance of Mr. Rogers.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.200
That could be a thing, General.

20:55.200 --> 21:01.200
I learned about it from time later, Senator McClellan, the south and the south and the southeast of the pond.

21:01.200 --> 21:06.200
Did he relate to you the substance of that conference with blood and blood?

21:06.200 --> 21:13.200
I don't recall, as he said, of the details that I suggested that he go to the Republican members of the committee.

21:13.200 --> 21:21.200
I just don't remember the point he called me a public district.

21:21.200 --> 21:30.200
Did he tell you that I suggested after he gave me this information that I would not have used it unless he put it in writing?

21:30.200 --> 21:32.200
Did he tell you that?

21:32.200 --> 21:34.200
I don't recall it.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.200
Did he tell you that?

21:35.200 --> 21:37.200
I would say it doesn't exist on a regular basis.

21:37.200 --> 21:45.200
Did he tell you that the purpose of coming to see me was because the Lord of the Lord was being defeated just as.

21:45.200 --> 21:51.200
And that, he had saved me from the force, he knew.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.200
And you are near if you would know too.

21:54.200 --> 22:03.200
That if the Lord of the Lord refused the answers to see me, the only action the committee could take would be to either...

22:03.200 --> 22:10.200
...a dark day resolution calling on the Senate.

22:10.200 --> 22:16.200
The sites the members of the Lord's darkened camp are to reject such a resolution.

22:16.200 --> 22:23.200
And that such a resolution would have to come before the close to the media, which I was a member.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.200
You used that, didn't you?

22:25.200 --> 22:26.200
Did he relate to that to you?

22:26.200 --> 22:29.200
I don't recall all of that specifically kind of a problem.

22:29.200 --> 22:34.200
The prior they told you that I advised him to go to the Republican members of the Senate.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.200
Can you recall that?

22:36.200 --> 22:38.200
I like tough death.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.200
There are an interesting advice for once more helpful.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.200
That is the WD attorney general with the government of the Democrats.

22:43.200 --> 22:47.200
It's a lot of my question of that.

22:47.200 --> 22:52.200
I think they've come to the Democrats and listen to those little moody women who have written their song in their hands.

22:52.200 --> 22:57.200
Are they concluded?

22:58.200 --> 23:00.200
As underdaction.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.200
As underdaction?

23:03.200 --> 23:10.200
Mr. Stevens, on page 1458, he testified, and I quote,

23:10.200 --> 23:16.200
this referring to this report, that the connection relates one moment sentence until we get it.

23:16.200 --> 23:19.200
Certainly, I agree.

23:19.200 --> 23:22.200
Page 1458.

23:22.200 --> 23:28.200
While they're looking for this testimony, let's return to our studios across the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

23:28.200 --> 23:33.200
This is ABC Television Network.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.200
The boxing from Eastern Parkway in Supertoler 7.

23:36.200 --> 23:43.200
The slamming, slug says, this mob Baker against Joe Backing, in a 10-round heavyweight made event, not a chance.

23:43.200 --> 23:49.200
The ultimate boxing from Eastern Parkway, gone to the power of 7 to 9 to 10.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.200
He quit.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.200
Perfect coordinated.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.200
And who talked to whom?

24:00.200 --> 24:04.200
This was referenced to the meeting in the Pentagon the night of February 24.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.200
I believe that's correct.

24:06.200 --> 24:13.200
Secretary Stevens, if it was originated then or any other time, which I very much doubt, I have no knowledge of it.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.200
And I had nothing to do with it.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.200
Send them a card.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.200
You say you had nothing to do with it?

24:19.200 --> 24:21.200
Absolutely nothing to do with it.

24:21.200 --> 24:28.200
Senator McCarthy, did you ever discuss with Adam the preparation of these charges, Secretary Stevens?

24:28.200 --> 24:32.200
I'm sure I must have talked to Mr. Adams about it.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.200
After all, he was a department consular, yes.

24:35.200 --> 24:43.200
I was questioned today if the point I want to try to make here by confumer on very briefly after all this discussion.

24:43.200 --> 24:47.200
What your position is with reference to this matter.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.200
My position is this is not a swear campaign.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.200
You mean the charges that you find?

24:54.200 --> 24:55.200
That's correct.

24:55.200 --> 25:15.200
No, Mr. Secretary, do I understand your position to be that while you were out of the Congress, in the Far East, Mr. Adams did have conversations with various people, including this meeting of January 21st, conferred with other people, probably in a defense department.

25:15.200 --> 25:41.200
And then he proceeded to prepare a firm memory, rough notes, which was the basis later for the preparation of the charges by Mr. Brown and Mr. Hempels Office, and which you later ordered, released to the members of the committee and other parties on the Hill who have requested the information.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.200
That's right.

25:42.200 --> 25:49.200
So that's the substance I'm trying to, in my own mind, just get the situation clarified.

25:49.200 --> 26:06.200
I do understand from you then that consul and advice was received from people above, that is in the defense department, and over this meeting on January 21st by Mr. Adams and maybe others within the department of the Army.

26:06.200 --> 26:13.200
That advice was taken back to the Department of the Army and then you made the decision to whether this material should be released.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.200
Does that substance of this system?

26:15.200 --> 26:18.200
I think that's the substance of it, it's my responsibility.

26:18.200 --> 26:25.200
No order came from the law, that is, the entire authority directing you to release this system.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.200
No, no, sir, that's a good idea.

26:27.200 --> 26:34.200
The information was obtained through the collaboration of a lot of people in the executive branch.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.200
That's incorrect.

26:35.200 --> 26:47.200
And it's your understanding that after this meeting on January 21st, no order was given to release that information but only to collect it, and to put it down in memorandum form.

26:47.200 --> 26:53.200
There was no order to collect it, there was a suggestion I had about having some memorandum on the subject.

26:53.200 --> 27:07.200
But no order was made which was the basis, and which you, there was no order issued at that time which later became the basis for your order to release the notion.

27:07.200 --> 27:17.200
Now Mr. Chairman, there's one other thing that I, in fairness to Senator Lodge, I think I must say that the record is a bit confused.

27:17.200 --> 27:28.200
I understand, by your say, that he was working at the White House after the research of the United Nations.

27:28.200 --> 27:39.200
I believe there was a test release I'm informed, issued by the White House saying that he was working for the White House on matters relating to the Hill.

27:39.200 --> 28:05.200
I want to be fair, I know that the public must be a bit confused why the representatives of the United Nations was at this meeting, and I was suggest that appropriate officials supply this committee with a release of what the White House gave to the press at the time he went to work if that is the fact for the White House.

28:05.200 --> 28:11.200
I just want the record to be complete as I mentioned here, and I mentioned this, and I want to be fair.

28:11.200 --> 28:16.200
So here he actually has a legitimate suggestion in the fact that you're released.

28:16.200 --> 28:22.200
Well, I don't have it. I assume the Secretary of France or the government just supply that.

28:22.200 --> 28:28.200
I would like to ask Mr. Welch as comfortable as he could find out from the White House if that's the fact.

28:28.200 --> 28:37.200
I'm doing this only as a matter of fairness. I'm asking only Mr. Welch that you give the committee back, which is previously just made public.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.200
I don't know there will be no possible one of these record awards.

28:40.200 --> 28:49.200
Then the exact and new battery when you and I have a ready access to the White House, I have not reached that busy height.

28:49.200 --> 28:56.200
However, I can help you, and I think you're in very difficult one. If there's anything I can do, you know how to be happy to do it.

28:56.200 --> 29:06.200
Mr. Welch, the press was called to my attention the fact that a press release, been issued by the White House, I believe, back in November.

29:06.200 --> 29:19.200
But he was after the recess of the United Nations that he was working on the lead with the White House in connection with matters on Capitol Hill or matters related to Senate.

29:19.200 --> 29:24.200
I'm only making this observation the third of the Senate is so direct of these things.

29:24.200 --> 29:29.200
And I think he had that fact and I'll be glad to cooperate within my power, sir.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.200
Senator Dirkton?

29:31.200 --> 29:33.200
Senator Povenham?

29:33.200 --> 29:35.200
Senator Potter?

29:35.200 --> 29:36.200
Senator Charlie Edison?

29:36.200 --> 29:38.200
Senator Mitchell Business?

29:38.200 --> 29:41.200
Senator Tommy?

29:41.200 --> 29:50.200
Senator Chairman, I feel a little like the fat lady when the circus has fell down, this is up to a neck of a mishit.

29:50.200 --> 29:58.200
I'm up to my neck and legal thought here about this situation and I'd like to get out of here before fall.

29:58.200 --> 30:04.200
I'd like to ask the secretary this question.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.200
You remember the executive branch of the government, is that correct?

30:07.200 --> 30:09.200
Yes sir.

30:09.200 --> 30:22.200
And in your absence Mr. Adams decided that he would make up a record of the conversations that he'd had with respect to the problem of Mr. G. David Shahn.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.200
Is that right, yes sir?

30:23.200 --> 30:27.200
He submitted those to you when you got back from your trip.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.200
I thought...

30:29.200 --> 30:31.200
Uh...

30:31.200 --> 30:37.200
After you received those, did you discuss those with Secretary Wilson?

30:37.200 --> 30:43.200
I've kept Secretary Wilson from time to time and form, yes.

30:43.200 --> 30:50.200
And did you discuss those with anybody else in the executive branch of the government that you could remember on-hand?

30:50.200 --> 30:53.200
I don't think outside of the department of the front-centered.

30:53.200 --> 31:01.200
But at one time the executive branch of the government was respected, he's legislated, the legislated branch decided that they had a problem.

31:01.200 --> 31:06.200
You can at any time to release that problem because they felt as I understand it, they...

31:06.200 --> 31:14.200
So your secretary factor is in use against Mr. executive branch and therefore the entire executive branch in effect was involved.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.200
That's why a lot of territory is not under fire.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.200
Well, I just want to find out if we've got to talk to the majority of the territory of the government.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.200
What I'm trying to say is that why we're calling it right now is we...

31:24.200 --> 31:29.200
And we've had two witnesses so far. You and Mr. Adams, and I'm trying to push it on.

31:29.200 --> 31:36.200
The reason for this is that if any party of the executive branch is in use, then by any chance, one of them will be able to do it.

31:36.200 --> 31:42.200
It's the matter for the executive side of the government that these charges have been made about undue pressures.

31:42.200 --> 31:49.200
But the future takes a responsibility of issuing the charges because it's under use. That's correct.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.200
I have no further questions, Mr. Adams.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.200
And the door check? Mr. Welch? I have no questions.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
And I'm a graduate, Mr. Comon.

31:58.200 --> 32:05.200
Mr. Adams, the position to be of the students that will give more time to you is finally clear, I hope.

32:05.200 --> 32:09.200
Did you... or did or not, you...
