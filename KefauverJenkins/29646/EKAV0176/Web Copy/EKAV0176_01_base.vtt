WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The sea was all pretty sexy alike.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
That is the one thing that I was always aware of.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
How's that?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
That is the one thing I was always aware of.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
All right, the Army has an obligation not only to every man that it injustices,

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
every man who has been inducted, but every man in all of the other services.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
To see that everybody is treated correctly and justly.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
And if the selected service act is properly administered,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I was always aware of that.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
It was always before me, it always will be.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
And that no man was discriminated over another.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
In the fires I can have anything to do with it, that's never what occurs.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Are given any preferences over another?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
That is correct.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
That every man has to do in the Army just like every other man.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
That's that is correct.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
That is the responsibility you were well aware of.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
It works.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
You are correct.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And you knew that you were being called and has been called.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
About getting one soldier off of safety duties.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
And I'll ask him if it's just even if you didn't dodge it and run from it.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
By refusing to place that call from Mr. Colman.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Well, here, here, I did not dodge anything and run from anything Mr. Duncan.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
You're assuming that I administered the enlistment of five of China.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I did not.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
That was done by General Ryan.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
The only thing that happened was that employees of this committee

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
would call me and ask me to intervene with General Ryan.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Something I did not wish to do.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I avoided that phone call for that service.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
But weren't usually a liaison officer between the Secretary and General Ryan.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
No, I wasn't there.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I talked to General Ryan on a couple of occasions.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
But you put in many calls to some calls to General Ryan about five minutes.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
I made a total of 11 telephone calls to General Ryan and they were on about four or five subjects.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
They were grouped together.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Do you know whether or not he did get off of safety duties?

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
My understanding that when he returned on that weekend,

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
he did not get a put on case at KTB because of the fact that the list he was on was not gone.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Unless you've learned of it, but you did go back to get your back to get that nice.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
When you returned to Washington, I said, that's just a hammer.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Unless you've learned of you went to Mr. Colman's office.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
For the purpose.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
For the purpose.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, I returned to Washington on 9th of January.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Sunday was the 10th, Monday was the 11th.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
My recollection is that my next visit to his office was on the 13th.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And this incident was on the 9th of September.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yes, sir.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Unless you didn't know that he was always for the first purpose as you told the Secretary to get him in a good humor.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
That's right.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
It wasn't really for that express purpose.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
I was in the building. I was in the corridor directly below this room.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
It was about lunchtime.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And I told Mr. Stavins that I thought I'd go down to Colman's car.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And what?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Just trying to figure it out.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
To the right, get the relationship.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
You proved I'm the threat of getting an interview with you.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
You said that.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
That's right.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I didn't have for that.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I was in the first test.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Getting an interview with him.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
On the count of 6, 8 feet into the hammer.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes, I'm serious.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
There's other incidents I think I appreciate this.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
And that wasn't the call.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
You were afraid of that reason.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
You know, the other time that there was a person told.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I had no other time to play games, molotite.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Keeping all these investigations.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
No, I wasn't trying to.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
What was it?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
What was it?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
A patch wonder.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Anything for the matter, is that?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I know it's a purpose I told.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I went to state.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I didn't get license to go.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
We had a very easy and present pleasant relationship.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I also think that kind of shot.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I just thought it was a period of several weeks when we didn't even get it from him.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
And we understand.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Or, approximately, a month or more.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And find out the length of January 20th.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
From when?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
You say, what period is it you refer to?

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
What I mean, the period preceding February 24th.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Yes, how long has it been that you missed going broke off relationship?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Well, I think that's not correct.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
We didn't break off relationship.

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
I had called some of the members of this committee and had placed objections to the fact

04:33.000 --> 04:41.000
that the Army, the loyalty board members had been propended and I pointed out to them that

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
it seemed to me to be related to a calm, good pleasure with reference to Shine.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
And the fact that that call became known because four of the members of the committee met together.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Three of them met.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
The next list, Senator McCoy, these two discussed that subject.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Mr. Chai was present as I understand it.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
That was on the afternoon of the 22nd of January.

05:02.000 --> 05:13.000
And I am sure that the circumstances of my calls on those members and of the meeting of the members of the Senate,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
of the members of the committee, was relayed in its tone.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
And I am sure that it was made aware of the fact that I had pointed out to the committee that I felt that extreme

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
pressures with reference to Shine had been being exerted on the Army.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
And I am sure also that that is the reason that I wasn't hearing from Mr. Cohen anymore.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
He told me sometime later that he was no longer authorized to negotiate with me.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
And I didn't hear from him subjectment to January 20th for about 25 days.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Until I fell off my hands.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
He told me that he is all relationship between you and him and been separate.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
That's what he told me on the phone.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
All the relatives have been separate on January 25th.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
On January 25th, he told me that.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Well, no, 25 days before February 24th.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
We're putting that way, is that right?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Well, I think we're both a little mixed up in our arithmetic.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
How long before it's sent away 24th when you call him up?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And it's been a few talks today.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
13th.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I thought I saw him on February 14th.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
For the June on.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Let me look at my records as I nature.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Well, Mr. C.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm Mr. Adam looking through his lecture records.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Let's return to our studios across the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
This is ABC Television Network.

06:38.000 --> 06:46.000
An important message from Senator Smathers of Althamayami Dory.

06:46.000 --> 06:58.000
This picture, Abley shows what a few courageous citizens, honest politicians and tough alert police agencies can do to rid their cities of gang rams in Florence.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
See the Miami story, starting from the Paramount Theater.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
The newspaper has a February 24th that you call him up to justify his inductive.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I think that was February 12th.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Was February 12th?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
How long had it been on February 12th that you had seen were talked to? How long did it date you?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, it has been...

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
I haven't talked to the told.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
And I think that he had called me long business and wrote a book on Florida, which was on about the 19th of January.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
When he called the long business, he came up here.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
He sent it here as I understand. He went back to Florida.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
We had some serious assumptions that week was reference to the...

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
the peanut of the loyalty board members.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
And I called on Senator McCarthy. I just request in his apartment on the night of January 22nd.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
While I was in the center to the apartment, the telephone rang while I was sitting next to it.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I listed the phone off the receiver and heard Cohen's voice. I passed it over to...

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
send him a copy on that occasion.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
I don't believe that we talked the end of February 12th when I initiated the call again.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Which was the social call?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
No, there I was in my office when I called.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I called on Senator Adams and knew of all of these.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
himself, along the roof of his house.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
All of his alleged high pressure has been brought to bearable circumstances.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
The treatment is either quite interesting.

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
And in view of your dignified position with the Army, didn't you think that calling him...

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
initiating these calls like to these inspells for some of the...

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
of secretly so new parts now and beneath your dignity.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
No, Senator Lee Army.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
You did not know that they're into Fire Dynew.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Lee Army was still in business with the committee.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I expected investigations to continue.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I had no knowledge that they were going to terminate.

09:04.000 --> 09:12.000
From time to time during this period, as I recall, I was receiving requests from other members of the staff for certain Army data.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Which was being supplied.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
And Mr. Cohen into Fire Dynew was still chief counsel of this committee.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
And I knew that I would have a continuing relationship with him.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
And you knew of your obligations to the millions of boys in the Army?

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Did you go to the highest zone, was there any opposed to the cost?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yes, sir.

09:31.000 --> 09:41.000
I knew there was a certain dignity of the Army, a cost for these to use the words of the Secretary to be maintained before this makes it continue.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yes, sir.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Yes. And you think it's been sent to be in the precinct?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I wasn't necessarily.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I mean, I was.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
The staff of the Dynew did not understand.

09:53.000 --> 10:13.000
That in your campaign to enrich your staff with Mr. Cohen, all on the page in the plan you were serving the Secretary in the Army, you discussed with us your first prosecutor in your department, the formation of a law partnership with the New York State.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Your point was.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
I think I again must have asked for a clarification.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
I have again assumed that this question is based merely on allegations made by the other side of the table.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Not on the police, but just against the law.

10:29.000 --> 10:40.000
No, Madam, Mr. Sanktrayer, this question has a basis of any of the allegations of the other side, plus the statements of Mr. Adam has given them.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Thank you.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I'm sorry for every day.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Allow Mr. Jenkins, I did not give you a statement.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
So the effect that I discussed the formation of the law partnership is that the evidence is in name.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
The statement you gave me makes no reference to any of the things you saw.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, it makes reference to the talks.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
That's what I thought.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yes, sir.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I can see that I've seen conversations.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Yes, sir.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I think that the talks has put in all the basis of the talk.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yes, sir.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
You know, I have seen that I've seen talks to Mr. Williams with a purpose of ingration yourself with.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I thought Henry New York's service is to use firm.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Yes, sir.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Now, the lawyer.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
What did you talk to him about any of the questions there ever any discussion or talk about a proposed formation of a partnership between Mr. Roy?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Not a partnership in the slide, I remember.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
May I discuss the subject?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I think that is one of the good things the allegations made.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
I think the committee would be very much interested in it.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
All right, sir.

11:34.000 --> 11:44.000
About three weeks after I became councilor Lear, why I was in New York one day at hearings I received a telephone call from a personal friend of mine.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
Who was in New York and who was an official of large industrial and financial concern?

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
He told me the basic issues existed in his firm.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
He asked me about the interviews his firm with reference to that statement.

11:59.000 --> 12:10.000
I pointed out to him that I had just become councilor Lear and that I didn't see how I could seriously consider a change of the division three weeks after I stated one.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
He asked me never to let it by which I have these interviews which I did have during that same week or two.

12:17.000 --> 12:32.000
At the time that I had the interviews I discussed the fact that Mr. Cohn and Mr. Carr and I think maybe Mr. Julianne somebody else was talking about my arrival and that it was very interesting to listen.

12:32.000 --> 12:41.000
Mr. Cohn and them around him at the 14th of January makes reference to it that he didn't actually have salary to come to the salary.

12:41.000 --> 12:54.000
Yes, he had an access to the division and I told Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn that I did not intend to fill it.

12:54.000 --> 13:02.000
At the time we were having the discussion which was about first of November thereabouts.

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
I stated that in the course of a luncheon conversation something to be effective.

13:09.000 --> 13:17.000
If you know somebody in New York who wants to pay about $25,000 a year somebody who's not worth half that money who's come up here and practice law and thing around.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
Cohn said something because that's why I like to know somebody and I said well don't bother.

13:22.000 --> 13:31.000
I've never since I've been out of law school in 20 years practice private law of resources one would have to be able to practice and be assessed in New York.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I've never filed a brief I've never gone and complained.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
I'm specifically a Washington Died lawyer I do not confess up here.

13:38.000 --> 13:48.000
I expected one I leave the government if I ever do and I'll go into business for some part of the offer has to walk with it just come across my arrival.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
And that was the extent of the conversation on that occasion.

13:53.000 --> 14:03.000
I might elaborate on it further by stating that in the seven years that I have been in Washington I have never made an inquiry.

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
With anybody as the private practice law because I have never intended to practice one private place.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
I have had in the last four years the project for seven different positions.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
Not all of them just the five have to be offered none of them were in the practice law.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Three or four of them I can fit it seriously.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
In November at the time that I decided I would not pursue this job I thought about it Mr. Stevens.

14:32.000 --> 14:40.000
I pointed out to him that I had never practiced law privately and I certainly couldn't be a success in the time of New York's firm.

14:40.000 --> 14:48.000
Commercial time has a firm that New York firms are and that's when I left the government I was probably going to do.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
I said something to him to the effect of any year or two and might come around and ask him if he was fit.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
If I decide to go into business and I point out to the committee he's a Stevens.

14:59.000 --> 15:07.000
Before he became Secretary of the Army had a queen from Sydney American business community that was probably unfathomable.

15:07.000 --> 15:17.000
And if I need to help find a job either than for now I certainly had other sources than Mr. Cohen.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
Any conversations that we had on the subject of practice practicing law were always light.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
There were two or three of them who were strictly justified.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
There were conversation opinions and for a movement only and they were clearly recognized as such when it's Cohen.

15:31.000 --> 15:40.000
When the Cohen was asked about this topic on the press he stated on the hard 14th in Antwery and Inquiry.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
Some of his favourites on the Miami-M does not indicate anything in the top of the mode of on this part and I will suggest not.

15:48.000 --> 15:59.000
That is true. There wasn't a lot of movers however. The publication of his memorandum in the context of the public suggests him in the priority on my part which was not there.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
The memorandum declares it the way of the public and what it is to get his fall.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
I'm not asking about the mode is that. I'm giving you a long answer to what I'm trying to understand.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
My question was whether or not you did discuss the law partnership with Mr. Cohen or never in Syria.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Now I'm going in his office. You say never go in and result never serious.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
Never go in his office as I say from maybe two or three times there was just other references to going into the law that was in Syria.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
I am not a lot of them serious. There was never anything serious on it. I do not identify the day.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
You weren't even calling with the idea not toying with the idea.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
You mean just as I went into the law practice in New York, why I'd be stroking too much.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
You mean just I don't talk on your part as busy as you are and with all your responsibilities?

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
That wasn't even I don't talk with a conversational piece for the first of creating an atmosphere friendship.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
An atmosphere friendship.

16:56.000 --> 17:06.000
Now Mr. Adam finally this committee charges you with obstructing its investigation of your law of insecurity forward.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
You're aware that are you not?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Yes, sir. I am.

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
Did it ask you to bring members of the law of insecurity forward to executive?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
To executive sessions?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
That's correct. That's correct.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
You did not do it, did you?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I did not. You refused to do it.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I did.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
And you referred to it in this party page document, timing to be by you. That's correct, if it is.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Yes, sir. I'm okay.

17:34.000 --> 17:45.000
Why Mr. Adam, did you refuse to present members of your law of importance to the McCarthy Investigating Committee?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Why did we get it?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
It had been consistent policy in the Army.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
Previous to my time, I understood that it had been consistent policy throughout the Department of the Finns.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Insofar as I knew, it had been consistent policy throughout the government.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
That's the law of the board members.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Sure.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Who were operating in a quasi-judicial state.

18:09.000 --> 18:18.000
And who had somewhat the responsibility for the judge should not be required to appear one three or five years later.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.000
For the purpose of reasoning out a decision which they had made, you know, all the Friday insofar as you knew.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
And for that reason, I was being consistent with the position.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
The guy on the list was always there for his investigation.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
That we must protect the lawy program by protecting lawy-goer members from interrogation.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
That was my target.

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
The guy on the tenure end for now is the cause of the consistent policy again at his direction.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I'm no other reason.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
That is correct, sir.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
Did you know that the Secretary of the Army and his testimony put it on the basis of the agency?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
That there was a directive against this?

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
There is a directive against the CIA, just across towards the other state of the government.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
Well, I'm sure I don't think this statement I have before me I have seen nothing in there.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
About any directive or an against this?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
That's right. That's right.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
And you stated that many of the goals of the only reason.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Was the cause there was a consistent policy against this?

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I didn't even indicate that it was the only reason.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I'll ask you to read back.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, I have a disagree that I may have said that.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I didn't know that I said it was the only reason.

19:27.000 --> 19:37.000
But the position of the Army in the fire that I understood was the position of the defense department and was consistent with the government has taken.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
You now say that there are two reasons.

19:40.000 --> 19:47.000
The way it's won, a consistent policy of the government against this two A-director.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I guess it is. That's correct.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
The consistent policy of the Army against it and any Secretary of President of the Director's Prohibit insofar as I can see now.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
They must qualify that one moment there.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
There's a small year in the administration of the loyalty program.

20:04.000 --> 20:14.000
As to whether or not the individuals may respond or should respond to the demons or whether or not they should not.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
There are two schools of the Fox practically and every agency of the government.

20:18.000 --> 20:31.000
One school said that an individual, if he receives a subpoena, even though the subpoena is directed only to his participation in the loyalty program, must respond to the subpoena.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
But in responding, he may not answer any question having to do with his participation in the program.

20:37.000 --> 20:51.000
The second attitude, which is strongly held by many other officials of the government, is that properly to protect the loyalty program, the people who are on the loyalty program should not respond to the subpoena.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
And you belong to the latter school at all.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I do so.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
I don't say I'm in majority that that is the position I have always taken.

20:59.000 --> 21:07.000
Based upon my study of the director and my understanding of politics and my appreciation of how I'll allow the program to be.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
I'm sure of them that I think I'm about through Apple.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
So I read you on page 31 what you said about these loyalty board members.

21:18.000 --> 21:28.000
I've jicted this request starting in sublifation, reminded him that on all previous occasions when the subject could bring all that up the army had opposed it.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
I reminded him that we had agreed that the problem would not put on any shoes.

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
Carve me as this was true, but stated this phone in return the night before 8.50 pm from Florida.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
Just ignite out that he talked from that book of a time and that there was nothing hard to do.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
The army is not pretty sweet with the loyalty board members requesting on the 19th with our call on Senator McSan.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Senator McRathlin has always shortly before the schedule to hear.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Walk to the hearing room with him and attempt to discuss the subject with him.

21:57.000 --> 22:09.000
When we reached the hearing room and response to questions from some new press paperman, he stated that he was giving the army a little side of the 22nd of the same season to produce the loyalty board members requesting or else he would convene them.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
No hearing and statement to you saying anything about any direct use.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
No, sir, I do not.

22:15.000 --> 22:26.000
And the little flannel always human says always stated that your only reason for not producing those loyalty board members was the call of a standing policy against it.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
Correct. That is correct. And any policy is based on direct use.

22:32.000 --> 22:46.000
And Mr. Adams, you know that just prior to the investigation of Portman, Senator McRathlin and his committee had invested the government spending office in Washington.

22:46.000 --> 22:56.000
That's the thing is the loyalty board members and if they have responded to that, the thing is and testify before it's committee and executive say, can you do that?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I knew that, sir.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
The government's printing office there is an agency of the legislative branch of the government.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I'm the never-ending producer single member of the law and the board.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Did you know, sir?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
No, sir.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I didn't finish my question this day.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Well, thank you for having me.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
I'm not a state-owned, that state-owned, the government is an agency of the legislative branch of the government.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I'm not a state-owned, that state-owned, that state-owned, the government is an agency of the legislative branch of the government.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
Mr. Adams, I desire to ask you this question.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
You know, Governor Alokin of course.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Yes, sir.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
You know his name?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Lieutenant Cohen.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Yes, sir.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Captain Cohen.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Captain Cohen.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Yes, sir.

23:33.000 --> 23:40.000
And you know that he is regarded as the man of integrity and as a great general in the Army, you know?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
General Alokin?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Yes, sir.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
I beg your pardon, sir.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
So, regarding by General, by a secretary of defense?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Yes, sir.

23:47.000 --> 23:56.000
I want to ask you whether or not in November, if you have this conversation and I read Mr. Adams, and I asserted his effect.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
And I asserted his effect in the presence of General Alokin and Captain Corley of the age.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
I want it because I have personal knowledge of this matter.

24:07.000 --> 24:16.000
I read from a statement stated by General Alokin to Captain Corley and written in Captain Corley's handwriting.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
And I asked you whether or not this occurred.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
Adams asked Alokin by phone.

24:26.000 --> 24:37.000
I hope you can see your way clear to withdraw certain cases which you have recommended for removal of vast security risks.

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
The Wist Law Commissioner of Science that he was not do so, that's the secretary's take to responsibility.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
You need high-dainst thing that I want to ask you this.

24:48.000 --> 24:55.000
General Alokin was the commander and chief, asked for the support month of installation with the NOS yesterday.

24:55.000 --> 25:04.000
You undisclosed if he had cooperated with the police over hardensy with the McCarthy committee, just in investigation of the conditions that had you not done.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
The Saddam Jr. and the Secretary have this.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Consider removing General Alokin, have you not?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Yes, sir.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
How much much much less for much later than the assignment?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Yes sir.

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
I will ask you whether or not General Alokin's take stated this truth when he and Captain Corley have prepared that question.

25:27.000 --> 25:37.000
You use the General Alokin, have then been given a party to use his own discretion in making suspicions of the verses of that lawyer there is, didn't you?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yes sir.

25:38.000 --> 25:51.000
I will ask you whether or not General Alokin's hold the truth when he dictated this statement to his aide that you call him on the telephone and ask him if he can see his way clear.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
The withdrawal of certain cases which we have recommended for the removal of the private security rate, think you do it or not?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yes sir.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
You did that yesterday.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Yes sir.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Do you want to make some of this clear?

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
I don't think I am sure there is a committee on one of them.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
May I meet the Secretary?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
I understand him, sir.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
All right sir.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
And I will ask you much for this.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
I think this Secretary and all parents thought of you giving an opportunity to ask the question that I will solve in just one way.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
I asked that if you would prefer that he, I was not so open to him.

26:25.000 --> 26:39.000
I asked him if the question and he and I answered he said that he didn't seek calling and make that request and he now desire to make an explanation and I have told him that as far as I was concerned I was felt as a committee desired an explanation.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Your status by answer then the point of order is the same care.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I am both cutting off to the two ways.

26:44.000 --> 26:52.000
The witnesses can do it as well as the interesting affairs of partner of Mr. Welles and Mr. Welles and Mr. Welles and gracious Mrs. Rupptau.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Thank you very much.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
If you add in, you may proceed with your explanation.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
There are two needs by which a commander can accomplish the removal of an individual.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
One of them is summer-related suspending individual when he gets the right of the right information.

27:12.000 --> 27:19.000
The other is to send forward to the Secretary of the Army a recommendation for the removal of the individual.

27:19.000 --> 27:30.000
The latter means usually the ones which is used when there is some doubt in the mind that the commander has to whether or not they should replace his clear trust.

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
He leaves it to the responsibility of the screening board to make a decision as to whether or not the individual should be suspended.

27:37.000 --> 27:49.000
At the time of the Port Montlis investigation, when it began, the regulation permitted these wholesale suspensions or these immediate other various suspensions by a commander.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
But that technique had not been being used.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And it had not been being used at Port Montlis.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
I think that General Lawson's reasons were quite proper.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
He had had an experience or two, and his predecessor had had an experience or two.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Well, recommendations which went forward did not resolve any suspensions.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
And here are recommendations for suspensions which were made on the software reverse.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
So they adopted the second technique of removing the man from a classified position.

28:20.000 --> 28:29.000
Keeping him on non-sensitive work and sending the recommendations forward for the decision that he made at higher headquarters so that there wouldn't be a reversal.

28:29.000 --> 28:38.000
In addition to the number of suspensions which General Lawson had made at Port Montlis and which are approached 30s, and this is the key point that's mentioned,

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
there were some additional recommendations which had come forward for a decision in Washington.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
And it was these cases which I discussed with General Lawson.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
It was enough the cases which he had suspended.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
The telephone call was on the 31st of October.

28:56.000 --> 29:07.000
And I pointed out to General Lawson that the people who administer the security treaty boards had gone over the facts with reference to these individuals and had indicted.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
They did not think that these cases were strong enough to hold up before a hearing board.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
I initiated a call as a result of the fact that I had talked to Mr. Stevens and it made these facts available to him.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
He had transmitted his concern to General back.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
General back had talked to General Lawson.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
General Lawson had indicated that he'd like to talk to me about it.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
I placed a call with General Lawson and he said in effect substantially what you would say no.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I have made these recommendations for suspension.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
I don't want to put these people back.

29:41.000 --> 29:49.000
I feel on my own volition and own responsibility that there are sufficient facts that they should remain in suspension.

29:49.000 --> 29:57.000
So let the Secretary or let the Army take the responsibility if they want to get the proof these things just disapprove them.

29:58.000 --> 30:05.000
Subsequent to that time in the case of these nine individuals who were discussed.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
One of the nine resigned.

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
Three of them were reinstated with full clearances and collection.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
One of them was suspended as a result of the fact.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
One resigned.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Three were reinstated with full clearances.

30:23.000 --> 30:40.000
Three are still being held in the office of the Secretary of the Army because they appear to relate to other cases and their results will probably depend upon the results which are forthcoming in the hearing board actions on other cases which are in suspension.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And one is under further investigation.

30:42.000 --> 30:49.000
From those nine cases, sir, we're not part of the 33 who were suspended at Port Montenegro.

30:50.000 --> 30:58.000
They were other cases on which General Lawton had sent forward recommendation for suspension and on which the action had to be taken in the office with the Secretary of the Army.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
If they had him, he made the request that are expected you didn't use.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Yes, sir.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
General Lawton refused to take it.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
That is right.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
That is right.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
As some of those nine are still under suspension.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
One has been suspended.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
Three are being held with no action but on Montenegro's work.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
One is being held on Montenegro's work under investigation.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Three has been reinstated.
