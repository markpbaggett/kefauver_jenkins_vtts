WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
It's your position or is it your position?

00:04.000 --> 00:06.500
If that request was made of general law,

00:06.500 --> 00:10.500
and the cause of bureaucratic faith in the innocence of these mind,

00:10.500 --> 00:11.500
the innocence of the court,

00:11.500 --> 00:15.000
where they took this credit, Senator Matradi, and it's that.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
For neither of them.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
For neither of them, I'm its chairman.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
And there are one or two subjects about which we desire

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
to close the exam and Mr. Adams.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
They are not as peculiarly within the knowledge

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
of Mr. Thomas Trois, and I now desire to retire

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
and ask Mr. Trois to resign because he's

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
to continue across the examination.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, Sarah.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Tom, here.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Hello.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Hello, please.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Okay, go.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Okay, Charles, go to the chief counsel's entry.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Please.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Good.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Mr. Adams, the rest of us,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
to Senator Matradi's charge,

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
at the 34th age,

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Army, so called in mint,

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
was issued publicly in an effort to stop investigations

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
of the McCarthy Committee.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
As I understand, you're a testimony,

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
committing January 23.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
You began the preparation of the various memorandums,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
recounting the events to which you've given your testimony.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
That's correct.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Yes, sir.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
About to March 11 of this year,

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
did you exhibit that memorandum

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
to any members of the threat?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Yes, I did.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
To rule.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I have been enrolled to the Geo-Devices.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
I have been in part to fill a part of the Baltimore town

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
to hold a big event in New York,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
to view and to very crucially

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
the examination of one or two favorites

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
to the Murray-Mider of the Washington Post.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Are you a speaker?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I think I moved more on the piece.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
I said I exhibited an info to those of all of us.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Five feathers to fill a potter in the Baltimore town,

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
five feathers to home a figure to the arrow to be on

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
and Murray-Mider of the Washington Post.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
When did you exhibit this to Mr. Jill DePaul?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, I remember.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh, they did it around the 50th to the 80th there

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
and it was about the February.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
And when did you exhibit the memorandum

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
to the other gentlemen that you've made?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Well, all of us were around that time.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I mean, all of them were in my office

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
about that time, sometimes time,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
and sometimes it was the second

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
of the 70th February there, am I?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Now, these various members of the threat

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
to whom you exhibit these memorandums,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
if you know that they had written articles

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
on the present they share what they say to Jonathan McCartney.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Yes?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Why did you exhibit those memorandums

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
to members of the threat

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
when you knew that those reporters

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
were on the planet to send it to McCartney?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, I didn't exhibit it to them

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
because they were on friendly with Senator McCartney.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I exhibited it to them because I knew them

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
in some instances where I admired them in one instance.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Did you know Mr. Olsuk try to be engaging?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
No.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I'll try it, no.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh, Mr. Olsuk said no.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Sir, if you can see, I scrolled right to one of the reporters

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
or any of the reporters.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
They didn't get to be under the discussion of this.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I said no, sir, I did not.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
As you have seen before, that I came.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yes, I have seen them.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
He's been pointed out to me.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I rule a lot.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I know his brother is slightly.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I've met his brother in Timoncus in one couple of years ago.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
And let's add on some of the causes of charge

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
that all the night of January, 20th,

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
you express to his children the report

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
on the Facebook list of coal.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Unless the Senator stops his investigations

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
beyond the ultimate of that charge.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I have it, sir.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
And it was on the next day,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
January 23, that you've convinced the preparation

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
of no report which was the rocket-drivenness coal.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
That's correct, Mr. Sir.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yes, sir.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm January 23, I dictated my first name around.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
But, as you go, I did not expect the Senator MacArthur

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
on the night of January 27.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I have made no way to deal with that.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
I have a second term, because the Democratic Affairs charge

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
did not choose.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
You testify that you're not the same as the others

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
that on the night of January 22,

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Senator MacArthur suggested that Mr. Coal

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
conduct with you had already resolved

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
in the MacArthur Committee's

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
stoppage of the investigation of the arms.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
No, I don't think I've said that he said he had already

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
resolved it.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
He said to me that Mr. Coal's action

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
forces us to terminate our investigation of the arms.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
He said the fireman concerned the investigation is over.

05:54.000 --> 06:03.000
Now, just out of the things I think the Committee

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
and the Democratic Senate's class

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
is interested in learning what

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
you divulge this information

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
of a derogatory nature concerning Mr. Coal

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
to various members of the press.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
So soon after the preparation of the memorandum

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
and before it was made public.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Now, will you attempt to explain this?

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Well, this is a very easy experience that I had been

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
having through the fall in the winter.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
We're no secret.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
They were known to all of my folks in the office

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
of the Department of Council of the Army.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
They were known to my family.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
They were known to me, particularly these facts

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
with reference to the treatment I had been receiving

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
were known to some of the newspaper men who covered the hearing.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Some of the incidents were known to them.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
On January 9th, when I went to Amherst, Massachusetts,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
on the occasion of the KP incident,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I was just something by a newspaper man

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
who was also making the speaking of KP talks there.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I told him about the KP incident when it occurred.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
And during the course of our travel back,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I had returned to do them in some detail.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
My experience is with the Committee and with the Committee

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Sam.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
On December 15th, there has been an actionally syndicated

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
columnist, I think, from two persons who have written

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
in detail about the preferential treatment which

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
drives a shyness of the PD.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
As can't the addiction.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
On December 23rd, there was an article in the Baltimore

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Stone about the same matter.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
On January 20th and 21st, I had a occasion

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
to interview five different members of the Senate who

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
are sitting on this Committee today.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And I told him, for instance, for members of the Senate,

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
my deputy interviewer, this told him some parts

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
of the incidents which had occurred, which made it pretty well known

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
to members of this Committee.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
On January 21st, as I have stated to you,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
I had a interview with five top officials

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
of the government outside of the Army.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
At which time I discussed the matter in considerable detail.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Between January 20th and January 30th, I

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
was at a meeting in the Army, attended by about 20

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
off to the Army when I discussed the matter in considerable

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
detail.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
So by the time that I had my file in December, I was

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
thinking there were a total of somewhere between 30 and 50

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
people who had perstand knowledge of the incidents or part of the

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
incidents which had occurred.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And the newspaper man who had come here to be the Army

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
snapped two tapes and the newspaper man knew who

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
myself subsequently, knew who my total part of each

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
fact, I pledge that they might not release the documents.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
They might not, I didn't give them the paper, they might not

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
release any of the facts.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
They couldn't write about it.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
They couldn't refer to it.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
In the far as I was able to determine by following the

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
newspapers, no one of them ever did.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
But in the day of the year 29th, while my paper was still

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
under preparation, while my file was still under

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
preparation, the commanding general had sport sticks.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Made a public announcement to the fact that he was

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
having the Inspector General at sport sticks.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Investigates the allegation to preferential

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
treatment to By the Shine.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
On January 29th, New York Post carried a large story.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
It was generated from sport sticks.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
On February 1st, the Army received a first inquiry from

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
a member of the Senate and enclosing some of these

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
newspaper stories which had been written in December.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
On February 4th, we received our second one.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
During the court of February, we received a total of six

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
from members of the Senate, one from the chairman of the

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
House Media Armed Services, all of them making reference

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
specifically, but the Army give a report on this matter,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
all of them making reference to newspaper stories which

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
they had read prior to the time that my paper was prepared.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Under those circumstances, I do not think, particularly in view,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
is the fact that the newspaper men do to my talks and who

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
respected my confidence.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
I do not think that I really, just in tonight.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Would you identify as a reporter as amherst?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I'll be friendly at the Washington Post.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Did you have any particular reason for taking out the

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
report that you just made?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, I was so popular with all of them, I was done at the

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
former office of course.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
We have many usual friends.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I come to know him very well during the sportsman

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
in the investigation.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I have a high regard for him.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I consider him a both friend of mine.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
I had a similar regard for Murray-Mariner.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
And although I hadn't known over Bigger's age, had served in

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Korea, I had the work or a fun and was popular and was

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
introduced to me by Potter, who sent him over and asked

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
if I would talk to him about this matter at the same time

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
on a confidential basis.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
Those of all that came to me at about this same time told me

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
that he was aware of the portfolio I had and he respited.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Not in detail, from what I've respited enough to make me aware of

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
the fact that he knew about it.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
I held him in the highest admiration and I still do.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I expected that he would be the winner.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Those of all of us.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Thank you.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
And I still do.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
I expected him to reject my confidence and he did.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Oh, five of the new types of men, with whom I talk,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
respected my confidence.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
No one of them wrote anything and any newspapers that I would

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
find, which was in any way related to this document,

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
prior to the time of the Army report, was medically hit on my can.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Mr. Adams, I understand you.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
The first testimony, the existence of these memorandums

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
in the early part of February, was rather notoriously known.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
There were a number of people who knew about the situation

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
and there were a number of people who knew about the problem I was having.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
There were a number of people who knew about the rendering myself

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
so it's due to the existence of your own.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Yes, I think so.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
So, quite a few people knew about the existence of the file.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
Now, you did not divulge the contents of the memorandum

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
to any members of the Congress.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
No, still after the Senate's file.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I wrote this letter on Marcie.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
No, sir.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
That's right.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
That's right.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
But you did divulge about the fact that I didn't show any members of the Congress,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
any of my men.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
But you did divulge that to at least the four or five former

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
of the press and four or 30, 50 other people.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Something like that, yes sir.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Now, all of the additional questions,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
excluding the new statements,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
confined to the Pentagon.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
No.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Most of them were in the Pentagon.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I related yesterday a meeting that I had in the Department of Justice

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
where I divulged these facts to five officials outside of the Pentagon.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
I participated many of these memorandums at home in my discipline.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
And members of my family, my wife's family,

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
adults with their presence and her dedication.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
One of them is an officer in the wax.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
The other is then a Mr. Mann in the Army,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
neither of them stationed in Washington.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
One of them is a professor at Duke University,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
and all of them from time to time.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
I heard of these incidents.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
I wanted to general public to know that you had these derogatory memorandums.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
No.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
You were using every effort to keep it covered up, that's right?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
By the time to February, I decided that I'd better lock it up,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
and I did lock it up,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
and it was not taken out of my state,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
except to attend additional memorandums to it.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
Until it was given to Mr. Hempel on the 28th of February.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
You weren't holding that memorandum as a source to use against the Senate from the cost,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
and you were in health.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
You do know that the fact that the memorandum was made general is public

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
from March 11th,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
it served self-investigation.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Yes sir, that was by action of the Committee, not by action of the Army.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
The memorandum was not made public by the Army,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
it was submitted to members of Congress.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
You did not walk the memorandum to work the stopping of the Senate from across its investigation.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
That's your testimony?

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
I had no plans with reference to the memorandum.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
I did not participate in the division as the memorandum would be submitted to the Congress.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
The battle of the Senate and the party has charged on the 13th of its investigation.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
Number 32, as far as from mid-Aktual for through January 1954.

15:16.000 --> 15:24.000
Miss Adam sought on numerous defeats to secure from the chairman and subcommittee staff.

15:24.000 --> 15:33.000
They promised to stop if he and Mr. Stevens spoke both general law,

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
commanding general at fourth month, and relieving him obvious command.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Is that charged true or not?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
That charged false.

15:43.000 --> 15:54.000
Did you or not call Senator McCarty on many or few occasions or any of these?

15:54.000 --> 16:06.000
And it's by Senator McCarty that the Secretary was considered relieving general law for his command.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I did not call in McCarty.

16:09.000 --> 16:16.000
I had one personal conversation with Senator McCarty on November 24th or November 25th in New York.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Conversation with Senator McCarty on his speech.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I advise Senator McCarty to serve as a servant.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
Mr. Stevens, I have talked to Mr. Stevens by long distance telephone.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
Mr. Stevens had stated to me that he had received some allegations,

16:33.000 --> 16:43.000
and if they proved true, we're serious enough so they might fit the balance and require him to release general law.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
He asked me if I would speak to General Lawton or Senator McCarty about it.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
Makes Senator McCarty aware of the fact that the Secretary might find it necessary to take this action

16:53.000 --> 17:02.000
and to assure Senator McCarty that the action was not being taken because of the fact that General Lawton had cooperated with me.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
I did have such a talk with Senator McCarty.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I called Mr. Stevens back.

17:07.000 --> 17:18.000
I stated to him that Senator McCarty had indicated that he felt that it was the regardless of whether or not he was silent.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
Members of the press would take it as a slap at Senator McCarty.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
And that Senator McCarty suggested that Mr. Stevens were going to do it.

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
Would it be possible to wait until the first of the year, which would be about five weeks, Mr. Stevens response to me,

17:35.000 --> 17:42.000
was that he could not prompt because if these allegations proved true, he might have to go ahead in any event.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
I didn't pass that on to Senator McCarty.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
I have no further conversations with Senator McCarty about the matter.

17:51.000 --> 17:59.000
I told Mr. Stevens in the subject when telephone conversation that Senator McCarty was going to be going for ten days.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
And he's gone to Wisconsin for ten days.

18:02.000 --> 18:10.000
And perhaps Mr. Stevens would be willing to give these allegations were developed.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
To all of us and to the Senator McCarty came back so that he wouldn't read it in the paper in Wisconsin or something like that.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
And Mr. Stevens said he might be able to do that, but he wasn't sure.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
I have no other conversations with Senator McCarty about the matter that I remember.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
No other conversations with any other member of the staff until the day of December 17th.

18:29.000 --> 18:39.000
When we were sitting at luncheon, when Mr. Cohen stated that Mr. Stevens was planning to relieve General Oven only because he was friendly with the committee.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
And I had responded to Mr. Cohen that that was not true and he knew it wasn't true.

18:44.000 --> 18:54.000
The final conversation I had with anybody on the subject was Mr. Stevens on about the first of the year when I inquired of him as to what steps he intended to take on the matter.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
He stated to me that the allegations which had been brought to his attention he does not think it's been proved.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I missed out on best go back to the original question.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
And I want to say it in this manner.

19:07.000 --> 19:21.000
If you not on the occasion of your first conversation with Senator McCarty concerning the proposed relieving of General Oven,

19:22.000 --> 19:40.000
please do extract from Senator McCarty a commitment that he, the senator, would remain silent and not make a public issue if Senator Locke, if General Locke were relieved.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I don't remember putting it in those terms.

19:42.000 --> 19:50.000
I tried to point out Senator McCarty that Mr. Stevens found it necessary to take this action.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
He hoped that Senator McCarty would understand that it was not being done as retaliation and was not in the duty.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
The decision to extract from the senator of former society.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I don't remember doing that.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
The ultimate winner of society.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
I don't think all right.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Did you ask him if he would be silent?

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
I asked him what action he would say. He said he thought that he would say I'm not saying anything about it,

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
but that he might be forced into it by hostile threats.

20:21.000 --> 20:28.000
What was the purpose of your conversation with him to determine whether or not Senator McCarty would remain silent?

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
No. The purpose of my conversation was to make him aware of a contemplative action of the secretary.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
And you are interested in learning whether the senator would make a public issue out of it.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
I was a person interested in finding out whether he would make a public issue if it mattered.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
I was not trying to extract any promise I was inquiring that what his attitude was made was my opinion.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
You were interested in learning whether or not the senator would make a public issue out of it.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Is that correct?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Yes, sir. I think that is correct.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Was that not the sole purpose of your conversation?

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
No. No, Mr. Stevens made it quite fair to me that he might believe they all serve as artists.

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
And I was not authorized and Mr. Stevens had no intentions as I understood it.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
I was not moving provided Senator McCarty objected. He made it quite clear to me that he might have to move.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
And he hopes to send him a county would understand that it was not intended.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
I just want that Senator McCarty or the committee, but that it was deemed on.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
If it was done, he called another allegation.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
I'll speak to another secretary. And then I will conclude my examination.

21:36.000 --> 21:46.000
You and Mr. Cohn developed a rather close friendship, convincing around first thought, Cohn, did you not?

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
Yes, sir. I think it was a close friendship based on our professional relationships.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
We didn't see each other's evening in Washington on any occasion that I remember.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
We were out together in New York on about two occasions in the evening.

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
But we were at the same hearings and we walked back and forth from the restaurant together in a group.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
And we were quite famous.

22:14.000 --> 22:30.000
Was it your idea that the course of youth duties compelled you in grace eating yourself and making yourself as friendly as possible with Mr. Cohn?

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
Well, I have no such idea that that being part of my duties.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
You thought you were wrong with the committee?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, yes, sir.

22:41.000 --> 22:53.000
And is it not true that many of these remarks or abuses that you have detailed on the part of Mr. Cohn

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
were made in a position or a job you'll be in?

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
On the subject of shine, nothing was funny. Nothing was suspicious. Nothing was Jovia.

23:07.000 --> 23:16.000
Well, the five two refused remarks and obscene language confined to Mr. Cohn's end of the conversation.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I think so, yes, sir.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
They never eliminated from you, Nelson.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
I have nothing to abuse, Mr. Cohn.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
That's all I have to do.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
And as much as there's almost five o'clock then, these can't be kept as we were.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
We have to keep it up until 10 o'clock tomorrow.

23:44.000 --> 23:51.000
You have just heard Chairman Montenau that the committee will hold its next session at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning.

23:52.000 --> 23:59.000
And that's this long session this afternoon, almost three hours of it, as concluded with the Army Constellar

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
and one of the principals in this controversy between Senator McCarthy and the Army, Mr. Cohn Adams,

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
still on the stand and still on the cross-examination by the committee council, Mr. Ray and Jenkins,

24:10.000 --> 24:18.000
that the record straight, Mr. Cohn just today, examined Mr. Adams directly,

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
that is to bring out all of the facets of the case that were favorable to the Army side of the controversy.

24:24.000 --> 24:33.000
And today, the other tact and cross-examination brought out all of the elements that were favorable to the case of Senator Joseph McChryft.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
you
