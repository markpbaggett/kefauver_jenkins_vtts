00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Ready to interview Senator Estes' chief auger on the events and situations in our nation's capital.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Senator Chief auger, spring is here.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
It has scratched the living room.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
We didn't join the weather.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Perhaps the law of publicization is important.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I have a message to the government.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
I would have really carried lessons from the outing of the food.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Low and everything has been very beautiful here in Washington.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
It's quite of the food weather out there.

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
I believe on the last Friday they had the oldest day that they've ever had since 1900 in Washington this time of the year.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
The two brothers seemed to have cooled down the news in Washington.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
I believe the Senate had the good-and-much unfunfantastic rivers and harbours still up for consideration of the bill most week.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
But you're correct, Charlotte.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
The late on the rivers and harbours of the public bill is not nearly so exciting.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
That's the beauty of destruction.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
We all, last week, was turning the current natural gas system.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
The housing bill and other controversial matters we have been considering this week.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
The fact that it's being followed, I'm wondering if this would not be a good time to have some of the academic discussion about the 21 food rep commission,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
the government re-organization discussion.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Perhaps, I'm committing a discussion of the problem of bloody.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
I think this would be a good opportunity to start with regard to the food report and current state parents' etiquette.

01:26.000 --> 01:36.000
I think the food rep commission is generally on the food rep which I would like to introduce to the government by officially unbiased,

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
through lying across the system and eliminating some of the agencies who use the patients to say the great deal of nothing.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
The President's influence seems to be getting in the hand that he programed the food rep commission that it's recommended.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
And the President has sent 21 re-organization plans to Congress last month, which were based upon the recommendations of the food rep commission.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
The first six plans were transferred to the heads of the Treasury Justice and Period,

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
as a culture of commerce and labor department, respectively.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
Certain functions not referred by law on supporting the officials and the listens that do good point.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
The next seven plans, seven to thirteen,

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
they were administrative power of seven regulatory boards and commissions to the chair, under each group,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
rather than leaving it to the members of the commission.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
These agencies are the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Trade Commission,

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
on which I judge you in Davis, a great kind of CM, the board is Deputy Chairman.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
The Federal Power Commission, they secured as an exchange commission,

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
the Federal Communications Commission and the National Labor Relations Board and the Civil Air, not its board.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
So you see that these first thirteen plans all have the same purpose,

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
the picture responsibility and authority for the management of these departments and boards,

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
and one person, rather than having it spread out in the commission generally all with other people.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
Let's say, in such a good way, you mean that the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, for instance,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
cannot make administrative decisions and matters that come up from time to time?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
That's a situation exactly, believe it or not.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
Besides your case in this very agency, I sent an important letter to the Federal Trade Commission,

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
seeking information and an opinion of the commission to use and of debate on the Senate floor,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
facing points matter which we had a...

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Any response? Finally, I went down to the commission and figured the opinion.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Of course, they couldn't get a forum of the member's presence.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
One member had a death in his family and was out at power, and other was in the House Federal,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
and then I was a vacancy on the commission.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
The two commissioners available were parenists to act because it was a bad man commission.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
The three members had to be present in the House of the Federal Court.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Didn't the Federal Commission, inc. the size and necessity of these particular changes?

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
Yes, they are there. These reorganization plans generally are, I think, followed the Hoover recommendation.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
The report pointed out that the president has administrative prepared of our agency,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
and under him, his chief lieutenant and department heads,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
should be held responsible and accountable to the people and to the Congress,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
but it's under these various functions.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
They pointed out also that we can hardly hold any of these boards and departments accountable,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
unless they have the authority to direct the administration of the various agencies.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And I think it is a point well taken.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
I noticed he didn't mention in the various agencies affected the state department and the first office department.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
Well, this same thing was done as regards the state department and the post office department by legislation last year.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
In addition, these plans fall for the designation of a career man in each department,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
as an administrative assistant secretary,

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
and the state department, for instance, Jim Webb from North Carolina is the administrative assistant secretary.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
And he would have a civil service status and be able to assist the department head in the heavy managerial job,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
even if the head of the department resigned and wants to replace.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
The LHMD, too much opposition to these 13 plans, should they portray our will,

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
come in for some serious trouble in that process.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
There's been a longstanding fight as we all know between the national labor relations board and its general counsel.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Land number 12, but it's published in the Office of the General Counsel of the NLRB,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
and transferring his rather broad authority to the chairman of the force.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
The other 12 plans should enjoy these decisions.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
Well, how about the remaining eight plans that we had talked about, Sanjay?

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
All of these plans that propose the reassignment of certain functions of the government.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
All of them are designed to group programs of the government and the smallest practical number of the staff.

05:58.000 --> 06:08.000
I don't believe the details of the official interest to our friends to outline them and detail here.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
All in all, I think the plans are worthy of our most sympathetic consideration.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
I've noticed Sanjay keep all of them, that when all of those meaningful proposals is made in progress,

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
at least two groups started immediately seeking on the one hand the adoption of the proposal,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
and on the other hand the field proposal.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
This, of course, brings us to the question of lobby.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
You have to go, very few people who are not connected with Congress,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
appreciate the magnitude of the lobby and the problem, John.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm sure you didn't before you came up here a year and a half ago,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
but it is a very great problem.

06:44.000 --> 06:54.000
In fact, somebody, I stated, I think, rather laugh than make that Congress could not operate without the lobby.

06:54.000 --> 07:02.000
Of course, as in the case of nearly everything else, lobby and has its good points and advantages and has its bad points.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Of course, there are all kinds of lobby that operate near and Congress.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
There are good lobby for good purposes, bad lobby.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
There are lobbies that have no all-terior motive, and then, of course, the first special interest lobby.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
And under the Constitution, anybody has the right to position Congress.

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
So we have a lot of citizens who come up as they should come up and see us about that particular topic.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
That is nevertheless a type of lobby.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Knowing that a question is being lobbied both ways,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm sure as members of Congress, if they are getting both sides of the picture.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
This is a beneficial lesson, deciding how to vote on a particular issue.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
But not being, unfortunately, has a strong side to many bills passed upon this,

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
which otherwise would be voted on, but it not them, but the application of special, special interest lobby.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
Now, there is an approach this time, yes, but how started investigation of lobbying two or three weeks ago?

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
There is Congressman Frank Bigger, the president of the Manoeu, by the well as the chairman of the Investigative Group.

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
And Stan Hearings will be resumed Wednesday, taking up the real estate and the housing pressure groups first.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
I hope that committee's external looked into the lobby registration act,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
which passed about four years ago.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And I'm just wondering, is that act of that?

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, it provides briefly that any person who comes to influence legislation of pay

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
or any consideration of much of it, that is others and does the private individual coming up,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
especially about some matter of these efforts.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
But any lobby must have financial reports of every quarter,

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
organizations raising funds for this purpose, and the files of the report, also,

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
and it provides a penalty kind of file or imprisonment of three years' suspension

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
from lobbying, a stability-on-conviction of a violation of the law.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
That is the law set for how in crucial registry.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
Now, that's left to the secretary of the Senate and will they take to the House.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
As a consequence, there are persons and groups engaged in almost identical activities,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
one of which has registered and the other has registered,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
and the purpose of the regulation is that they don't have the registry.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
I think the Congress and the Senate and committee will certainly recommend changes in these forms.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
How many lobbyists do you have to make to be in?

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Of course, I'm glad that the city is just about full of them.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
But about 2,500 different persons and groups have registered to the law limits.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
But Mr. Patan, however, as the name suggests, we have about 10,000 active lobbying persons

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
and organizations here in Washington.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, that's amazing, Senator.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
How many days do you have to probably spend a lot of your time?

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, the House Committee's tabulation shows that the reports of expenditures

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
for lobbying that is owed to registered and listed their expenses,

09:59.000 --> 10:08.000
raised from $2,200,000 in 1946 to $10,300,000 in 1949.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
I would say allowing for duplications and the likes of probably $30 million has been extended

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
by a lobbyist during the past few years.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
Sometimes, a smongest that about well above $100 million has been spent in the last five years,

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
and goodness gracious, sir.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
There wasn't this matter of been done in 1984.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
Well, you may remember, Charlie, that's in the 1948 presidential campaign.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Mr. Truman attacks the lobby.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
Senator Kilgore, a West Virginia introduced a resolution calling for a Senate investigation

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
early in 1949.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
I hear the representative of Canada's top-of-the-spousal resolution after receiving a dilute of 9,000 letters

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
in the amendment until no resolution has ever cleared the Senate on the matter of lobby.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
As a matter of fact, only one investigation should be followed,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
and we have one on the House.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
We have too many overlapping and duplicating skills.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
But just how will the House Committee go about its decision?

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
I understand that the Committee hopes to use this so-called top-of-the-spousal system study

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
of lobby.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
It will probably look into special groups, both topics,

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
and groups which are just outside the registration of funds.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
It has been made clear that the Committee is not aiming at any administration lobby

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
to find the structure of government lobby.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
The main effect will be inclusion of the registration provisions of the law

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
and to separate folks and lobbies from South East Special Group lobby.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
On a bit of a bit of those of us, who goes into the number,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
have there ever been lobby and investigation prior to the passage

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
of the registration law of 1996?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, I am not 46, I think I have a text number,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
reference to my age, I am not question Charlie,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
but of course the only way I would know is what I have read.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
Seriously, there are about three such investigations in the past 60 years,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
in 1913, 1929, and 1935.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
But it is going to be interesting to watch what's on the diet of the 1950s,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
the investigation of lobby.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And it's key part of one more thing,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
which I've tried to pass with, which I think is usually the coming.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Our first at the fifth anniversary of the death of the late president of the

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Spanx City Roosevelt, and he's thinking about the content of the page.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
So you can be coming on that.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, I am Charlie, I certainly will.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Five years ago on Wednesday, President Roosevelt died,

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
and there's no members of the past, but the third is that president's president,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
so at that time it must have been John.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
We would still have war, and this president failed more than anyone else,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
because he was not the parent or his new birth.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
He was so humble that he has passed the system to be a narrative pupil,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
to save him every experience.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So that we're no longer at the narrative,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and he has many urgent problems facing him,

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
as a president's president and his pacifectic.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
After assuming the president's being his own right,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
he has done pretty the difficult personality.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Half of it has been a pacifectic.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
However, as some of us may think of president,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
we're all at the recent shooting,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
he said he had tried very hard to do a pacifect.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
And many of us who did not approve the role of the point in assuming

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
the slap ball that might be 40 years.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
And many of us who will be all these countries

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
who benefit part of the focus of coming along,

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
are there few who would take from that as a president

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
and see if he should do what he is entitled for doing a hard job

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
the way he thought it fit the path.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Thank you, Senator S. T. P. P.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
for now to listen, dear Mr. Lee,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
and we invite you to be seen in the conversation

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
to hear the next news that we've been radioed with,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
so listen if you're talking to Washington,

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
and if you're talking to him,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
it's a challenge that you can use to be a local mountain.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Thank you.
