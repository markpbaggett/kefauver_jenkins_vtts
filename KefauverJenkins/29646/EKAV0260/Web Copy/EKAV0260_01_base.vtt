WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
That's what I said.

00:02.400 --> 00:09.400
And I said, the court here will use that term hostage.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.400
Yes, yes, very nice.

00:12.400 --> 00:19.980
Mr. Adams uses many terms just as all of us do, which are perhaps facetious, but he used

00:19.980 --> 00:20.980
that term.

00:20.980 --> 00:24.480
I know heLEY is the term Indian, to refer to staff members.

00:24.480 --> 00:31.760
He used the term hostage almost from the time that Cheyenne went into the army.

00:31.760 --> 00:38.400
I couldn't tell, frankly, at which time he was using it in a serious vein, which time

00:38.400 --> 00:40.400
he was just getting about it.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.040
At this point, he used the word hostage.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.800
He asked me how the hostage was making up at Fort Dix.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.080
I told him that I guess he was doing all right.

00:50.080 --> 00:57.280
And then he said to me, well, maybe he could do a little better with some help from us.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.400
I assumed that he meant himself for Secretary Stevens.

01:01.400 --> 01:07.440
I said that as far as I was concerned, he was doing all right.

01:07.440 --> 01:13.520
And he said, well, now I'd say, maybe he could do a little better with a little help.

01:13.520 --> 01:18.320
And he said, what's there in it for us if we do something for Sean?

01:18.320 --> 01:22.280
Now he didn't say, what's there in it for Stevens and me?

01:22.280 --> 01:25.800
He said, what's there in it for us if we do something for Sean?

01:25.800 --> 01:30.040
I told him that I didn't think there would be anything in it for him if he did it, something

01:30.040 --> 01:31.040
for Sean.

01:31.040 --> 01:37.640
I thought that afternoon I wrote a memorandum to Senator McCarthy in which I said, again,

01:37.640 --> 01:43.920
today John Adams came down here after the hearings and using clever phrases, tried to find

01:43.920 --> 01:46.440
out what's there in it for us.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.240
And he and Stevens did something for Sean.

01:49.240 --> 01:54.960
He refers to Sean as our hostage, or the hostage, whenever his name comes up.

01:54.960 --> 01:59.880
I made it clear that as far as I was concerned, I don't personally care what treatment they

01:59.880 --> 02:01.280
gave Sean.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.080
And that as far as I was concerned, he was in the army.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.440
I did say that I thought it wasn't fair.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.440
This is the memorandum of December 9th.

02:11.440 --> 02:16.960
I did say that I thought it wasn't fair of them to take it out on Sean because we were

02:16.960 --> 02:22.240
investigating the army, but I keep using it to try to stop our investigation.

02:22.240 --> 02:29.440
I told him the only contact we were authorized to have with him about Sean was on Investigations

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
Committee Business.

02:30.440 --> 02:34.480
There were other things in the memorandum.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.440
That's about the substance.

02:36.440 --> 02:42.680
Now for the statements that you get for you, this contained in your memorandum of December

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
9th.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.680
Yes, sir.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.880
I dictated that memorandum following our conversation.

02:48.880 --> 02:55.920
Now have you stated the substance of your conversation with Mr. Adams on December 9th?

02:55.920 --> 02:56.920
Yes, sir.

02:56.920 --> 03:00.920
It's best I recall now.

03:01.920 --> 03:10.920
Well, you present on the occasion of the luncheon that the Carol Arons on December 10th.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.920
Yes, sir.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.920
I was.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.920
State very briefly.

03:14.920 --> 03:15.920
The conversation there.

03:15.920 --> 03:24.920
I believe Mr. Adams, Mr. Stevens and Senator McCarthy were also present.

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
Yes, sir.

03:25.920 --> 03:32.360
So that morning the Senator asked me if I wanted to have lunch with him at the Carol Arons.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.440
He said that the Secretary would be there and Mr. Adams.

03:36.440 --> 03:45.520
We had lunch, the Secretary and Mr. Adams and the Senator were discussing the possibility

03:45.520 --> 03:51.360
of some end to the hearings at the point moment.

03:51.360 --> 03:58.960
The Secretary and Mr. Adams again brought up the argument that the Army now had all

03:58.960 --> 04:06.000
of the information they needed and that the Subcommittee had helped the Army by having

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
some of these hearings and the Army now could handle the situation.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.360
They thought that the hearing should be terminated.

04:12.360 --> 04:18.160
Senator McCarthy was not committed about the ending of the hearings.

04:18.160 --> 04:26.240
He pointed out that he wanted to have some hearings, at least executive hearings, with

04:26.240 --> 04:33.920
members of the loyalty boards who had allowed some of these communist court moments to remain

04:33.920 --> 04:41.120
in their jobs after investigations had been conducted of them.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.120
That's about the...

04:42.120 --> 04:48.840
What was the attitude of Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams, the purpose to the Senator's statement

04:48.840 --> 04:51.720
about calling the loyalty boards?

04:51.720 --> 04:58.120
Well, throughout the entire period of the Fourth Monument's investigation, so I believe

04:58.120 --> 05:09.840
that back in October sometime when a man referred to here as Mr. X had appeared, the

05:09.840 --> 05:16.880
President, John Adams had taken a position that it would not be a good thing for the loyalty

05:16.880 --> 05:21.080
board members to be called in.

05:21.080 --> 05:26.200
The Secretary seemed to affirm that position at this luncheon.

05:26.200 --> 05:32.400
I don't specifically recall what the Secretary said at that luncheon.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
Yes, sir.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.400
Very briefly.

05:34.400 --> 05:43.960
There was some conversation concerning him.

05:43.960 --> 05:51.400
Somebody I don't know what was brought up the fact that he was at fix.

05:51.400 --> 05:59.400
The Secretary said that he was doing well in his training or words without effect.

05:59.400 --> 06:07.400
He mentioned that basic training was an important thing and that everybody had to do it.

06:07.400 --> 06:15.040
I remember that that touched off rather long dissertation by Senator McCarthy concerning

06:15.040 --> 06:20.160
his own basic training in the Marine Corps that included a vivid description of calling

06:20.160 --> 06:21.160
through modern.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.160
I think it was good for 20 minutes.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.160
Well, with any bait, I'll put up on that occasion.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.160
Not that I recall.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.160
I wouldn't say so.

06:29.160 --> 06:40.160
The sick test even developed referred to as young man, John, as a hostage.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.160
No, sir, not for my knowledge.

06:44.160 --> 06:54.160
Now, Mr. Carr, have you stated the substance of conversations of December 10 that relate

06:54.160 --> 06:55.160
to your job?

06:55.160 --> 06:56.160
Yes, sir.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.160
That's the right time.

06:57.160 --> 07:07.160
Now, let's go to December 17th, in the update of the celebrated luncheon and Carr.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.160
You were present.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.160
Yes, sir.

07:10.160 --> 07:18.160
And I've taken you a present at the hearings on the morning of December 17th.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.160
Yes, sir.

07:19.160 --> 07:24.160
There were hearings that morning on the Port Mama's investigation.

07:24.160 --> 07:31.160
What was the subject of conversation during the luncheon and the substance could call

07:31.160 --> 07:34.160
at on December 17th?

07:35.160 --> 07:41.160
When Mr. Carr and I arrived at Gassnuss, restaurant, which is about a block away from the courthouse

07:41.160 --> 07:49.160
in New York, Mr. Adams and the Senator were already there.

07:49.160 --> 07:56.160
There was some general conversation, and then I recall the Senator saying that John has

07:56.160 --> 07:59.160
brought up the subject of law again.

08:00.160 --> 08:08.160
This touched off a conversation, some length, I wouldn't say a conversation was a monologue,

08:08.160 --> 08:17.160
but Mr. Carr, at this point on the subject of general law and reprisals made against persons

08:17.160 --> 08:24.160
who had helped the subcommittee in some way, he said that to remove general law and

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
would be a disgraceful thing.

08:26.160 --> 08:31.160
He said that a man should not be punished for helping a subcommittee and certainly Senator

08:31.160 --> 08:38.160
McCartney should not say bye and allow a man of general law and statute to be punished

08:38.160 --> 08:45.160
in any way for assisting in the investigation of the subcommittee.

08:45.160 --> 08:53.160
He brought up the fact that as a result of previous investigations of the subcommittee, several

08:53.160 --> 09:00.160
persons in the voice of America had been conveniently dropped at the end of the investigation.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.160
He made quite a point of it.

09:03.160 --> 09:12.160
He said that the subcommittee and no investigative agency could last very long if it would sit back

09:12.160 --> 09:17.160
and allow persons who help it to be the subject of reprisals.

09:18.160 --> 09:24.160
I recall that there was some conversation about the Senator being subdued.

09:24.160 --> 09:33.160
The Senator was in agreement with Mr. Carr, and because he was quiet, I don't think it means he was subdued.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.160
He agreed with Mr. Carr.

09:37.160 --> 09:44.160
He said that he thought that he could not order the army about and tell the army what it could do with its generals,

09:44.160 --> 09:47.160
but he fully agreed with Mr. Carr.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.160
A praise of the situation.

09:49.160 --> 10:00.160
Throughout the conversation, Mr. Adams didn't get many words in, but Mr. Adams kept trying to interject himself

10:00.160 --> 10:07.160
by making statements which I recall in substance as this.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.160
Let's talk about shine.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.160
All right, let's talk about shine.

10:11.160 --> 10:17.160
Mr. Cohn replied rather heatedly, I don't want to talk about shine.

10:17.160 --> 10:22.160
Let's talk about what we're talking about, and we did talk about what.

10:22.160 --> 10:32.160
When the luncheon had been served in the evening, we proceeded outside the building.

10:32.160 --> 10:37.160
Mr. Cohn's car was parked nearby, and he offered us a ride up town.

10:37.160 --> 10:43.160
Mr. Adams said that he was going to Penn Station, and he would grab a cab.

10:43.160 --> 10:47.160
I recall that Mr. Cohn said, he gave him a lift.

10:47.160 --> 10:53.160
Adams was concerned about making a certain train, I don't know which one it was.

10:53.160 --> 11:02.160
We went up town, and as we got to Fourth Avenue, I'm not sure whether at that point it's Fourth or Park Avenue,

11:02.160 --> 11:06.160
but it's all the same in New York at various points.

11:06.160 --> 11:12.160
We got to about 34th Street and Park Thurund Street and Park Avenue,

11:12.160 --> 11:15.160
and Mr. Cohn tried to make a left turn.

11:15.160 --> 11:20.160
There was an officer there who was not much influenced by Mr. Cohn,

11:20.160 --> 11:30.160
and we went through, as we had to, a tunnel arrangement in the middle of the avenue,

11:30.160 --> 11:39.160
which made the next available exit, something like Park Avenue in 46th or 48th Street,

11:39.160 --> 11:42.160
not sure the number of the street.

11:42.160 --> 11:48.160
As I recall it, Mr. Adams was getting a big disturbed about the train,

11:48.160 --> 11:51.160
and he thought that he might not make it.

11:51.160 --> 11:55.160
Mr. Adams kept saying, let me out, let me out.

11:55.160 --> 11:59.160
I got to make the train, and he said, I'll take you over, don't worry about it.

11:59.160 --> 12:08.160
When we got to this intersection at about 46th Street, Mr. Adams said, I'll take a cab.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.160
At that point, I think Mr. Cohn said it.

12:11.160 --> 12:17.160
I don't know whether he said it or I just assume that he would say it at any rate,

12:17.160 --> 12:21.160
we were near the curb in the first lane of traffic, as I recall.

12:21.160 --> 12:28.160
Mr. Adams got out, Mr. Cohn said, OK, take a cab, and Adams left.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.160
I think he testified that he didn't make his train.

12:31.160 --> 12:41.160
The senator and I and Mr. Cohn continued uptown through the walled up where the senator was staying.

12:41.160 --> 12:45.160
The senator was not ejected from the car, I might say.

12:45.160 --> 12:57.160
As we got uptown, after Mr. Adams left the car, the senator said to Roy that

12:57.160 --> 13:01.160
the water situation would work out all right.

13:01.160 --> 13:13.160
And as I've since learned, both the senator and Mr. Cohn contacted either the general or his aide that day or the next.

13:13.160 --> 13:18.160
I have to recap the events of the December 17th.

13:18.160 --> 13:30.160
I'll ask you if I'm correct when I state that your testimonial substance is that the animated monologue

13:30.160 --> 13:39.160
which is spoke of of Mr. Cohn was precipitated by discussion of general law.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.160
That's correct.

13:41.160 --> 13:53.160
Mr. Adams tried on several occasions to swing the subject to shine, but he never got there.

13:53.160 --> 14:02.160
Was Mr. Adams the emulating factor as far as the subject of shine was concerned?

14:02.160 --> 14:05.160
Yes, he tried, but it didn't get the shine.

14:05.160 --> 14:11.160
The subject was almost exclusively around general law.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.160
Yes, correct.

14:13.160 --> 14:22.160
And the general subject matter of reprisals against that person who had helped the committee.

14:22.160 --> 14:31.160
Well, in what manner was the subject of shine injected into this piti conversation?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.160
At the luncheon?

14:32.160 --> 14:33.160
Yes.

14:33.160 --> 14:41.160
It didn't get injected in beyond the point of saying, let's talk about shine, and that's how much is getting.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.160
Was that the excuse?

14:42.160 --> 14:46.160
That's Mr. Cohn wouldn't talk about shine. He wouldn't talk about what?

14:46.160 --> 14:51.160
And he made no reference to the treatment of shine at days.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.160
No, sir, not that I recall it all.

14:53.160 --> 14:59.160
Now, have you stated the substance of the event of December 17th?

14:59.160 --> 15:01.160
Yes, sir, as I recall.

15:02.160 --> 15:16.160
Now, let's go to January 14th, which I believe is the occasion of Mr. Adams' visit to Europe.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.160
Is that correct?

15:17.160 --> 15:19.160
Yes, January 14th.

15:19.160 --> 15:27.160
What was his purpose if he recalled in this team, your office, or January 14th?

15:28.160 --> 15:30.160
Well, I don't know his purpose.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.160
I can tell you what happened to him.

15:33.160 --> 15:38.160
Mr. Adams came to the office in room 101.

15:38.160 --> 15:42.160
Mr. Cohn and I were both present.

15:42.160 --> 15:48.160
He asked if the hearings on Fort Marmot would resume.

15:48.160 --> 15:56.160
There had been a recess of a few weeks while the staff was getting out its reports.

15:57.160 --> 16:06.160
Mr. Cohn said he was sure that the chairman would resume the hearings when we had finished with the reports.

16:06.160 --> 16:18.160
He said that there was a question of the loyalty board yet to be considered and that he was sure the senator would be interested in those.

16:19.160 --> 16:30.160
Mr. Adams argued that, again, the same type of argument, he argued that the executive sessions had been held.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.160
We had now had several public sessions.

16:33.160 --> 16:41.160
He didn't think that there was any need to go into the loyalty board situation.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.160
Mr. Cohn did not agree with him.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.160
In fact, I didn't agree with him either.

16:47.160 --> 17:05.160
Mr. Adams was a little upset by this, not terrifically so, but somewhat upset by this, and said that he thought that we, Mr. Cohn and myself, could have cooperated with him a little more.

17:06.160 --> 17:12.160
He said that he had been trying to work with us and that we could cooperate with him.

17:12.160 --> 17:22.160
He said that since we didn't want to cooperate with him, maybe he could try a little bit of quote, cooperation and quote himself.

17:22.160 --> 17:31.160
He asked Mr. Cohn, how Mr. Cohn would like it if private shines were shipped over seas.

17:32.160 --> 17:46.160
He said that China not even finished his basic training and that he didn't see any reason why Adams should link this up with this subject of cooperation.

17:46.160 --> 17:57.160
He said that if after his training, and as far as he was concerned as soon as the reports were out, they wanted to ship shine overseas.

17:57.160 --> 18:09.160
That was perfectly alright, but he said that because he had been with the subcommittee, he should not be shipped overseas without completing his training.

18:09.160 --> 18:13.160
That's about the substance of that conversation.

18:13.160 --> 18:19.160
I frankly thought that Mr. Adams was baiting Mr. Cohn at this time.

18:20.160 --> 18:31.160
Now, is that the subject of which you had in mind when you dictated a memorandum to Senator McCarthy, did they defend you at 15, 1954?

18:31.160 --> 18:48.160
Yes, sir. That afternoon, I went upstairs to see Senator McCarthy. As I recall, I either dictated a scribble of note to him saying that...

18:49.160 --> 19:02.160
I thought that he would do well to try to talk to John Adams and see if they couldn't sort of calm him down on the subject.

19:02.160 --> 19:08.160
I thought John Adams was baiting Roy a little more than necessary at this time and that's from someone.

19:09.160 --> 19:19.160
Now, the example which you just stated was that the worst baiting that you noted in so far as Mr. Adams was concerned.

19:19.160 --> 19:23.160
Yes, I think it was about the worst example of baiting yet.

19:23.160 --> 19:35.160
And it's your testimony that Mr. Adams questioned about what would happen if Mr. Cohn was sent overseas.

19:35.160 --> 19:44.160
It came about after a rather heated discussion concerning the production of members of the lawyers.

19:44.160 --> 19:49.160
Yes, sir. That and the termination of the hairy.

19:54.160 --> 20:02.160
Now, Mr. Cohn, what occurred of any significance on January 19th?

20:05.160 --> 20:21.160
Well, on January 19th, Mr. Adams and the appeared before Senator McCarthy at a hearing at which loyalty for members had the request of the Cohn.

20:21.160 --> 20:27.160
He appeared himself and said that he didn't think they should appear.

20:27.160 --> 20:40.160
The Senator said that he had information and he wanted to question members of the lawyerly board concerning several matters including such things as fraud and misconduct.

20:40.160 --> 20:55.160
And that he felt that the board members, just as any other government employee or citizen had to respond to a subpoena, then they might answer certain questions or not answer certain questions.

20:55.160 --> 21:02.160
Now, when has the Senator requested the production of members of the lawyerly board?

21:02.160 --> 21:09.160
I think that morning or the afternoon before.

21:09.160 --> 21:12.160
And you speak in January 19th?

21:12.160 --> 21:13.160
Yes.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.160
And Mr. Adams came along?

21:15.160 --> 21:16.160
Yes.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.160
That's correct.

21:17.160 --> 21:24.160
And what was the senator's reaction to the failure to produce members of the lawyerly board?

21:24.160 --> 21:29.160
Well, it'd be difficult to say.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.160
I don't know what his reaction was.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.160
I know what happened.

21:32.160 --> 21:53.160
I know that as a result of Mr. Adams' appearance and the conversation that followed, Mr. Senator McCarthy and Mr. Adams agreed that by the following Friday, Mr. Adams would either produce or send over the person who was involved.

21:53.160 --> 22:02.160
And so, the person who requested or he would at a certain time of the day tell upon me and subpoenas would be issued.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.160
There was no argument.

22:05.160 --> 22:11.160
Well, subpoenas was the production of members of the lawyerly board ever actually prepared.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.160
Yes, subpoenas were prepared.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.160
But they were never issued.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.160
Never issued.

22:16.160 --> 22:21.160
Do you know when those subpoenas were prepared?

22:21.160 --> 22:27.160
In the day or so following Mr. Knight Heath meeting, I had them prepared.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.160
Around January 20th, that's right.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.160
Yes, sir.

22:31.160 --> 22:36.160
On the 22nd, Mr. Adams was to call me and I had the subpoenas ready.

22:36.160 --> 22:43.160
Well, did you ever conversation with Senator Dexon on January 22nd?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.160
Yes.

22:44.160 --> 22:55.160
On the morning in January 22nd, Senator Dexon called me and said that and asked me if I had issued the subpoenas,

22:55.160 --> 22:59.160
or subpoenas had been issued to certain members of the lawyerly board.

22:59.160 --> 23:04.160
And I told them that they were ready but they were not to be issued until later that day.

23:04.160 --> 23:12.160
The Senator told me that he had had a conversation with John Adams and that if the subpoenas were issued,

23:12.160 --> 23:22.160
Adams told him that there would be an embarrassing report issued concerning Mr. Kohn.

23:22.160 --> 23:27.160
He asked me not to issue the subpoenas until he could speak with the chairman.

23:27.160 --> 23:32.160
Senator McToth, am I in, of course, brief?

23:32.160 --> 23:37.160
There was no direction if you prepared the subpoenas.

23:37.160 --> 23:46.160
The subpoenas were prepared at the direction of the chairman.

23:46.160 --> 23:52.160
Prior to the preparation of each subpoenas, on their about January 20th,

23:52.160 --> 24:01.160
the state had you ever declared any subpoenas for production of lawyers for members?

24:01.160 --> 24:10.160
No, I don't think so. I think that the one time one appeared to Mr. Adams' predictions.

24:10.160 --> 24:21.160
Was there any relation to the demand for production of the lawyers' board members to the shine matter, Mr. Kohn?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.160
No, sir.

24:24.160 --> 24:33.160
And is it your testimony that regardless of the treatment of court and private shine,

24:33.160 --> 24:39.160
your committee would have permitted production of the lawyers' board members?

24:39.160 --> 24:45.160
Yes, sir. Senator McCaughty had always stated that he wanted members of the lawyer before him.

24:45.160 --> 24:51.160
And those who served each other had absolutely no relation one for the other?

24:51.160 --> 25:03.160
Now, when was the next attempt, or suggested by even Mr. Adams or Mr. Stevens,

25:03.160 --> 25:16.160
concerning your termination of investigation of the army for your foregoing issuing subpoenas for production of the lawyers' board members?

25:17.160 --> 25:26.160
Well, the following week, the week following January 19th and 22nd,

25:26.160 --> 25:32.160
fight by accident, I ran into Mr. Adams in the downstairs cafeteria,

25:32.160 --> 25:36.160
and we sat down and either had lunch or a cup of coffee,

25:36.160 --> 25:51.160
and Mr. Adams asked me if Mr. Kohn were angry about the business of the threatened report concerning him.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.160
I told him that I was sure that he was.

25:54.160 --> 26:04.160
I told him what Mr. Kohn had told me that he thought that John Adams had no business threatening to put out a report on him.

26:04.160 --> 26:11.160
I thought that it was a dishonest act when John's bought and that he was through with John. He would have nothing further to do with him.

26:11.160 --> 26:23.160
Mr. Adams told me that as far as he was concerned, he was very sorry about Mr. Kohn's attitude because he said that he liked Mr. Kohn personally,

26:23.160 --> 26:27.160
and he didn't want to have any disagreements with him.

26:27.160 --> 26:32.160
He said that putting out of the subpoenas,

26:32.160 --> 26:38.160
stopping of the subpoenas was something that he just had to do.

26:38.160 --> 26:43.160
He said he would stop at nothing to prevent the loyal board members from coming in.

26:43.160 --> 26:50.160
Now, there then followed some discussion about the subpoenas being stopped,

26:50.160 --> 26:57.160
and he told me that this was nothing for a right-pone to be angry with John Adams about.

26:57.160 --> 27:07.160
He said that the whole affair concerning the loyalty board and the stopping of the subpoenas was not a John Adams decision.

27:07.160 --> 27:12.160
He said that this was a high administration decision.

27:12.160 --> 27:19.160
He told me that he had had a conference with Bill Rogers of the Department of Justice.

27:19.160 --> 27:27.160
He also told me that there had been conferences with the Attorney General's office.

27:27.160 --> 27:31.160
That's about the substance of the conversation.

27:31.160 --> 27:36.160
Mr. Adams bought to January 27th.

27:36.160 --> 27:47.160
Ever since he complained with you concerning the late abuse by Mr. Kohn.

27:47.160 --> 27:52.160
Abuse? Abuse or mistreatment?

27:52.160 --> 27:56.160
No, I'd be nice to drive it, John.

27:56.160 --> 28:00.160
No, no, he hadn't.

28:00.160 --> 28:08.160
Now, Mr. Kohn, on March 5th, 1954,

28:08.160 --> 28:12.160
did you ever launch an engagement with Miss Adams?

28:12.160 --> 28:14.160
I yes, I did.

28:14.160 --> 28:20.160
Anything was said on the staff of the United States of America.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.160
Yes, sir.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.160
Well, if anything was said,

28:23.160 --> 28:31.160
we'd reference to the issuance of a report on the shine now.

28:31.160 --> 28:35.160
Yes, sir. The launch was held at the...

28:35.160 --> 28:39.160
We met for launch at the Methodist Building across the street.

28:39.160 --> 28:45.160
And, certainly, a lot of people go there and the food is fine.

28:45.160 --> 28:49.160
Mr. Adams and I set it one of the tables.

28:49.160 --> 28:54.160
And I recalled asking, Mr. Adams,

28:54.160 --> 28:59.160
was there going to be some sort of a report concerning Roy Kohn?

28:59.160 --> 29:03.160
I told him that I had read in the papers or had heard the discussion,

29:03.160 --> 29:09.160
talked that several senators had requested of the Army or the Defense Department

29:09.160 --> 29:13.160
and alleged reports concerning Roy Kohn.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.160
Mr. Adams told me that...

29:16.160 --> 29:22.160
Mr. Adams said that, yes, that senators had asked for a report,

29:22.160 --> 29:25.160
but he said he didn't think they were going to get it.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.160
He told me not to worry about it.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.160
He said there's nothing to it.

29:29.160 --> 29:34.160
That was the end of that portion of the conversation.

29:34.160 --> 29:43.160
We then talked about Mr. Adams's own personal position.

29:43.160 --> 29:50.160
Was anything else stated on the occasion of the launch of March 5th

29:50.160 --> 29:57.160
that relates to your specifications or charges?

29:57.160 --> 30:00.160
Yes, sir. I think so.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.160
Would you state it, please?

30:02.160 --> 30:11.160
Yes, Mr. Adams said that he wanted to reestablish himself

30:11.160 --> 30:17.160
on a friendly relationship with Senator McCarthy and Roy Kohn.

30:17.160 --> 30:26.160
He said that Mr. Kohn had not been friendly with him since sometime in January.

30:26.160 --> 30:33.160
He said that Senator McCarthy had let it be known that he wouldn't have anything further to do with John Adams.

30:33.160 --> 30:40.160
He said that the position of the senator had reached the Pentagon

30:40.160 --> 30:42.160
and that it was damaging to him.

30:42.160 --> 30:50.160
The man assigned to contact with the committee if both the Chief Council and the Chairman of the Committee

30:50.160 --> 30:52.160
would have nothing to do with him.

30:52.160 --> 31:01.160
He asked me if I would help him in more or less patching up the differences as far as he was concerned.

31:01.160 --> 31:06.160
I told him that I would see what I could do.

31:06.160 --> 31:12.160
Have you stated the substantive conversation now March 5th

31:12.160 --> 31:16.160
and so far as it relates to your charges?

31:16.160 --> 31:23.160
Well, there was one other, I believe there was one other topic.
