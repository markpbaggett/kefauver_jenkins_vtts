WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.880
with this getting back on family terms with the senator, Mr. Cohn, that he knew that

00:07.880 --> 00:15.920
Mr. Cohn and Senator McCarthy would never believe that he had had nothing to do with the

00:15.920 --> 00:20.440
incidents that followed the General's Wicker testimony.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.800
He said that the matter had been taken out of his hands entirely and that it was a high

00:25.800 --> 00:26.800
policy matter.

00:26.800 --> 00:36.880
There was another portion of the conversation which concerned the fact that the subcommittee

00:36.880 --> 00:42.840
had at that period of time been calling before it individual uniform members of the Communist

00:42.840 --> 00:47.320
Party in executive and public session.

00:47.320 --> 01:02.760
Mr. Adams had volunteered the appearance of the secretary of the Army before the subcommittee

01:02.760 --> 01:09.080
to explain the Army's position in policy concerning communist and alleged communists before

01:09.080 --> 01:11.080
the subcommittee.

01:11.080 --> 01:16.240
I remember there was some more of us kidding and joking back and forth between here and

01:16.240 --> 01:20.400
that point since he had volunteered the secretary's appearance.

01:20.400 --> 01:28.400
Mr. Adams said that there was some, but he asked me how many more of the uniform communists

01:28.400 --> 01:30.640
we would call before the subcommittee.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.000
I told him that we knew of several.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.400
He said that there are probably 200 of them in the Army that you could call before the

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
committee.

01:41.400 --> 01:49.000
I asked me if there was any possibility of discontinuing calling any of more of these

01:49.000 --> 01:54.720
uniform members of the party or alleged members of the party before the subcommittee until

01:54.720 --> 01:58.240
after Mr. Stevens had testified.

01:58.240 --> 02:03.600
I told him that I would see what I could do about that matter.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.920
Mr. Carp of the room before we conclude your direct examination.

02:07.920 --> 02:15.520
Now ask you if there is any additional statement that you would like to make concerning the

02:15.520 --> 02:23.440
specifications filed with committee by Senator McCartney for the long your behalf and

02:23.440 --> 02:25.960
on Mr. Coleman's behalf as well as his own.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.360
Do you care to make any other statement?

02:28.360 --> 02:29.360
No, sir.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.360
I think we've covered it.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.360
There's something I've overlooked why.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.360
I'm sure you'll bring it out.

02:34.360 --> 02:44.160
Now, let the car turn to examination of you more in the nature of cross-examination.

02:44.160 --> 02:57.920
I should like to ask you and you capacity as executive director because they commit and

02:57.920 --> 03:00.680
I believe you state as chief investigator.

03:00.680 --> 03:12.080
Do you have supervision and control over the other investigators on the stand?

03:12.080 --> 03:13.080
Yes, sir.

03:13.080 --> 03:20.720
Yes, I'm the administrative of the child in person in charge of the investigator, yes.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.520
Formerly, you had got to give her in the cross-examination while we were.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.520
Yes, yes, yes.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.520
Two other investigators.

03:26.520 --> 03:31.440
Yes, I do and they also give suggestions to me.

03:31.440 --> 03:35.080
And are they under your supervision and control?

03:35.080 --> 03:37.120
Generally speaking, yes.

03:37.120 --> 03:42.280
When did you first meet Mr. Shine?

03:42.280 --> 03:47.760
I think that I first met him at 8950, delivered.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.640
After I'd come with the committee, although I have a very recollection of having been

03:52.640 --> 03:57.240
introduced to him somewhere in New York prior to that time.

03:57.240 --> 04:05.200
Did you know after you came to the committee that Mr. Shine and Mr. Cohn were close personal

04:05.200 --> 04:06.200
friends?

04:06.200 --> 04:09.840
I assume they were in Francesco.

04:09.840 --> 04:22.240
And I'll ask you to state, Mr. Carr, in a general sort of a way, the qualifications of

04:22.240 --> 04:29.120
the other investigators on your committee.

04:29.120 --> 04:36.480
In general, are they men of experience with the FBI or justice department?

04:36.480 --> 04:38.520
All on you?

04:38.520 --> 04:42.480
Yes, sir.

04:42.480 --> 04:49.920
Most of them have gained knowledge through having worked their way up more or less with the

04:49.920 --> 04:50.920
committee.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.040
And they have become investigators, yes?

04:55.040 --> 05:02.040
Do you have any investigators on your state under your supervision and control or otherwise?

05:02.040 --> 05:11.480
Do you have not yet tried experience in FBI, justice department or who are not lawyers?

05:11.480 --> 05:13.760
Yes, sir.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.760
We have...

05:14.760 --> 05:15.760
We don't.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.760
The state is very misplaced.

05:18.760 --> 05:19.760
Yes, sir.

05:19.760 --> 05:28.120
We have two men who are in the category that I have explained who had started out with

05:28.120 --> 05:35.160
the committee as staff assistance and have been assisting investigations and now conduct

05:35.160 --> 05:36.160
investigations and stuff.

05:36.160 --> 05:42.320
I mean, they've had long practical experience as members of the staff of the subcommittee.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.320
Yes, and no.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.760
They've had experience with the staff of some of them.

05:47.760 --> 05:54.000
Well, Mr. Clark, rather get an exact answer on that question if we can.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.120
Yes, so one has had what I would consider long experience and the other has had what

05:59.120 --> 06:01.600
I would consider somewhat less experienced.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.120
Now, what do you mean by somewhat less experienced?

06:04.120 --> 06:10.960
I think the experience of about a year prior to just doing the investigator.

06:10.960 --> 06:18.160
Now, what happens to Mr. Shine and his qualifications and his investigative experience?

06:18.160 --> 06:27.640
I'll ask you to assign an immediate investigative test to Mr. Shine after you became executive

06:27.640 --> 06:28.640
director.

06:28.640 --> 06:29.640
No, sir, I did.

06:29.640 --> 06:38.280
Well, did Mr. Shine undertake these investigative tests after you became executive director?

06:38.280 --> 06:42.520
Well, sir, I better explain it this way.

06:42.520 --> 06:49.240
When I came with the subcommittee, Mr. Shine was already a consultant with the committee.

06:49.240 --> 06:53.400
Mr. Shine was doing this part time.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.680
He was in New York.

06:54.680 --> 06:59.920
When he was in Washington, he had some office space over in the other building and the HLC

06:59.920 --> 07:03.560
building, I believe it is, and I had space here.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.720
He was not often in Washington after I came with the committee.

07:07.720 --> 07:16.440
I think that Mr. Shine's thoughts, suggestions, were channels to be coordinated with me through

07:16.440 --> 07:17.440
Mr. Cohn.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.640
I understand your question only then.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.040
Mr. Shine was a part time consultant.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.040
I guess so.

07:24.040 --> 07:33.240
He spent only a small portion of his time in his class years consulting with this committee.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.240
No, sir.

07:34.240 --> 07:39.480
When I say part time, I mean that he didn't have both his full time too, that he also was

07:39.480 --> 07:41.280
running a business.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.360
He did spend a good deal of time with the committee on committee work.

07:44.360 --> 07:51.000
Well, man, after you came with the committee, July 16th of last year, and until November

07:51.000 --> 08:02.200
3, 1953, Mr. Shine spent the greatest portion of his time in New York running his business,

08:02.200 --> 08:06.200
and he spent the greatest portion of his time in work on the committee.

08:06.200 --> 08:13.720
I think it's your committee who is what all of the employees of the committee do.

08:13.720 --> 08:18.320
Yes, sir, I'm familiar with the employees of the committee, the work that they do.

08:18.320 --> 08:23.600
As I've explained, however, Mr. Shine was a consultant for the committee.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.720
He did committee work in New York City.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.400
He did some down here as I say.

08:29.400 --> 08:34.400
After I came with the committee, most of his time was spent in New York.

08:34.400 --> 08:41.600
A fraction of the time with Mr. Shine spent in Washington during that period, and as you

08:41.600 --> 08:47.960
asked 16 until November 3.

08:47.960 --> 08:54.400
I would say he spent a fair portion of his time with me.

08:54.400 --> 08:59.880
I would be happy to say how many days I did see him here.

08:59.880 --> 09:06.680
We had hearings of Washington in August and September, later in the fall.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.240
He was here on other occasions.

09:09.240 --> 09:14.160
He was not here every day as most of all the other investigators worked.

09:14.160 --> 09:19.560
In a general sort of a way, what service did Mr. Shine render to the committee during

09:19.560 --> 09:22.240
the period that he had just been in the heat?

09:22.240 --> 09:26.880
Since I've come, I came in from the mayor's in front of New York City.

09:26.880 --> 09:36.120
Mr. Shine, as a consultant, was working on the development of information which was

09:36.120 --> 09:38.000
the assistance to the committee.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.320
He had done a good deal of work prior to I came with the committee on the voice of America.

09:44.320 --> 09:49.240
He maintained his contact with that investigation.

09:49.240 --> 10:00.080
He had more or less projected a plan for continued investigation of the voice of America.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.360
Some faces of the voice of America.

10:02.360 --> 10:11.560
He contacted confidential informants to assist in the development of the government printing

10:11.560 --> 10:12.560
office case.

10:12.560 --> 10:17.480
He had a matter of fact that was knowledge that he learned through the voice of America

10:17.480 --> 10:24.880
case that we first got on to the fact that there were a communist employed at the government

10:24.880 --> 10:26.480
printing office.

10:26.480 --> 10:35.360
He had an informant who was of great assistance in connection with the Fort Mama investigation.

10:35.360 --> 10:45.960
He had another contact who furnished information concerning the General Electric Company in

10:45.960 --> 10:49.160
Upper State New York, which is the area of his home.

10:49.160 --> 10:53.160
Mr. Carwood, supervise the work of the Prime Minister.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.160
Mr. Shine.

10:54.160 --> 11:02.200
Well, sir, I don't know that it was supervised in any strict sense as you might say that

11:02.200 --> 11:05.600
of the other investigators was.

11:05.600 --> 11:11.760
The work of the subcommittee is an informal work until we get around to having hearings,

11:11.760 --> 11:14.640
it's preparation for hearings.

11:14.640 --> 11:23.200
As I say, Mr. Shine's activity and his work was reported and coordinated with me through

11:23.200 --> 11:24.200
Mr. Colman.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.440
Through Mr. Colman, did you say that?

11:26.440 --> 11:27.440
Yes.

11:27.440 --> 11:32.440
Was Mr. Shine responsible to you for the work that you did?

11:32.440 --> 11:33.440
No, sir.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.440
I wouldn't say so.

11:34.440 --> 11:39.160
I always felt that Mr. Shine was responsible to the senator.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.160
He was a consultant.

11:40.160 --> 11:45.880
Mr. Colman was the chief counsel and I was the staff director.

11:45.880 --> 11:51.720
I thought that we were all responsible to the senator and that we should at best, best

11:51.720 --> 11:54.480
we could coordinate our work.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
Mr. Carwood.

11:55.480 --> 12:07.120
There's been an introduction evidence of monetary calls of November 7 between Senate and

12:07.120 --> 12:18.680
the court and Secretary Stevens in which the Senate that stated in substance I believe

12:18.680 --> 12:26.480
that on the subject of Shine Mr. Colman was completely unreasonable.

12:26.480 --> 12:34.560
Now, Mr. Carwood, you've described to that state on the senator.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.560
As far as I am concerned, no, he was never unreasonable.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.560
Me?

12:39.560 --> 12:42.560
Well, unreasonable to any degree.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.560
I know, sir, not as far as I'm concerned.

12:44.560 --> 12:49.880
And it's your testimony that Mr. Colman was not unreasonable on the subject of Shine.

12:49.880 --> 12:50.880
I know, sir.

12:50.880 --> 13:02.160
Now, you stated at least here the efforts of beating tactics on the part of Mr. Adams holding

13:02.160 --> 13:12.760
up small favors or tibits in order to gain a termination of your investigation.

13:12.760 --> 13:17.200
You recall your testimony after you got it.

13:17.200 --> 13:28.240
Now, what effect would it have on Mr. Colman's disfating that Mr. Adams used?

13:28.240 --> 13:35.240
Now, I was just myself interested to the instance of January 14.

13:35.240 --> 13:43.240
Mr. Colman, the effect it had on Mr. Colman was that it annoyed him.

13:43.240 --> 13:49.160
Mr. Colman felt very strongly that he, since he was responsible in some measure for bringing

13:49.160 --> 13:55.940
Mr. Shine with the subcommittee that Mr. Shine should not be discriminated against by the

13:55.940 --> 13:56.940
army.

13:56.940 --> 13:59.780
He should not be used by the army.

13:59.780 --> 14:05.820
An example of what Mr. Colman apparently had in mind was the fact that Mr. Adams brought

14:05.820 --> 14:10.980
up this business of shipping and molding scenes before he actually finished his training.

14:10.980 --> 14:17.300
Another example I might think of is this publicized statement by a general in the army that he

14:17.300 --> 14:21.220
would give $100 to anyone who would poke Shine in the nose.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.220
That type of thing.

14:22.220 --> 14:27.180
Mr. Colman felt that Shine should not be discriminated against because he had worked

14:27.180 --> 14:28.180
with the committee.

14:28.180 --> 14:34.180
Well, was this essentially a subject with Mr. Colman?

14:34.180 --> 14:36.180
What do you mean sensitive?

14:36.180 --> 14:38.180
On the question of Shine.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.180
I wouldn't.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.180
Mr. Adams made it.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.180
He was stated.

14:41.180 --> 14:47.180
No, I wouldn't say it was a sensitive subject with Mr. Colman.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.180
Mr. Adams stated him.

14:49.180 --> 14:53.700
Mr. Colman for a long time took a good deal of baiting.

14:53.700 --> 14:58.180
Once in a while, it would get under his skin as it would anyone else.

14:58.180 --> 15:09.420
I want to refer you to Mr. Adams' testimony on page 2606 of the record that relates to the

15:09.420 --> 15:12.420
conversation of January 14th.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.420
The evidence of Mr. Colman.

15:15.420 --> 15:17.420
And I'll read from Mr. Adams' testimony.

15:22.420 --> 15:26.420
Mr. Adams, yes sir, that is right.

15:26.420 --> 15:32.420
I asked him what would happen if Shine got overseas duty.

15:32.420 --> 15:35.420
He responded with bigger and more.

15:35.420 --> 15:39.420
Colman, Steven is through a sectarian army.

15:40.420 --> 15:44.420
I said, both O'Roy and something to this effect.

15:44.420 --> 15:46.420
O'Roy, don't say that.

15:46.420 --> 15:52.420
Come on, really, what is going to happen if Shine gets overseas duty.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.420
He responded with even more force.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.420
Colman, we will wreck the army.

15:58.420 --> 16:04.420
Now, is the statement which I have guessed right?

16:04.420 --> 16:06.420
Attributable to Mr. Colman.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.420
Correct.

16:08.420 --> 16:15.420
No sir, I was there in the room after Mr. Adams had mentioned this chipping of Shine overseas.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.420
Mr. Colman did not make the statement.

16:17.420 --> 16:22.420
There is no question, but what that question was brought up.

16:22.420 --> 16:27.420
Mr. Adams asked Mr. Colman what would happen if Shine was then overseas.

16:27.420 --> 16:33.420
I don't recall him saying what would happen if Mr. Shine was then overseas.

16:34.420 --> 16:40.420
I recall he said something about how cooperated with you for us a little bit.

16:40.420 --> 16:44.420
Now, what would you like if I sent Adams overseas?

16:44.420 --> 16:47.420
That's a front-to-channel scene.

16:47.420 --> 16:52.420
And it is your testimony that Mr. Colman did not make any response.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.420
In substance, Colman, we will wreck the army.

16:54.420 --> 16:55.420
That's correct.

16:55.420 --> 16:56.420
That's correct.

16:56.420 --> 17:01.420
I'll read further from Mr. Adams' testimony on page 2607.

17:02.420 --> 17:11.420
Then he said, Colman, the first thing we are going to do is get General Ryan for the way he has treated Dave at Fort Dix.

17:11.420 --> 17:15.420
Dave gets through at Fort Dix tomorrow or this week.

17:15.420 --> 17:24.420
And as soon as he is gone, we are going to get General Ryan for the obscene way in which he has committed shine to be treated up there.

17:24.420 --> 17:28.420
He said, Colman, we are not going to do it ourselves.

17:28.420 --> 17:31.420
We have another committee of the Congress interested in it.

17:31.420 --> 17:35.420
Then he said, I wouldn't put it past you to do this.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.420
We will start investigation.

17:37.420 --> 17:42.420
We have enough stuff on the army to keep investigations going indefinitely.

17:42.420 --> 17:51.420
And if anything, like such and such double-cross occurs, that is what we will do.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.420
Did you follow me as I read, Mr. Car?

17:54.420 --> 17:55.420
Yes, pretty much.

17:55.420 --> 18:00.420
Did Mr. Colman make any such statement or the substance?

18:00.420 --> 18:02.420
No, he did not.

18:02.420 --> 18:03.420
No, sir, he did not.

18:03.420 --> 18:05.420
I am sure that I would have recalled it.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.420
I said anything concerning General Ryan.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.420
My contact with General Ryan has been most pleasant.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.420
I thought he was a bind gentleman.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.420
I am sure he would have recalled it.

18:13.420 --> 18:20.420
Are you within hearing distance of Mr. Colman and Mr. Adams during the entire time of their conversation on this particular case?

18:21.420 --> 18:27.420
Yes, I was, except for the very beginning of the conversation on the port name, yes.

18:27.420 --> 18:32.420
But after the search, he took a shine, was in a pose, you say, by Mr. Adams?

18:32.420 --> 18:33.420
Yes.

18:33.420 --> 18:37.420
You work within hearing distance of each gentleman as they converge.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.420
Yes, I was in a room.

18:38.420 --> 18:49.420
And it's your testimony that no such statement as I just read, which is attributable to Mr. Colman by Mr. Adams, was made by Mr. Colman.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.420
Yes, sir, that's my testimony.

18:52.420 --> 19:05.420
And this statement concerning what we are going to do about General Ryan for the way he has treated China and Fort Dix is just the pigment of the imagination of Mr. Adams.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.420
Well, I don't know what it is.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.420
I know that this didn't happen.

19:08.420 --> 19:13.420
I know that if it had happened, I would have gotten into the conversation at that point.

19:14.420 --> 19:25.420
Well, what was stated by Mr. Colman in response to the inquiry of Mr. Adams concerning the possibility of China's shipment overseas?

19:27.420 --> 19:42.420
Well, at that point, Mr. Cron said that he could see no reason for China being sent overseas, that he was disgusted with Mr. Adams for tying that in with the statement of cooperation.

19:42.420 --> 19:51.420
And with the statement about a request for ending the hearing, I recall something about he has not had enough training to go overseas.

19:53.420 --> 20:02.420
Did Mr. Colman or let occasion or any other occasion make the statement quote Steven is true as Secretary of the Army?

20:02.420 --> 20:03.420
No, sir, nothing like that.

20:03.420 --> 20:04.420
No, I know.

20:04.420 --> 20:09.420
And if he made any such statement on January 14, you don't know anything about it.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.420
That's correct.

20:12.420 --> 20:17.420
Now, Mr. Car shifting back to an earlier date.

20:20.420 --> 20:34.420
Now, last few if you recall, Mr. Adams testimony that around the time that Dave Shine was inducted into the Army November 3,

20:35.420 --> 20:39.420
Adams had a conversation with Mr. Colman in which he will present.

20:40.420 --> 20:43.420
Page 2533 of the record.

20:44.420 --> 20:51.420
That that conversation occurred in room 101 in the Senate Office building.

20:52.420 --> 21:03.420
At which time in substance, Mr. Adams stated to Mr. Colman that the National Empress will preclude

21:05.420 --> 21:10.420
Mr. Adams doing anything in a preference your way for Mr. Shine.

21:10.420 --> 21:13.420
Did you recall the substance of that testimony?

21:13.420 --> 21:16.420
No, I'm just looking at all the evidence.

21:23.420 --> 21:28.420
I will read from the record, Mr. Car page 2533.

21:29.420 --> 21:38.420
Mr. Adams, yes sir, I pointed out to him that I was 15 years here seeing him.

21:38.420 --> 21:53.420
And although I did not at all presume to be as good a lawyer as he was, and I am sure that I am not, that I did feel that there was one field in which I could give him some friendly advice if he would take him.

21:54.420 --> 22:02.420
I pointed out to him that the National Empress required that Shine be treated just like every other soldier.

22:02.420 --> 22:08.420
Mr. Jenkins, what was his reply to that, Mr. Adams if you have finished?

22:08.420 --> 22:17.420
Mr. Adams, it was the wrong clause to use because he excluded at that and said if the National Empress was the thing with...

22:18.420 --> 22:21.420
He would give us a little bit.

22:21.420 --> 22:27.420
The outline how they would hold a series of hearings and point it out to us.

22:27.420 --> 22:32.420
He would give us a little national interest if that was what we were interested in.

22:32.420 --> 22:36.420
That was the substance. This was the substance.

22:36.420 --> 22:42.420
Shine which caused the regeneration of an otherwise friendly relationship over the months.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.420
Now did you call him, Mr. Car?

22:44.420 --> 22:45.420
Yes, sir.

22:45.420 --> 22:50.420
Do you recall any such conversation between Mr. Adams and Mr. Colme?

22:50.420 --> 22:54.420
Well, that was the adoption of Shine was discussed.

22:54.420 --> 22:55.420
No, sir.

22:55.420 --> 23:00.420
You were not present if any such conversation did impact the court.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.420
Yes, sir. I don't recall any such conversation.

23:03.420 --> 23:08.420
Now let's go to December 17th.

23:09.420 --> 23:18.420
And I'll ask you if on the morning of December 17th, and that was preceding this automobile ride,

23:18.420 --> 23:37.420
Senate to MacArthur, who had remained abused, or was critical of you with reference to the intervention of the committee on behalf of Shine at Fort Dicks.

23:39.420 --> 23:40.420
No, sir. Did not.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.420
Did he discuss that matter with you?

23:43.420 --> 23:45.420
Not that time, nothing.

23:45.420 --> 23:50.420
Now, as you too, refresh your memory if you can.

23:50.420 --> 24:00.420
By turning to Mr. Adams' testimony, page 2586 of the record, and I'll read it.

24:01.420 --> 24:06.420
Mr. Car was in the room, and this is Thursday, December 17th.

24:06.420 --> 24:11.420
When we walked into the room, he began to speak to Mr. Car about the subject.

24:11.420 --> 24:20.420
And he began to criticize Mr. Car about the matter that he had spoken to me about, and to clarify it,

24:20.420 --> 24:25.420
I'll read the preceding paragraph on page 2585.

24:26.420 --> 24:42.420
Senator McCartney stated to me that the purpose of his call for night before was that he had just learned that it deduced on the previous day of the amount of interference with the officials at Fort Dicks, which is set at a conference.

24:42.420 --> 24:49.420
And that he wished to tell me that as I've been and now it was through, it is ceased.

24:49.420 --> 24:52.420
And that he was not going to permit it anymore.

24:52.420 --> 25:02.420
I told him I was gratified to get that information, but it would be absolutely of no value to me unless he stated it to come in front of me.

25:02.420 --> 25:05.420
Now, do you recall that testimony, Mr. Car?

25:05.420 --> 25:06.420
Yes, sir.

25:06.420 --> 25:18.420
And it is your testimony now under oath that Senator McCartney did not speak to you on the morning of December 17th, with reference to any intervention on behalf of Chine,

25:18.420 --> 25:20.420
by members of the committee.

25:20.420 --> 25:21.420
That's correct.

25:21.420 --> 25:29.420
And you deny that any such referment is test-fired to by Mr. Adam Stiff, please?

25:29.420 --> 25:34.420
No, I, and the Senator McCartney, who's recommended me, but not on that subject.

25:34.420 --> 25:37.420
He did not referment you concerning Chine.

25:37.420 --> 25:38.420
Right.

25:38.420 --> 25:42.420
Did he discuss with you on that morning the subject of Chine?

25:42.420 --> 25:45.420
No, no, his activities at Fort Dicks.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.420
Not on that morning, sir.

25:48.420 --> 25:50.420
Thank you.
