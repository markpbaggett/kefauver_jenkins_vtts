00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Hello Charlie, I'm from Toronto too.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.480
Well, what is this mysterious theme you've picked up

00:05.480 --> 00:08.120
to get to me, so let's get into real-reaching

00:08.120 --> 00:10.880
deep into the male copy during the week.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.080
It made a little so great that these uppressions

00:13.080 --> 00:16.280
were being most asked only part of our friends

00:16.280 --> 00:19.360
in Tennessee as they like to use some lead letters

00:19.360 --> 00:21.080
and telegrams that I have to catch

00:21.080 --> 00:24.320
and punch my questions to either answer.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.040
Of course, the Korean War between a little more

00:27.040 --> 00:29.280
real-reaching scene to take care of it.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.720
That's right Charlie, I'm from the National Guard Unit

00:31.720 --> 00:35.400
filed in the federal service by the 2278

00:35.400 --> 00:39.120
Regimental Combat Team of the Tennessee Guard.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.880
Under the command of Warren Jow,

00:40.880 --> 00:42.720
the outside has units and drifts of

00:42.720 --> 00:44.800
transport, toxic bird, acid,

00:44.800 --> 00:47.720
and the not-gill and no-today.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.360
These men will have 30 days in which

00:49.360 --> 00:51.760
they get ready to report on September 1st

00:51.760 --> 00:54.480
to camp dozens near Boston.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.320
We hate to see them go, but I have to go

00:56.320 --> 00:57.840
that to file out of it.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.640
Honestly, it's not file about 100 states from nothing

01:00.640 --> 01:02.560
and time and trouble.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.560
I see you have on hand the male bag

01:05.560 --> 01:07.960
of Charlie and what's the first copy.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.680
The most controversial subjects in our male bag

01:11.680 --> 01:14.640
deals with the question of economic control.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.600
In fact, it's probably the biggest domestic problem

01:17.600 --> 01:20.800
concerning the Korean fighting the nationality thing.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.120
What are the proposals in Michigan for the big questions

01:24.120 --> 01:26.320
that you say Charlie are?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.320
What are the proposals that they are big controls?

01:28.320 --> 01:30.320
How much controls should they be?

01:30.320 --> 01:32.320
And when should they be applied?

01:32.320 --> 01:36.320
President Truman recommended a program of partial controls.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.520
His latest recommendation is to be effective weight-priced

01:39.520 --> 01:41.920
and man-priced controls are not necessary

01:41.920 --> 01:43.920
in a certain situation.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.920
And short, the president doesn't believe

01:45.920 --> 01:49.520
the current situation wants all our mobile regulations.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.520
And where he does think so,

01:51.520 --> 01:53.320
he will very likely not have

01:53.320 --> 01:56.120
for economic and man-priced controls.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.120
The other states, Mr. Bernard Baruch

01:58.120 --> 02:01.720
on the other hand thinks we can go all out now.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.720
And Mr. Baruch has a wealth of experience,

02:04.720 --> 02:07.720
committed experience in World War I and World War II.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.320
And that's not it.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.320
The Baruch plan outlined by his office

02:11.320 --> 02:13.120
before the Senate's backing in current

02:13.120 --> 02:16.120
is committed during the last week.

02:16.120 --> 02:20.520
House of feelings, House of Souls, on everything now.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.720
I would say that I did it.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.920
I may only be running for in favor of the Baruch claim.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.120
Now that you have outlined,

02:27.120 --> 02:29.920
there's been women in the Baruch proposal.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.520
So you advise us how you feel about the question

02:32.520 --> 02:33.920
of economic control.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.780
As a matter of fact,

02:34.780 --> 02:37.720
I've always told you that the Baruch plan,

02:37.720 --> 02:40.720
I did it in World War II and I do now.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.720
But they do not, the decision required

02:42.720 --> 02:44.720
a little more explanation.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.120
Now the gold or unclutching usage

02:47.120 --> 02:49.920
in all the maritime controls are most undesirable.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.520
And they are just talking to the court

02:51.520 --> 02:54.720
to our American freedom and way of life.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.120
About our very tenure and nature economic control

02:58.120 --> 03:00.120
and control the land power of harm

03:00.120 --> 03:03.120
through the way we like to live here in this country.

03:03.120 --> 03:03.720
That's all.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.120
So in the Korean aggression,

03:05.120 --> 03:06.920
harm dry way of life.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.120
This is an emergency period in my opinion.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.120
And when the situation gets bad enough

03:11.120 --> 03:13.520
as it has for Americans' blood to be filled

03:13.520 --> 03:15.520
to preserve our way of life,

03:15.520 --> 03:18.120
then the time has arrived for American treasure

03:18.120 --> 03:20.920
to be drafted and served also.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.320
So I say really immediate institution

03:23.320 --> 03:25.120
of the root of the border,

03:25.120 --> 03:28.720
that they now have wanted to do early in World War II.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.220
I dare to say here also immediate

03:31.220 --> 03:32.920
economic control.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.520
Just like the dining house,

03:34.520 --> 03:36.920
fighting, waiting, there's a lot of.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.520
Try to be successful and it's just

03:38.520 --> 03:40.920
that most controlled must be about.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.920
Fight is not taking control of the force

03:42.920 --> 03:45.920
but wages must have a ceiling on them as well.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.520
Unless the stores are flat

03:47.520 --> 03:50.920
who wages, fighting, rent and profit.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.120
There will be no more burden

03:53.120 --> 03:54.720
and will be more voting votes

03:54.720 --> 03:57.320
kept buying more unnecessary taxes

03:57.320 --> 04:00.120
among justified fighting groups.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.720
The upper half-fifth controls

04:01.720 --> 04:03.720
and leave off weight-steering pensions

04:03.720 --> 04:06.320
but result in an instigating period of inflation

04:06.320 --> 04:09.320
and hardship on Thomas Smith.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.720
The same with two of the pilots

04:10.720 --> 04:12.720
last feeling on one part of our

04:12.720 --> 04:14.920
art controls on one part of our economy

04:14.920 --> 04:16.920
without a full out of spying on this

04:16.920 --> 04:19.520
that we just came to.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.720
It would have spied and perhaps

04:20.720 --> 04:22.520
this far and you wage the land

04:22.520 --> 04:25.120
in public wage labor to.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.520
We can't stand labor to speak

04:26.520 --> 04:28.720
to our wages at this time.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.320
And a way to prevent wage demand

04:30.320 --> 04:32.120
is to have inflation by putting

04:32.120 --> 04:33.920
steel in on both sides

04:33.920 --> 04:35.920
wages and profits.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.120
The credit to our food pages again

04:38.120 --> 04:41.120
is just in total at this time

04:41.120 --> 04:42.320
a little harsh

04:42.320 --> 04:44.520
but our first man don't challenge.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.720
Of course, we're very hopeful

04:45.720 --> 04:47.320
that our speech at in Korea

04:47.320 --> 04:48.360
will now remain

04:48.360 --> 04:51.160
hopeful to get out to push back again.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.560
But it matters now at the end

04:52.560 --> 04:53.960
we can only be in a state

04:53.960 --> 04:56.960
and it's filming at least for the time being.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.960
That the action in Korea is

04:58.960 --> 05:00.960
if we lose or maybe if we lose

05:00.960 --> 05:02.560
the world's worth, we.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.160
Of course, we hope that the

05:04.160 --> 05:06.160
world will be pushed down

05:06.160 --> 05:07.760
but we will be moved and realistic

05:07.760 --> 05:08.560
through our time

05:08.560 --> 05:10.160
than the other way.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.560
If the world is all

05:11.560 --> 05:13.960
and we do not have general water

05:13.960 --> 05:15.960
and we haven't lost anything much

05:15.960 --> 05:17.960
and perhaps we'll make

05:17.960 --> 05:20.760
a change in the future.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.760
And we are spending the context

05:22.760 --> 05:25.160
we will have embedded ourselves

05:25.160 --> 05:26.160
for less.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
What he here had to eat about

05:28.160 --> 05:30.160
the mechanics of the planning

05:30.160 --> 05:32.160
is over 50 dollars.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.160
Plan.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.160
I'm for applying them right now.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.160
But if hunger wants to delay the plan

05:37.160 --> 05:38.960
I'm saying that it's been

05:38.960 --> 05:40.560
I think hunger can do it by

05:40.560 --> 05:42.160
resolution at the top of time

05:42.160 --> 05:44.160
and hunger can do it.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.160
The hunger is not in session

05:46.160 --> 05:48.960
and it's not in session.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.960
That's the matter

05:50.960 --> 05:52.760
I tell you our

05:52.760 --> 05:53.760
ballot paper controls

05:53.760 --> 05:54.760
not work.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.760
I always appeal

05:55.760 --> 05:56.760
and I'm about

05:56.760 --> 05:57.760
by the rules

05:57.760 --> 05:59.760
but you think the president

05:59.760 --> 06:00.760
might be told

06:00.760 --> 06:01.760
that the police proposes

06:01.760 --> 06:02.560
and the other

06:02.560 --> 06:04.360
recommendations for less.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.560
I doubt that he would

06:05.560 --> 06:06.960
if hunger's my

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
fellow child.

06:07.960 --> 06:08.960
Actually the people

06:08.960 --> 06:09.960
think that they even

06:09.960 --> 06:10.960
have a fellow ahead of

06:10.960 --> 06:11.960
hunger and hunger

06:11.960 --> 06:12.560
because they're

06:12.560 --> 06:13.960
the head of the president

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
that they're not.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
Another question

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
is I think the real

06:16.960 --> 06:17.760
mayor of the state

06:17.760 --> 06:18.760
borrow it

06:18.760 --> 06:19.760
and cooperate.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.760
And that is so

06:20.760 --> 06:21.760
he's on that.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.280
He's a

06:22.280 --> 06:23.280
terrible

06:23.280 --> 06:24.280
cruel telephone

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
for us.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.560
Many times the

06:26.560 --> 06:27.240
tragic

06:27.240 --> 06:28.240
time is on the

06:28.240 --> 06:29.240
page of the group

06:29.240 --> 06:30.240
our destination

06:30.240 --> 06:31.360
of private

06:31.360 --> 06:32.360
festivals

06:32.360 --> 06:33.360
could not

06:33.360 --> 06:34.360

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
wish to

06:41.360 --> 06:42.360
available to

06:42.360 --> 06:42.360


06:42.360 --> 06:43.360
On the other hand

06:43.360 --> 06:44.360
we have

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
become
