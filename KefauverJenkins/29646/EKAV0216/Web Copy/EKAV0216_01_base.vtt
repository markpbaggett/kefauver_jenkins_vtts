WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'll be right back.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
You're welcome.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Welcome.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
David.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
You're right.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Come on.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Can anybody come to our room?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Come on.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Come on.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Can anybody come to our room?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Please.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Come on.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Come on.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Come on.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Come on.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Come on.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Come on.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Maggie.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
You can see that the road's all over the farm.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Come on.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
We're bound.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
I'm going to turn like a road call.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
We'll find out what's in there.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
We'll find out what's in there.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
We'll find out what's in there.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
That's the road we're having our recess.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
That's the road we're having our recess.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
That's the road we're having our recess.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
That's the road we're having our recess.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Margaret's talking very good.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Come on.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Get back in the front.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Get back in the front.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Come on.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Want to keep going?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Wish me luck with that.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm sorry, remember.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
One of the clerks about this, uh,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Margaret, the Jeff Sounder,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
and there may be another role called on a recess.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Absolutely.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Anybody sure they have a one-dollar tooth?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
One-dollar tooth?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
One-dollar tooth?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
So both then, we'll have to go and go to the back of the van.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
We said for another ten minutes.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Regulations of the chemical.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
We had just concluded.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
One turn around the wheel and ask in question.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Do not be rich back in the councilations.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Do you have any further questions that's this time?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Go for the questions, Mr. Chair.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Chair, may I have one?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We'll come back to send him a call on a little later.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
He hasn't quite returned from the floor yet.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Send the dirt.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Send him on.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Call the afternoon session to order.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
He's going around the table.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Calling from the senators.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
He's now gone to send a good Jackson.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Send a good message.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Mary Driscoll and now send him to board.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm not sure if the chair would consider technically a question.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I think it's something that will make ten minutes.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Bring it up.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I was just over on the floor of the Senate tonight.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I know that my Senator Flanders and Senator Mastic

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
question concerning him.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Senator Flanders this morning.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm going to send him a call我們的.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm going to send him a call.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm going to send him a call.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm going to send him a call.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And so on this afternoon.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
The 20th Army.

02:52.000 --> 03:09.200
On the first floor there was a wieb and鳳 a

03:09.200 --> 03:35.140
Christophe, the

03:35.140 --> 03:44.320
if the Center from Vermont, Mr. Flanders has any information, I think that the

03:44.320 --> 03:50.080
Center's would want to get that. I think that he should be willing to come down

03:50.080 --> 03:55.300
here under open testify and then in a bit of a name calling he refers to

03:55.300 --> 03:59.360
McCarthy as Dennis the Menace.

03:59.360 --> 04:10.360
He says that the assistant has some hold on the senator.

04:10.360 --> 04:17.120
Can't be that our generous the men are so much to the making trouble for his

04:17.120 --> 04:20.640
elders as the last Japanese troubling himself.

04:20.640 --> 04:27.000
Does the committee plan to investigate the real issues that they now Mr.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.960
Chairman this is a statement by the Center from Vermont when they

04:31.960 --> 04:37.640
sure they trust them. I have a very patient for the Center from Vermont.

04:37.640 --> 04:46.160
As he is engaged in his death tribes over the past number of weeks have

04:46.160 --> 04:53.800
felt that he's a nice kindly old gentleman. I wondered whether this has been a

04:53.800 --> 05:03.720
result of some melody or a vicious. In any case we can't let him continue to

05:03.720 --> 05:09.520
inform me so he does have information without calling him.

05:09.520 --> 05:20.240
And I may Mr. Chairman I may say that in the statement on the center floor he

05:20.240 --> 05:24.640
does more than any man I have ever heard.

05:24.640 --> 05:30.800
Do the tribe of employing Rachel and religious figures. It's a vicious

05:30.800 --> 05:38.960
fight. It's a dishonest fight. It brings him a question of

05:38.960 --> 05:45.080
Jewish people, heart of some people, Catholic people. May I say Mr. Chairman

05:45.080 --> 05:54.920
that the three top people in our committee, the chief council, the chief

05:54.920 --> 06:03.000
of staff and myself, one happens to be Jewish, one happens to be Protestant, one

06:03.000 --> 06:10.760
happens to be Catholic. All of us are very active in our particular place.

06:11.280 --> 06:19.120
That has been a fear not even enough for us. In this exposure of coming, then I

06:19.120 --> 06:28.000
think that it dishonest me on words for a son of her to take the talent for and try and

06:28.000 --> 06:35.560
inject religious and racial bigotry into this effort to explore communism.

06:35.560 --> 06:46.600
May I say Mr. Chairman also, quoting the center, he refers to the quote incurable

06:46.600 --> 06:54.920
success of tapping with publicans into a detailed and relentless search for some

06:54.920 --> 06:59.480
significant evidence of subversion of the Republican administration.

06:59.480 --> 07:06.480
Mr. Chairman, I'm sure that the chair of this committee was done such an outstanding job

07:06.480 --> 07:14.400
in the Algerian history. Mr. General standing down in the house on America until he's

07:14.400 --> 07:21.240
committed. We'll agree that when you get to the issue of

07:21.240 --> 07:28.240
reasons, you can't start drawing party lines. I am sure that the very able chief council

07:28.240 --> 07:36.240
who has done such an excellent job of bringing out the evidence cost examining on both sides

07:36.240 --> 07:42.240
will agree that when we get to the question of subversion, there should be no party line.

07:42.240 --> 07:50.240
And I would like now Mr. Chairman to ask the chair to subpoena, just like that. I don't

07:50.240 --> 07:57.240
think we can subpoena the senator. I would like to ask the chair to request that the

07:57.240 --> 08:09.240
senator from Vermont come before this committee and under oath tell us tell us funny

08:09.240 --> 08:16.240
knows about the real heart of this mystery. Have him tell us, for example, what he knows

08:16.240 --> 08:27.240
about menace to menace and what he refers to me being in trouble. I'd like to know what

08:27.240 --> 08:33.240
that trouble is Mr. Chairman. I'd like to get it under oath and Mr. Chairman, the senator

08:33.240 --> 08:40.240
from Vermont has told off some talk about the waving of senatorial immunity. And coming

08:40.240 --> 08:46.240
out in the open giving the fact, I think that he should not be reluctant to do this. May I

08:46.240 --> 08:52.240
say Mr. Chairman's conclusion? Well, normally, it means the practice in the senator's

08:52.240 --> 08:59.240
chair knows to notify a senator if he has to be attacked on the senator's floor. I wasn't

08:59.240 --> 09:06.240
notified, however, I did notify Mr. Flounders, but I was going to discuss this statement and

09:06.240 --> 09:17.240
I invited him to be here. And I suggest that I would ask the chair to give him the opportunity

09:17.240 --> 09:24.240
to make any statements that he had to make. I understand that the senator is not here.

09:25.240 --> 09:31.240
In the chair, the fellow of his customary procedures refraining from commenting about any

09:31.240 --> 09:38.240
of the comments that his colleagues make either honor or off the bill. I'm so

09:38.240 --> 09:45.240
glad to hear that. Mr. Driscoll, you have a kind of Mr. Driscoll.

09:45.240 --> 09:54.240
You, I take it out of the senator's number one technical area, is that right? Yes.

09:54.240 --> 10:01.240
As I take it, you are quite an age of 50. Yes. You handle all of the nails. Yes.

10:02.240 --> 10:08.240
When you say handle, what do you mean? Well, you have anything to do with all of the

10:08.240 --> 10:15.240
things you want in all of the terms. I see it all. Have you taken the patient? Yes.

10:15.240 --> 10:24.240
Both members and others. Yes. I have a somewhere around in the trust committee of some

10:24.240 --> 10:29.240
of the officers who take the patient. I suppose so, Mr. Wells, but I don't know. They must

10:29.240 --> 10:36.240
have the operation of the committee. Do you know the value there? Well, I know the

10:36.240 --> 10:43.240
stress analysis. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

10:43.240 --> 10:56.240
I found it no all of them. I don't know how many there are. All three of you are just

10:56.240 --> 11:04.240
patients. Well, I would take the patient from any member of this faculty last week. Then

11:04.240 --> 11:09.240
they're all in the title of this claim. I don't know whether you would call it entitled enough.

11:09.240 --> 11:16.240
I'd be curious enough to take anything. I'm not sure if it's going to be good.

11:16.240 --> 11:32.240
Oh, Mr. Caron has. I can't tell you who else. I know the way I have. Let's see.

11:34.240 --> 11:45.240
Now, I want to ask you a question or two about the date on these member and you have told

11:45.240 --> 11:50.240
us I think that they risked their stay. Our data is half or about to come when the

11:50.240 --> 11:57.240
dictation was given to you. I think so. Suppose the dictation was given through you to stay on the

11:57.240 --> 12:04.240
here. When you didn't get the time private on until the 11th, would you stay to leave here

12:04.240 --> 12:13.240
until the 11th? I have no set pattern. I have no set pattern. If the date stays

12:13.240 --> 12:19.240
alive, just to take a arbitrary date appears on the member and that will mean that either

12:19.240 --> 12:25.240
it was dictated on how it's on that day, which it could mean could it not? Or it would

12:25.240 --> 12:33.240
mean that it was typed on that day and dictated earlier. So, whatever we see on the

12:33.240 --> 12:40.240
member and with the date on it, it must have been dictated on that date. The case on

12:40.240 --> 12:46.240
it all on a day or two or three days or two. That has to be true.

12:46.240 --> 12:57.240
You have any forms and your office for you to be dictated on the 14th floor?

12:57.240 --> 13:03.240
I'll tell you how you feel you understand. I think that's your answer. No, in my office, we have a

13:03.240 --> 13:10.240
form printed out with $1060 space space memorandum. Do you have anything that says

13:10.240 --> 13:17.240
memorandum on the top of it? I think we have memorandum heads and the office

13:17.240 --> 13:22.240
plays that because it is a chunk that we would type on. Yes, but I also have a form.

13:22.240 --> 13:26.240
Let's look at the size of the 7th memorandum heads that we have here. Of course, I wouldn't

13:26.240 --> 13:32.240
use those. My question is, do you have a letter size memorandum form? We do not.

13:32.240 --> 13:39.240
They all are these memorandum heads all appear to be on claim memorandum, on claim paper.

13:39.240 --> 13:45.240
I think you have told us that you have more than one typewriter in your office. Is that

13:45.240 --> 13:54.240
right? Yes. And beginning back in October of 1953, you were able to use more than one typewriter.

13:55.240 --> 14:07.240
I think you have a different name to do have. I have to again. I'm kind of proud of you.

14:07.240 --> 14:14.240
There are any things that are oiled and there are beams. I don't know what I would have come to

14:14.240 --> 14:20.240
support you. What do you mean little folks are those like? I'm here to use the word

14:21.240 --> 14:27.240
I'm here to start being the electrical system. The oil, the electrical or not? No, it is not.

14:27.240 --> 14:32.240
And the other one you mentioned before. I think we have some running stuff. I don't think

14:32.240 --> 14:38.240
then I don't have one. Have you or just? Yes, I have one. What is that one? The one that

14:38.240 --> 14:42.240
is now is 9 to 10. That's in the left of the typewriter. That's not. Now we just look at

14:42.240 --> 14:47.240
just how these are these memorandums. If you have those thoughts, you know, taking

14:47.240 --> 14:53.240
them along about 12 or 12th of 1953. So I just do them real on what machines are inside.

14:53.240 --> 15:00.240
I can tell you. I don't know. You don't know? No, I don't recognize. I can have some

15:00.240 --> 15:05.240
of some of certain things. What do you want to do with making a castwriter? I think I do

15:05.240 --> 15:11.240
so much. I think I like that. Now if you occasionally get up and be your desk and go to

15:11.240 --> 15:16.240
some others desk to type that a letter. Yes. So I want to do it there because I

15:16.240 --> 15:22.240
have the emissary. I have the emissary. I have the emissary. What's that there? I don't

15:22.240 --> 15:28.240
recall. I don't know. Yes. Can't you look at that? The second area is now. I'm

15:28.240 --> 15:32.240
already talking to you about their typewriter. Don't you know when you got the one you got

15:32.240 --> 15:36.240
now? No. You don't know how long you've had. No. You can't tell I told you that. It's

15:36.240 --> 15:42.240
a month or two. What about a little man? No. And you don't know all this is just no

15:42.240 --> 15:49.240
time to be able to use anything in our 30s or 30s. No, it's about five months. No.

15:49.240 --> 15:55.240
I don't know. No. I type right on the typewriter. I don't say any thanks to the time you

15:55.240 --> 15:59.240
typewriter. For your typewriter, I'm the first to write something. You're always taking

15:59.240 --> 16:06.240
about that all you want to do with it. You don't know anything. And you can do it.

16:06.240 --> 16:11.240
Any idea what this is? It's a little bit late. I'll do the typewriter. So, do you

16:11.240 --> 16:16.240
as long as I remember an amount of coverage back in 1953? I cannot have to return.

16:16.240 --> 16:25.240
Do I? And can you do anything for a permanent number? No. Can you do anything for a permanent

16:25.240 --> 16:35.240
number? I'll remember. No. I can't. All right. Yes. Start out. Party 30s.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.240
Party 30s.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.240
You can't yell it. I cannot tell you what makes a typewriter with 2D.

16:45.240 --> 16:49.240
You know, both. You can't go around all 8th and December 90s. You know what?

16:49.240 --> 16:52.240
I'm not going to change your type. No, I can't. It's throughout.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.240
For the one of December 17th.

16:54.240 --> 17:02.240
Is that correct? This is for them. I have heard about everything now.

17:03.240 --> 17:08.240
The first thing you're looking ready about, what kind of a typewriter should use?

17:08.240 --> 17:17.240
The Eurodog. It must be about the pace of something or other. I'll be at least a chance.

17:17.240 --> 17:22.240
You know, it's just passing all day long and much more than night. What particular typewriter

17:22.240 --> 17:24.240
should use for Eurodog?

17:24.240 --> 17:29.240
So, a lot of that person is going to be looking at it. That information he's been asking him.

17:29.240 --> 17:33.240
Correctly 30s. The Eurodog is a question you're talking about.

17:33.240 --> 17:38.240
But, sure, there's plenty of work that you can do to that. I'm just going to give you a call.

17:38.240 --> 17:43.240
What is the number and the number you'll be calling? You know that, don't you?

17:43.240 --> 17:46.240
I would give you a few. Okay.

17:47.240 --> 17:53.240
Now, through what they had we, one of the physicists, giving you a key to recall

17:53.240 --> 17:58.240
or identify the typewriter you would use. Before the 21st, we meet that thing.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.240
You're asking if you'd like to see if the real time of trade I can tell you that.

18:02.240 --> 18:07.240
So, I think I asked you about the 21st, when you have a cemetery in your office,

18:07.240 --> 18:09.240
and you can't identify the typewriter.

18:09.240 --> 18:14.240
I can't say that I cannot identify the typewriter on which any of these people ran.

18:14.240 --> 18:19.240
Well, when you know a truth, when you look at a wooden car like an expert wheel,

18:19.240 --> 18:23.240
until how many typewriter should use?

18:23.240 --> 18:25.240
No, I don't think I can tell you that.

18:25.240 --> 18:30.240
Do you feel the anxiety while you've popped around from one typewriter to another in your office?

18:33.240 --> 18:36.240
No, I don't think you're unnecessarily bobbed around.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.240
I think maybe at times there was one kind of typewriter on my desk,

18:40.240 --> 18:43.240
and for one reason I know that it was changed and there was another one on there.

18:43.240 --> 18:47.240
Yeah. I don't know.

18:47.240 --> 18:52.240
What could have been, I'm not sure if it was all on the desk,

18:52.240 --> 18:59.240
but how long would you have the typewriter at the door of the door that you might use?

18:59.240 --> 19:03.240
I don't know.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.240
I just don't know.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.240
I just don't know.

19:09.240 --> 19:15.240
You know, the best thing is that you're trying to see me as a guy.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.240
Well, I just had the typewriter.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.240
I just now.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.240
How many consecutive days have you turned my desk?

19:23.240 --> 19:25.240
Do you know what you need?

19:25.240 --> 19:28.240
I need just for any simple product.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.240
You need to power, you need to have the typewriter that you've got at your desk.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.240
No, I don't know.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.240
You don't know.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.240
When you've had it, don't you think you're leaking out with just?

19:38.240 --> 19:40.240
Oh, I did.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.240
I don't know.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.240
You don't know that?

19:44.240 --> 19:45.240
No, it's rough.

19:45.240 --> 19:49.240
I'm not saying I can't do typewriter, but I can't ask for those questions.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.240
You can't go there.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.240
You want to go there, but you can't go there.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.240
Tell her.

19:56.240 --> 20:00.240
Whether or not I have to love the machine to you every day,

20:00.240 --> 20:05.240
you could credit it as a whole or less.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.240
Oh, you can't.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
I'm not telling you.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.240
You're not asking about the age.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
You're going to change.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.240
I'm talking about the age.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.240
You get a new work, I can tell you.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.240
No, I don't know.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.240
What's the time and the time?

20:18.240 --> 20:19.240
I'm Mr. Lincoln.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.240
No further questions, Mr. Chairman.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.240
No, no.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.240
Send them a call.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.240
Non-adaction?

20:26.240 --> 20:28.240
No, no.

20:28.240 --> 20:34.240
Mr. Diff, there's so many officers out there in the street that you occupy on the floor of the bus.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.240
Four.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.240
So, have you worked on our work again?

20:38.240 --> 20:39.240
Yes, I do.

20:39.240 --> 20:43.240
You'll probably be there, or should I choose that, so you can call the question, or are you there?

20:43.240 --> 20:45.240
How does that matter to the car?

20:45.240 --> 20:46.240
Please.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.240
Every day.

20:47.240 --> 20:50.240
I was telling you that I get going to the car all over the place.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.240
That's fine.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.240
I was in your air when this is called on the front page.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.240
Yes.

20:55.240 --> 21:01.240
Obviously, you've been using all this pretty casualy talking lens where I was in the city.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.240
Well, I don't think I saw any sense of it.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.240
Well, I'm thinking of your car all over the place.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.240
So, I think it's just that.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.240
Yes, I'll accept it.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.240
You're all right.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.240
You can just look at it that way.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.240
Oh, but the car is just tied up.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.240
You can work in one of the first and fifth homes in the city.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.240
Yes, I do.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.240
You work in the car all over the place.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.240
You can also see what we're looking for.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.240
The General is speaking.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.240
I work in the third office from the front.

21:27.240 --> 21:31.240
And if I want to type something that is marked by a confidential, and I don't...

21:31.240 --> 21:34.240
And there are a lot of people around my desk that they're frequently asked.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.240
I would go to another desk and type it.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.240
I invite evening when everyone else is gone.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.240
And there's no one there.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.240
So, in our street, when we go to the front office to work,

21:44.240 --> 21:49.240
first to hear the door when it comes open, people come in, and also to hear the phone.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.240
The phone only rings in that ring.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.240
That's just very awesome.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.240
Well, number three.

21:53.240 --> 21:58.240
I think each one of the workers often in the basement is going to be all the type of stuff that's going to happen.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.240
That's right.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.240
That's all of those types of things that are very important.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.240
Everyone except season type of systems.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.240
And we have a lot of them on the campus.

22:07.240 --> 22:11.240
And we have to drop them in one office with another one desk.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.240
And use whatever type of everything.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.240
You have to do everything.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.240
The type of everything is going to be in the wheelchair.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.240
So, you do the life of the guy who acts like that, don't you?

22:23.240 --> 22:25.240
Very good.

22:25.240 --> 22:28.240
This one question now has been brought up.

22:28.240 --> 22:36.240
In your office, do the secretary move from next to death for the days, have their own demographic death?

22:36.240 --> 22:38.240
Each arrow has a death.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.240
Well, that's what I didn't plan to say.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.240
Each girl has her own death.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.240
That's right.

22:44.240 --> 22:48.240
But do you use various deaths?

22:48.240 --> 22:53.240
I just hope that the director on occasion is I want to type something at my desk,

22:53.240 --> 22:55.240
and there are people around it.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.240
I don't want to do the type things for a standing over me.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.240
It may be at lunchtime when some of the other deaths are vacant.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.240
I'll use that there.

23:02.240 --> 23:05.240
If I want to, there'll be an indication.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.240
She may be at six.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.240
Now, use that death.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.240
Who uses your death?

23:11.240 --> 23:12.240
No one.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.240
I don't use anything.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.240
No one ever sits at my desk.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.240
But if I've left my desk there to reason five,

23:20.240 --> 23:23.240
and I just sit down on my desk to use the phone,

23:23.240 --> 23:24.240
I may be sitting there.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.240
He wants to use the type I have.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.240
Like, it's just that he's not out of his place.

23:28.240 --> 23:34.240
Generally speaking, you use your death for what 90% of your work is,

23:34.240 --> 23:38.240
it's only on rare occasions that you'd be using some other death.

23:38.240 --> 23:43.240
Well, not a question of while, when something I don't want to type it about people,

23:43.240 --> 23:45.240
and you're just not bad, I'll move.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.240
And then the afternoon, when I move when you're very late,

23:48.240 --> 23:51.240
I always bet when everyone else is gone,

23:51.240 --> 23:54.240
it's not only you should be able to turn off the door,

23:54.240 --> 23:56.240
but on hour, have a long, I'm going to be there,

23:56.240 --> 24:00.240
so that I can use the phone so that it can't be in hour, no.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.240
And does the other type there do the same?

24:02.240 --> 24:04.240
The other type there do the same.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.240
The other type there do the same.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.240
The other type there do the same.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.240
The other type there do the same.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.240
The other type there do the same.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.240
And they don't have any expectations.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.240
That's all.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.240
We have a minute and a minute.

24:18.240 --> 24:21.240
A minute and a minute.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.240
Next to the minute and a minute.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.240
We have the office.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.240
We don't have jest.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.240
We have the chief.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.240
Well, ladies and gentlemen, the office is far as deflected.

24:33.240 --> 24:38.240
How many people will be in the office?

24:38.240 --> 24:41.240
Which is what?

24:41.240 --> 24:43.240
11.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.240
11.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.240
11.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.240
11.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.240
12.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.240
I reach you in.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.240
Let's all.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.240
From the family room.

24:57.240 --> 25:01.240
This is a guy I just went.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.240
I've been there to you.

25:03.240 --> 25:07.240
The whole way you have there is a regional tenant.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.240
There's two.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.240
I'm not sure that there's one of those two.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.240
It's five.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.240
You were dead.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.240
That's the same question.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.240
Oh, thank you.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.240
I can't tell.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.240
I just don't recognize.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.240
Every day, it's a dark rudder.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.240
You don't know which is one.

25:27.240 --> 25:31.240
The fine grind is the one that makes the lot of this high.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.240
I can't take this.

25:33.240 --> 25:37.240
If you were written on a rattle or a ram, come on.

25:37.240 --> 25:41.240
The fine grinder you have is the one that makes the lot of letters.

25:41.240 --> 25:45.240
Fire dents for the one that makes the small letters.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.240
There's generally speaking how low the fine grinders make the small.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.240
Would they have been down from each other in there?

25:51.240 --> 25:53.240
Yes, they are.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.240
The longest size.

25:55.240 --> 25:57.240
In those that you have there.

25:57.240 --> 26:01.240
I was wondering whether that was the type of rider by your death.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.240
The one that made the small letters.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.240
I was sitting beside my death.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.240
That's not.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.240
No, 45.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.240
Is there any advice?

26:11.240 --> 26:13.240
I have a question.

26:13.240 --> 26:21.240
I think the view of life is going into this question.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.240
I have a question.

26:23.240 --> 26:27.240
How many times have you been around the office?

26:27.240 --> 26:29.240
Four.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.240
Four.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.240
Ten girls.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.240
Each girl has the type of rider.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.240
I think there's one or two.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.240
That's the one that makes the small letters.

26:39.240 --> 26:41.240
Ten.

26:41.240 --> 26:45.240
The typewriter and the company being service-telling.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.240
Yes, they are.

26:47.240 --> 26:51.240
And so it's thousands of brain normally.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.240
And almost half of it has went to take it out.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.240
And you have her for the podium.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.240
Yes.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.240
And on your go.

26:59.240 --> 27:03.240
When a typewriter is sending service to a new typewriter.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.240
Take out your own.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.240
And that goes to the milk and drop it.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.240
Oh, no.

27:09.240 --> 27:13.240
It's usually, unless you want a really typewriter,

27:13.240 --> 27:15.240
it doesn't change it.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.240
But you're not supposed to send it to someone else's box.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.240
If you just send it down to the computer.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.240
If you just send it down to the computer,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.240
it's clear that I claim.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.240
Unless you ask for a different typewriter.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.240
I knew when they would bring that one back.

27:27.240 --> 27:31.240
I don't know if it's important to this.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.240
The typewriter investigation plan is curious enough.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.240
I know what the fifth and fifth news is.

27:35.240 --> 27:39.240
It's got about 10 or 11 typewriters in your office.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.240
And the one typewriter is taking out

27:41.240 --> 27:43.240
another typewriter's plan, right?

27:43.240 --> 27:45.240
Yes.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.240
But over a ton of her junk, you know,

27:47.240 --> 27:49.240
they have the typewriter one day.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.240
And unless they're taking down to be service.

27:51.240 --> 27:55.240
You get a different typewriter.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.240
When his typewriter has some clean,

27:57.240 --> 27:59.240
that's making it back to all of them.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.240
So is that from my room, or what?

28:01.240 --> 28:05.240
No, I think that you can have a typewriter

28:05.240 --> 28:07.240
that needs cleaning and blunt,

28:07.240 --> 28:09.240
near it to sign to you.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.240
And it goes down to be cleaned.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.240
When they finish, where does it bring it back?

28:13.240 --> 28:15.240
But if you don't like it, or if something really wrong with it,

28:15.240 --> 28:17.240
you can turn that one in and get no one.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.240
Perfect.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.240
When they're prepared to one, turn it in and give that to some other

28:21.240 --> 28:23.240
typewriter.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.240
Perfect.

28:25.240 --> 28:27.240
He turned it upside.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.240
Right.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.240
So, this is the first number and the updated December 9

28:31.240 --> 28:33.240
that you've probably charted for.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.240
Are you looking at it?

28:39.240 --> 28:41.240
Yes, I am.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.240
Hold it, you determine the size.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.240
Do you have a number and the one is the best file or you now have it?

28:45.240 --> 28:47.240
The test is the same subject matter.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.240
The test is the seven letters.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.240
These are the two.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.240
Both things and the same things and the atoms.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.240
I'm sorry.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.240
Same thing, the same things and the atoms.

28:57.240 --> 29:03.240
Well, this, this thing when we talked about atoms, does it not?

29:03.240 --> 29:05.240
So, that.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.240
If you have a file on atoms or not.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.240
No.

29:09.240 --> 29:13.240
Then you, if anybody has you to put stuff,

29:13.240 --> 29:15.240
room random, can you file?

29:15.240 --> 29:17.240
No.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.240
You just thought of a few things.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.240
Can't do it all.

29:21.240 --> 29:23.240
Yes.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.240
No, you have to stay next to it, too, you will.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.240
What?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.240
You learned a math, always a math, and you have second memorandums,

29:31.240 --> 29:35.240
that December 9, 1953.

29:35.240 --> 29:41.240
If you rely on, as you decided, that memo went into this file.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.240
I'm sorry, I can hear you.

29:43.240 --> 29:49.240
Looking outside of the game, looking at the number of the second memorandum,

29:49.240 --> 29:52.240
date of December 9, 1953.

29:52.240 --> 29:57.240
What word or words you tell me for you, the left image of that memorandum?

29:57.240 --> 29:59.240
It's subject matter of it.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.240
It's subject matter.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.240
Flammary 83?

30:03.240 --> 30:05.240
No, what's the subject matter?

30:05.240 --> 30:07.240
It's an error from Frank Carter, from the coffee.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.240
Ralfick, two coffee head with John, and Ralfick, who are you talking about?

30:11.240 --> 30:13.240
Well, he's a rocker.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.240
I talk, he has a tongue, and...

30:15.240 --> 30:17.240
Is that the subject matter?

30:17.240 --> 30:19.240
It's off the job, and it's...

30:19.240 --> 30:21.240
Flammary 83?

30:21.240 --> 30:23.240
That didn't make you to put it in this file, would it?

30:23.240 --> 30:25.240
But it made me to put it in this file, and so on.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.240
I know, it didn't make you to put it in this file.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.240
No, why?

30:29.240 --> 30:35.240
So, that's those words, John Adam, some way that you to put the left memorandum in this file.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.240
No, I'm afraid you don't understand me, Mr. Well.

30:37.240 --> 30:40.240
I've had the entire memorandum, and determined from the text of it,

30:40.240 --> 30:44.240
to go in this folder, in my opinion, and I was to run during the filing.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.240
Well, now the first paragraph, you've heard the word,

30:47.240 --> 30:49.240
SHINE in the subject.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.240
You see that in the second line?

30:51.240 --> 30:53.240
I was the first paragraph.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.240
Yes.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.240
No, the first paragraph.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.240
I'm dealing with a student's topic, myself.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.240
Well, that paragraph has the word SHINE in the subject.

31:01.240 --> 31:02.240
Four times.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.240
Yes?

31:03.240 --> 31:05.240
That paragraph has the word SHINE in it.

31:05.240 --> 31:09.240
One, two, three, four, five,

31:09.240 --> 31:10.240
four times.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.240
Because it's not.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.240
Well, I'm Adam Cahn.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.240
I just got to give you seven times.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.240
Well, I'll count one for you.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.240
Okay.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.240
Okay.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.240
Okay.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
Okay.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
Okay.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.240
Okay.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.240
Okay.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.240
Okay.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.240
Okay.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.240
Okay.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.240
Okay.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.240
Okay.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
Okay.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.240
Okay.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.240
Okay.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.240
Okay.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.240
Okay.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.240
Okay.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.240
Okay.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.240
Okay.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.240
Okay.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.240
Okay.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.240
Okay.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.240
Okay.

31:44.240 --> 31:45.240
Okay.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.240
Okay.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.240
Okay.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.240
Okay.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.240
Okay.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.240
Okay.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.240
Okay.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.240
Okay.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.400
Now something is touching on that there's a bit being

31:55.400 --> 31:57.400
a response with thisvalid sign here.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.400
Yeah.

31:58.400 --> 32:02.220
I imagine when it comes to another paragraph,

32:02.220 --> 32:05.180
I'm going to go ahead and get the

32:05.180 --> 32:06.180
response.

32:06.180 --> 32:07.180
Okay.

32:07.180 --> 32:08.180
Okay.

32:08.180 --> 32:09.180
Okay.

32:09.180 --> 32:10.180
Okay.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.180
Okay.
