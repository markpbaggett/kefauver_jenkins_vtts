WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Well, but almost, what does this human limb look like under that?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
For shine, does this not?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Half-by-light, right?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Well, do you know the first 200 of the demons?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
No, I did not.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Did you have a final one, Charlie?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
That's that.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Did you know anything?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Yes.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
When you look at the one of Babypixembrech's seven feet,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
you tell them what the...

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
...determination of what?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Remember, and as you put it on the spot.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Anything.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
What's the same thing?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
But I've not asked.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Does it matter?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
And does it tell me the same thing?

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
And we expect to the ones of December 21, 1953?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
It's a subject matter.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
It's a subject matter of every one of those cars that have a gen shine.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Is the subject matter of these cars that have a gen shine?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
That's not the subject matter.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
That's not the way I determine where it's valid.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
It's the subject matter of the entire membrane.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
And the next membrane, too, is the file for the famous human.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Are you expecting the 27th, 26th?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.600
I think your partner was the friend of December 21,

01:28.600 --> 01:29.600
left.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.000
That had five powers left, and it's going to miss the shine.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
And your wife is talking about an ass clock.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
December 21, I left the ass clock.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
That's the one that has five powers left, and it's going to shine.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
But the subject matter of every one of those cars that have a gen shine.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
That's not the way I'm going to say it.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
That's it.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Is it January 9?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
The thing's going to fly.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Is that right?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yes.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
And January 14th.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
We're in up here.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
We'll move to the...

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Anyone listening to your questions with a phone, that...

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
That could not have been the same subject matter.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I know the few people that left the man on earth,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
who tried to deceive anyone.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Don't share that.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
I wonder if he would not make it clearer that all of the membrane

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
that has to do with the...

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
The strength of the pressure to call, please, and the segregation.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
But I think this should do that for the record.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
That is, I think, as far as the committee is concerned.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
May I direct your attention to the one day of January 15th, 1954?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
That's very short, isn't it, Mr. Dishon?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
And I think this is maybe one of these very huge 60s young atoms

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
in a friendly way.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I've tried to give Lady Roy pretty much lately

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
on my hostage situation.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
They get pretty heated before a royal bias aligns

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
but it's going to lead to trouble.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
With the specific matter of grab, I just feel...

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I've been here.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
It might be due in Smith's arm on this list,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
even the sentence that came to that nightside and sit in this hole.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
And you can tell by looking at it that it belongs

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
on this special file of yours.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I read it in black.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yes.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Now when you're looking to one day this month,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
11th, 1954,

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
is that indicated to you on that day?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I think it was.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Right.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
But it turns right by you on that day.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Not on the run.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
It was tight by me up there, not on that company.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, one of the other works is not as easy.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
It was either dictated or found by not later than March 11th.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Yes, it was tight, not later than March 11th.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
That's right.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Well, no, I can't tell you that now.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
It may just be some of these times of day

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
on which they were dictated even though they never been tight

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
until it was fixed day.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
But my roommate has a date on which they were active tight.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I can't tell you that.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yes.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I think we understand each other.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
When you see the date here, we do.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
When you see the date March 11th, that means

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
that it was either dictated or not made

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
or charged or charged or not made.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Is that correct?

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
dictated on that day are charged and charged to that day.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
That's right.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That's right.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
That's what it is.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
It was tight on March 11th, whether dictated or not.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
No, that's not necessarily true.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
You need new might as well.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I might have dated it today, it was dictated.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I can't tell you now.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I see even though you can't tell it's the next day.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I may have twisted the date one, but it'll be ready

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
when we buy a phone, one or two at three days in any event.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I think so.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Now, because I read one sentence of that,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
remember I had to tell you about the middle of the sentence.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Do you see a sentence beginning about in the middle of a sentence

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
of the incarcerated advisory district?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Do you see that?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yes.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Now, we ask you, do you see the incarcerated advisory district?

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The writer was searching for files for a memory

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
and a dictated concerning time.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Were you titled, when you are dictated that to you?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
For that time?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Yes.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
No.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Well, did you think during the Chicago look,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
no further, I've got them all,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
and look at the little package here you ever saw.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Ah, that's it, isn't it?

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, did you tell them it's just what's going on?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Just a laugh.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Could you tell them it?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Of course, that didn't.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Well, it's just what's going on.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
When you had them all together, wasn't it?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, 13.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
So you were having them all together, didn't you?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm not going to tell me because it's very, very silly.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I don't know.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
I've got them all together.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Maybe I'm over the line.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
This is just what it all is.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
But you were having them all together, didn't you?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Maybe I over the line.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
But you had what you got here together, didn't you, not?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
That's the time of this memory and the dictated here.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, I can tell you that.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
I don't know.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Well, I don't know what time of date this memory

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
and the dictated.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
So, moving quickly, hold us.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
You put them here every time they came along.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
While you had it all in this nice packing,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
there's only one over it all.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
On my bed, you'll be in peace.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
We helped them.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
We just found them.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Where are they?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Yeah.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
I don't mind, just a rough tackling this script,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
but it's up to a certain point.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Two of us, we showed off, you know,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
that even though it's electric,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
my hand name was Bile.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
But he may decide to search further

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
for additional information.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And I haven't.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
It's just that from objecting,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
when the heckling has been of my man on the sand,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
nothing we've been a young lady here.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
She should be given the usual courtesy,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
and most of us, I'm sure, well,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
knows there's nothing unusual.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I'm Mr. Carr, and today I will search further

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
for additional information.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I've said that this,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
the only way to a thousand times myself

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
has been asking for power.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Mr. Carr, I have nothing to offer.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I have nothing but admiration from Mr. Riftville.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I cannot concede from the stoneter

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
of that I have the deepest suspicion

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
about the genuine of these memorandums.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And how do you deny my questioner?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
May I hold your distance, Mr. Riftville?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Did you ever find a single memorandum

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
to hide the red file?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
After Mr. Carr gets here, that too.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Now that question is well,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
if you're confused with me.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Well, I do not know, just on the day

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
this memorandum was dictated.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I can't tell you, brother,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
at the moment it was dictated,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
I have all these changes together.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
To tell you, dictated,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
this is the minute every morning.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Maybe I didn't get this together

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
until afternoon.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
You asked me if I had them,

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
all the jays and all of them

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
it's the time.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
This is dictated.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I can't tell you that,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
but, I can't remember.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You can't have this alone for a long time.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
But I could not just have like,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
there are no places like here.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
So, let me go.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm going to send this to my left.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yes, that's both.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I'm going to send it to you.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Mr. Cameraman, I'd like to present this place to you.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
For some time we have known,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
been around at one person dictated,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
the memorandum.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
And there's been great interest in the memorandum.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I would like to ask the chairman,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
if an executive session or any other time,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
there's been any investigation of the memorandum

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
to stand for a time,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
the memorandum up,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
but the flight flight is in the office.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Perhaps Mr. Jenkins could answer that,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
rather than you could.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So, I think it's the question the Ruby has.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
So, we might go up to her right up now.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Maybe a question you have to adjust to the council,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
because the chair has never seen these memorandums.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Absolutely, in the present time.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
The idea here is in the first time in the given.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
501 is 50 years,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
well, specifically, I am at,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
and based on the knowledge,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
it's important for this memorandum.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
In the fact that I had been told before,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I've been dictated only for the big takers

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
that have taken only by one person.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
That's been confirmed by this track of lady now on the sand.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Now, I might go ahead and ask if it's been any effort

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
on the board of the council to check the memorandum,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
the originals against any of the thankfuliders in the office,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
but I know, obviously, that I just want to make the record clear.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
So, there are findings in the form of these good old friends,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
from 50 weeks ago, Mr. Thompson,

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
and I have these of my staff on here with Mr. Robert Coyer

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
of my staff,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
right through the office question that this goes,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I think, with that time,

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
as I remember that Mr. fiscal took all of the dictations.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
She was told at that time by Mr. Sue that they were tied

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
to on the different machines,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
and that they were tied at the time they would be stated

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
our shirt as air here within a day or two there.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
In addition to that, Mr. Thomas Coyer went to the residence.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
I remember Senator McCarthy's staff, Mr. Levinion,

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
and Mr. Levinion, Mr. Levinion about these memorandums.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm Mr. Levinion,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Vice-Payton's Commissioner of Coyer,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
fixing the Bay outter for aberrating the unmediated,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
such a bad idea today.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
I do not think it's proper Senator Simon,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
and for me to tell you what the conclusions were reached,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I come through a reference to these memorandums,

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
but I have discussed these memorandums with Mr. Welch

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
of the Army on more than one occasion.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I have not shown the original memorandum to him

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
because it was a valid result.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
The conditions that the restos memorandums were delivered to me,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
there has been no document experts

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
with saying the exempted memorandums are to compare

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
with the machines upon which they have been prepared.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Senator McClellan, have I answered your questions for you or not?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I think it's just...

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm Senator McClellan, I have a question.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
I just want to ask this question.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I have to make a statement.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
I do not know anything to respect the Mr. Levinius

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
of transmission in the matter nor at this time for me to I care.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
But in spite of the wisdom here,

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
this Christ certain that she has...

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
has taken the dictation on all these memorandums,

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
but she has very uncertain with respect

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
against what type of writers were used.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I say that in no criticism.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I was wondering if the council checked the memorandum again

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
to type the writers in the standards office.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
And I said that if it was done, that's what I would like to know.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
And if it wasn't done, that is also what I was trying to do.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
That's not true, I think it is.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I think it is Council for answering the questions very well.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
On the pilot, it's just a little bit.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Wait, I...

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Uh...

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I'm sorry.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I'm too low.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I am too low.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm too low.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Mary, just to clarify one thing here.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I believe you told the committee today,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
and I think it's amazing it told us the title,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
that when these memorandum were shown to the cut,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
at that time, and I think...

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I was in that period of two or three days,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
and I think one was sent all the time

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
that there's Satan of the Defense Department,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
that you and other girls in the office

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
reach high.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Uh, copies, and make numerous sets of copies.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Is that right?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And I think you saw them that,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
when you reassembled this file, you could not say,

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
under your oath, that each copy in here

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
was the original made back at the time that it was picked up.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Is that right?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
That's not that.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
In other words, some of the first copies here

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
might be the first copy on retypes,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
which you or the other girls in the office made,

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
from the original memorandum on March 11th and 12th,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
and during those two hectic days.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I'm not sure the question.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Who else?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Who else again?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
You think that the memorandum that you have

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
before you weren't even written by you?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I applied that on me.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I can't tell you that they were the ones

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
tight in the original instance.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Any of them?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I can't tell you five to me now.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I can't tell you five to me now.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Well, I thought, Mr. Fitz over on me too long,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
but I thought that you,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
who you think is the first memorandum you open to file

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
and put the memorandum in the set, right?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Please turn the head.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Please.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Right.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And similarly, when the second memorandum

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
got tight, it was easy.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
That's right.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And that will be true with two all of them.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Actually, all of them within the area

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
were the same and they were tight.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
That's right.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And you, all of them,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
they exhibit this or the time to end

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
in the calling exhibitum to file

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
to the file, as you know.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Okay.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And the file will remain in this file.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
So, these, they, the memorandum,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
were removed from the file and copied

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
first and have the picture track copied.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
You need to tell all of the rest of them

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
with the written out of the copies

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
for all of them in the first and the first release.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
So we tighten in the office?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
And we have the problem with the document.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
The picture roll of the pictures was not

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
made as I believe in the past year.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
If we didn't have enough copies

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
for all of the parts we had,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
oh, I forget I think pictures,

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
seven copies were up in the blank.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
For the first, I have to be fast

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
to get copies in the memorandum's

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
minifrush, I'll make it not get

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
to the memorandum you've had,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
a bit of time.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I'll leave pictures, seven copies.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Okay.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Okay.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
We'll have to be careful.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Okay.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Okay.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Well, let's get that,

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
get going.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Go on your attention.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah, think that there was one of

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
these documents that I've picked on.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
If I can fix your signs,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
it'll make you feel great.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I have been informed that there was

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
an embankment chart.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
A copy.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
You know just how many copies were made?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
If you know people that they were handed

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
to the child in any form.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I don't know.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
If any copies were made,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
a lot for a major they're not.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
What do you mean by a lot?

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
All of these are made to one shot at least.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Well, you can't make those pictures

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
that are reasonable.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
If you were sure they are all of these

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
but they are reasonable,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
what would you do?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Yeah.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
How many can you make on an electric

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
machine that are reasonable on the screen paper?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Sixty seven.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
At least that.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I think it's a lot of stuff.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I believe the witness has picked up seven.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
You didn't want to misplace the sexual identity.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
It's not easy for me to hear you with it.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I said six or seven.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Eight, eight minimum minimums.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I would say,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
was the original file exhibited as a press?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I was not even there,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Mr. Rouse, I don't know.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Was the original file when you assembled?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
It was me,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
this file was reassembled.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
After the press was left and all that equipment

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
had been moved out and the whole thing was over.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
What was given to the press?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I don't know.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
I wasn't in the front.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
The doctor came to Compton to see me out.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
What was prepared to the press?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Compton's been beaten around all the way to the paper.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
So I don't know.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
This time,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
maybe the carbon-zons didn't take them.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Maybe they were all made on thin paper.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I don't know.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
No, the ground can do attention once more.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It's a car's memorandum.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
The martial labum fits into the lab.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Come on.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Did you see him searching the file for these memorandums?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Do I seem it's the time during that?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Yes.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
No, I did not.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
You know where they're at?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
No, I did not.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Maybe if sometimes the sub-adjustes

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
might be the style of yours.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I got the file from Mr. Cough.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh, not Mr. Cough,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
but you got it for the senator.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
I got it.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Yeah, I didn't.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Can I get another question from the emergency smile?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I want another question.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Where?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Looks like I like to know the hell it ran away.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I'll figure it out and replace it.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
When did you get the file?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
This is the file.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
This is the file.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
I like to know the thread.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I've taken it and asked it again.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Mr. Cough, when did you on that day

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
get the file that you had in the courtroom today?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
So I don't know.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I don't know the hour.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Okay.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
No, no, no.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
It's all at the Wednesday morning or after noon.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
So Mr. Cough,

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
where did you tell Mr. Cough that you had this file that you were produced here?

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
I think I even told Mr. Cough that I think Mr. Cough is the type of the answer you get to file.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
And it's probably 3 pm.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I don't recall as detail altogether.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Oh, it was the same from the file office again.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Right.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Now, can't you tell us,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
this is just the last time of the day,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
it was that you handed that to us.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
No, I can't.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Can you tell us what time of day the girls had you played

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
or the file apart and make copies?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't think that's the case.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
You can tell us the names of the girls who made the copies.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
No, I can tell you the names of the girls.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
That's what it'll tell us the ones who made the copies.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Oh, I can't do that.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Mr. Cough, I don't know.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
You don't know that.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Did you make any of them?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
I think our fathers did that once in a while.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Okay, I can't tell you guys.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
No, I can't.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
No, I can't.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Any girl who made any of those copies, they're sure.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
No, I can't.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
This is the one.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
What?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Power off the front of the triangle,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
five, six, seven thousand letters a day.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
We can't ask this young lady to remember.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
Who wrote a particular letter who copied a particular memorandum?

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
A month ago, Mr. Welk knows that.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
This is an obvious attempt to try and brow these 15 letters.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
The triangle.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
The woman with the funny.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
This is an obvious attempt to try to brow these 15 letters.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
And they're giving an answer, which you know if you can't hear,

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
she can't possibly know who's typed any particular letter,

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
any particular document she's busy from early morning until late at night,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
knowing a tremendous job.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And one letter,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
you know this,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
even in your office, you can't.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
One letter and all, which is a proof letter for particular letters.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to say in my office,

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm sure you're liking it again because the dictation marks the right on us,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
as they should be unanywhere to write off us.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Don't you put dictation marks on the letter you write for the television?

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm the letter you need to need to put it out of your way,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
but I know I remember it.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I was determined that I'd throw another letter.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
The last thing I was waiting to do was to resolve these papers with Mr. Welk.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
I do not wish to come to you from any one of your rooms

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
that I have greatest suspicions about the office,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
because of the European memorandum.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
And I think I must now have to be thankful to the committee

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
that people will be getting out of the hang of them,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
and to do an export and a gamble in the next quarter,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
because they're in place, and they're offering a lot of justice.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I'd like to do that, Mr. Chairman.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
I do that, Mr. Welk, with Warren.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
If you get evidence to see his memorandum and all the public,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
the committee should have it.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
The D.F. not be sure to miss that by...

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
How are we, unpropern,

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
when the makes mistakes are about having any evidence to back it up,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
and he knows the stuff proves.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
I think he should be torn, they don't ask for anything else.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
If any of these are in there, they're not opening.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Mr. Chairman, the land that's been Mr. Welk,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
he has now a fiscal challenge for the committee.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
To retain the service of his obivocuments experts,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
and to turn these memorandum over to that document,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I'm sorry, examination,

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
and he reports that the result of his examination is that correct, Mr. Welk.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
I was a little in the tent, it could have that hurt.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
The land is then, if you have now reflected me as a council for the committee,

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
to retain the service of his obivocuments experts,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
and to turn these memorandum over to a document expert,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm sorry, examination,

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
and I'm sorry, a report has to their authenticity, is that correct?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I make that the written suggestion,

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
I say to my current name, Mr. Cohn,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
the exact thing is council, apparently, part of me is just Cohn.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
I'm Mr. Cohn, do I understand you just say that you have no objection to that,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
whatever?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I sure I tell, but I would say this.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I think that Senator McCarthy is absolutely correct.

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
I've been in a court room not for too many years, long enough to recognize things like this,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
and I think it's Mr. Welk's high-level evidence

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
that committee should have it under oath justice,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I've been made to come forward, and everyone else has.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm in any issue like this, and take the oath,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
and be subjected to examination and court examination.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
Otherwise, Mr. Welk's lead us, make a loud charge there with no patience for it,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
and leave an erroneous impression with the public.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
When the issue about the picture came up, I was put right on the stand,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
and saved my testimony under oath I was led to.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
Another thing like that, and I'm sure that Mr. Welk's would be willing to do exactly the same thing here.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
The evidence is wrong, let's speak the record straight.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Let me check it.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
The record is taken to the chairman, man.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
The executive has to go.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
The Zionist and Mr. Welk's best statement is that he has sufficient,

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
and that is as far as he has known,

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
there is a spectrally often to the of these documents.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
And the Zionist and Mr. Koolney's statement

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
has no objections to me following the prestigious adjacent Madness to Welk's.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Sure, I would say this.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Mr. Welk, I don't know whether he meant to or not,

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
has created the inflection of Leapton, my mind,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
but he wants people to think he has some information,

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
or he has some knowledge, the seat number, and not all many.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
He has not stood so long, he has merely stated,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
let's make early on, come to the meeting.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Within the last few minutes, Mr. Gerrard,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
he has his restrictions with respect.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The occupancy of these documents.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
Mr. Gerrard, the executive, which you are recognizing from this news time,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Mr. Aga, I understand Mr. Chairman,

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
such a request has been made by Council for the Army,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Mr. Steven Smith-Hattis.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Mr. Koon has exceeded to that request.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
May I ask the senator from Wisconsin whether or not

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
the interposes of the objectives of the report?

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Please don't take it in the next session to the request, Mr. Jenkins.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
I say first, I think Senator McCarthy is absolutely right.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Let's do a lot of many hints as there,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
let's get into Welk's under oath.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
I have faced publicly here for all the gear I am seeing,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
and I present the same people who are listening to me as

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
just listening to Mr. Welk.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
That Mr. Welk has not stated that he has any evidence,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
or any grounds upon which the basis is sufficient.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I'm arrived Mr. Welk.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Nothing except what has been said in this room.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Mr. Chairman.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
So glad your presence,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
let's look all around on the introduction to

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
having me document the shaman by an expert

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
help with the number of me I say this.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Mr. Jenkins knows the Chair knows that when we have had

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
the sessions, we have not aired them,

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
and talked about them with answers to Jenkins to call the witnesses.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
Now, Mr. Welk has stated that he has got the physicians.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
That means to the jury,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
when the jury, to the American people,

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
that means for the jury to Mr. Welk,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
is telling them that there's something to make.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
The effect is there's something not genuine about the document.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Mr. Chairman, we have carefully avoided anything like that.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
We've asked the Chair to call the witnesses

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
and executive questions when we have the sessions.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Now, it's Mr. Welk.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
There's no information, no evidence of any kind.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Then he said to the Honour's enough to tell us that

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
he's an effect to choosing this young lady here

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
of the jury.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
That's what he's doing before the microphone.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
He's saying I've got the physicians.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Let's hear what those suspicions are placed upon.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
I know a little about these memorandum documents,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
which is just what he testified on her role.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
And it's just so well done.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
And I know he's a very great clever to the lawyer.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
If he wants to do the science, tell the American people.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
That means he knows something about these documents

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
that will indicate they are not genuine.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Then he should raise his right hand,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
go down here in the whippedest stand,

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
and tell us why he dares to accuse this young lady of purchasing.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
That's what he's doing.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
With the time when he should be required to do that,

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
I'm getting off.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
We've picked away down deep inside of these innuenders.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
These charges without saying as much.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
But someone is dishonor, someone is doing something improper.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
Now this man wealth has.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
He has just now, there's no question about it.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
We try to face the impression of the young lady

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
of the jury.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Let's have him take the stand.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Let's have him take the oath.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Let's cross the ground on him.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Let's our jury of American people.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
See that he has nothing, absolutely nothing.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
Who, on which to face this unreasonable,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
and if I say Mr. Welch,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
this is just harmous charge against this young lady.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
With the chairman's reckoning.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
The jury composed of the American audience

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
that frankly has the same evidence

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
on which to face any suspicion it might have.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
As it has been,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
as Mr. Welch and the biblical,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Mr. Welch has stated publicly here

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
that his suspicions are his and his along apparently

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
and that they are based on the documents themselves

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
and what he has heard here this afternoon.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Mr. Welch, this is very much Senator.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Yes, ma'am.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
That's right.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Mr. Welch, when you're talking to me,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I say that it's a primer to make the statement.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
I suspect that some of them being guilty of surgery.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
This year, I would have rightfully saw

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
that it would take the family immediately.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
And let me cross the ground on him.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Mr. Welch has gotten milder this now for four or five times.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
I think now we should know.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
We should know whether there's any places to face this fact.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
For these social suspicions,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
when there's no reason why he shouldn't get down there,

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
it is right now, Mr. Warren,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
the coffee time on the same as any other witness,

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
is coffee time.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Mr. Chairman, I'd desire to make this one further statement.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Mr. Chairman?

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
And I hesitate to make it a little while ago,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
and I hear in a scene saying,

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
the senator from Missouri asked me a question to it.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
Whether or not I had had these documents examined,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
by Dr. M. Beckberg,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
or compared them with the pie-bratters

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
in the Office of Senators, McCartney.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
Mr. Chairman will remember that he is present.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Several weeks ago, when I was investigating this case,

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
and perhaps even before I started to engage in studies,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
I, the assistant,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
to the director of Federal Bureau of Investigation,

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
whether or not such an investigation,

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
as was suggested by Senator Sammingson,

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
with being feasible, our revealing.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
And I was given an answer in the negative.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
And that question and those answers were given

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
in the office of the chairman of this deputy,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and in the presence of the chairman.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
And I hope that's the chairman of the organization.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
And it was for that one of our first-place reasons,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
and I'm going to order, please,

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
that I have not other things.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
I'll be documents for each person.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
In the first place, I was asked to counsel,

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
just correct, his statement that I suggested

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
such an investigation.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
I did not.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
I simply asked what a such an investigation has been made.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
You're right, thanks very much, Mr. Jenkins.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
The second point is, I did not ask,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
because I do not know whether the investigation

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
was respected as he, who had the length of time,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
and it's been written or anything of that character,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
which presumably the council based away,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
he put the question we're talking about.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
I simply asked the council whether or not,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
my distinguished friend, Dennis B,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
whether or not, because,

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
his visit just goes very frankly fair,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
and he was very busy.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
He didn't know what my co-outage he might have used.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
He didn't know what my co-outage was ever death.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah.
