00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Mr. Cohen raised the question, was there no call between Mr. Shine and Secretary Steven?

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Mr. Lucas said there was that there was no transfer to President of the time.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.000
Mr. Cohen said that if we brought Mr. Shine down and he gave his consent with that call the red, do Mr. Shine.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Mr. Cohen then called for Mr. Shine who came in about ten minutes later.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Mr. Shine when he came in red that his limited consent signed the limited consent.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Now before the thing was red I want to go back for a moment.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
While we were waiting for Mr. Shine to come a discussion arose with respect to this call.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
In which Mr. Cohen said I'll bet Mr. Steven's call Mr. Shine and Mr. St. Clair said now Mr. Shine called Mr. Steven.

00:54.000 --> 01:05.000
At that point there was a gathering back and forth about that point and I got up there and said that no events will I do the stakeholder on this outcome of this momentous conversation.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
Mr. Shine came Mr. Lucas said down what his notebook started to read.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
The only words of the call as I remember them are Secretary Steven's call Mr. Shine.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
There was something about the word Dave and then it said something about Steve Cole that another number others and the one that they originally called.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
I remember that word and Mr. Cohen turned to me and said see I was right.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Now that is the con-Mr. Lucas Ben Red, the left of the call following that.

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
Mr. Cohen and half Mr. St. Clair whether it was be possible if they brought up a secretary to have the call,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
then that's the case.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Mr. Stein would have a copy.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
When I said Mr. Cohen I don't remember exactly what it was Mr. Cohen but Mr. Shine because they were together.

01:55.000 --> 02:05.000
Mr. Ben Red was the first to come up and Mr. Lucas began dictating I was not present well the rest of the conversation was on because I was busy as family and the notebook and the other document.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Now that's the story as I recall it.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Thank you very much Mr. Herbert.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Mr. Chair and the Chair of Mr. Lucas and Mr. St. Clair who were all the present.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Are there the recital which you have done for him?

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
In conformity with what you have been taking place Mr. Lucas you and those all have been present.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Yes sir.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Mr. St. Clair.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Chair may have to work to disagree if you agree and there is no competition.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
No competition.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I suppose you know you're going to be a ceremony and you're going to be wearing it on the whistle.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But there is some kind of thing on this one.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I suppose it has to be quite a testimony.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Mr. Chairman I'm doing my best to think back.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I may be known as I didn't anticipate we'd have any troubles back.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
I thought we got along admirably well considering the circumstance.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I suppose it appears that I may some form of wager.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
If I did I'd never paint off nor have I collected.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
I will say this a wager was supposed to be correct.

03:09.000 --> 03:18.000
The only thing I would like to say concerning Mr. Horowitz's statement I think it's accurate.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
I think that I would add that I persisted in my view that as to what the order of the telephone calls were.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
I think Mr. Cohn and all fairness persisted in his view however.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
I suppose it's not the case that I was in the court.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
I need to be sure I know what an international witness has to tell me if I have such a big problem.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Any descendants of my right?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Well they're going around the table and while we have the opportunity let's return.

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
I think the injection matter certainly that the resolve very simply by our weather Mr. Shine called on the 19th.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
What are the secretary in effect we turn just call we all get telephone calls sometimes we call back on the operator number.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Maybe the calls also you call the number direct.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I think we're spending a lot of time here on something that could be resolved very simply.

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
Mr. Lucas is I understand your testimony your records disclose that a call was made to the secretary by Mr. Shine on the 19th of October.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
And your records in your office show that?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes sir.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Is that correct?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
And an operator number was left?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yes sir.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
And a telephone number?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yes sir.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Operator such in such New York telephone number so and so is that?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yes sir.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
Well Mr. Chairman I don't know whether that if that point is disputed.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
Well I say that's the first sort of thing Mr. Chairman.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I think we get to the heart and have it over with.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
And your question?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
By the Senate?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
No.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
He tell you that you have to welcome Mr. Washington back.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Well then I'll take you for a few minutes and reply to the Senate of Jackson by May.

05:01.000 --> 05:09.000
The telephone records now on file of this committee disclose the following information.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
What are you reading so?

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
Well the senator I mean from my copy of the telephone records that has been already marked in effort.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
There is a committee that is in order to determine some kind of information.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
But what's called a report of the read from Mr. Frank Fire?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
That's the meeting to tell us that the report is not pardoning.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
That's the meeting to tell us that the report is not pardoning.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
And the testing to tell us a little bit about this next time.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Just a moment sir.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm fine.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
There's quite a lengthy group there.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
These are the whatever something is that covers Washington DC.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
On 101953, they missed a shine.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I must take that back.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
It's the New York Company.

05:59.000 --> 06:11.000
So from New York to a man by the name of Stevens at the Liberty 5-6-700 in Washington DC at 137 p.m.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
What did he call for?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
New York.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Over the where in New York.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
There's a child.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Well I'm not familiar enough with these.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
I think it does not show.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
I would like to ask the witness if he knows whether on the following day October 20th,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Secretary Stevens was out of the office and in fact had port money.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Yes sir.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
And returned to his office and the next day on the 20th of October.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Yes sir.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
And then as the day he made this call to Mr. Shine we've now been discussing.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Yes sir.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
The other question is Mr. Tindler.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Welcome.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Mr. Tindler, any more?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So thank you Mr. Chairman.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Very well Mr. Tone or...

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I have a client or a senator.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Anyone with me is Mr. Tindler.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Now...

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
What's this?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Mr. Wilkins, you were a successful owner.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
You know how many were successful?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Which was the season's day here at 12.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm one person on.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
David Shine called me up on the 21st of October.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Are you familiar with that?

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
It's day 248 of the record here.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
David Shine called me up on the 21st of October.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
That's what I'm interested in.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Am I familiar with it?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Yes sir.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
What do you mean?

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, Mr. Stevens, I'm telling you sir that Mr. Stevens came under all testimony in this room on April 23rd.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
That day is Shine called me up on the 21st of October.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Well, I haven't read all of the talk.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Thank you sir.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Take my word for that.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yes sir.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Are you ready to read all of the talk?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
David Shine, that's what I'm interested in.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
David Shine called me up on the 21st of October.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Now I'm not interested in a call on the 19th of October,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
or the 10th of October, or anything else.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I know about a call on the 19th and I know about other calls.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
But I'm interested in Mr. Locus and let me make this clear.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Is full initiator the call on the 21st?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
And who wanted to talk for room?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
That's the issue here.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Now, is Mr. Stevens telephoned?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I'm sorry.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Did David Shine call up Mr. Stevens on the 21st of October?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
No sir.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
He did not.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
No sir.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Did Mr. Stevens call Mr. Shine on the 21st of October?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yes sir.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
And Mr. Stevens say to Mr. Shine,

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
I told you I would rather have talked with you in person

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
than to have told you on the phone.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Yes sir.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Did he go on and say, but since I didn't get to get you in person,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
and I am about to leave on a quick trip to California,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I wanted to call you and tell you.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Is that right?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Yes sir.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Well now, what did that sound like to you?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Does that sound like Mr. Stevens calling Mr. Shine

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
or that Mr. Shine is calling Mr. Stevens?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Well, I can't wait to hear it.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Now, farewell.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Any other questions?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I have a China question.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
No questions sir.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Very well, I guess we'll do it that way.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
We'll run out of any meetings,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
directed detectives, the phone calls,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
are you ready to call?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yes sir.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I'd like Mr. Jenkins to remind him the record.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Very well.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
And, uh...

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
So, do you not agree with the coverage of the call

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
that you've been missing?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I do.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I believe I've decided to leave on the phone.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I believe I've decided to leave on the phone.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I believe I've decided to leave on the phone.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I believe I've decided to leave on the phone.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I believe I've decided to leave on the phone.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I believe I've decided to leave on the phone.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Mr. Luther's on the left asking to stay

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
whether or not he's monitoring a number of telephone calls

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
hicing between Mr. Cohen and the secretary of the Army.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yes sir.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
You don't have any...

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
I believe I'll...

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Seven, sir.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
May the chair and the chair have said it's a private time.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You are just listed on the committee table now

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
and you make a back to the Army and wherever you are.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I do hear that.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
All right.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I'll have a second.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
What's the...

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Wait, wait, wait.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm just curious.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I thought the Army Comfort was going to have a question.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Did Mr. Shine call on the night?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Oh, that's...

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I think that's an example.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I call on the meeting range.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It's going to be on the 20th.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I don't know if it's an absolute.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
We know like four times we're going to have the record.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I'll tell you the exact answer.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Just for the sake of clarifying the record,

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
if Mr. Stephen were returning the call of mine,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
he would have asked me what I had called him about.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
This phone call that has been read into the record today

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
clearly shows, I think,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
that Mr. Stephen said most of the talking

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
and that I did most of the listening, sir.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Did you see him on the plane?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I did not, sir.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
That is the explain in the conversation.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Well, I really asked a question.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
There's an unreterned call as I understand the record here.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
On the 19th.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
And I understood Mr. Lucas originally to say that

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
the call had not been returned and it's been two days later

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
that a call was initiated then by Mr. Stephen.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
At least I would indicate that.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
But you say you'd call him the 19th about

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
the entirely different matter,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
but he did not return that on the 19th city.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
There was on the 19th arrangement for being made

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
for a trip to Fort Lama.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
That is an entirely different matter, sir.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
The trip to Fort Lama took place on the 20th.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
As it happens, I didn't get to fly down

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
because the pilots called me and told me

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
that the weather would not permit us to fly.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
On the 21st Secretary Stephen called me

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
as his indicator to this conversation

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
and told me that he was sorry

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
that he did not add the opportunity to see me at Fort Lama.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
And that therefore he had to call me on the telephone.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
This wasn't entirely different matter, sir.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Oh, I think that's your out of no.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
The conversation was very well.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
I was like, I didn't spend time.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Yes, I just wanted to fire.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I have to.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
All right, then he may set down by the chance.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Before he goes, Mr. Starr and today.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
We have a record of a telephone call from Mr. Shines

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
to the Secretary of the 19th of October.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Our record indicates that at that time

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
you talked to Colonel Booth.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
And the reason is a call was completely different.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Yes, sir. I believe the call was completed

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
concerning plain arrangements to Fort Lama, sir.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
And that record has been introduced to the record, Mr. Chairman.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Chairman, I would say that records are very clear

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
that the call was only as he was made.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
It was completed.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
This was an entirely different matter.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
There was a new call initiated firement to see

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
this on the 21st.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
We have Mr. Stephen's warm testimony.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
We have the contradiction from the call,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
and it will be up to the committee to make the determination.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Well, what you're saying is that the call was not completed

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
to Stephen's, but it was completed to someone

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
in the office, Colonel Booth.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Yes, sir.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
And I'm saying the purpose of that call,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
the business was transacted on the 19th and the 20th.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
There was no sending business, and that a new call on a different matter

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
was initiated by Mr. Stephen, who said in the call to the call,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I am calling you.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
I wanted to call you, and I wanted to tell you such and such things.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I think I've been one time.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yes, sir.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yes, sir.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
The bill was revealed.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
The call on the 19th was to make arrangements for the hearing

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
at Fort Moments, was that the case?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yes, sir.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
The call?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yes, sir.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
What?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I think you have to do this in a certain way, Colonel Bloor.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
After you can give Mr. Stephen.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yes, sir.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Thanks, sir.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
The sign is also a kind of a little white talker,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
but the route is not the one.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Let's hear it.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I think they have put down these tracks,

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
and they can't have too much difference.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
We're going to see if they can do that.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I'll get that done.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
It's a little bit better.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I think, yes, that it's perhaps a little inappropriate

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
for counsel to argue a case in the middle of it

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
or even for a participant, but I would suggest that the Army

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
be allowed to file, whether it's records made at the time,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
which would indicate that the witness

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
or the participant now privacy is shy and asked

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
if the secretary called him back.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
We will do that this afternoon.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Anyway, everyone.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Okay.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
There are no further questions now about privacy.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
The chairman, like you just mentioned, is a witness.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Something to be called against.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
It's necessary.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Mr. James.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
The Chief Minister of the United Nations,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
your first monitor's call between Mr. Boone

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
and the Secretary of the Army.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
23 September 1973.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Did you take the short-hand note of that call?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Yes, sir.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
And if you transcribe those notes to type, yes, sir.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Do you have a copy of your transcription before you?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yes, sir.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Is he correct or subventionary, so?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Yes, sir.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Mr. Coen, do I understand that you desire that I repeat?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm very much appreciated if you would, Mr. James.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Now, I've noticed, in the course of my calls,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and particularly, I'm Mr. Card,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
there are certain names mentioned that come into two categories.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
One of those is suspected communists in the Army.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
I have suggested that those names be not read publicly.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
The second thing is, I think that in my calls,

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
there are two references to an usual personal friend of Mr. Steven's and myself,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
similar to the thing in Senator Macaw, these two all.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And I've answered if there's no objection for anyone.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
For many of them, that's not be read either.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
And I would be very happy to have you show all those things to the committee and let them decide.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
And I understand you've made proper decisions on the coffees you have delivered to me, Mr. Coen.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
And before reading those names, they will be submitted to the members of the committee.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
I would still ask you to follow me, please, now.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
And after I have completed meeting each call,

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
you may say, well, they're not absolutely ready to the purposes of the record.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
23 September 1953, since when is it going to show the law of Cohn's policy?

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
Law of Cohn's phone secretary, the Army from New York, at 12.29.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Steven, are you working in New York now?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Cohn, yes.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.000


16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
We have got to hold a hearing here today.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Steven, when we need to be back, Cohn,

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't think we will be back over the weekend.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
We have something like a heavyweight championship.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Three dots.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Cohn, what are we going to do with General Putsch?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Steven, I don't know, Roy.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
You're going to have to head him up there on Monday, of course.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Cohn, that is up to you, Steven.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
I think it would be on my as Roy for me to have enough to do that.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Cohn, you don't have to ask me.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
Steven, I think it is a very nice thing.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I've deleted the words.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
I've accidentally saved the meaning of it yesterday.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
Cohn, you just don't, you just give me an indication

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
because maybe the thing has ramifications.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
And he has the head of Cohn, and maybe we won't be doing much

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
if we make the head of Cohn's policy.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Steven, you won't be gaining much from our standpoint

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
to make the Cohn's policy.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
On the other hand, I don't like to say to you,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
quote, please don't call it that, I'm full code.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
I think you'd better call him up there and handle it,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
as you think, man.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
But don't let's have too much of a spectacle.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Cohn, I'm afraid once you get that bad,

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
there will not be too much of a way to stop the things you see.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
You know what, he likes it.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You might want a nice General Putsch,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
but once you get in the ring and start thinking

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
a couple of posts, it gets on the exchange.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Steven, how do you feel about it yourself?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Cool.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I think it would be a lot of fun.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
You know I have an old, big name, mother.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
But on the other hand, I can see why that would not be a good idea

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
from the standpoint of over there.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
And if you can do a good job, on the other hand,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
we have a lot of witnesses.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And maybe we just won't reach here.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Dennis, much easier.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Let me know as late as Monday morning.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Steven, how can I call you?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Cool.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I have a check.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I need you to follow up.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Why?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
My office number.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
I don't mind that.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
I would appreciate it if you didn't read my home phone

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
because I'd start getting a phone.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
So, here we be the one with a two-gillipop lover.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
And Cohn gives you the two office numbers.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And here office and residence.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
That's Cohn.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Is that correct?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Steven.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
That will be over the next two or three days.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Cohn, right.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
You just let me know.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Everything else all right?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Steven's okay.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Have I correctly read it?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Yes, sir.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
What is the latest next monitor that telephone call

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
between Mr. Cohn and the Secretary of the Army, Mr. Cohn?

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
The poll is September 25, 1953.

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
I mean, is that substantially correct?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yes, sir.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
The monitoring of that call in your transcript.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Transcription.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Are they correct, Mr. Lucas?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Yes, sir.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Can you follow me as I read you, please?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Are you ready?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Yes, sir.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
25 September, 1953, friends and sprouting.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
925, Secretary of the Army tried to phone Roy Cohn.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
And 937, Roy Cohn called back Secretary of the Army.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Steven.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Are you keeping busy?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Cohn, yes.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
We had your friend, Paula.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Steven.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
He said he stayed away from the Fifth Amendment call.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
We're getting a contempt citation against him.

19:42.000 --> 19:50.000
Then, the mayor was in, and he named Le Mans, and some of these books,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
question-marking references, and their communist party activities.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
Then we got hired more who had written that, and she got a postponement,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
postponement of her money, and she was a fifth amendment case.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
There is a new situation involving a part of your thing that I would think you about

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
when I see you that looks pretty bad.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
I know they're trying to cover up so you won't even know about Steven.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Is it something I ought to act on before you get back, Cohn?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I don't think so.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
They're trying to do a cover-up job on something, Steven.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
That I am not interested in.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I won't earn for me anything and everything.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Thank you.
