WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
I understand from my idea that the view of this time, financial position is with the availability.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Maybe not that.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Point of order, no.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
In order to pay that, the witness specifies that he has a proper way of collecting copyright.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
So yes, that's by unanimous consent.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
If he's sending the new record, that's fine as the old lady.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
I am checking that.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I suspect that he doesn't send a very nice, I like that over Mr. Colby.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I think that's a very important question of this.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
These are one or two matters of this reference.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Is that a certificate from his wife?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I think this one is the very important one.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
What is it, Mr. Colby?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
It's this.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
I think Mr. Lucas is trying to create the impression here that Mrs. that, uh, Mrs. Shine Cole, Mrs. Stevens,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
instead of the other way around.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Now, when Mr. Lucas, uh, Mr. Jenkins was with Mr. Horowitz of your stamp and myself,

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
and Mrs. Shine and his son are with us, my office wife, have on the way up to the room.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
He stated it was very clear from the call that Mrs. Stevens had Cole Shine and not by the version.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
And back then, I had a witness to St. Clare and Mr. Welch's stamp about that, and I believe I won the bet.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Now, in the course of the call that the Jenkins, Mrs. Stevens said,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
well, I wanted to call you.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
And other words, Stevens wanted to call Shine and tell him so and so forth.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
So it's very clear from the text of the call that I want to see, then to call Shine and want to call.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
I think that's right there in the text. Well, I wanted to call you.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And tell you so and so forth. So I think that point should be clearly established.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Does that matter of argument, Mr. Cohen, and a matter of interpretation?

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Does it pass on by the committee automatically?

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Mr. Chairman, I think the role that Mr. Thomas has in order on it, if he's Mr. Jason, but ask for that.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
In the end, you, Mr. Cohen, say, well, I think the witnesses are not going to make any statement he desires to make.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Do you desire to make one, Mr. Lucas? Yes, sir.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, my notebook does not say that, as Secretary Stevens, as my sharnier notes, did not say that,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
as Secretary Stevens was returning to Shine and call.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I have looked it up, Mr. Shine called.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
Secretary Stevens on 19 October at 147 C.M.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
And did not speak. He left an operator's number 398.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
New York City with his calling number that's on here.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Now I have to go into some questions, please.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Are you going to get around here, men?

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
You have questions on our table. Mr. Chairman, I have no questions asked.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
You do a good thing.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Chair, I have a second round.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I'll order to ask the plaintiff.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
The document to what's in the stress, the rest, and the automated part of the record.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I also asked for that, as I said.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
As Senator McCullough, he's that part now that's not made part of the rite.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And the sharnier has to send that very well.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Well, we have this opportunity. Let's return to our studios across the country.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Senator Simonton, for the Chair, I have more.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Please let the call position as well.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Make it his, uh, uh, decal.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Either Mr. Shine, get called before Mr. Stevens call, or he didn't.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
And I think the record should be made very clear on that.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
The telephone record.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Well, the Chair understands that Mr. Lucas said,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
today is pervary and a note on his cards, a chanted call.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
And the current note book on this particular call is not indicated.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Who only shares the call?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
That was Chair Dungeons and Directors Lucas.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Uh, Senator, the, from the secretary, uh, when a call comes in,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
for the secretary, and he is not there, someone else, he calls him back.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
The secretary called him back.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I've just write a little note to the secretary telling him about that.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And, uh, I have found that note.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
And also, I've, I've checked with, uh, on the, uh, the, with a telephone.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Uh, slip and so on.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
And there's a notation.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Uh, Mr. Shine called Mr. Stevens and left word.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Uh, uh, that case, nineteen, October, one, forty, seven.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And the incident call is not October 21?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yes, sir.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
I can be 21.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yes?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
The Chairman, why are you doing ghosts?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Uh, uh, yeah, kind of draw out.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Would you be good enough to supply for the record, the official, uh,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
is there, uh, official note?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Well, I will reference to the telephone call.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
It's a regular, uh, government or department.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a department, a slip, a blue, uh, informal member, and a slip.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Well, I think it's the appropriate, if there's any question about it,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
be the fact there's a dispute in the Chairman.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
I think that a photostatic coffee of that should be included, uh,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
in the record at this point.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And, uh, any other person that, uh, uh, uh, uh,

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
uh, note statement made at that time,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
and temper any of the events.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Could that be done?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yes, sir.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Okay.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
That'll be done.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Send the voice back.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
No, sir.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
No, sir.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I'll make the call.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Uh, the list I'd rather ask, but you sign, you know, the question,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
or if it's the call representing you in it?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Mr. Caller's not representing me, but at this time, I have no questions, sir.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Very well, then, uh, give me a statement.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I will also pass on this Chairman first.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Uh, but, uh, what you look at, uh,

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
you said you just, but you have out of your files, right?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I don't know what you're referring to.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
You've got a copy of this.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I've known for all of it, no time to return.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
You say it took earlier for you?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, you're referring to the little blue memorandum that I mentioned, sir.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm referring to the blue call from Stephen with the shine.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Whether that is a little blue informal,

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
uh, what are all puts in them all, saying, uh, Mr. Shine,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
or Mr. Steve, or something like that.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
How does your copy differ from the copy that Mr. Jenkins mentioned from?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
In the head, sir.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Can I see that?

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
What's this, did you, uh, well, what they said you, uh,

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
did you, uh, dictate the memorandum,

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
the monitor call from Mr. Jenkins' grant?

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
I don't remember the dates, sir.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
You don't recall that I had...

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
You don't recall that?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
No, sir?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I don't recall what they said.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
They just said, uh, they document your hands,

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
they just said, uh, they document your hands and me.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
One might sometimes, sir.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
You know, considerably after your dictated,

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
they wanted to, uh, Mr. Jenkins' office.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Otherwise, first you dictated the memorandum, Mr. Jenkins' office.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
Where on, you face that, uh, another copy and put it in the file.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Is that nice?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
No, sir.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, what is the time difference, sir?

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Well, on the informal memo, that was on the 19th of October,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
when Mr. Shine, uh, Mr. Shine,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
belongs back to our factory statement.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
How could you dictating it was the Jenkins' office from,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
from your, from your short hand notes,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
or from the documents that you had handed me?

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Uh, I wrote, uh, that transcript,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
uh, and that was the better to Mr. Harwell,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Mr. Lutkis, you know, Mr. Anderson,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
you had number one, you'd dictate it.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
That's number random over the telephone.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Mr. Jenkins' office, that right?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
No, sir, the only dictating I did was to, uh, Mr. Mims,

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
with Mr. Shine there. Mr. Shine, as I recall,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
he couldn't have a copy of that.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
And we didn't seem to have one available,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
so I, uh, I, uh, I read from my notes,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
and Mr. Mims, with Mr. Shine there.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
At the time that the transcripts were turned over to Mr. Harwell.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Now, sometime you turned over to Mr. Harwell,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
and I was the document which from which Mr. Jenkins read.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Is that right?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
What, sir?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
No, uh, no.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I never turned that over to Mr. Harwell.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I was a dependent over him.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
No one.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Uh, I'm, how to, how to, how to, Mr. Jenkins again.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
He didn't, I don't know whether he ever got it,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
until, uh, this occasion.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
And evidently what he has is what Mr. Mims wrote.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
All right, then we get, we get back to the,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
for the fact that you dictate it to Mr. Mims.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
All right.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I'll start off, I ask you to listen to Mr. Mims.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I ask you whether you dictate it from your short hand notes.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
At that time or not.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
So we're back at that point now, when you answer that question.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Yep, sir, I did dictate it from my short hand notes.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Well, then, then later, then at that time was the document

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
that you now hand me in existence.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Yes, sir, but we didn't have it in hand then.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Right.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Now, isn't it a fragment of Lucas that you learned?

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
That Mr. Cohn, Mr. St. Clair, had considerable discussion

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
about other Mr. Stevens made this call,

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
or Mr. Schaim did, and that after you learned of that,

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
you then changed this memorandum, originally it says,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Secretary Stevens called, called him Dave.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Now we plan you give us memorandum.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Secretary Stevens returned call of David Schaim.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Now, isn't it a fact that this document was handed me?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Was prepared after you learned of a discussion

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
between Mr. Cohn and Mr. St. Clair,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
about the significance of other and other mysteries,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Stevens called him Mr. Schaim.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
No, sir, it was not prepared after the time that I dictated to him.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It was prepared before then.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Have you got your short hand notes with you?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
No, sir, I don't.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Well, I'm going to ask the Sherrod Orderer with us

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
to produce the short hand notes that he will.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I think the short hand notes were produced with it

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
out of the time that the amount of the calls were finally

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
done and we got the notes down the call.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Mr. East Cameron and the harvest department,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
I heard from you, advised me that these types occur.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
In the present, which Cohn,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
you represent Senator MacI, and Mr. Cohn,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
which car, the present, Mr. Fawick, representing my past,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Mr. Lucas, that is the original notes with him.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
The red is the original notes of that time.

09:47.000 --> 09:56.000
The notes that I have and from which I read it.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Thereupon there was some considerable discussion

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
between Mr. Cohn and I and the Sandit and Mr. St. Claven,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Mr. St. Claven, Mr. St. Claven,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
I must say, part of the advice is,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
these are Mr. Cohn's position in all fairness,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
correct insofar as the document from which I read is concerned,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
it would appear, Mr. Chairman, that I,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
sir, the notes were read to the gentleman whose name

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
was mentioned, Mr. Lucas, went back to the Pentagon

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
and I'll probably read it.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And I looked up and took into your position

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
other notes on the 19th.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm a light about that.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Yes, sir.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
It was from the information that you gathered from your notes

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
as a 19th, as well as the notes that you read to Mr.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Harwich, Mr. St. Claven, Mr. Cohn,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
that you compiled the document from which you read.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
I read that to public correct, is it not that light, Mr. St. Claven?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I'm sorry, I didn't say you were that kind of person.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm a part of a big question.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Mr. Jenkins, it was from the information

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
that you gathered from your notes of the 19th,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
as well as the notes that you read to Mr. Harwich.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Mr. St. Claven and Mr. Cohn,

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
that you compiled as a document that you read,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I think that's probably correct.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Here's a lot said right, Mr. St. Claven.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I would say, presently, Mr. Jenkins,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
my memory and situation is this.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
We present it all of the notebooks of Mr.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Lutus, the name of Mark by Mr. Harwich,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
initialed and dated, I believe.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Then came the question about whether or not we could have

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
paying consent to make these available to you.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And at that time, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Carly,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I was there and that's all that we had expected would be there.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Not really, we did not expect, Mr.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Shine would be there and we did not bring the transcript

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
as his talk along.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
With the shine, it turned out it was in the Senate Office building

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
and was available to a phone call,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
and I believe Mr. Cohn called him,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
and he came up to the room and signed the consent

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
about what I have said.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We're up on, all we had there was a notebook.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I did not have the transcriptions with me,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
because I did not anticipate that

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
private shine would be there.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm sure Mr. Lutus will either correct me if I'm wrong

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
or confirm it if I'm right, to keep that down

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
and dictated from his notes to Mr. Smith.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
And I believe that must be the end of the copy that you have.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
No request was made for our transcript.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I believe you, as far as understanding,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
that your committee was satisfied with the transcript

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
you have in your hands.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I will say that the transcript that has been read

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
from by Mr. Lutus was in existence before I even came to Washington.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
We just didn't have it with us in the Senate Office building

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
that day because we did not anticipate the private shine

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
would then be available to consent to.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
He was there, so he did the next best thing,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
namely, reading notes.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Chairman, that thing is here.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I was at the House, I can't explain it to you.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Of course, that's right.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I'm going to have a meeting.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I'm going to have a meeting with Mr. Lutus.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
Mr. Lutus, do you mind anything in your notebook,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
of a 21st, to indicate that the Stevens

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
of returning, he called the day of change,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
not in the static graphic notes,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
not in the static graphic notes book,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
on that call, on the page where that call was.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
As I recall, I don't remember.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Just you know.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
In the notebook, I have no way of it, knowing.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Mr. Harvest, have you heard of the notebook?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Do you know the original notebook, right now?

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
When you produce those, and I don't book?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yes, sir.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Now, the afternoon,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
the outside, is it?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
A little bit different, sir.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I'll tell you how it here is.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
But you have here by 130, so we can go over

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
before the session too far.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Yes, sir, if I can.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I'm going to call your attention, Mr. Lutus.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
To the language in this, and that, you know,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
this doesn't indicate positively that this was no return

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
of a call, but rather an original call.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
Well, trying down the middle of the page, Mr. Stevens,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
followed a little hazy and moneless,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
that perfectly all right to the flight.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
He's referring to the flight of the 20th, man.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Did you know that?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Yes, sir, like that, sir.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I would rather have talked to you in person

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
than to call you on the phone,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
but since I didn't get to you in person,

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
and I am about to leave on a Christmas trip to California.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
And, look, I wanted to call you and tell you,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
doesn't make it very clear that Mr. Stevens

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
is making a call.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yes, sir?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Well, now, when you picked up something in the 19th,

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
and transferred back to a 21st after

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
you had picked out the original law,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
did you then know that Mr. Cheyne had made a call

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
to Mr. Stevens?

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
So, the purpose of talking about the trip to Monmouth,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
that we made the trip to Monmouth the following day,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
and that we freely discussed practically everything

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
with Mr. Stevens and I took to Monmouth.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
So, this was not a return of a phone call.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Are you aware of those facts?

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Well, some of them, what is the question, sir?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
It's a long, long take.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
All right, we'll start over.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
At the time you picked up the notation from the 19th,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
did you inquire of anyone

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
as to why that phone call was made?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
I don't understand.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
At the time I picked up the notation of the 19th.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Yes.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
When you took that, I'm certain it was that on the 21st.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I still don't understand the question, sir.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
You know, well, now, you've got your thoughts of Mr. Stevens

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
on the 21st, was returning a call of the 19th, am I right?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Well, I made this new transfer,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
that I made, I wrote down that Secretary Stevens

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
returned the call of David Cheyne.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
So you know, what made you change your mind?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
After you took that original document,

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
from you know, saying Secretary Stevens called and called him Dave.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
What made you change that to your next document,

16:08.000 --> 16:15.000
which you say Secretary Stevens returned the call of David Cheyne?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What made you change your mind?

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
Your question has turned into the timing of the two transcripts

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
that I've followed here today, is the one that I first made.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
The other one is the result of my having dictated

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
that Mrs. Limbs at a later point.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Let me show you an attention to certain testimony,

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
and I won't ask you if you were aware of this before the second document is prepared.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
The testimony of Secretary Stevens from April 23rd.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
When was your next contact with a staff?

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Well, David Cheyne called me up on the 21st of October.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I think that was the next day.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
First of all, and what was the study on education by David Cheyne?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Well, David Cheyne still, I think, hovers the hope.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
Now, we say that he should do some special jobs and investigation, rather than.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
Now, is there anything in this to indicate that Dave was calling Bob Stevens

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
on the 21st, hovers the hope that he could get some job

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
and go to the case of Stephen's calling time saying we've arranged a birth for you to finish your ability?

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Which is a time in which we have some questions.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
That's another long question.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Sorry, I couldn't follow it.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
What do you mean by, is there any way in the next ten minutes go round?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
If you have any questions?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
No questions.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I'll send them in the comments.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
And the pilot and the Jackson, one question.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
After you dictated to Mrs. Mamm,

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
the note from your shorthand note,

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
the transcription of this telephone conversation of October 21st,

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
did you then read the typed copy that she prepared?

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
No, sir, I've never seen the one that said you dictated prepared.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
I dictated it and then I understand that I heard it right here.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Yes, but I have to understand a very simple question.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
You dictated it to her and then after she typed it out, did you then read the typed written copy?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Well, sir, I have never seen that type written copy.

18:20.000 --> 18:27.000
Well, then after you dictated it, you did not see it again until you heard the transcription read

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
by the Comforter Committee of this year and this morning.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
That's correct.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
That's the next time that I heard it here.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Let me just ask you one further question.

18:35.000 --> 18:44.000
Can you say whether you dictated to her the caption as it appears in the copy before you,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
the one that you said that you had transcribed earlier?

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
I don't believe I dictated the Secretary Steven's call, Mr. Shine.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I'm a little hazy on that. I don't recall.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You can't recall one way or the other.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
I have to recall that I did call attention to the fact that I wrote down Dave in the note for a tipley in the game.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I didn't see him call him Dave. I do that occasionally.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It isn't exactly what Mr. Steven said.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
In case the Secretary writing a letter might want to know how to address the letter,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
he's going, so I would have it there.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
You're no children. He said Dave and you just automatically had a shine on.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
No, I wrote Dave, but I have down Secretary Steven's place to call to let you shine, I believe.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm not sure.

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
I think it's kind of important, but can you say whether or not you dictated to Mrs. Mim,

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
that Secretary Steven's return, Mr. Shine's call?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I just don't remember.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
You have no recollection. You didn't read the copy after it was transcribed.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
I'll try to do that.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I don't wonder.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
Okay. I'll take you up and listen back to what you said.

19:50.000 --> 20:00.000
Mr. Steven said that, in your attention, that Robert Shine had called Mr. Steven's on the 19th from a Memorandum.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Now, you filed a Memorandum of that time?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Yes, sir.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
And when did you prepare your transcripts?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I bought four on it.

20:12.000 --> 20:19.000
At some time in March, it was long before I turned these transcripts over to Lizzie Memorandum, a catch-to-your-no-foot,

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
or how did you have to recall that Memorandum?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Well, I had it in a very large pack of memos in my desk, sir.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
Did you go through all your faults, determine whether it was a return fall or whether it was in the initial fall?

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
When with the other calls that you've testified, you hear.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Well, I got those either from my demographic notes book, or from Little Summary's.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
We're rather your demographic note book designation.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
It was a return fall.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
As I recall now, sir, it doesn't designate.

20:51.000 --> 21:00.000
My impression is it could very well have simply a time, and maybe Shine or Dave Shine or say something of that sort with no particular detail.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, Senator Potter, the handling of the telephone is a very fast-moving thing.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
Sometimes the conversation has started, and you don't have time to write out all the things.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
I can appreciate that, but I'm just curious to know how you handle your Memorandum.

21:18.000 --> 21:25.000
I know in my office that the return call comes in on one day, and I can't return the call until the next.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
I left on my desk. After returning the call, I destroyed the Memorandum.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I was wondering if the same thing applied in general.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
That same sort of thing applies.

21:33.000 --> 21:49.000
On the 19th, the way that this month has happened, I was right-in-out to the secretary saying that Shine calls such as that time, and when the return call, down the bottom left-hand corner, I indicate how to get the operator, how to make the return call.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
So if I'm not there, whoever gets that memo from the secretary, would know how to do it.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
There have been no records, but there have been no record of it, and you're kind of graphics book.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Does that correct? Well, it's not in the 19th. Does that be a record of it?

22:02.000 --> 22:11.000
Their twitter could not be a record of it. It may be that our phone operator after the call came in, might have given me a little fluke, liver, something saying Mr. Shine call, or I might have been there.

22:11.000 --> 22:23.000
If I was on the phone, taking down the information, it would be in my notebook. If I did not happen to be there when that original incoming call came in, why somebody else may have told me about it or given me a slip of paper.

22:23.000 --> 22:32.000
But then from whatever source I had, I just nominated, then I write a little flu-interofered memo to the secretary. I found that they blew Interofer's memo.

22:32.000 --> 22:42.000
I also checked with a phone record that one of our switchboards and found out that Mr. Shine said, I didn't have the time, and it's definitely on this blue memo, the 147 CM.

22:42.000 --> 22:51.000
But I found out from the other records that was the time Mr. Shine called and left word. He did not say he just called and left word, did he want to return call?

22:51.000 --> 23:01.000
Do you know of your own knowledge, whether that was a recurrent call, whether it was a call that the secretary initiated on a bus stand or something?

23:01.000 --> 23:10.000
Well, the secretary would not always be likely to say, return the call of Mr. Shine. He probably said, get Mr. Shine or let's go at that.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
He wouldn't make a point of whether he was returning a man's call or calling him.

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
I wonder if it's certainly not all of the time I would have been able to see the over-40-mile point.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Are you getting here if you will start at no specific as the beginning of the conversation?

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
He was allegedly returning call, and he was getting you all, and he said, I'm calling you up.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
He said, he said, he's not.

23:34.000 --> 23:43.000
He's not necessarily the solicitation, he's the crediallocation of preceding conversation. I think if you look at that, you may find him your shorthand book letter when you return call it up.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't take them down in shorthand.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Well, I'll probably ask that other question.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
That was made up of time. I understand that's a little.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Is that right? Yes, sir.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
That was made up of any of the Smiths at call? Yes, sir. And that's in the file?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
At first.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
You mean you have the second set, one made up of the 19th and one of the 21st?

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
No, sir. There's a slip for the 19th, telling the secretary, Mr. Cheyenne called and one of the return calls.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
On the 21st, Mr. Stevens probably said, get Cheyenne.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I'll be clear in the next.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Good, sir.

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
I think I have a formula that looks like it is Haselow, where the wording of the caption of the respective documents immediately.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Mr. Harvest, first present.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
He has a remarkable memory for detail.

24:23.000 --> 24:32.000
He has been explained to the satisfaction of Mr. Sankhler, Mr. Colm, and of the public generally, and for Mr. Cheyenne.

24:32.000 --> 24:41.000
In a meeting, sir, the man of the public that Mr. Harvest, beyond television, I now want the pleasure of introducing Mr. Harvest, the messy explain.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
As Dr. Sankhler has said to the other square, Mr. Harvest, he's only remembered the fact that he hasn't been sworn. He's really happy that he's here.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Lieutenant, may I say a little, I think it's a good thing to put Mr. Harvest on.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
I will want Mr. Ternukh to hear, because there's something very...

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
Right, Mr. Ternukh, Mr. Ternukh, Mr. Ternukh, Mr. Ternukh, Mr. Ternukh, Mr. Ternukh, Mr. Ternukh, Mr. Harvest, I'm very raffined about this phone call set up. I'd like to get it.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
You soundly for the testimony you're about to give, Mr. Ternukh.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
The whole truth is that nothing but the truth is that I do.

25:10.000 --> 25:22.000
It's all this, and you may proceed to tell us in your own way what you recall of the meetings at which time in the loop is decaying these phones all.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
And he had not had been finished long since.

25:25.000 --> 25:32.000
The only fact that I do not recall exactly is that transaction is the exact date that it took place.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
It took place either on the first or the second year of the OSMAT.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
We went up following the hearing to room 457 in this building.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
There was presence that might self-represented the community.

25:47.000 --> 25:58.000
Mr. Welsh, Mr. Sinclair, representing the department of the Army, Mr. Cohen is there representing Senator McCartney and his staff.

25:59.000 --> 26:12.000
At the very beginning, Mr. Welsh raised the question whether this call was the call to me at this point was not a violation of Section 505 of Title 47.

26:12.000 --> 26:20.000
After some discussion, we're ready for a limited consent to the hearing in which the parties would consent to these calls,

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
we've shown them the need for transmission of Mr. Jenkins and for no other purpose at that time.

26:26.000 --> 26:37.000
This document was signed by Mr. Welsh on behalf of the department of the Army, Mr. Sinclair, Mr. Adams, and which is on the Mr. Cohen on behalf of Senator McCartney, Mr. Carr and himself.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
At that point, the notebook and certain transfers.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
.
