WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I think it's not a cracked figure.

00:06.000 --> 00:14.000
I told the man who made the start, the bigger Hoover and the testified about 10 total

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
crowd were in February devoted time.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
So he made the 250,000.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
I don't believe Mr. Dyson that the husband that dropped us a number of total crowd.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
I think it's not a little too further in my time.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
The number 25,000 under the year 1954, I assume I'm a map representing the number of the

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
community in the United States of America, under discipline of Moscow, is derived that from

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
the testimony of the judgment you refer to Mr. Director of the Federal Bureau of the Federal

00:51.640 --> 00:58.880
Bureau of the Federal Bureau of the Federal Bureau first of all, for the their adult

00:58.880 --> 01:05.380
build with his own caliber and training, but with other personnel in Baker Hall, where

01:05.380 --> 01:13.540
it might not be necessities or emergency institutions in general.

01:43.540 --> 01:54.540
The chief, the murder, the misogynist, did anything necessary on God's earth to make sure

01:54.540 --> 01:57.700
that the Red Comforts they finally control the world.

01:57.700 --> 02:01.940
He's the leading thing that brought the old building to a little McCarthy.

02:01.940 --> 02:08.140
Are you just hopeful to the growth to top of the table and well known?

02:08.700 --> 02:18.300
Mr. Duncan, it's becoming more and more successful during the war years when people were

02:18.300 --> 02:23.340
talking about cooperation with Russia, and as you know, some very fine people.

02:23.340 --> 02:33.420
Thoughts as we could work out peace and have communist nations side by side with our

02:33.420 --> 02:40.420
government, and that time it was much more on the surface, it's going more and more

02:40.420 --> 02:48.420
underground, and how many of the, how much better they had, last number of 25,000 are

02:48.420 --> 02:50.420
undergone at this time.

02:50.420 --> 02:58.420
Because they're not that sneaky, they're zero number, almost difficult to, this is

02:58.420 --> 03:05.420
a start to identify and think out that a communist are communist.

03:05.420 --> 03:10.420
Would like if they're going underground, what would you say about that?

03:10.420 --> 03:12.420
More difficult.

03:12.420 --> 03:23.420
Do you not regard Senator McCarthy as the existence of this underground communist party in the

03:23.420 --> 03:30.420
United States as a constant threat to our formal government that you are an American way

03:30.420 --> 03:31.420
of life?

03:31.420 --> 03:33.420
Mr. Duncan, what's the further?

03:33.420 --> 03:41.420
The way that I, that I'm monitoring myself to make some answers, I have to make you

03:41.420 --> 03:42.420
wrong.

03:42.420 --> 03:51.420
In 1917, you know, I guess it was, the time that it was done, seven devoted communists

03:51.420 --> 04:04.420
in the world, or headed by Nicolai Lamy, seven men, and within 100 days, those seven men

04:04.420 --> 04:13.420
had taken over and enslaved in nation of 180 million people, and those 180 million people

04:13.420 --> 04:20.420
no more wanted to become the foyer than we did.

04:20.420 --> 04:26.420
Seven people, and I we've got twenty-five thousand, and they've got the experience of a good

04:26.420 --> 04:33.420
number of years behind them, so it's a very eminent purchase, day-to-day danger.

04:33.420 --> 04:44.420
What is the purpose of the communist party in the United States, to create a world world

04:44.420 --> 04:45.420
a communist world?

04:45.420 --> 04:53.420
He just told us this government and the form of government, and the changes to that of a communist

04:53.420 --> 05:00.420
government, that of a threat of the Duncan's and the May I, against a forty-five hundred

05:00.420 --> 05:09.420
million, back in 1848, as you know, how much of the Bible of the communist party, at that

05:09.420 --> 05:17.420
time, we got the position that part of the exercise to have a complete red dictatorship

05:18.420 --> 05:24.420
of the world. He just told us that the United States of England, who are just as

05:24.420 --> 05:31.420
as a bloody revolution of some sense, he just told us that part of the necessary to have

05:31.420 --> 05:39.420
a bloody revolution in all of the rest of the world, that we could create a communist

05:39.420 --> 05:46.420
dictatorship in the United States of England by any field of fighting, by a peaceful means

05:46.420 --> 05:47.420
of your will.

05:47.420 --> 05:52.420
I did have a first, as that occurred, no one nineteen forty in the United States of the

05:52.420 --> 06:00.420
world, no one nineteen fourteen Mr. Duncan, Michael A. Lanham, real world, in effect,

06:00.420 --> 06:08.420
real world, the Bible of the Soviet nation, forty-eight, that time, one of them felt that

06:08.420 --> 06:15.420
while Marx was right in 1848, a condition that changed this and that there was no

06:15.420 --> 06:22.420
makes in the United, that you could take over without a bloody revolution and Duncan,

06:22.420 --> 06:29.420
you've heard the words, people have heard we've marked one online, we marked one online

06:29.420 --> 06:36.420
and we marked the idea that they must create a communist dictatorship, modified by one

06:36.420 --> 06:45.420
under the effect of that must be done by violence, by bloodshed in every nation under

06:45.420 --> 06:49.420
the rule of the Soviet Union.

06:49.420 --> 06:56.420
Senator Underwood's direction was the map to which you have been referring to, by any other

06:56.420 --> 07:07.420
references to which you want to make to the map before you switch back in the Whitney's

07:07.420 --> 07:12.420
chair, Senator Mataji. No idea if you think that's going to be the greatest

07:12.420 --> 07:18.420
situation. I'd like to make a correct clear, Senator Duncan, but this map is just

07:18.420 --> 07:26.420
in for the far from the England plate. This is the fifty-way from the Rockway, as I

07:26.420 --> 07:36.420
said before, February 9, 1950, the time I made the wheeling piece, I found that many individuals

07:36.420 --> 07:46.420
named here as party organizers and shamans, apparently were figureheads.

07:47.420 --> 07:54.420
So, many ramifications of this, I expect me of no knowledge of what the other, for example,

07:54.420 --> 08:02.420
I couldn't take or pick out any state of random, pick out, we'll stay watching them

08:03.420 --> 08:11.420
in place. I would have no idea where the very topicals you have a headquarter for the

08:11.420 --> 08:21.420
astronaut's group of operate problems. This is just a general rough picture with the

08:21.420 --> 08:28.420
Duncan's, but the fifty-way from the Rockway was to give a picture of how through

08:28.420 --> 08:37.420
all the way they have, how through and how organized the United States, how through all their

08:37.420 --> 08:44.420
plans to take over a matter of the tremendous, significant formwork and conditions.

08:44.420 --> 08:54.420
There are many people who think that we can move side by side to come. They think that maybe

08:54.420 --> 09:02.420
as a 1951 or 1952, they're going to become people, or you say about that, Mr. Duncan, anyone

09:02.420 --> 09:12.420
who has followed the Communistism seriously, given a remote point, and I'm going to add two

09:12.420 --> 09:24.420
to that. There is no remote property of this war between today and the war, war between

09:24.420 --> 09:31.420
the movement, no remote possibility of the ending, except by a victory or by death for this

09:31.420 --> 09:37.420
civil rights. And then, including the Duncan's, I know I've lived from the coming of my friends

09:37.420 --> 09:47.420
to Red Marine Tom. And if a titler set up, very clearly, he was named the Dominator of

09:47.420 --> 09:53.420
Europe. There was always a federal and jokingly of the means for his plan. Well, they thought

09:53.420 --> 10:01.420
later they ran later after a great deal of bloodshed and that of the structure and the

10:01.420 --> 10:11.420
influence of the fact. And Mr. Duncan, the structure here is much longer, is much clearer,

10:11.420 --> 10:23.420
is run from 1848, up till the eighth day of June, 1954, because the war was declared by

10:23.420 --> 10:35.420
the government. We declared often, over by one, we declared a 1947 in the Italian football.

10:35.420 --> 10:43.420
We declared it, because by one car in his book in 1932, and there's no indication of

10:43.420 --> 10:49.420
it. It's too much to Duncan. They will have to keep up on Christmas. They will talk about

10:49.420 --> 10:57.420
wanting peace and want to work with us. But it's only so that they can regroup their

10:57.420 --> 11:03.420
fortune as they didn't plan as they will do throughout the world, unless until we win

11:03.420 --> 11:09.420
it, they will probably make it for the long after. There was a book before you sit down.

11:09.420 --> 11:19.420
I observed in various areas on that map, white spaces in which from one to several

11:19.420 --> 11:27.420
names, two major several names are written. Are they the actual names of Senator McCarthy,

11:27.420 --> 11:33.420
are communist, embarrassed levels of the communist organization in this country?

11:33.420 --> 11:43.420
Yes, for example, let's bring you again to the state of Washington now.

11:43.420 --> 11:51.420
This is not the case. Let's walk it up. Let's talk about it in a different day.

11:51.420 --> 11:56.420
Let's take the table Montana. Just Montana. That Lucid Chairman,

11:56.420 --> 12:02.420
the double top, definitely top. He was a communist party district chairman,

12:02.420 --> 12:14.420
taking the free space to Colorado, New Mexico, the party organizer,

12:14.420 --> 12:24.420
and we get very glad for this.

12:24.420 --> 12:32.420
Here we have the chairman, the ad web,

12:32.420 --> 12:36.420
Lucid, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Colorado,

12:36.420 --> 12:40.420
this is 25, the 25 of our fellow men,

12:40.420 --> 12:44.420
four top of five, 2691,

12:44.420 --> 12:50.420
four 929, 17th, 16th, and a lot of our current families,

12:50.420 --> 13:02.420
take the stuff down to the district that covers the ladder on part of California,

13:02.420 --> 13:08.420
communist party district 940, March 3, 1701,

13:08.420 --> 13:12.420
Pan-Fan-Futto, William Nighthvern, chairman,

13:12.420 --> 13:16.420
Louis Todd Spectatory, well, Nighthvern Edwin,

13:16.420 --> 13:20.420
and Victor Todd, and Austin, and Victor Delvett.

13:20.420 --> 13:24.420
Take down on the state of Texas,

13:24.420 --> 13:28.420
four top four, 85 Houston, Texas.

13:28.420 --> 13:32.420
There they don't have the chairman, the party organizer.

13:32.420 --> 13:36.420
Take down the state of Louisiana,

13:36.420 --> 13:39.420
room 417,

13:39.420 --> 13:43.420
guts are building, New Orleans, New Orleans,

13:43.420 --> 13:46.420
Louisiana, building golf,

13:46.420 --> 13:48.420
but no city hall will list.

13:48.420 --> 13:51.420
I don't think there will be much time on that.

13:51.420 --> 13:57.420
Over here, Mr. Jenkins, you'll find pretty likely individuals who are not assigned

13:57.420 --> 14:01.420
to any specific district,

14:01.420 --> 14:05.420
but who are assigned to specific staff.

14:05.420 --> 14:09.420
Take a quick example, Mr. Jenkins.

14:09.420 --> 14:18.420
We had before about five or six months ago,

14:18.420 --> 14:22.420
I believe it was before the MFFF Committee performed its not before July,

14:22.420 --> 14:24.420
the last year.

14:24.420 --> 14:33.420
We had an individual who was present about the two where they fought favoritists.

14:33.420 --> 14:36.420
Not ten years ago, not five years ago,

14:36.420 --> 14:39.420
but even a month ago.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.420
Building with firefoot walls and investments,

14:43.420 --> 14:49.420
where they taught the groom squad how to throw the hands in the air,

14:49.420 --> 14:53.420
how to an affectionate murder of an 18,

14:53.420 --> 14:57.420
and that's in the executive testimony of the committee.

14:57.420 --> 15:02.420
We have not made that public because we have an ask not to

15:02.420 --> 15:05.420
make the address of the buildings,

15:05.420 --> 15:08.420
or the testimony public,

15:08.420 --> 15:13.420
so we have not provided available to any member of the committee who wants to meet.

15:13.420 --> 15:15.420
Don't get your idea.

15:15.420 --> 15:20.420
But I get your idea, Mr. Chairman, of the fact that there's nothing so ethical.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.420
This is no theme at all.

15:23.420 --> 15:26.420
As of today, as of today,

15:26.420 --> 15:29.420
we can assume that those buildings,

15:29.420 --> 15:32.420
which are keeping sabotage and murder,

15:32.420 --> 15:37.420
as ever, they were from eight or nine months ago.

15:37.420 --> 15:43.420
We can assume they're doing the same thing as of today.

15:43.420 --> 15:47.420
Now, the privilege you feel is you have a claim

15:47.420 --> 15:51.420
that the significance of that map and the various types of nations on it.

15:51.420 --> 15:54.420
Incidentally, I think those definitions, whatever,

15:54.420 --> 15:59.420
where the state of Tennessee is indicated to any main,

15:59.420 --> 16:02.420
to any communist of any level,

16:02.420 --> 16:04.420
being in that particular area,

16:04.420 --> 16:06.420
that's right, Senator.

16:06.420 --> 16:08.420
You'd like to get that in the record.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.420
That's correct.

16:09.420 --> 16:14.420
Then there's now two come down and have a seat on the Wittling Sand.

16:14.420 --> 16:18.420
We are continuing with direct examination.

16:18.420 --> 16:23.420
I'd like to share a little lighter screen for the...

16:24.420 --> 16:28.420
...Venus that are very able to keep comfortable,

16:28.420 --> 16:31.420
I think, to put it in the significance.

16:31.420 --> 16:34.420
The communist party district of Alabama,

16:34.420 --> 16:38.420
out of the British post office, brought 1891,

16:38.420 --> 16:40.420
drumming here in Alabama,

16:40.420 --> 16:42.420
famine, famine, haul,

16:42.420 --> 16:44.420
like that they're ending bound,

16:44.420 --> 16:48.420
handle the Tennessee area.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.420
And, Nancy, and Mr. Dinkins,

16:51.420 --> 16:53.420
I'm one of the types,

16:53.420 --> 16:55.420
but you might want to discuss it for a minute.

16:55.420 --> 16:57.420
No, I don't think so.

16:57.420 --> 16:59.420
Don't think so. I'd like to have a seat.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.420
Now, we will refer on all about the other types.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.420
You can be sitting there for a year,

17:03.420 --> 17:05.420
and I have a great business here,

17:05.420 --> 17:08.420
but not for the two individuals,

17:08.420 --> 17:12.420
if it's science, but it is.

17:12.420 --> 17:15.420
I have a little teacher here,

17:15.420 --> 17:17.420
and you have that map,

17:17.420 --> 17:19.420
and you have a family,

17:19.420 --> 17:21.420
as we did this to your testimony,

17:21.420 --> 17:24.420
so that it is officially a part of your testimony.

17:24.420 --> 17:27.420
Well, we're very glad to have a lot of them.

17:27.420 --> 17:30.420
That's only a select number.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.420
The greatest one-minute service.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.420
I have to mention that.

17:36.420 --> 17:40.420
The number of parties,

17:40.420 --> 17:45.420
how do you regard the communist pickpick

17:45.420 --> 17:47.420
to our government

17:47.420 --> 17:50.420
as compared with other threats,

17:50.420 --> 17:54.420
with 50-kitties from frontiers?

17:54.420 --> 17:57.420
I evaluate that in a comparative sense.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.420
If you will,

17:58.420 --> 18:00.420
I think it's a scientific thing

18:00.420 --> 18:02.420
for the American people to know

18:02.420 --> 18:05.420
that there is a communist party in this nation.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.420
There's no something about its organization,

18:07.420 --> 18:09.420
it's set up.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.420
There's no something about

18:11.420 --> 18:14.420
this degree of danger,

18:14.420 --> 18:17.420
of the existence of such an organization,

18:17.420 --> 18:18.420
being able to mean

18:18.420 --> 18:20.420
to the expectation of those conclusions.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.420
That's certainly true,

18:22.420 --> 18:24.420
and I'm answering your question with the gentleman.

18:24.420 --> 18:28.420
I think I can both answer this one.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.420
The American 1848,

18:30.420 --> 18:32.420
that's one of the six years ago.

18:32.420 --> 18:35.420
You could number the members of the communist

18:35.420 --> 18:39.420
and stay with me on the fingers of both their hands.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.420
There are many great little progressions

18:41.420 --> 18:43.420
with number of important firms

18:43.420 --> 18:46.420
until 1917 and 18.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.420
The two of them organized

18:48.420 --> 18:51.420
some parties that hold the context.

18:51.420 --> 18:54.420
Then all of a sudden their membership,

18:54.420 --> 18:55.420
I should look at a membership,

18:55.420 --> 18:57.420
those under coming of domination

18:57.420 --> 19:00.420
and space to 180 minutes.

19:00.420 --> 19:04.420
Since 1917 and 1945,

19:04.420 --> 19:07.420
that figure stayed rather fast.

19:07.420 --> 19:10.420
It was 180 million.

19:10.420 --> 19:14.420
In 1945 and 1952,

19:14.420 --> 19:16.420
the figure suddenly jumped

19:16.420 --> 19:19.420
to the 18900 million.

19:19.420 --> 19:22.420
It keeps in mind that the entire world population,

19:22.420 --> 19:24.420
according to the estimates,

19:24.420 --> 19:26.420
we all have it around

19:26.420 --> 19:29.420
two billion to three hundred minutes.

19:29.420 --> 19:33.420
So we're getting very close to

19:33.420 --> 19:35.420
some distance playoff

19:35.420 --> 19:37.420
of one half of the world.

19:37.420 --> 19:40.420
And keep in mind that they are winning.

19:40.420 --> 19:41.420
They're not losing.

19:41.420 --> 19:44.420
Since 1950,

19:44.420 --> 19:46.420
January 1st, 1953,

19:46.420 --> 19:50.420
it's true they haven't increased their membership.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.420
I should say they haven't increased their domination

19:53.420 --> 19:55.420
in the world, anybody except.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.420
They have some examples in this kind of,

19:57.420 --> 19:58.420
but neither have it,

19:58.420 --> 20:00.420
it hasn't been decreased.

20:00.420 --> 20:03.420
And it's a thing that

20:04.420 --> 20:06.420
I think we must remember.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.420
This is a war

20:13.420 --> 20:16.420
with a brutalitarian force

20:16.420 --> 20:20.420
as one so a greater extent.

20:23.420 --> 20:25.420
The many brutalitarian force

20:25.420 --> 20:28.420
has won a war in the history of the world before.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.420
For example,

20:31.420 --> 20:33.420
50 units,

20:33.420 --> 20:34.420
which has been

20:34.420 --> 20:37.420
in existence for two thousand years,

20:37.420 --> 20:39.420
has not

20:39.420 --> 20:40.420
converted,

20:40.420 --> 20:44.420
converted nearly as many people

20:44.420 --> 20:48.420
as the tongue of brutalitarianism

20:48.420 --> 20:50.420
has enshrined

20:50.420 --> 20:52.420
in one hundred and six years.

20:52.420 --> 20:55.420
And they're not going to stop.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.420
I know that many of my good friends

21:00.420 --> 21:04.420
have been in this kind of a game.

21:04.420 --> 21:06.420
We can fight.

21:06.420 --> 21:09.420
As you can talk about communism

21:09.420 --> 21:12.420
or something,

21:12.420 --> 21:16.420
ten thousand miles away.

21:16.420 --> 21:18.420
Mr. Jenkins answered your question.

21:18.420 --> 21:22.420
Let me say it's right here with us now.

21:22.420 --> 21:25.420
If we and less we

21:25.420 --> 21:28.420
make sure that there's no end to the situation

21:28.420 --> 21:31.420
of our government,

21:31.420 --> 21:36.420
then jump to a certain age you're stuck there.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.420
In the period of our lives,

21:39.420 --> 21:43.420
you will see a red world.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.420
There's no question about this, Jenkins.

21:45.420 --> 21:48.420
And then I may have to say this,

21:48.420 --> 21:50.420
but I see you look at your watch, man.

21:50.420 --> 21:53.420
I have no discrimination to cut you off.

21:53.420 --> 21:56.420
And if you make this statement,

21:56.420 --> 22:01.420
I'm sure that everybody in this room

22:01.420 --> 22:04.420
hates communism.

22:04.420 --> 22:06.420
I'm sure that everybody in this room

22:06.420 --> 22:07.420
loves the army,

22:07.420 --> 22:09.420
the United States of America.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.420
It's about closing times.

22:11.420 --> 22:13.420
The things you have to be

22:13.420 --> 22:15.420
a month alarming and disturbing

22:15.420 --> 22:18.420
to the people's discrimination that we all love.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.420
I think that this time,

22:20.420 --> 22:23.420
I'm saying to my credit before I begin

22:23.420 --> 22:25.420
directly examining you

22:25.420 --> 22:27.420
with the controversy.

22:27.420 --> 22:30.420
And particularly with reference to your choices

22:30.420 --> 22:32.420
of some of the McCarthy and your staff

22:32.420 --> 22:35.420
against the army of the Secretary of the Army,

22:35.420 --> 22:38.420
which no doubt cannot begin until in the morning.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.420
But now,

22:40.420 --> 22:42.420
why do you have an audience that's perhaps

22:42.420 --> 22:45.420
20 or 30 million Americans?

22:45.420 --> 22:50.420
I want to ask you to make one statement, Senator.

22:50.420 --> 22:53.420
I'm not asking you to be here,

22:53.420 --> 22:55.420
I'm just concerned about the balance of the time,

22:55.420 --> 22:58.420
a lot of things that happen in the statements

22:58.420 --> 23:00.420
to the American people,

23:00.420 --> 23:02.420
telling them,

23:02.420 --> 23:06.420
they've gone in all it can experience

23:06.420 --> 23:10.420
of the communist party in the state of communism

23:10.420 --> 23:12.420
and the United States of America.

23:12.420 --> 23:14.420
I want you to,

23:14.420 --> 23:18.420
I want you to tell a major to this person

23:18.420 --> 23:21.420
or rather this request.

23:21.420 --> 23:26.420
Not what Senator McCarthy and the members of the state can do.

23:26.420 --> 23:29.420
Not what the Secretary of the Army and the members of the state

23:29.420 --> 23:30.420
can do, I mean,

23:30.420 --> 23:34.420
this to be the agency can do as an agency.

23:34.420 --> 23:38.420
But what the individual America,

23:38.420 --> 23:43.420
man, woman, child can do,

23:43.420 --> 23:45.420
the fight,

23:45.420 --> 23:48.420
the threat of communism

23:48.420 --> 23:56.420
and to do their best to make today the communist party in this country.

23:56.420 --> 24:01.420
I think the utilization of your crime and not respect

24:01.420 --> 24:03.420
will do well with that.

24:03.420 --> 24:04.420
Do you get my request?

24:04.420 --> 24:05.420
You want to get my deal with,

24:05.420 --> 24:07.420
I'm going to say,

24:07.420 --> 24:09.420
good request,

24:09.420 --> 24:11.420
rather unexpressive,

24:11.420 --> 24:14.420
and I wish I had more time to think it over

24:14.420 --> 24:17.420
but I will try and answer that.

24:17.420 --> 24:20.420
Number one, the average Americans

24:20.420 --> 24:22.420
in New Variable

24:22.420 --> 24:24.420
in profile

24:24.420 --> 24:26.420
of the Daging Communists,

24:26.420 --> 24:28.420
just been our agents

24:28.420 --> 24:31.420
out of our government in terms of.

24:31.420 --> 24:38.420
They must depend upon those of us who might come down here

24:38.420 --> 24:41.420
to man the watchtowers of the Navy.

24:41.420 --> 24:44.420
They must depend upon us for that.

24:44.420 --> 24:48.420
However, there is one very important thing that the American people can do,

24:48.420 --> 24:51.420
and if I'm in your place.

24:51.420 --> 24:55.420
I'm sure that you will recall Hitler's statement.

24:55.420 --> 24:57.420
He said,

24:57.420 --> 25:04.420
give me control of the reign of the youth.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.420
He said,

25:06.420 --> 25:07.420
I'm not sure if I told you for a bit,

25:07.420 --> 25:09.420
but in the fact he said,

25:09.420 --> 25:12.420
then I will let the firing of shots

25:12.420 --> 25:15.420
and call any nation on earth.

25:15.420 --> 25:17.420
That was his aim.

25:17.420 --> 25:21.420
To teach not theism in the schools,

25:21.420 --> 25:24.420
to make sure that

25:24.420 --> 25:27.420
that only was taught to the youth of the nation.

25:27.420 --> 25:30.420
Now, he learned that lesson well.

25:30.420 --> 25:37.420
The Communists have learned that lesson well also since the day.

25:37.420 --> 25:41.420
The thing that the American people can do is to

25:41.420 --> 25:44.420
be vigilant day and night

25:44.420 --> 25:47.420
to make sure they don't have time

25:47.420 --> 25:51.420
to teaching the sons and daughters of America.

25:51.420 --> 25:53.420
Now, I realize a few minutes,

25:53.420 --> 26:00.420
anyone tries to get a Communist out of a college out of university.

26:00.420 --> 26:02.420
They'll be raised before me,

26:02.420 --> 26:05.420
trying to surrender to the academic freedom.

26:05.420 --> 26:10.420
I would like to emphasize that there is no academic freedom

26:10.420 --> 26:13.420
for a Communist's concerns.

26:13.420 --> 26:16.420
He is not a free agent.

26:16.420 --> 26:18.420
He has no freedom of thought,

26:18.420 --> 26:20.420
no freedom of expertise.

26:20.420 --> 26:23.420
He must take his orders from Moscow

26:23.420 --> 26:28.420
or he will no longer be a member of the Communist Party.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.420
I must say,

26:30.420 --> 26:34.420
I don't care how much they steal the whole crack pot.

26:35.420 --> 26:41.420
Any professor or teacher might be as long as he or she is a free agent.

26:41.420 --> 26:45.420
But once, once you have this United States,

26:45.420 --> 26:49.420
from the Atlantic to the Pacific,

26:49.420 --> 26:52.420
covered with a network,

26:52.420 --> 26:56.420
a network of professors and teachers

26:56.420 --> 27:01.420
who are getting their orders from Moscow,

27:02.420 --> 27:05.420
from an organization that wants to destroy this nation,

27:05.420 --> 27:09.420
that wants to corrupt the minds of youth,

27:09.420 --> 27:12.420
then Mr. Jenkins,

27:12.420 --> 27:14.420
we are rapidly losing a battle.

27:14.420 --> 27:16.420
So I would say this,

27:16.420 --> 27:18.420
the thing the American people can do

27:18.420 --> 27:20.420
is to watch what's going on,

27:20.420 --> 27:21.420
but above all,

27:21.420 --> 27:23.420
what they should be careful of

27:23.420 --> 27:26.420
is not to go out half-cock

27:26.420 --> 27:29.420
because you'll fight me for the exact question.

27:29.420 --> 27:31.420
Not because they don't like,

27:31.420 --> 27:33.420
but some teacher is teaching,

27:33.420 --> 27:35.420
because they think you're too liberal,

27:35.420 --> 27:37.420
because they think you're too radical.

27:37.420 --> 27:38.420
Don't jump,

27:38.420 --> 27:40.420
they can close me to communist.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.420
But if they will keep,

27:43.420 --> 27:48.420
a wide open idea of night,

27:48.420 --> 27:50.420
and all of their schools,

27:50.420 --> 27:51.420
all the colleges,

27:51.420 --> 27:53.420
all the universities,

27:53.420 --> 27:55.420
and when they get information,

27:55.420 --> 27:58.420
which indicates that someone is actually a member

27:58.420 --> 28:00.420
of the communist university,

28:00.420 --> 28:03.420
send that into our FBI.

28:03.420 --> 28:06.420
I think that is one thing they can do

28:06.420 --> 28:07.420
that is more important

28:07.420 --> 28:09.420
or not more of a thing.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.420
I didn't intend to make a speech

28:11.420 --> 28:13.420
if you asked me a question which was possible to me too.

28:13.420 --> 28:15.420
One other thing,

28:15.420 --> 28:17.420
a little bit,

28:17.420 --> 28:18.420
about a minute or so,

28:18.420 --> 28:20.420
I just wanted the American people to know

28:20.420 --> 28:23.420
we're expecting a long time now

28:23.420 --> 28:25.420
to know that they're something

28:25.420 --> 28:27.420
that each of every individual

28:27.420 --> 28:29.420
in this nation can do about it.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.420
In addition to the very same,

28:31.420 --> 28:33.420
you know, discharge of that responsibility.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.420
And that's true, isn't it?

28:34.420 --> 28:36.420
Yes, there's one other thing Mr. Jenkins,

28:36.420 --> 28:37.420
which I think they can do.

28:37.420 --> 28:40.420
And I will trust that sometimes,

28:40.420 --> 28:42.420
just because I still believe

28:42.420 --> 28:46.420
the question half answered.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.420
One of them wants that

28:47.420 --> 28:49.420
that he will control China,

28:49.420 --> 28:52.420
and I can't put him in the prohibitive.

28:52.420 --> 28:54.420
He will control China,

28:54.420 --> 29:01.420
and the law of the nation will control the world.

29:01.420 --> 29:03.420
Mr. Hoover testified about a year ago

29:03.420 --> 29:04.420
or less than that,

29:04.420 --> 29:06.420
but one of the communist aims

29:06.420 --> 29:08.420
was to increase the shipment

29:08.420 --> 29:09.420
to which way it would match

29:09.420 --> 29:11.420
with China and China,

29:11.420 --> 29:14.420
but it won't have a shipment of materials

29:14.420 --> 29:20.420
to China in that area.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.420
And this is not a demographic problem

29:21.420 --> 29:23.420
or a Republican problem.

29:23.420 --> 29:27.420
I think the American people should remember,

29:27.420 --> 29:29.420
especially when we talk about the morale

29:29.420 --> 29:31.420
of our armed forces,

29:31.420 --> 29:34.420
but as of tonight,

29:34.420 --> 29:37.420
there are a size of a number

29:37.420 --> 29:41.420
of American uniform men,

29:41.420 --> 29:44.420
being brainwashed

29:44.420 --> 29:48.420
in communist bloodshade done.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.420
This is not my word.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.420
This is the word of our military

29:51.420 --> 29:53.420
that was given as a figure.

29:53.420 --> 29:55.420
September 10, 1953,

29:55.420 --> 29:58.420
that said 900 uniform men,

29:58.420 --> 29:59.420
two days later,

29:59.420 --> 30:00.420
the communist said

30:00.420 --> 30:02.420
we have 32 pair men,

30:02.420 --> 30:03.420
sat down over a man,

30:03.420 --> 30:04.420
sure he wants people to serve

30:04.420 --> 30:05.420
as a president of war.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.420
And I've heard of a situation

30:07.420 --> 30:11.420
and I've heard a lot of people can do about this.

30:11.420 --> 30:12.420
And again,

30:12.420 --> 30:13.420
I'm excited to see not a Democrat

30:13.420 --> 30:15.420
or a Republican matter.

30:15.420 --> 30:16.420
I think the American people

30:16.420 --> 30:18.420
that fall in the way,

30:18.420 --> 30:20.420
you like to say,

30:20.420 --> 30:21.420
Congress,

30:21.420 --> 30:23.420
all the congressmen,

30:23.420 --> 30:25.420
want to do the Senate,

30:25.420 --> 30:27.420
regardless of how they're going to vote

30:27.420 --> 30:29.420
Democrat or Republican,

30:29.420 --> 30:32.420
that out to hundreds of Congressmen

30:32.420 --> 30:34.420
says the military,

30:34.420 --> 30:37.420
if we send you to Washington,

30:37.420 --> 30:38.420
our unique,

30:38.420 --> 30:42.420
continues,

30:42.420 --> 30:44.420
sending American money,

30:44.420 --> 30:46.420
to nation,

30:46.420 --> 30:48.420

and not all the two of the things

31:05.420 --> 31:07.420
