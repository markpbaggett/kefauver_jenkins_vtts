02:25.960 --> 02:33.360
1 minute of Dr.arzadze, I want to get some of these

02:33.360 --> 02:40.360
I'm going to get some of these.

02:40.360 --> 02:47.360
Okay, let's do it.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.360
I believe that your full name is Joseph R. McCarthy.

02:51.360 --> 02:52.360
That is right.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.360
You need to introduce him to the state of the country.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.360
That is right.

02:57.360 --> 03:06.360
Joseph McCarthy, what official position do you hold with the coming of the meeting on government operation?

03:06.360 --> 03:07.360
Chairman.

03:07.360 --> 03:16.360
And what is your official position with this cut committee on education?

03:16.360 --> 03:21.360
Chairman of the committee, but not Chairman of the special committee that is not getting started.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.360
You are the chairman of the committee regularly?

03:24.360 --> 03:25.360
Yes.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.360
The rule is to stand this for the purposes of these hearings.

03:27.360 --> 03:34.360
You step down temporarily as chairman and will succeed by as a person acting chairman chairman months.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.360
That is right.

03:35.360 --> 03:39.360
When did you become chairman on the government operation?

03:39.360 --> 03:45.360
Well, what is the mechanism that you step down on as chairman that he is not a member of the special committee yet?

03:45.360 --> 03:48.360
And you say thereby, that is what it is.

03:48.360 --> 03:57.360
At the moment, I have the committee on the full committee and the full committee's footnote with the watch back on to still have taken place.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.360
I do not agree with the chair.

03:59.360 --> 04:06.360
I want to know if this was a very special committee, which is the regular standing full committee of the call investigation.

04:06.360 --> 04:11.360
Well, the chairman, therefore, will be placed so local to the purpose of these hearings.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
That is right.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
That is the correct.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.360
I have to confirm.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.360
That is for our basis and in the comments.

04:16.360 --> 04:23.360
My last question, Senator McCrathy, was, might not be to become chairman of this subcommittee.

04:23.360 --> 04:29.360
I can't say anything that I say to the secretary after a personalizing or a demonstration before.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.360
Earlier, the committee in the year 1953, that was right.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.360
Perhaps in January?

04:35.360 --> 04:37.360
Yes, we might.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.360
I have a date here of January 17, 1953.

04:41.360 --> 04:51.360
The program of office, too, was, what, social inquiries have you directed to the attention of your committee?

04:51.360 --> 04:54.360
The impression of your chairman, chief, obviously.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.360
Mr. Durkins, we have had a great number of inquiries.

04:58.360 --> 05:03.360
I believe the total is 450, so the situation is perfect.

05:03.360 --> 05:06.360
443, suffered inquiries.

05:06.360 --> 05:10.360
We have followed the rule of any senator.

05:10.360 --> 05:18.360
If anyone of any kind of voting makes a complaint, we check.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.360
And then it develops a fair amount of conditions.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.360
We are important to hold a call of hearing.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.360
I take it up for the committee.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.360
I assume I assume the gentleman's your refer to the hearings that we have in public.

05:31.360 --> 05:39.360
The first hearing I believe, the importance was the hearing on the information program,

05:39.360 --> 05:48.360
the fifth-partement information program, the filing system in the second department.

05:48.360 --> 06:00.360
The government funding office, I think one of the very important hearings we held was on the trade between the total of three nations

06:00.360 --> 06:07.360
and the communications, theifying red sign of a trade, the minority council, the major funds map.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.360
Let me recreate my question, Senator.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.360
What has been your interest in coming in?

06:13.360 --> 06:23.360
It's been on the both of you, of course, in the government and in the very thickings of the government.

06:24.360 --> 06:32.360
It has been a very deep investment to your judgment because I have felt strongly that,

06:32.360 --> 06:40.360
unless we come out of the coming and its current government, it is a great waste of time, money and blood.

06:40.360 --> 06:47.360
The time comes out from other parts of the South of Old, Adam and third, by the influence of the situation of coming in our government.

06:48.360 --> 06:56.360
I would like to bring up freedom of time to the time we became chairman of the government committee and the respect committee.

06:56.360 --> 07:03.360
You devoted a little of much time to the subject of coming in this country.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.360
Thank you very much, Mr. Duncan.

07:06.360 --> 07:13.360
They were there not on the floor of the city to make decisions with respect to communism,

07:13.360 --> 07:20.360
and particularly for the purpose of warming this country over the question of communists in the United States.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.360
I have Mr. Duncan along the floor of that.

07:23.360 --> 07:32.360
In my campaign in 1946, before I was elected to the Senate, I discussed the subject also, so nothing new by time to time.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.360
You position on communism then I take it as long as I'm senator.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.360
I think so.

07:39.360 --> 07:45.360
You decide to stay and there are good points to earn our identity to oppose each other.

07:45.360 --> 07:51.360
You're not one of the very heads of the head boy.

07:51.360 --> 07:57.360
You're not going to be the president, you're not the president.

07:57.360 --> 08:06.360
Then senator, you have made a special study of communism and the vote is much of your time and your energy.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.360
Do you have a question of coming in the United States?

08:09.360 --> 08:13.360
A great deal, Mr. Duncan.

08:13.360 --> 08:19.360
From the McCarthy, I think it is proper as this time, if you will, then so.

08:19.360 --> 08:25.360
The fellow members of the subject committee and the fellow in the American public,

08:25.360 --> 08:33.360
without going into human details, just what the fellow of the communist is.

08:33.360 --> 08:40.360
The committee was referenced as organization and its various levels in ramifications in this country.

08:40.360 --> 08:47.360
When you do that, Senator McKinney, I would like to know that Mr. Duncan, I construct my testimony on a very great deal.

08:47.360 --> 08:53.360
If I could use the map over here, I don't know where to put that, so the substance is,

08:53.360 --> 08:56.360
and the number of the committee can fit.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.360
If I could have some suggestions.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.360
When I will see a map over there and for the purpose of either the vacation,

09:01.360 --> 09:08.360
it is this is made into the top-owned party organization where it faced the way 1950.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.360
Is that the map to which you refer to the senator?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.360
Is that the map to which you now refer to as?

09:13.360 --> 09:16.360
Which you senator, please.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
I'm more than you.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.360
And for you, I'm the boy of it.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.360
I'm going to ask you a question.

09:22.360 --> 09:28.360
You do have to move here, or if you move here to map.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.360
Yes, I would like to move here to map as I discuss it.

09:32.360 --> 09:38.360
Mr. Duncan's, I don't know where, but I should be placed.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.360
The number of the committee can fit.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.360
The first and also first is the suggestion of Mr. McMill.

09:43.360 --> 09:47.360
What do you think about fitting either to a sovereign, or a stable, and any place available to me?

09:47.360 --> 09:54.360
I think it's a rather taken by truck and for the fact that I'll keep it that way.

09:54.360 --> 10:07.360
I think if you put it right on the right hand, I'll be moving more fast than once.

10:07.360 --> 10:16.360
You won't cut off the load and then you'll fall in on the regular bench.

10:16.360 --> 10:23.360
That's okay.

10:23.360 --> 10:28.360
I'll take it away.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.360
I'll take it away.

10:29.360 --> 10:33.360
Prepare the foot and we'll tell you your technical information.

10:33.360 --> 10:37.360
That is the reason you consider the table and that's the microphone.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.360
Are you saying to be proper?

10:39.360 --> 10:44.360
Well, I've got a good, a good calling voice, Mr. Chairman, and I think I can speak loudly enough

10:44.360 --> 10:48.360
so that the mic will pick it up.

10:48.360 --> 10:52.360
You'll see here, Mr. Duncan, they're now.

10:52.360 --> 10:59.360
You'll most be designated as part of the organization you have made.

10:59.360 --> 11:04.360
February 9, 19, 15, five is up 8,000, down here.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.360
Well, I picked up dates, Mr. Duncan, for two reasons.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.360
Number one, that is the date that I have made.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.360
Publicly, that's the discuss.

11:14.360 --> 11:20.360
The danger of the coming of controversy, that's just a separate discussion during the campaign.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.360
During the number of years.

11:21.360 --> 11:29.360
Number two, because as of now, that's running today, the customer will be prepared to move over,

11:29.360 --> 11:38.360
given last year, it's impossible to know what the outcomes of the various tips that are

11:38.360 --> 11:44.360
through the names of the various district leaders, because many of them have gone underground,

11:44.360 --> 11:50.360
from the oven, above all, half coming up with a convection.

11:50.360 --> 12:01.360
So I picked the February 9 date, that's paying the deferment for 32 districts.

12:01.360 --> 12:09.360
The man, the anecdote, before that, the ordered 12th of Moscow,

12:09.360 --> 12:14.360
they brought the Moscow to a tough coming of later.

12:14.360 --> 12:24.360
The name I couldn't give you up today, then to Papa Zoon as the National Committee,

12:24.360 --> 12:30.360
or the football that is now known as the National Board.

12:30.360 --> 12:40.360
You'll know, Commissioner, family names of the National Committee, William Foster's family,

12:40.360 --> 12:48.360
and William Foster has an embedded, he's been putting away a hearty element of thickness between

12:48.360 --> 12:56.360
the sides for one of the years, or about 15 years.

12:56.360 --> 13:01.360
At least, at least a thousand of the number of years, when you have moved these down,

13:01.360 --> 13:06.360
but the general secretary, there's a general secretary of government in the state,

13:06.360 --> 13:11.360
he has been convicted, got fall, national prosecutor, convicted,

13:11.360 --> 13:17.360
tangling Winston, ordained to a secretary of the president.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.360
We don't know where he is, but I think he has had any special,

13:21.360 --> 13:28.360
John William, from the Labour Secretary of the Convictors, over the various plans.

13:28.360 --> 13:34.360
At least, play the dozen of key of the play of this kind, right?

13:35.360 --> 13:42.360
Then they've convicted John, based convicted, they were seen off the convicted by the candidates.

13:42.360 --> 13:53.360
There he is, we don't know, Mr. Dengen, Erving Fultag, that's one of the three top boys in the party,

13:54.360 --> 14:02.360
Alfred and Victor. Robert Thompson, the Dengen recall that Robert Thompson was a candidate for some time,

14:02.360 --> 14:07.360
he was picked up in the someplace in the Sierra Mountains in California,

14:07.360 --> 14:13.360
a number of months ago about a year ago, I believe, the Italian tear of his looks,

14:13.360 --> 14:17.360
was hiding out, and directing the company's fight from there.

14:17.360 --> 14:24.360
Well, Victor, now Victor is down and I'm not sure if we can figure out some way,

14:24.360 --> 14:29.360
if this we have, we'll have to remember him of a district, I have no significance.

14:29.360 --> 14:35.360
I just remember the Marvick Carley, I don't know what if any number of the companies party had,

14:35.360 --> 14:38.360
they were 32 districts of that time.

14:38.360 --> 14:46.360
Now if they all come up to the chairman left, they'd named the chairman of the various districts,

14:46.360 --> 14:53.360
have little special significance because some of the conditions of the past time you desire district

14:53.360 --> 15:03.360
were individuals who were not named yet, what we have on this side are the individuals who are acting as parts,

15:03.360 --> 15:11.360
the social care of those of the coming of party that part of them above the wall.

15:12.360 --> 15:21.360
There was a big deal, the figures were the districts, I don't think one of the car like,

15:21.360 --> 15:26.360
district 25, 60 votes, and votes of three states.

15:26.360 --> 15:36.360
Under the district head, Act Bary, chairman, post office, twenty-fix twenty-one,

15:36.360 --> 15:42.360
also post office, act nine twenty-nine, thank you for that.

15:42.360 --> 15:48.360
Post office twenty-six ninety-one, our address, nine twenty-nine seventeen, state Denver, Colorado,

15:48.360 --> 15:55.360
Act Bary, chairman, now underneath by their work state committee,

15:55.360 --> 15:59.360
and keep them land if you will, with the guidance of the state committee,

15:59.360 --> 16:07.360
the rest can plan by any state plan, if they committee could flow over another state very well,

16:07.360 --> 16:10.360
when there would be so-called county committee.

16:10.360 --> 16:18.360
Now a county committee makes them both a one county, it might be composed of half a county of three or four times,

16:18.360 --> 16:28.360
and then there was the local cell, and there was the also the local industrial units,

16:28.360 --> 16:34.360
and the industrial units might be composed of two or three or five people,

16:34.360 --> 16:38.360
it seems a three or five of the favorite figures.

16:38.360 --> 16:43.360
Now in addition to this fact, I merely prepared this, Mr. Jenkins,

16:43.360 --> 16:47.360
so that we could get a picture of the type of organization there was,

16:47.360 --> 16:51.360
and if there's no matter what you have here, it's sabotage, you know.

16:51.360 --> 16:56.360
Take the example in the city, we'll say Milwaukee was coming,

16:56.360 --> 17:00.360
there's no question, the part there, our number of individuals,

17:00.360 --> 17:07.360
you know exactly where you saw a log chain or a steel cable,

17:07.360 --> 17:14.360
that cut off the electric power of the city, in case you're welcome to come here as well.

17:14.360 --> 17:20.360
Take the example, Mr. Damon, again using my state of the stunt,

17:20.360 --> 17:27.360
when you first know that there's a unit, there's no just where between, for example,

17:27.360 --> 17:32.360
Apple and the stunt, and what can go with stunt,

17:32.360 --> 17:38.360
they might say about a fine, a coughing of the lens of the telephone cable,

17:38.360 --> 17:43.360
where they might drop a bomb and cut out all telephone communication.

17:43.360 --> 17:47.360
And I'm Mr. Jenkins, the addition of the electric,

17:47.360 --> 17:57.360
if you see the line that there are the organization for two completely across the stunt class,

17:57.360 --> 18:02.360
they have to do with a regular, different type of,

18:02.360 --> 18:07.360
the regulatory, for example, here, Mr. Damon, Mr. Jenkins,

18:07.360 --> 18:16.360
we'll have to stick out a few at random,

18:16.360 --> 18:23.360
a bencomin for you, a for instance, the legal organization,

18:23.360 --> 18:30.360
this job was direct, the education was legal, this is all of the difference,

18:31.360 --> 18:38.360
here's the top man in that, and then there's our elder sponsor,

18:38.360 --> 18:44.360
the organization, for task with nothing fine, 20 particular districts,

18:44.360 --> 18:49.360
for task with, to include the entire ceiling of things.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.360
I'm a technicist, I'm a minister of security,

18:51.360 --> 18:54.360
I go out ahead, I'm a head secretary, I'm a head secretary,

18:54.360 --> 18:57.360
there's a member of the committee, then there's almost a sponsor,

18:58.360 --> 19:03.360
we're all for the organization, again nothing fine, 20 particular districts,

19:03.360 --> 19:09.360
but to the entire ceiling of things, and Andrew Under,

19:09.360 --> 19:14.360
the other two organizations, we're all for the,

19:14.360 --> 19:18.360
the head of the national security, the family,

19:18.360 --> 19:22.360
the logistics organizers for years, Tony Luffabick,

19:23.360 --> 19:29.360
organizers for the total area, Tony Luffabick,

19:29.360 --> 19:32.360
again feels, let me take this poll,

19:32.360 --> 19:36.360
this is Jason Zimmerman, who's the last couple days,

19:36.360 --> 19:40.360
and we'll, uh, link up the,

19:40.360 --> 19:44.360
camera, what I've, what level is this, the number three,

19:44.360 --> 19:48.360
and the big fellow secretary, who's got under different names,

19:48.360 --> 19:50.360
they're both interested,

19:50.360 --> 19:53.360
but in the last week they have an indictment.

19:53.360 --> 19:58.360
Uh, now, there's one other thing that might be a thumb in this,

19:58.360 --> 20:01.360
in 19th-stift days,

20:01.360 --> 20:04.360
the number of coming us in the United States,

20:04.360 --> 20:09.360
as the estimated number, over 54,174,

20:09.360 --> 20:12.360
and over there's an AIC at this point,

20:12.360 --> 20:17.360
how is that number 54,174 coming us in the United States?

20:17.360 --> 20:20.360
In 1950, arrived at that.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.360
That was from the testimony of Vager Hoover,

20:23.360 --> 20:27.360
and the estimated number of fellow travelers,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.360
five hundred and forty thousand,

20:29.360 --> 20:31.360
by fellow travelers, the four-time names,

20:31.360 --> 20:36.360
both were not under the discipline of Moscow,

20:36.360 --> 20:39.360
who were not found to take order,

20:39.360 --> 20:42.360
but individuals who are known to the coming of party,

20:42.360 --> 20:46.360
who are willing to carry out the work of the Communist Party,

20:46.360 --> 20:49.360
and the government should have,

20:49.360 --> 20:52.360
otherwise you will not be able to make a policy,

20:52.360 --> 20:55.360
you're fellow travelers, easy communists,

20:55.360 --> 20:57.360
and if not, public relationship.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.360
So, he's not a communist, uh, uh,

21:00.360 --> 21:03.360
the president comes from the,

21:03.360 --> 21:06.360
he's not under a communist party discipline.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.360
Let's say, for example, I am a lawyer,

21:09.360 --> 21:11.360
and let me give you an example,

21:11.360 --> 21:13.360
what they are in my right hand,

21:13.360 --> 21:15.360
I will associate the communist,

21:15.360 --> 21:20.360
I can be in accordance with former view,

21:20.360 --> 21:22.360
and please, for a good reason,

21:22.360 --> 21:25.360
a pact in re-attack,

21:25.360 --> 21:27.360
then you listen to me as a false traveler,

21:27.360 --> 21:29.360
but not a member of the Communist Party.

21:29.360 --> 21:32.360
I like you whether or not fellow travelers,

21:32.360 --> 21:41.360
are organized, are they just individuals scattered over the country?

21:41.360 --> 21:44.360
No, uh, good President and Mr. Dijkens,

21:44.360 --> 21:47.360
there is no tight organization so far,

21:47.360 --> 21:49.360
so fellow travelers are confined.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.360
For example, we know in the forum here,

21:52.360 --> 21:55.360
there are fellow travelers,

21:55.360 --> 21:58.360
who will speak as the communist,

21:58.360 --> 22:00.360
the President, please,

22:00.360 --> 22:03.360
who will like as the communist,

22:03.360 --> 22:06.360
the President, please.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.360
But they are not away from it,

22:09.360 --> 22:13.360
they can refuse, if not, and win, they will.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.360
It's a completely loose organization,

22:16.360 --> 22:21.360
from and from, um, fairly innocent people.

22:21.360 --> 22:27.360
How is the figure 540,000 representing the number of fellow travelers

22:27.360 --> 22:30.360
in the United States in the United States?

22:30.360 --> 22:33.360
What's the figure, Mr. Dijkens,

22:33.360 --> 22:37.360
and again, I've seen tonight people saying,

22:37.360 --> 22:39.360
you and Dijkens, who were told tales,

22:39.360 --> 22:40.360
I don't want to do that,

22:40.360 --> 22:42.360
but I must call him in the necessary,

22:42.360 --> 22:46.360
uh, Dijkens, who were, have testified on rules

22:46.360 --> 22:48.360
of the February communist,

22:48.360 --> 22:51.360
every minute and there are disciplines and musts,

22:51.360 --> 22:54.360
so I roughly can, unless it's up after that,

22:54.360 --> 22:56.360
fellow travelers, who do their work,

22:56.360 --> 22:58.360
and they are sent with the Denkens,

22:58.360 --> 23:02.360
if you only have, if you only have the 54,000 communists,

23:02.360 --> 23:05.360
you can block out the fellow travelers.

23:05.360 --> 23:10.360
Then we get 6, not 4 easily, these days.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.360
These are the fellow travelers,

23:12.360 --> 23:18.360
the Denkens, a good prospect for membership in the communist party

23:18.360 --> 23:22.360
by reason of his communist regime.

23:22.360 --> 23:26.360
Would you say, uh, he might be a good prospect, Mr. Dijkens,

23:26.360 --> 23:28.360
and probably a thickly-throw-all way,

23:28.360 --> 23:30.360
I assume you would please like to get up.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.360
He might be a good prospect for the next few months,

23:33.360 --> 23:36.360
he might be a good prospect for the next few months,

23:36.360 --> 23:42.360
but the communist party is not aiming for a vast number of them.

23:42.360 --> 23:45.360
As I said over and over and over,

23:45.360 --> 23:48.360
we were policy not-quantant.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.360
They want, from that,

23:50.360 --> 23:56.360
the most communist, the most fussed in any of the already,

23:56.360 --> 23:58.360
and who do their bidding at all times,

23:58.360 --> 24:00.360
as far as numbers are concerned,

24:00.360 --> 24:02.360
they don't want to be great number.

24:02.360 --> 24:06.360
Our next supporter will not be a number of communist,

24:06.360 --> 24:12.360
and the orders from Moscow is increasing or decreasing in the country.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.360
So, 1950, it's pretty decreasing,

24:15.360 --> 24:17.360
but, for example, 1935,

24:17.360 --> 24:21.360
1954, in 1954,

24:21.360 --> 24:26.360
the aftermath of the Cypher over 25,000,

24:26.360 --> 24:28.360
that means a couple of hands.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.360
It is that I'm going to do,

24:30.360 --> 24:33.360
should that be taken as the force of comfort,

24:33.360 --> 24:36.360
the bad people of this nation or not?

24:36.360 --> 24:38.360
No, no, no, no, Mr. Dagen, why not?

24:38.360 --> 24:43.360
Because they are tightening up their organ effects.

24:43.360 --> 24:46.360
The results of the, for example,

24:46.360 --> 24:50.360
the fist hearings conducted by the Chairman of the Committee of the Government,

24:50.360 --> 24:54.360
both by the Nixon, other hearings that closed communist,

24:54.360 --> 24:57.360
they've drilling the drilling from,

24:58.360 --> 25:00.360
or how many were drilled,

25:00.360 --> 25:06.360
at least something, two, in 1948.

25:06.360 --> 25:11.360
The daily of those terminus has followed some to fight up their organ impressions,

25:11.360 --> 25:15.360
and make sure that only got they be able to terminus for also one reason,

25:15.360 --> 25:22.360
Mr. Dagen's why the number of drops is because the communist has been more and more disturbed

25:23.360 --> 25:30.360
by the FBI agents who have under the forties of the FBI,

25:30.360 --> 25:35.360
has been both righted and become members of youth throughout the country.

25:35.360 --> 25:40.360
But now they're being very, very careful about a new member,

25:40.360 --> 25:47.360
and they're giving the communist party the son of the dog in kicking out any of the present members.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
Thank you.
