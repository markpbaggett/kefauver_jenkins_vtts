00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Returning from East Tennessee, where he had taken his family for the summer, Senator

00:04.400 --> 00:06.400
Keith Harvard launched into a busy week.

00:06.400 --> 00:11.560
In addition to participating in the stepped-up legislative schedule, Senator Keith Harvard

00:11.560 --> 00:15.880
presented a mini session of the Senate committee investigating organized crime and interstate

00:15.880 --> 00:20.240
commerce, before leading at weeks end to address the Memphis chapter of the Atlantic

00:20.240 --> 00:24.640
Union committee, and to dedicate the new Lotterville County Hospital of Ripley.

00:24.640 --> 00:29.640
And along with the rest of us, Senator Keith Harvard kept one-hound three-in-situation.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.680
Senator, I'll start off this quiz by asking you the $64 question, which seems to be

00:34.680 --> 00:36.680
up-emotioned by his mind these days.

00:36.680 --> 00:40.680
You think we are nearing open warfare for the Soviet Union?

00:40.680 --> 00:43.680
Our chartered leaders from Coral Reload certainly not good.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.520
General McArthur has called for a comeback to the vision of Marines, and we have the feeling

00:48.520 --> 00:50.520
of situation it's taking in time.

00:50.520 --> 00:54.520
But an old Army general seeks help stop from the Marines.

00:54.520 --> 00:59.520
This action by General McArthur has had the effect of shaking us back into reality.

00:59.520 --> 01:04.520
Those of us who had the notion of first glance of the United Nations forces, the force

01:04.520 --> 01:08.520
will fix the invading North Korean attackers back, will not take another look.

01:08.520 --> 01:13.520
The heavily armed and highly mechanized North Korean companies have been moving forward

01:13.520 --> 01:18.520
with incredible speed and overrun the South Korean defenses.

01:18.520 --> 01:23.520
So far as a full scale shooting war with Russia is concerned, we have no reason to foresee

01:23.520 --> 01:25.520
that possibility as yet.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.520
I was glad that we determined the offer of assistance of 30,000 troops of nationalist China.

01:30.520 --> 01:35.520
The thing to me that the use of General Shanghai's military forces would open the way for the

01:35.520 --> 01:40.520
Kremlin, bring all the communist China troops into play of the Korean company.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.520
It is certainly the hope that a full-dressed war can be avoided shortly.

01:44.520 --> 01:50.520
I guess there is no man in the world as the military's son of the party say a few minutes ago.

01:50.520 --> 01:55.520
We can foresee what the men of the government have in mind whether they are going to let this be

01:55.520 --> 02:00.520
a localized situation or whether they are going to let it precipitate World War III.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.520
We can only wait and see.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.520
What is your information center?

02:05.520 --> 02:10.520
Do you ask the detainment to bring the Korean War to a successful conclusion?

02:10.520 --> 02:17.520
Well, of course the North Korean Communist have driven and have motorized the equipment very deep in the South Korean.

02:17.520 --> 02:23.520
We will post these advances with ground troops and supporting heavy equipment for a take some time.

02:23.520 --> 02:32.520
Our military leaders, very hard in mind, they are opening up a stock of front-bath and Marines on the LSC after the communist line of communication has gone wrong.

02:32.520 --> 02:39.520
I would say that official sources in Washington expected to take us at least six months to drive the invaders back across the 38th.

02:40.520 --> 02:47.520
But of course all that depends upon whether it is going to be localized or in general.

02:47.520 --> 02:56.520
Senator, I had to express this idea aloud before but all along I had to feel in that perhaps the Korean incident is a blessing in disguise.

02:56.520 --> 03:01.520
The reason I pose that question now is if Mr. Winston Churchill had his Mr. Savior in the week.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.520
Well, I saw Mr. Churchill sleeping with two drivers.

03:04.520 --> 03:13.520
I got it that people leave that this event brought us no nearer to war and may have even paved the way to indicate a mechanism that would keep his peace long.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.520
I share that feeling to some extent.

03:16.520 --> 03:22.520
Because I have been staying in the Senate for some months now, we are tripling with destiny to foolishly waste time.

03:22.520 --> 03:33.520
All the evidence we see at the moment is that the three peoples of the world are united, the wages to meet the threat of truth, peace get on, and vigilant to the possibilities of breaking the peace.

03:34.520 --> 03:41.520
But of course we wasted time and we had time. We won, we were unprepared when we were taken once again by the trials.

03:41.520 --> 03:48.520
The events in Korea demonstrate that we cannot expect Russia to keep our paper promises within the United Nations.

03:48.520 --> 03:57.520
But at the same time it has been shown that underlying the United Nations' paper work is a determination of three people who seek unprovoked aggression.

03:58.520 --> 04:04.520
We could see arising from the terrible experience in Korea as genuine international police force.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.520
This would certainly be a historical development.

04:07.520 --> 04:21.520
The designation of a supreme UN commander and the flying of the UN flag over joint forces in Korea would break many precedents and enable us to clean up the messages such as we now find in Korea immediately in the future.

04:22.520 --> 04:30.520
So we may say at this point that as it is that the Korean battlefield may force the three people of the world to unify on a practical basis.

04:30.520 --> 04:35.520
What nations are participating with us in the Korean campaign center?

04:35.520 --> 04:41.520
A great Britain, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, and other forces are already cooperating.

04:41.520 --> 04:47.520
All the other governments representing a billion people have united to crusade against unprovoked aggression.

04:48.520 --> 04:54.520
Our American troops and officers are in the forefront, but they will not stand alone for long.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.520
It was somewhat ironical that our fighting name were depending the liberty of the free world.

04:59.520 --> 05:06.520
At the same time the United States was celebrating its 174th birthday as a free nation of the world.

05:06.520 --> 05:13.520
Yes, Charlie, we're fighting for liberty and independence and struggle that will mean much to mankind in 1950.

05:13.520 --> 05:21.520
Just as our founding fathers fought for that idea 170 years ago, the stakes are high and the victory will not be easy.

05:21.520 --> 05:36.520
But I am persuaded that a great part of the conflict was won when three people determined to face the challenge on the basis of moral courage and have principle rather than seeking relief through appeasement backing off and tempering.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.520
Do you find any comparison between the Kremlin and the Hitchner Regime?

05:40.520 --> 05:43.520
Well, of course we do, it's quite apparent.

05:43.520 --> 05:48.520
A Stalin and his full hearts are following the historic pattern of all aggressive dictators.

05:48.520 --> 05:53.520
Dictators always strike when the opposing forces are divided and demoralized.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.520
When they feel like a kind of escaped United armed resistance.

05:57.520 --> 06:04.520
The only difference between the present pattern and those we witnessed in the 25-year armistice between the two recent world wars

06:04.520 --> 06:11.520
is that the aggressors waited longer after 1918 and they did after 1945.

06:11.520 --> 06:19.520
What a new opinion would prevent another aggressive actions on the part of President or teacher, aggressive center?

06:19.520 --> 06:26.520
Well, it seems to me that we must be in a position to stand together and act together and calling the bluff of aggressors.

06:26.520 --> 06:31.520
He is in peace, meal, action, or an insufficient answer to the problem.

06:31.520 --> 06:37.520
To be effective and successful, our standing together and acting together must be grounded in law.

06:37.520 --> 06:43.520
And we've been united in law with other three people, the communists, but never have risked the Korean invasion.

06:43.520 --> 06:51.520
If we unite or even begin to unite in federation now, the Kremlin will order no further aggression in my opinion.

06:51.520 --> 06:57.520
Aggressors prey upon the weak and divided, never on the strong and the united.

06:57.520 --> 07:06.520
Thirty years ago, or almost that long at the University of Tennessee, when I played football, I learned a great truth that the best defense is a good offense.

07:06.520 --> 07:12.520
If we will take up the offense now, no dictator will be able to arrest our freedom fronts.

07:12.520 --> 07:21.520
The emergence of a powerful, prosperous, and expanding federation of three people all over the world, of course the communist leaders on the defensive.

07:21.520 --> 07:29.520
Even though it would not apply their difficulties in maintaining control over the subjugated people, millions of people who were fired at freedom today.

07:29.520 --> 07:33.520
Thank you for those profanon observations, Senator.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.520
During the worst we received the return from the census.

07:36.520 --> 07:43.520
At a Tennessee fire center, well Tennessee gained over 366,000 in population in the past decade.

07:43.520 --> 07:50.520
Charlie, we now have 3,283,730 people in the Great Ball and Tears state.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.520
How does that figure out their percentage?

07:53.520 --> 07:57.520
I believe that represents an increase of 12.24%.

07:57.520 --> 08:05.520
Was the increased statewide in school, well six of the time congressional districts registered increases in population,

08:05.520 --> 08:11.520
as in more than half of the counties of the state, but 42 counties lost in population.

08:11.520 --> 08:16.520
Of course as we expected, the greatest gain was an undersea county where Oak Ridge is located.

08:16.520 --> 08:23.520
Oak Ridge is now the fifth largest city in Tennessee, and undersea county has more than doubled in population.

08:23.520 --> 08:31.520
The great city of Memphis gained over 100,000, but the gains in Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville were less in proportion

08:31.520 --> 08:36.520
and any precincts reflected in the respective counties in which these cities are low people.

08:36.520 --> 08:41.520
What are the leading cities in Tennessee from the population, B4, and undersea,

08:41.520 --> 08:43.520
these nose county reports, Senator?

08:43.520 --> 08:48.520
Well, unless the Memphis is of course the largest followed by Nashville,

08:48.520 --> 08:54.520
then comes my home city of Chattanooga, then Knoxville and Oak Ridge.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.520
The accent with 30,000 is the next west Tennessee metropolis.

08:58.520 --> 09:03.520
Then we swing back to Upper East Tennessee for Johnson City, things for the briskers.

09:03.520 --> 09:09.520
By the way, Bristol is larger than Oak Ridge if you consider both Bristol, Virginia, and Tennessee.

09:09.520 --> 09:16.520
The tenth largest in the municipality is Chattanooga, and middle Tennessee was slightly more than 16,000.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.520
Which district, district's large population?

09:19.520 --> 09:25.520
The fourth and the seventh and the two rural west Tennessee districts, the eighth and the ninth.

09:25.520 --> 09:29.520
Speaking of the eighth district where I live, Senator, if my members seriously,

09:29.520 --> 09:34.520
we have fewer people today and the day 30 years ago, I can read count for that.

09:34.520 --> 09:40.520
Well, I certainly wasn't anything derogatory of the section of the people who lived there,

09:40.520 --> 09:42.520
of the fertility of the soil.

09:42.520 --> 09:47.520
The best explanation I know to offer is that the greatest increases came in the sections

09:47.520 --> 09:52.520
where we were achieving a better balance between agriculture and manufacturing.

09:53.520 --> 10:00.520
As in the fourth, seventh, eighths and ninth districts have not seen as great an industrial growth as the other six districts.

10:00.520 --> 10:07.520
You see in the past 15 years, the number of manufacturing establishments in Tennessee is more than double.

10:07.520 --> 10:13.520
And we have approximately 100,000 more work-reason industrial plants now than we did in 1933.

10:13.520 --> 10:19.520
Much of this expansion has occurred in East Tennessee and Memphis and Nashville.

10:19.520 --> 10:26.520
And also in Chaléa, we know that the people mechanized equipment and agriculture and on the farms.

10:26.520 --> 10:31.520
The farms, something they don't need as many people do, take care of them as they sit in the past.

10:31.520 --> 10:37.520
The speaking of increases as you were, how has farming been advanced in that same period?

10:37.520 --> 10:44.520
Well, our choice, farm income in 1948 was more than $508 million.

10:44.520 --> 10:48.520
An increase of about 700 percent over 1932.

10:48.520 --> 10:53.520
Of course, in 1932, farm was selling to 45 cents a push on.

10:53.520 --> 10:58.520
And the average price in 1948 was $1.39 a cents a push on.

10:58.520 --> 11:03.520
One of the happy signs is that our Tennessee farmers are paying off their mortgages.

11:03.520 --> 11:10.520
In the past 17 years, we have seen Tennessee farmers pay off more than $15 million in farm mortgages.

11:10.520 --> 11:15.520
But another happy sign too is the development of rural electrification.

11:15.520 --> 11:20.520
The RAA is certainly a far-in thing in Tennessee for rural life.

11:20.520 --> 11:27.520
Back in 1935, when this focus started and when they shortly after the TBA got underway,

11:27.520 --> 11:31.520
only 4 percent of our farms had electric power.

11:31.520 --> 11:41.520
Today, 65 and 8 cents per cent, almost 6 to 6 percent of all Tennessee farms have electricity with all the benefits it's doing.

11:41.520 --> 11:46.520
I didn't mean to get us into all these things, it's Charlie, but it's a good one.

11:46.520 --> 11:51.520
But it's good every now and then to stop and take the stuff and just what you do.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.520
I'm sure that I think Tennessee is certainly what you have to say.

11:55.520 --> 12:00.520
By the way, we've had several inquiries about the Fish and Wildlife Program

12:00.520 --> 12:04.520
that we promised to get folks to Tennessee South Canada. What happened to it?

12:04.520 --> 12:08.520
Well, like the timely schedule, that program is to Albert Day,

12:08.520 --> 12:12.520
the director of the Fish and Wildlife, without the city.

12:12.520 --> 12:18.520
We hope to have Mr. Day up here real soon, now Charlie, perhaps on the next broadcast.

12:18.520 --> 12:24.520
There's a great deal of enthusiastic interest in hunting, fishing and other farm directorations,

12:24.520 --> 12:28.520
since the TBA created such wonderful facilities in our state.

12:28.520 --> 12:34.520
Please note that some of our listeners were interested enough to remind us of our promise.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.520
We'll make the delivery very, very soon.

12:37.520 --> 12:42.520
How does it guarantee that the bulls seem to be possible?

12:42.520 --> 12:47.520
But right now it's impossible to say, of course, when Congress may have done it.

12:47.520 --> 12:54.520
We have been shooting at July 31, August 15th, at the Dirtman Day,

12:54.520 --> 12:59.520
but until some break, there were one way or another in the four-real situation.

12:59.520 --> 13:03.520
I'm satisfied that Congress will not adjourn.

13:03.520 --> 13:10.520
What we may do is to finish up the most important business that's on the schedule at the present time,

13:10.520 --> 13:14.520
and then TBA is scattered in the congressional force and operations,

13:14.520 --> 13:17.520
so that Congress can come back and take the blame.

13:17.520 --> 13:23.520
And we are breaking to see without having to keep Paul back for a special session by the present.

13:23.520 --> 13:29.520
In the meeting of the armed services committee on yesterday,

13:29.520 --> 13:32.520
the general situation was discussed.

13:32.520 --> 13:41.520
I put the armed services committee is going to make some investigation as to why we didn't have sufficient military material

13:41.520 --> 13:45.520
in the specific meeting at the time of the meeting,

13:45.520 --> 13:49.520
but at that time they expressed another number to the armed services committee,

13:49.520 --> 13:54.520
while we would stay here until come break to one way or another in the present conflict.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.520
Thank you. Thank you for asking people.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.520
In the present gentleman, you have heard the 26th,

13:58.520 --> 14:03.520
next series of weekly reports by Senator S. Steve Paulver from your center of the South of New Washington.

14:03.520 --> 14:08.520
Probably brought to you as a public service at the expense of the station which you are now listed.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.520
We invite you to be keen in the next week at the same time as Senator Steve Paulver,

14:12.520 --> 14:14.520
who will sign with his next success.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.520
So at the end of this trial, I need to keep the integration of this office in the relations capital

14:18.520 --> 14:20.520
and we're trying to use the word of this.
