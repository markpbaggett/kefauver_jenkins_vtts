00:00.000 --> 00:10.920
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, this is the second telecast, bringing you the

00:10.920 --> 00:14.720
news from Washington, which I'm very honored to present.

00:14.720 --> 00:19.680
And on this occasion, I would be very happy to have with us the distinguished member of

00:19.680 --> 00:25.360
Congress of Tennessee from the fourth congressional district, the honorable Joe Evans.

00:25.360 --> 00:29.840
Joe, it was that beginning as a term as a member of the House of Representatives.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.960
He is a member of the Appropriations Committee.

00:32.960 --> 00:37.400
And I wanted to tell all of you people of Tennessee, not only of you, a post district,

00:37.400 --> 00:44.600
Joe, but everyone that you are, very hardworking, effective, member of the House of Representatives.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.280
And we certainly are glad to have you here.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.280
And you know, you're in the middle of the conversation.

00:48.280 --> 00:56.600
I came up here in 1933 and March, before the passage of the Elaine Document to the

00:56.600 --> 00:58.760
inauguration of President Roosevelt.

00:58.760 --> 01:02.840
And of course, we're all here doing this kind of inauguration.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.840
I haven't talked to you people since then.

01:04.840 --> 01:10.840
You know, there was snow and slash in the coal whims, most of us called bad coal.

01:10.840 --> 01:18.160
But I don't think there has been as much enthusiasm or as large a crowd, instead of the

01:18.160 --> 01:23.360
weather in town as there was for Mr. Kennedy's inauguration.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.800
The answer was a great, non-porn, with people's model of the country.

01:26.800 --> 01:31.020
And we were certainly privileged to have a great number of our fans from Tennessee, with

01:31.020 --> 01:34.560
a truly great inauguration, a great occasion, and we lived through the snow.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.640
And we had bad energy to do the birds.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.640
And too much.
