WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
But these people sense them.

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
They don't know where the snow and the slash and the coal whims and most of us called bad

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
coal.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
I don't think there has been as much enthusiasm or as large a crowd in spite of the coal

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
weather in town as there was for the Mr. Kennedy's inauguration.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
It was a great on-point and a good point of view of the country and we were certain

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
that we had a great number of our fans from Tennessee.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
It was a truly great inaugural, a great occasion and we lived through the snow.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
We had three bands from Tennessee and other states had one so we got to all edge on.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Let me mention a couple of those outstanding bands from the four district of Tennessee from the

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
University of Seoul, that's Suwani and also the Mokersberg band.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
They were very proud of them.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
I won the draw and they had a band and Mars town.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
I promised the people at Mars town that they were very excellent band could be invited to

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
march in the parade.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
They won the National Honors last year.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
But if there only wanted one for one state so I got Jigs Dunnay here to parade chairman

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
let them march in place of the Virgin owls which didn't send a band up here.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Tennessee played a big part.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
I had the feeling that during inauguration it was been happening since 1933 even.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
President Roosevelt took over.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Of course there was a tremendous domestic recession and depression at that time.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Always not well over the mystic.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
But we do have a great international problems and then as now it is a time for great leadership

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
and a firmative action.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
I think our president has been showing that in his inaugural address.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I mean this message is to the Congress don't you?

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
Yes, the president delivered a great inaugural address and I think all of us at the Congress have been impressed

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
with the great speech which he delivered before the joint session of the Congress.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
His first message on the state of the union.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Well I thought that this speech had the state of justice he saw it without missing any words

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
without trying to cover over anything.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
The pictures he saw at the day economically.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
That is that we have a lot of bad situations that we have to but they're not hopeless.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
And then in the international affairs and among the nations of the world we have lost some standing.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
There has been some deterioration that fair again with leadership,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
with sacrifice that we can think about a better condition.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
I thought it was a very forthright fine assessment.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
And after all the American people ought to know exactly where we stand.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
Well certainly he discussed domestic issues but he greatly appointed up a trouble spots in the world

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
and indicated that America would not be second to the nation in power and strength.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
It was a message of security and national defense.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
The president has certainly as a precise mind and a factual knowledge of a grasp of things

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
and all of these reaching through to the public and his views.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Or from a program with Congress.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
Well I thought not only in the state of the union message as well as a novel message of this.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I don't know what he had to say but the force of which he delivered his speech.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
The dedication and the cheers you in sincerity.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
As things you know that the president, John F. Kennedy and I were classmates together

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
and we came to Congress at the same time and my classmate has now become president.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
1946, 1946.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
I was there with you in 1946 and 1947 and I came over to the Senate and to your classmate.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Yes, join us and I remember that with our member.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
At first session when you and I served together in the House I didn't get to see you very much.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
You were campaigning for the Senate.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Well you know you have to do that sometimes.

03:54.000 --> 04:03.000
Well I have a feeling also that similar to what we had in 1933 that we have a lot of new faces around.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
A lot of young people with vision.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And you frontier.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
And you frontier and who wanted to sing that song said the country is in the best of hands.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Is that David Crocket?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Good day.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
All in all there are a lot of our fine, capable young men and women who have come into government service

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
with great dedication many of them making sacrifices.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
And I feel that by and large Mr. Kennedy has gotten very good men to advise and work with them.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Certainly he has surrounded himself with some very good men.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
Even the former president has committed him on a selection of his cabinet and said that he was and he had been able to attract some of these very outstanding men.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
It is assistance and any kind of men nominated.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
And I think that is a just spotler who used to be General Counsel for the Tennessee Valley Authority to be chairman of the Federal Power Commission.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
And a very significant selection.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
I was very pleased that the president select them to become chairman.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It was very important to have a commission.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
He comes from Nashville where he has been practicing law since he left the TVA in Africa.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
He is a fair man.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I think he is horseful.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I think he has the viewpoint of the consumer.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And believe me we have been meeting that viewpoint and federal power.

05:12.000 --> 05:21.000
As you know, the operation of the Federal Power Commission among all of the independent agencies as the one who is least functioning properly in the public interest.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
In the last few years it administers the natural gas act and the granting of franchises on the construction of great power dams the alternation.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
It is a very important commission.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I think Mr. Switzer will make a very excellent chairman.

05:33.000 --> 05:43.000
Of course there has been a whole lot of men here in the last few days about the violent and house of representatives over the change in the rules committee.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
And you have been right there where it has been taking place where the fire has been going on.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
So tell us about what the shootings are all about.

05:53.000 --> 06:03.000
As you know, at the beginning of each new session of the Congress, both the House and the Senate adopt rules of procedure for their individual bodies.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
The House has already adopted for the 87th Congress the same rules of procedure as were employed in the 86th Congress.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
But while adopting the same rules, we have been evaluating and considering the operations of the committee whether it has been written through the functioning.

06:18.000 --> 06:28.000
The real issue and the rules committee was whether or not the elected representatives of all the people, the entire House should have a right to work its will.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Where they should have a right to vote on legislation.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
A very small group or a handful or a small minority voted 12.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Well, even 203 whether vote could tie up a legislation.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
It has been charges that bills have been phishing hold that have been a real block and even vetoed.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And certain legislation has not been permitted to reach the floor of the House.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
Now, let us take a bill that has been debated for weeks and for months before a standing legislative committee of the Congress.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
After the bill has been discussed, publicans have been heard and the majority of the membership vote upon a bill.

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
Then the function of the rules committee is to orderly proceed on to the floor with measures for the House to debate and consider.

07:12.000 --> 07:22.000
If it has started in the time and the day and the hours and the numbers of bills that will flow on to the floor, they schedule them as they're trafficked to pass along.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
The rules committee is not supposed to be a dead end street.

07:25.000 --> 07:34.000
It is supposed to be a committee to orderly permit legislation to come on to the floor for debate and consideration.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Now, there has been instances of which maybe there are many bills that shouldn't pass.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
I am there in the past, I have voted for a rule to bring the bill on the floor to debate it, which is democratic.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
It certainly is democratic to have a prediscation of a measure, even controversial measures.

07:51.000 --> 08:00.000
But then after the bill was debated, after it was possibly amended and made noxious, I would vote against it on final passage.

08:00.000 --> 08:09.000
But the real issue of whether the four elected representatives should have a right to debate and to the vote upon legislation,

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
although there are a few of very small minority should walk legislation and deny the House the right to exercise its will.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
It certainly will house the elected representatives of the people should have a right to vote upon legislation.

08:22.000 --> 08:30.000
The rules committee is not a committee to legislation, it's a administrative committee, it's an all of the leadership historically.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
It's a good, good, good leadership.

08:33.000 --> 08:45.000
Well, Joe, thank you very much for telling us about the issue and certainly if we're going to get a new program over the entire membership of the House of Representatives all to have a chance to vote.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
My committee on appropriations has 50 members and the membership of this committee has been increased since I've been here.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
The rules committee used to be composed of five members.

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
And the last few years, I've said along the way, which is an even number, can do so to a tie vote, 66.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
So there have been a lot of tie votes and legislation has not reached the floor.

09:10.000 --> 09:23.000
So it's nothing unusual to change a committee of the Congress, as a matter of fact, we adopted a resolution allowing the speaker and the binocular leader to adjust the ratio of members of the committee.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
This committee has been composed of 12 members, now it will be composed of 15 with three additions, two Democrats and one Republican.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
By the way, the speaker has just announced, as you know, the two new Democratic members of the committee.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
There are a Congressman Carl Elliott, a Alabama and a BF Sisk of California.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah, both of them are in a very substantial position.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Very sound, man, very good man.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, in the first and state of the union message, he of course couldn't go into details about all of the things he was going to do.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
And there were some little criticism on that part, but he's been acting very rapidly since that time.

10:03.000 --> 10:17.000
He's issued a presence in executive order and expanding the surplus food distribution principally by, and then also setting up food staff areas, now hope that we'll get one in Tennessee.

10:17.000 --> 10:31.000
Another very important thing he did was that the community facilities program, which has only been applicable to sewers and water districts and water and gas, has been expanded so as to be applicable to anything else.

10:31.000 --> 10:46.000
And, incidentally, to arrive introduced to build him and large the community facilities program, so as to have a revolving fund of $1 billion to be loaned on worthwhile projects that are rate of interest, one for the bulk of the government has to pay for its money.

10:46.000 --> 11:00.000
As it is, as a representative of a lot of our very excellent small towns, I know that they have benefited from this program for municipal water works, sidewalks for libraries for hospital construction and various municipal and community improvements.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
Well, these are things that not only need to be done, there have been many improvements to the government.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
A loan program, a loan program, everybody, they have certainly given employment to a great many people.

11:12.000 --> 11:29.000
And also, we've been there, housing starts have been almost dried up so that President has lowered the interest rate by one quarter of a percent or one half a percent, no one fourth of a percent on FHA home loans, which ought to happen that respect.

11:30.000 --> 11:42.000
And I think Joe that President was wise in following the suggestion of the joint use of staff and revoking the order about the dependence on having to be sent back.

11:42.000 --> 11:57.000
I think that by trying to get them to restrict travel, tourism abroad and to buy their capital equipment here and let me say, I would certainly be for cutting down on some expensive years abroad but not at the expense of the American soldier and American servicemen and their families.

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
Well, I was over the NATO parliamentarians conference shortly after this order went into effect and the effect on them around our soldiers was evident to be seen.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
Certainly must be all the ways where the same result can be accomplished.

12:11.000 --> 12:21.000
But Joe, I want to tell you how good it is to have you over here with us and we are going to have a very exciting and I know a very useful session of Congress.

12:22.000 --> 12:31.000
I hope that one of these days we can get you back to joining and reporting to people who are kind of saying, yes, this is very nice to invite me.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
Ladies and gentlemen, until four weeks from today, when we will bring you another report, that's all. Thank you very much.
