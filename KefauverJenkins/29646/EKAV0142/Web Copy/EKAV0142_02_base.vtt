WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
The staff, that they saw some third person who was not recognizable and was not recognized,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
standing to the side.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
That was 15 months and was destroying and we're facing each other and looking at each other.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
There were 16 third persons standing on the side and they saw that third person had no mercy.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
And nothing to do with it.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
And that's a picture wanted was a picture of Steven's and John.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Will you reverse and that gave Mr. Colman information George?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Well we've discussed answers to questions George.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Will you reverse and engage with the Colman information?

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
I may have been one of a number of individuals that didn't do it.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
You mean half to the hearing?

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Now you know that there was a partner there who was not recognized for no.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I am the two Mr. Colman.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
No sir.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I am a someone's army that's not well.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
No sir.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Who asked to bring them that inform Mr. Colman and that factor?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
No sir.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
You know the world.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
No sir.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
You know the number of individuals that have been accepted.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
Well sir I know that there's been, we've generally, at various times,

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
discussed illegal points involved in this.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
If I could have, you know that it was a member of the staff and the staff.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I may have heard something like that.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
From whom did you hear it?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't recall.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
I might know we all, various members of the staff.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Will you explain Mr. Colman's testimony on film?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
That's which testimony?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
To the impact of their world, the third person down in the heat staff was unrecognizable

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
and that they don't run the staff and cut it out.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Well Mr. Chairman, I've been sitting here patiently through all of you.

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
Now since this waste of time, it's obviously improper and the human knows it

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
to ask a witness to evaluate another witness's testimony,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
who asks for the repeliers that are not only the committee from the chairman,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
but they not believe the testimony.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
I think we should be done with this waste of time.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
You may have received, St. Clair.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Mr. Chairman, an answer to the question.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Mr. Chairman, the point of order to the question that you cannot ask one witness

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
to evaluate another witness's testimony.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
We're going to have the question.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You read it this time.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
The last question.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Should be a second answer with the first question that you have.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
That is, yes, was unrecognizable.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And that a number of the staff had cut it out.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
The answer was yes.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
So would you read the whole question?

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
First was well I not even believe Mr. Colman's testimony.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
Why do we have to be determined whether or not this question is asking the witness

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
to evaluate the testimony of another witness?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm not sure whether that's a proper request.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
If you're not, this is a whole question.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I have to be back.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
Very well.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
You know that there was a number of the staff's and the committee.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
As well, sir.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I know their head can.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
We have to be a very happy time.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
I know that it was a number of the staff's and the committee.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I may have heard something like that.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
But the moment you hear it, I don't recall.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
I know we've all very sensitive staff.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Questions usually admit that the testimony don't do.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
What's that testimony?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
What's the other structure of the first person there?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
That he did with unrecognizable.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
The number of the staff has had it out.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
What I'm worried about is the staff.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I do not believe this one witness is called up on

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
to evaluate the testimony of another.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Time keepers have advised that the chair of the participants

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
may have had an effect.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Thank you.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
No questions?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
No questions?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
None.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
None here, Mr. Chair.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Chair of the president of the president of the president.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Any of the senators in my right?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
At my left?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
The same clerk or Mr. Welch?

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
For the question you may ask in no time.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I call your attention, George.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Mr. Coles, that's the five-year-old's day.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
The key and stuff that's been inspired

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
have been members of the staff.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
And learned from them that the chair of president

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
had to land the picture.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
You were not the first to admit your call to the party.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I said, no, I absolutely not.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
You know the first one was the call to the party.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And also, did you want to do first learn?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
And then there was a picture of the secretary

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
and the president's trying to know.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, I never knew that they were

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
necessarily alone.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
You never knew that, no.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
So, what to do to prepare for this case for the committee?

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
So, this is the only time the people have been

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
produced by the testimonies of the bar.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
For the federalists, I've been made a decide on

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
what this is referring for.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
I have been here at all at hearings,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
and I don't remember whether it was some other...

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, the photographs were tuned by the staff

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
that matter of the relation when it was produced and fired or tuned.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
I didn't attach any great information.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I didn't know that.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I didn't know that.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
I didn't attach any great importance to the...

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
to the, I thought it was one bit of evidence

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
that it would be helpful in the case.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
When did you bring that up?

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
Oh, I first learned that there was a photograph.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
When was that?

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, I testified when that,

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
shortly after Private Shine had brought the photograph

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
and the role I believe that he mentioned the fact

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
that it was a photograph.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
What did he say about the photograph?

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
I didn't say there are very long,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
or if he said anything, what did he say?

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, he didn't actually tell me anything about the picture as such.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Is this end of the day, one?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
At that particular time, no.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Well, you know some time before the interview,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
now if there was a picture in the distance, yes.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Who did you find that fact?

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
Well, at the time that...

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
I would say when...

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
When...

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Well, Private Shine had mentioned the fact that there was a picture.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
What did he say about it?

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Well, I each of said I have a photograph here or something like that.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I don't remember exactly.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
He may have mentioned that.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
You have no doubt that a D is a secretary or anything like that.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
He didn't know anything about this photograph.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Besides, I went down and picked him up,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
bring him over to Room 101.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Nothing about it when he came in.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
He brought in this and other papers.

08:21.000 --> 08:31.000
And he probably said something about this being there with Stephen in the picture.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
He didn't actually discuss it.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
He wanted a detail for the picture.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
So, the way he never knew there was such a picture.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Mr. Dynas, I didn't really know.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I wanted a detail for the picture, Chairman.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
And I think you might have wanted to explain everything from raising points of order

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
because of the fear that's by raising them,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I might take more time than it was to being taken.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
But I think the cherishers, they know the facts.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm going through a ridiculous delay for a speech in LA, the Unlearned.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
So picked up, Cheyne, brought him to the office, dropped him there.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Council knows that.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Really stalling.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Take a time or why I don't know.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
But I do think the cherishers just...

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Yes, the Council for...

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Mr. Stephen, Mr. Dynas.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Not to ask questions for the purpose merely hearing their voices,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
but only asking what they're looking for in the midst.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Chair, really, that is not a point of order.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Chair also holds a question there.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
I've got a petition, but he doesn't think he has any authority to tell Council

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
that they're not asked questions because I don't know.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I might be in mind at times.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Chair, please.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Mr. Stephen, I have a request for you to start the start.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Mr. Dynas, is that all?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Yes, I have.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Senator McCarthy, I think if you have no question.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Does anybody have any further questions before we dismiss to the council?

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
This is Mr. Calmiss's mails, please.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Mr. Anastos has been dismissed from the witness stand,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
so we pause ten seconds now for station identification.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
Let the New York's first patient, WABC, AM&FM.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
Now back to the McCarthy Army hearings in the Senate office building.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Second.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
This is a man who, if you please, tell the committee your full name.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Francis Terry, man.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
What official position do you occupy as this man?

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Certain of Secretary, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Car.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
How long have you been left to part?

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Since the Foxim in August of 1953.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Are your offices at number 101, Mrs. Belly?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
That's correct.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
Were you in the office one day, my excuse to dismiss my Mr. Shine and Mr. Anastos King,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
lad, together with the Hattie-Journey Bundle?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm sure I was, but yes.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
Was anyone else present besides you in the two mails I have called?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I did not recall.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Do you recall of about what the time of day it was, or evening or night,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
when the two made a game?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
The chickens are doing not.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I'm sorry.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Do you recall?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I guess it is.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
You recall this, and this is what is in the morning,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
and that's it, and are you?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I honestly can't.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
I don't know.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
You are rather busy young lady down there.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I'm afraid I am.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Mrs. Williams, without my asking you,

12:20.000 --> 12:27.000
the civic questions for the purpose of exploring the subject under you curiously time,

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
I will ask you to just tell this committee the events that transpired

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
when this hank in your bundle was delivered to that always.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
So I have very little that I can contribute.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
I remember that Mr. Shion and Mr. Nassus came in.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I did not have that time.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
No, there was a picture involved.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I do know there was a packet.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
I did not, and I never do stay in the interoffice when members of the staff were there working.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
They did not ask me to stay, so I went immediately from the office as soon as I delivered a message

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
to Mr. Shion upon his arrival there.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
I know nothing of the picture, and this is known for later that it was a picture.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Do you work in what we would generally turn to the reception room?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Yes, sir.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Open to the public.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yes.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
And Mr. Shion and Mr. Nassus go into a private office.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
It is my recollection that they did go inside.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Who is always with that message?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
They often submit the car and Mr. Cohn.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Their offices are together in the same room.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Yes, sir. 3103.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
While these are Mr. Cohn and Mr. Carp persons, did you know?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I did not recall, sir.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
You recall how long Mr. Nassus has been trying to bring that office?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
No, sir. I don't. I'm sorry.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
Did you have that time to see the contents of that packet?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
No, sir.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Did you ever see it?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
No, sir.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
Did you have these as the documents tell you what the contents of the packet?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
No, sir.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Did you ever think you what the contents of the packet were?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
No, sir.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Did you expect that I, Marcello, to prepare soon,

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
seeing a photo grab off the second page of the Army?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Mr. Shion and Colonel Ratney?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I have never seen such a picture to this moment.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
Have you ever seen a picture introduced here by Council for the Committee?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
A backpack out of the holiday.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
In which Mr. Stevens and Mr. Shion only are shown?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I've seen some newspaper prints.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I haven't seen the picture you're speaking of.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Is there a picture?

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
It is made of this Indian person.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Cut.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Our orders.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
If any wise, a picture delivered by Mr. Shion

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
to the office of the staff,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
being a photograph of himself, the Secretary of the Federal Planned Man,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
the unit only is like a valid photo.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Not anything at all.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Has anyone ever told you anything about it?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
No, sir.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
I have taken since you know nothing about these as your current influence

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
as the policy resters this by the evening here at Martin.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
No, sir.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
You were not finally on our gets.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
I was not there. I was in my office at work.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I have no further questions.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Sheriff has none, Mr. Smith, turning with them.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
There's names.

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
As I understand it, the package for porting to contain the pictures

16:01.000 --> 16:09.000
was brought to room 101 and carried in to Mr. Cars and Mr. Cohn's private office.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Is that correct?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I do not even notice that, sir.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
I did not notice the package contained the picture.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I knew nothing else at all.

16:18.000 --> 16:26.000
Do you recall the occasion then when Mr. Shion and Mr. Amestus did go into the office with the package?

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Yes, I do. I followed them to take a message to Mr. Shion.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
And then you left?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I did.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
And you do not know what the camera left package there after nor what that package contained?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
No, sir.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
You were given no instructions about it.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Never.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
And you gave no instructions about it?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
No, sir.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
All of a sudden.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And a Jackson of it.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
And a Jackson of it.

16:53.000 --> 17:06.000
And from the time that this package was brought in by private Shion accompanied by Mr. Amestus last week.

17:06.000 --> 17:16.000
And up until the Tuesday of this week, you never heard any discussion about this picture matter in the office.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
No, sir.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
No discussion by any one ever overheard any discussion in the office.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
No, whatever.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
No.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
So.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Uh, send the product.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I have no question.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And this time.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
This may be I misunderstood.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
So I thought that Mr. Amestus said that you opened up the package that wrong?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Mr. Amestus is in the area. He says that.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
Uh, you saw the package go into room, but you didn't see it come out. Is that right?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
I saw Mr. Shion go in the room with the package under his arm.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
I saw the package lying later on the desk. I did not see what was in it. I did not know what was in it.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Now, do not know what the came of it.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You never saw it after that.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
You never saw it at all.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
No, sir.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Mr. Amestus did it.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Now, when he said you opened it.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
He is an air in there.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I think.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I need to write that.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Hold on.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Just do well.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Hold on.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
I'll take a thousand proofs of this in private.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Right, Mr. Shion?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Send them a card.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
No questions, Mr. Shion.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
No questions.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Here it is.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
You're going to feel it.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
You can keep going around with somebody in the case.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
There's a question.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
There's nobody has a question.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
Uh, if there's a memory in this, then I think it's proper.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I've decided I have to ask Mr. Shion.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
One other question is this.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
They love to see you available.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
They're trying to look at the stand.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Is private sign in the room?

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
You feel not here, then I would like to ask Mr. Amestus.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
One other question.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
Mr. Amestus, you've put a pair here.

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
You look at private sign when it's through the office of Mr. Coln and Mr. Carr.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
With his back.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Yes, sir.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
And that Mrs. Mames was in the outer room.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Uh, yes, so she was in the outer room.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't recall exactly where it was.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
Did you and Mr. Shion leave the room together?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
No, sir.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Who met first?

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
I'm talking about the private office of Mr. Coln, Mr. Carr.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Now, I can recall whether I left him in that room.

19:44.000 --> 19:52.000
Or was he left first and I was in with Mrs. Mames?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I can't recall exactly.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
He recall about how long you were in there.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Yes, sir.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
About, uh...

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Oh, human.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Well, did anyone come in live with Amestus?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
And I tell others, others, uh, Mrs. Mames.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
Frankly, I'm trying to find out now who next came into the possession of the picture.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yes, sir.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
And you and Mr. Shion are in that Mr. Coln's room with that picture.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
Do you not know whether you left first or whether Mr. Shion left first?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Frankly, I can't remember.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
I do know that I left after a few minutes.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
And I, uh, as I recall, I went down to my old office.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
It did not take the picture if I could wait.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Absolutely not, sir.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
Then, if you left first, we then have the picture with Mr. Shion alone in Mr. Coln's office.

20:48.000 --> 20:55.000
But if the office, if he was your left first, then you're in with Mr. Coln's office alone with the biggest or one of the other.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
And I can't be not enlighten as on which one left first or whether or not the both left together.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Well, sir, the best of my recollection.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
I think that I left first, if you left, but I don't remember.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
Exactly. He may have been there, but I didn't, uh, I know I went down to room one, six, all.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Very well. You left the picture in that office.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Yes, sir.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And you think you left first?

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
I, thanks so much. But how is anyone else having questions?

21:27.000 --> 21:34.000
Anybody, uh, having a coyote over it?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Are there any questions?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Uh, Mr. Potter.

21:40.000 --> 21:50.000
What have been possible for either you or Mr. Shion who have left the packing gun on a desk with off-moves a question of who has been there?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
That's correct, sir.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
In fact, I think that was just a question of the work you and I don't know.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Who's dead? Of course, he may have taken, but I don't know.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
I don't know.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Uh-huh. Who's dead?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Who is dead?

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Who is on the other side of Frank Carstead.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
On the other side of Mr. Carstead, yes, sir.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And when you left, you left without the face.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
That's correct.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Yes, sir.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Mr. Shion, stay there with me left.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
You left without the face.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Oh, I guess so.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
Man, if there was no one else in the room, that time all that was a man from J and left.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
As a time to use Mr. Darnman, is that correct?

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
Uh, first he was back and forth into that outer room and I don't know what the truth is.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
Positively in the room when I left the list, was in the outer room, I don't know.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Well, thanks.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
The reason is the reason for my question, John, is it German?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
The best I can, what happens?

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
That's a character used in the day that I understand the testimony.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
You left the room without the picture.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
That's correct.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Uh, that's a giant and it's likewise.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I mean, I'm big, that was a testimony.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
There's no one else in the room outside of Mrs. Mim's, that's in and out.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And she said, he had the...

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
That's the end of the picture.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Well, sir, if no one else came, I no one else came into the room.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
No, I did not.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Well, therefore, you must have left the picture there.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Is that correct or not?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
That's right.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
I did.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Mr. Darnman.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Mr. Darnman.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Uh, I'm sorry, here.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Darnman.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Darnman.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
I wasn't raising a point of order, but just if it was there some time, Mr. Darnman,

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
I think that we can easily agree and certify and stipulate,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
what you made of the picture as it left.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
There's Shine's wall.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
I got into the hands of Mr. Giuliana.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
So the meantime, neither Mr. and Master, nor anyone else,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
cut it or did anything to it.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
Otherwise, if the identical picture was here from the wall, got the Giuliana kind of thing.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
I...

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
The position he could fit the Giuliana will testify to the fact that when he receives the picture,

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
it would be the only man who knows what happened to this picture.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
Uh, I think, uh, I think there's a long way.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
The enforcement has gone to Councilman.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I was just trying to find my site, uh, with the chairman.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
I don't blame Council for this, but I think we're wasting a fantastic amount of time.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
We can get down to the one young man who knows what happened to that picture.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
I appreciate the information the Senator has supplied.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
However, in terms of the rules that there are other questions,

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
uh, Senator Simon can agenda to give the assum.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
He's neither Senator McLeod nor Senator Bernie Sanders.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Senator Simon is in the middle.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
The lives of the state that just laid on one pass with Mr. Squish.

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
He is in all they've had, that you yourself personally delivered the picture.

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
To Mr. Giuliana, I ask you to refresh your memory now.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
After all that's been fine and is been not true that you delivered the picture to it.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Uh, doing up here, sir?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Yes.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Within 30 minutes after his broth to then open the spam.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Sir, has been that true?

25:13.000 --> 25:22.000
Sir, uh, I definitely remember that I left that picture.

25:22.000 --> 25:29.000
I left that picture in the papers on the desk of Frank Scott.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
I went down to my room and once I saw it.

25:33.000 --> 25:42.000
In such a good time, I was instructed I was tasked to bring up to this room.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
Uh, so that picture and other papers.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
And I brought them up here, sir, and Mr. Giuliana, as I remember,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
let me have play up this game.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I'll hear it.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I gave you.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I'll be there.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
Either the other thing that, uh, and the side of me,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I didn't get you up today.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Yes, I'm Simonton.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Mr. Hannes, this is, uh, uh, uh, from Mr. Shine,

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
testified, uh, to page 1119 yesterday.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
And when I came back from New York, sir,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Mr. Hannes, that's the idea of play.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Mr. Jenkins, you have testified to all of that now, Mr. Shine.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Mr. Shine, yes, sir.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
And therefore, I do remember giving him the photograph

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
because he came with me to the office.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
And as a matter of fact, one of the staff came in and said,

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
quote, let me see the picture of you and Secretary Steven's,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
and I said, quote, we had better send this right out

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
because Mr. Jenkins is anxious to have it.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
And so we had better not open it and it was.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
And I remember Mr. Hannes, uh, taking the picture.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Did you have any comment on that?

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Well, he's referring to, uh, the time,

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
the sense of time when I, uh, after I've been told

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
to bring it up, uh, that it is correct that I did come in.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
And I took, uh, the photograph and the tape,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
and brought them up.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Let me repeat.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
ABC radio is bringing along the scene coverage

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
of the McCarthy Army hearings in Washington.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
This is ABC radio network.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
This WABC New York 770 AM and FM.

27:47.000 --> 27:57.000
And now back to the McCarthy Army hearings,

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
where Senator Simington is questioning the witness.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, Mr. McCartney, I think you'll all have some.

28:07.000 --> 28:15.000
Well, this should be very short.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
I am puzzled, Mr. Amatos, if you're anxious to send a

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
to Simonton.

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
Private Shine's testimony was that he gave the photograph

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
to someone and he remembered one of the staff came in

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
and say it pulled.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Let me see the picture of you and Secretary Steven.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Did you say that, sir?

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
What member of the staff could have said it?

28:43.000 --> 28:50.000
Well, it was no other member there, but you, my little.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
No, I, uh, as I say, I'd love to wait a moment.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Wait a moment.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
There was no other member of this staff.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
What, sir?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
When Shine brought the picture in.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
Well, it's either in the last particular time

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
that I did not ask in that question.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
All right.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Then he just replied and shot me and I said,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Mr. Chairman, we had scattered.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Mr. Chairman.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
There was.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Right.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Is anybody else waiting?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Yes, I have.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
On the order of Mr. Chairman.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Yes, yesterday I was in terrible withdrawal.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
I could send him to the head minister, Steven,

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
taking off the stand so we could establish the facts in regard

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
to this picture.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I did that with the assumption that you were doing it to establish

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
the facts.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I think Council has done a very confidently.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
How can a deficient job have got this down?

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
But Mr. Chairman, if Council for the,

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
Mr. Steven's and Mr. Hansel and Mr. Adam

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
are going to continue this stalling practice

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
to keep Mr. Steven from going back to the stand.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
But I shall be successful or not.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
I don't know, but I am going to ask the chair.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I have about to be finished.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
I'm going to finish this, Mr. Chairman.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
I am going to ask the chair.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I'm not doing it now, but I am going to ask the chair

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
of the stalling continues to bring Mr. Steven's back

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
to the stand.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I only can send of the fee,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
if he removes only the theory that we wouldn't go through

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
this filibus ring,

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
proceed here by Council for Mr. Steven from the draft.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Mr. Chairman.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Mr. Chairman.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Mr. Chairman.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Chair, I'll have to confess to the fact that he has not yet been able

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
to find out the truth about the photograph

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
and that was the photograph he had written.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And we're trying to find it out.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
He's taking a long time, but I hope that he can find any

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
determinants to preserve his darkness to capture.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
Mr. Chairman, and if I think all the facts about the photograph

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
have been given to Mr. Duncan,

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
I think he is trying to get down to the important lessons.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
I agree that it is necessary for these phenomena to be discussed.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
Mr. Wells and Mr. Sinclair, in my opinion now,

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
are not looking for facts they're trying to stall.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
So Mr. Steven's not the turn to the stand,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
the draft the week.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm really serving notes.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Very well.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
No, the thing is right, it's been made.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Mr. Wells can be really serving notes.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Mr. Chairman, this continues.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I am going to raise objections to this.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
Mr. Wells, I also wish to serve a notice.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
I have made or thought of an invention that will greatly shorten this hearing.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
It is my observation of law's duties that when the principal witnesses testify,

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
these sub-pensables go on and off very fast.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
I wish to give notice now that at the conclusion of Mr. Steven's testimony,

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
I shall raise the right to proceed with Army witnesses,

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
and ask the Mr. Jenkins to call Senator McCarthy to the stand.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
That I wish to do as soon as Mr. Steven's conclusion testimony

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
will object I would suppose,

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
would be within an hour or so of the time he retakes his best.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
The chair will have to remind us.
