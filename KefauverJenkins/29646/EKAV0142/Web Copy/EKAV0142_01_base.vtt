WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Yes, sir.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
I think it's a good thing.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
Assistant, Assistant Council, sir.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Did the Senate investigate in committee?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Yes, sir.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Mr. Ambassador, I'll ask you whether or not

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
women, reason, please, a fuller,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
or a record delivery, you will ask the shot.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Yes, sir.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
When did that occur?

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
It was on Thursday last,

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
when after I had met the private shine at the airport,

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
and I, and we came back to the Senate Office building

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
to Room 101, at which time,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
private shine,

01:01.000 --> 01:12.000
delivered to the bundle or some papers onto the desk of Frank's car

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
at Room 101, as I recall, he said,

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
well, here's the, here, the, you want this,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
or something like that.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
And, well, that bundle or package

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
will be your presence.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
No, sir.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
If you ever see the condense,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
at a subsequent time,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
whether that time, no, sir,

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
the private shine, delivered to the bundle

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
contained, I believe that,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
when we got to Room 101, it was mentioned

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
made of a photograph.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
And you say that it was laid on the desk of Mr. Car Getter.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Who was present at that time,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
at the office of Mrs. Francis Limbs?

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
I didn't get to meet Francis Limbs, sir.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Please, please.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Smith.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
He is the secretary on the subcommittee.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Does anyone else present, besides you, Mr. Shy?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And Mrs. Limbs?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I don't.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm pretty sure there wasn't anybody else present there, sir,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
because the hearings, as I recall, the hearings were going on.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
And, uh, what's the staff?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I understand if you were not present

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
when the package was over.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Yes, that's right. That's correct, sir.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
That is correct.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
You say that you later saw the contents of the package.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, and as long as it's one time, I was told to bring some papers

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
up to the committee room here.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
And, uh, I think, uh,

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
is our recall, uh, Francis sort of, uh,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
open. She didn't actually find out.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
She found the open that I get to take a look at the photograph,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
and I kind of looked, but I didn't get a real good look at the time.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
You see, the entire photograph is on a tear.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
It introduces that, and no, sir, no, sir.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
You do not know that, or whether there were,

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
or who are three people showing the photograph still only not, sir.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Did you ever, at any time, see the original photograph,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
delivered to you in that package?

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
Assuming it was in the package, by Mr. Shining, sir.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Mr. Masters, you, a person's picture,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
was cut out of the original.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
You know, that's the first, do you know anything about it, why not?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
No, sir.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Did you have anything to do with it?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
That's so much, sir.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Then the last time that you saw the original package,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
delivered to you by Mr. Shining,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
was in room 101, in Mr. Howard Always,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
at which time you, Mr. Shining,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Mrs. Raymond, were present.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
It's that correct, the last time, yes.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
That you saw that the original package,

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
uh, film, you mean as it was delivered by Mr.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Yes, sir, that's right.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Mr. Masters, one of them,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
did anyone ever tell you,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
to say anything about anyone,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
all of them are changing,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
you're coming out,

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
and into this room, how much picture?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
There was talk about, uh,

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
the photograph, the in brought down stairs,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and to the, uh,

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
to the, uh,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
photograph,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
and, uh, but I don't know anything of my own personal knowledge.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Do you know anything from what anyone told you about,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
who did anyone this?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Cut off one of the individual pictures.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I do not know who cut out,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
if they just cut it off.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
There's one other question, Mr. Masters.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
Two others now.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
The room that you delivered the picture here in this room,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
uh, last week,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
well I was told to, uh,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
to bring up, uh, these papers,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
uh, which included the,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
the wrapped up photograph,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
two, two Jim Giuliana,

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
to the union,

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
and, uh,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
as I recall,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
he met me halfway down the aisle,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
and I can see a new member of his mate,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
yes sir.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Mr. Masters,

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
did you,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
a hen,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
a dinner,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
a party,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
a party,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
gathering,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
at the Colony Wrestling

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
here in Washington on Monday night of this week?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Absolutely not sir.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
As a matter of fact,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
fortunately,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
I, uh, had dinner with, uh,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
two other men

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
that evening at, uh,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
the year's restaurant,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
here in town.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
I have no other questions, Mr. Masterson.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
The uh, chairgettles

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
from the left remark that,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
if there continues to be any questions about,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
before you were Monday night,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
you're able to provide two witnesses

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
to where you were,

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
and perhaps,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
so hopefully sir.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
And if we're not the Colony,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
that's, that's right, very good.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
There's one other question that,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
if you're chair and your part in this, uh,

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
photograph, uh,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
transactions,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
if you're strictly limited

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
to having received

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
a wrapped package,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
covering something

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
which you believe can be a photograph,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
but there's not any.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
And transferring that wrapped package

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
to a third bottle,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
well as I say,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
it was, uh, it was on the desk,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
and, uh, I never had this.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
You never had this?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
No, except one of it.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
That is some time I brought it up to this room.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Uh, maybe,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
other great comments,

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
the chair asked a number of questions in yesterday,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
uh, which,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
throughout of the fact that,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
the big picture,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and these small,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
original,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
seemed to be considerably different

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
from the standpoint of the amount

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
to close-shown the bottom of the picture,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
and so forth.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Out of this,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
possibly information about,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
in large amounts,

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
uh,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
in general,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
changes in photographs,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
that,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
currently, having to be rather pertinent,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
because,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
may or may not seem

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
that some of these photographs are trans,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
so the amount of information

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
to be in the record.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
And it's possible to take off the bottom of the picture

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
without taking off the top and vice versa.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So the chair doesn't know whether,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
again, this question will be very pertinent enough,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
or whether,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
is it quite that empty-handed

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
to better be empty-handed only one?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
So I think you want to be,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
it may not have been one of the questions,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
but I'd like to ask you,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
uh, a fair limit on.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
You're turned to ask questions,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
if you have.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
All I want,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I didn't quite understand,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
you want to go this and ask this.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
You brought the picture from there,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and you're related on the desk in one office.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
So I didn't, uh,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
bring it from the airport.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Um,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
uh,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
try to shine the handle of the whole thing.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And he brought it in, he delivered it,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I suppose he means that he delivered it to me

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
by putting it on the desk.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And did I say,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
as I recall,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
he says,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
about, here it is,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
or is the business stuff,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
or is the deal not

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
raising any questions about it?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I thought he

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
testified that he delivered it to you.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, I,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
now, hey,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
well, sorry, he did not,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
he did not give it to me,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
I did not take it from his hand.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
He came and brought it

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
on the desk,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
and well, well,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
who else is in the room when he laid it on the desk?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Is he a friend?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Oh, I ask you who else was present?

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
At the time he laid it on the desk in your presence.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Mr. Spryen's men,

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
did he tell you he was delivering the picture to you?

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, he didn't say that he was delivering it to me, right?

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Well, now, he says that he delivered it to you.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Is that correct or not?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I don't know, I'm just asking you each test.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Well, he didn't say,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I mean, as very call,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
he said, here it is.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Did you take the session of the picture to Elser?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
No, sir.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Positively did not.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Absolutely not.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Then it was not delivered to you.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
No, sir.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
In that sense that he didn't,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
he didn't.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, I was delivered to you in any sense.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, sir, I don't know what he has in his mind.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I don't even.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I'm asking you, you're one of the partners.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
He may have delivered it in a sense that he,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
that he thought he was given it,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
he was giving it to my custody of my possession.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
But I never took possession of custody of him.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
He thought he was doing that, he was mistaken.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
You didn't say, because that's right, sir.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
That's correct. Yes, sir.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
So you don't have to have an acceptance left there on the desk.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yes, sir.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
It was on the desk when you left the room.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yes, sir.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Who else was present when you left?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Well, I guess Francis Memphis was there.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Miss Lou, Mrs. Memphis.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
That's all you know, sir.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Yes, sir. I walked out of the room.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
That's all.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Enter, sir.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Enter Jackson.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Why did you go to the airport?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I was told to go there, sir.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Who told you to go to the airport?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Mrs. Memphis told me that she had received a message

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
from Mr. Colne to for me to go to the airport

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
and meet Robert Chinon, bring him to the office.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
You've been advised of the nature of his trip to New York?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Most of.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And you haven't heard anything about me

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
as having a picture with me when he arrived.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
No, so I didn't know that he had a picture with me.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
All you know is that you received instructions

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
to meet him at the airport and to bring him in.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
That's right.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
To the office?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yes, sir.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Uh...

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Did you at any time?

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
At any time, during this period?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Uh...

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Hear any conversations or discussion about coming down

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
the sides of this picture and controversy?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
No, sir.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
You've never heard any discussion in the office

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
or elsewhere with anyone.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
No, I had nothing to do with the...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
uh...

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
blowing up or...

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
or...

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
taking other negatives of the thing.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
And you have...

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
I mean, not only did you not have any knowledge directly,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
you didn't hear about anything and could also have to

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
answer the point that had to raise in the hearing series.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
No, I'm at fire.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
No, sir, I did not.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Uh-huh.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And all you heard about was some talk in the office

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
about the photo being brought downstairs.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Uh...

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
You mentioned you testified that you heard talking

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
the committee room or...

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Oh, yes, when we were being interviewed by uh...

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
by uh...

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Mr. Jenkins.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
No, I meant up until the time the picture was introduced.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
In evidence.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
On Monday.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Oh, no, I didn't.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
That's all.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Senator Potter.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Uh...

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Did you testify to the fact that you didn't see the photograph again?

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
But at the time, it was open, the fact that you go for the office of 101.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Until you put the rest to bring the photograph up to uh...

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Mr. Juliano.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Well, as I recall, Senator, uh...

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
just before I was to...

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
take the uh... photograph and some other papers up to this room.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Uh...

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Francis Memphis, I think she kind of...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
uh...

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
took a peek at it or something like that, I can't let's all of that.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I just get a real good look at the picture at all.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
You and your family were both not sure I did not.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
You have no knowledge of any uh...

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
of any uh...

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
work being done on the photograph.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Uh...

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
You weren't present of anything.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
It was done for no, sir.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
You only think that tonight I have Mr. Carman, is that...

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
We're going to continue to use that span around the names of uh...

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
of restrooms to your Washington.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
We should uh...

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
charge for commercial.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
You should see that.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
The chairman's command to send it to commercial has been eliminated from the broadcast.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
He's probably with the committee room.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
And the time is just...

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
You say it definitely.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
This thing is...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You say it definitely.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
This thing you would never in your custody.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Uh...

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
I have never uh...

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
definitely think it was...

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
It was rough.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Did I do ever touch it?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Warm it.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I mean, it's put my hand on it.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
You know, I'm losing one of those uh...

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It still covered over.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
But you...

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
You...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
You did not ever have touch the other.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Or did.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Well, he had a physical touch to the other.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I never really handled this.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Send it to my hand.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It's too well.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
Mr. Nazco, you are, I think, a lawyer in that right, Mr. Nazco.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
And the graduate of that somewhat suspect place Harvard.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Correct.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
And the classmate of my brilliant young assistant, Jim St. Clair.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I don't remember his name.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I'm not taking that.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
There's been classmate of yours, I'm sure.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I'm not taking that.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
There's been classmate of yours, I'm sure.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I remember meeting Mr. St. Clair, uh...

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Boston, before I came out of Washington.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Now, the committee is being deprived of this delightful color.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I wish it didn't have to be in the name of it.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I thought it was.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I was making an introduction to Mr. Chairman.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
He happens to be a classmate of Mr. St. Clair,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and they were born to each other.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Very good.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
On the board of the staff.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And to the field by floor station, many are given.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm not carrying a total of the procedures.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Mr. Nazco, uh...

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
I may be wrong in this, but, uh...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
using an underworld phrase,

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
you kind of give me the impression that you feel this picture has become hot.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
There's that...

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Very good.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
And you do have a kind of a feeling.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
You don't want it to be any closer to that hot picture than you have to be.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Absolutely sure, I should.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
And the closest we've got you to the hot picture is that you might have placed your hand on it,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
and likely with God.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
See, that writer?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Well, it's quickly withdrawn.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I just quickly withdraw as I was.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Maybe I'd...

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Maybe my gesture was too abrupt, sir.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
I mean, if you displace your hand on the hot picture, you all told me.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
We reasonably promptly withdrew it.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Is that right?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I didn't want it in front of us, sir.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
You didn't...

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
I didn't want it.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
I didn't say anything.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
Now I just thought you'd say that when Mr. Shine brought the bundle into the room,

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
he said the picture was included, is that right?

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
The latter was brought to the room.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
I believe there was some discussion as to the photograph.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Yes, he did.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I very calm.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Now there were two people in that room, is that right?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yes, sir.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Three of us.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
Well, me not, meaning they'll admit, I have a kind.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Is that right?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yes, sir.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
And you, sir?

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
And this is, is that men's or men's, men's, M-I-M-F.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
Now private Shine was not delivering the picture to Mrs. Men's, was he?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
No, sir.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.000
And so, it's clear, is it not, that when he put it down in that room,

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
he delivered it to you.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Well, he delivered it to me in a sense.

19:21.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, in any old sense, I mean, I suppose, he was delivering it to the subcommittee.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, you don't mean to me.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
And I am a member of the subcommittee, so in a sense, he delivered to me.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I'm talking about human beings.

19:40.000 --> 19:48.000
The human being, the whom the picture was delivered, was not named men's, was he?

19:49.000 --> 19:58.000
Well, he could well have been delivering it to her and to me, or to me alone.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I don't know what was in there.

19:59.000 --> 20:07.000
You just told us the woman was going, he wasn't delivering it to her.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Well, he may have been delivering it to both of us, I suppose, and...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Well, the vegetarian, I'm a...

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
Okay, would you take a 50% position of the not picture?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Why, there's no making any difference, sir.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
I just can take the say that it was, in a sense, delivered to me,

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
but it wasn't actually given, why did it take us so long?

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
It gets to that point, if that's the actual point.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Sure, I'm for the point, if you're to be to the subcommittee before.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
Now you say, Francis, as you however, and I don't mean to just be disperienced to her.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Francis, open this, was that the phrase you used?

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
Well, later when it was ready to be brought up to this...

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Oh, after you was left there.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Yes, sir. No, no.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I had returned.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
I was told to bring it up to this room.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Oh, yeah.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
And just before I took that and other papers to be brought up here,

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
as I recall, she kind of pushed the things side, pushed the paper

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
on the front just to take a look.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And you took a little piece yourself.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
That's right.

21:17.000 --> 21:25.000
If you take a good enough piece, so you can tell us if the picture had a cast of three characters.

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
Now, sir, I didn't take a real good look.

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
I know it was shine and Mr. Stevens and Paul,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
I know it could have been three or a dozen other people in there.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't...

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
Mr. and that says that you prior to the time that hot picture was brought into that room.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
Heard any discussion about the facts of their widening systems.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
A picture of Secretary Stevens and private shines alone.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
Not, not, not alone, sir.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Not alone.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
You haven't heard that.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
I may have heard that there was a picture of a woman.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Any old woman?

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
Oh, after I was about to take it up to the room.

22:17.000 --> 22:28.000
At that time, I knew there was a picture of a private shine and Secretary Stevens alone.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
No, I didn't know whether it was a lawyer.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
I knew in this hearing room when that picture was thrown on Mr. Stevens

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
with the suggestion that he was scarcely telling the truth when he said he could not remember

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
ever having had a picture taken with private shine alone.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I believe I was, sir.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
I either was or was watching it on television.

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
How were you as assistant counsel preparing this case for presentations in this room?

22:57.000 --> 23:10.000
I have been called upon to help to a certain extent on various matters pertaining to this case.

23:10.000 --> 23:25.000
But I had, I was not asked to do anything in regard to this photograph except to go to to to get the private shine.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
The airport, I didn't even know you had a picture with them.

23:29.000 --> 23:42.000
And then subsequently I was asked to bring this photograph in the papers upstairs in this committee room.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
Well, somebody helped me to see the first picture that was introduced in evidence,

23:48.000 --> 23:56.000
which purports the show's demons and private shine, Mr. Secretary Stevens, the private shine alone.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
From the caucus room, the Senate office building in Washington,

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
the usual has been bringing you special coverage of the congressional hearings.

24:03.000 --> 24:13.000
It's the work required AFB dash for dates November 17, 1953.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Who puts that on there?

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
I never saw anybody put it on.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
That's not me.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
That's not me.

24:24.000 --> 24:38.000
Well, as I recall, I think that while we were being interviewed by Mr. Jenkins staff yesterday,

24:38.000 --> 24:50.000
I heard Jim Julianna tell Mr. Jenkins staff Mr. Collier and Mr. Arway that he had put it on the top.

24:50.000 --> 24:58.000
All right, however, once we know that, the Jim Julianna put the lettering on the picture that appears at it on top of it.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
That's perhaps the picture was brought here, is that right?

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Well, as I recall, he told Mr. Jenkins staff yesterday.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And you heard it.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
That's my recollection.

25:12.000 --> 25:20.000
One other thing or two was, when you were asked about the dinner last Monday night,

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
and the question was, what was the US to whether or not you were there?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
You remember that?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Being asked that question?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Yes, sir.

25:30.000 --> 25:38.000
And I remember your answer was, unfortunately, you were somewhere else with two other gentlemen, that's right.

25:38.000 --> 25:48.000
Then if you were to mention on the word, fortunately, do you also consider that the fact was a hot dinner?

25:48.000 --> 25:56.000
Yes, sir. It needs to become a big issue yet today.

25:56.000 --> 26:08.000
And my name was mentioned so often, yes to this hearing, that it almost seemed as though it was a follow.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
My name was having been there, having done something.

26:12.000 --> 26:20.000
And we got to that picture with the China period, and with the general law.

26:20.000 --> 26:28.000
And I didn't even know about that picture until yesterday's hearing.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
Did you love the time of the day?

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
This is one of two very brief questions.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
George, how many did you come to the committee?

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
It came from the 19th, the 15th grade, and where did you work by on the land?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
In the department of justice.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
Along with your work, the department of justice.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Yes, your office, three years.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
And you came in under a lot of Attorney General.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Uh, Attorney General McRath.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
McRath? Yes, sir.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
And you served under McRath, and what other Attorney General?

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Uh, Attorney General McRath.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
McRath, and uh, Attorney General McRath.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Brown out.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
And you left the department of justice one day and came to the committee the next day, is that correct?

27:19.000 --> 27:27.000
Now, sir, I, uh, I gave them two weeks to tell this.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Yes, but I mean, you worked in the department one day and the next day you worked on the committee's stance.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I don't think it was over a weekend.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Over a weekend.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
You were not fired, you resigned.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I resigned.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
In order to take the time for the committee.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
And you served under two Democrats, Attorney General, under one Republican.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
That's right. Yes, sir.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
No, no further questions.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Uh, sir, sir.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
How's your having?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
No further questions.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Mr. Chairman, I have none. Senator Miss Allen?

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
Any of the senators at my right have any further questions?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
That's my last.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
No, but...

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Mr. Weldon.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Any further questions?

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
Mr. Chairman, I think it's time my assistant to face the microphone.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
He's going to take a short turn and I think we will be through.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Mr. Schindler representing the Council's booth.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
You may have Mr. Weldon.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
All right.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
All right.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
Let's go here.

28:33.000 --> 28:39.000
ABC Radio is bringing you on the scene coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings in Washington.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
This is ABC Radio Network.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
This is New York Police Station, WABC AM and FF.

29:02.000 --> 29:18.000
Now back to the McCarthy Army hearings and the Senate Office Building in Washington.

29:18.000 --> 29:29.000
Remember the Senate investigation staff, George Anastose, is being questioned through this time by Mr. Sinclair,

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
who is the assistant to Joe Weldon, the Army Council.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Thank you, sir.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
I ask you to go.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
When did you first learn that there was any attention in the picture?

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
The description will be glad you have lost two days.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Would you please repeat that question?

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
Would you order me to question?

29:53.000 --> 30:01.000
What did you first learn that there was an existing picture of the description that we have passed here?

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm asking you to.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
You may listen to me here.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
He is the one who ordered the phone up to ensure the one that tried to shine.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Oh, well.

30:18.000 --> 30:27.000
Well, as I said, when I brought up the photograph, up to the committee room,

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
I know there was a picture of shine and the Stevens.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I didn't know there was anybody else.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
Where's the inquiry ever made of you, George Anastose?

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
How did you define that there were only two persons in the picture?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
We're going to hear last Monday.

30:46.000 --> 30:57.000
Well, I think after Mr. Walsh had raised the point of somebody of a third person

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
being cut out of the picture, naturally downstairs in our office,

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
there was general speculation of discussion as to what had happened.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Who was there?

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Well, I think, probably all around there.

31:17.000 --> 31:26.000
Well, I know I've heard him discuss generally the question of what had happened.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
The connection with the picture.

31:28.000 --> 31:36.000
The next connection did you learn that someone had had an office or a third person being cut out of the picture?

31:37.000 --> 31:46.000
Well, I never found out if anybody had given it any particular reason.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
No, exactly.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It answered the question.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
Did you learn that someone had had an office or a third person being cut out of the picture?

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
Well, I've never yet known to him.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Well, I learned that.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I learned that.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
I learned here.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
I learned that.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
I learned here.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Did you learn it down below?

32:09.000 --> 32:16.000
I just was up his surface that a third person had been omitted.

32:16.000 --> 32:23.000
I want to read to you as part of the control test once on the 629 of the transcripts.
