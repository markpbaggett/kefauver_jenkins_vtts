00:00.000 --> 00:23.360
This is Charlie Nance bringing you another interview.

01:53.360 --> 02:00.360
I am here in conflict and stuff with a short time about the mixture of finance and taxation in Tennessee.

02:00.360 --> 02:08.360
I am glad that we will have the benefit of the experiences of Senator Joe Thomas and Wiley to serve the district of Tennessee General.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.360
So I try as we may to keep this investigation on a judicial basis.

02:12.360 --> 02:19.360
It seems that inevitable in time when the type of person is trying to play the art we investigate

02:19.360 --> 02:23.360
at some good-storing prosecutor's office will come in handy.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.360
But Charlie, we have talked so much lately about this time investigation.

02:27.360 --> 02:33.360
It's supposed to be layered as time being and consider the Washington News of the week our actions.

02:33.360 --> 02:38.360
One thing that will be of interest to people of our state is the action of the Senate finance,

02:38.360 --> 02:44.360
recommending that Congress directs the post-match general to restore full mail service.

02:44.360 --> 02:57.360
So I like to many voted choose the man to nothing to report our favorably to the Senate's legislation to let President approach it must be acted upon by both houses as Congress and be signed in the law by the President.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.360
The poor and his visible results can be effective.

03:00.360 --> 03:05.360
But do you think the order of studying residential mail delivery is to be on the date of the overrun?

03:05.360 --> 03:09.360
Well, it's not good that in the long run it's the will of these guys.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.360
At the price of the mail service will be restored.

03:13.360 --> 03:21.360
But let me tell you that I think that if it isn't so hard that the full-scale rates certainly must be raised.

03:21.360 --> 03:28.360
The full-starth of the department simply cannot continue operating on a 500 million dollars per year.

03:28.360 --> 03:38.360
And it's quite interesting also to note that some of the people who oppose the increasing rates are also very much opposed to doing the right thing.

03:38.360 --> 03:46.360
But we're not going to be able to have our patient eat his food and just because...

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
The whole of the hair and run of the hair.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
That's right.

03:49.360 --> 03:59.360
So is it the attention of the Senate money who is turned to a proposal to make the so-calledlegraph under the civil rights field, the sending business of the Senate?

03:59.360 --> 04:08.360
That's Charlie. Most of the week I've done the voting to the after-party administration and most of the Republicans bring up the civil rights legislation.

04:08.360 --> 04:13.360
I think our listeners can be interested in an explanation of the calling measures legislation.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.360
Now, civil rights bill itself is not being made.

04:17.360 --> 04:23.360
Now, under the rules of the Senate of Oatmuth be taken to decide what item of business is going to be taken to the next.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.360
All in all, this is done merely by the society of the state.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.360
The touch of the bill will be taken out.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.360
If there is no objection and usually there is no objection.

04:33.360 --> 04:38.360
Of course, you now understand this as part of one's punishment kind of check.

04:38.360 --> 04:44.360
And what the interesting thing is to take well and to do on a motion to bring out the full of all his final decision.

04:44.360 --> 04:49.360
And this, and for all of the people's been honest questions, is taking us to the civil rights bill.

04:49.360 --> 04:58.360
Let me tell you that the next, the next, at the point and to the opposition is bringing up this measure.

04:58.360 --> 05:05.360
Actually, there haven't been any hearings held in this country, but forever on FTC legislation.

05:05.360 --> 05:15.360
Hearing them is important. All of the documents that we have, of course, are from the idiots Congress about two and a half years ago.

05:15.360 --> 05:20.360
And just the matter is when I've built this thought up there, the question of recent hearings on it.

05:20.360 --> 05:29.360
And so, just doing things, just really being brought up in a rather unusual manner and other unusual circumstances.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.360
And then, you mean this is not the same bill that you've set aside against the courtiers?

05:34.360 --> 05:37.360
It's going to be shared to me last year, expecting for the new.

05:37.360 --> 05:44.360
I know that they are part of the same general of the court, but they build a protest party against that in the grass.

05:44.360 --> 05:48.360
I'm the civil rights legislation that included the FTC.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.360
And this is FTC, you know.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.360
I noticed when, really, Cinnid was pursuing one of the presidents.

05:56.360 --> 06:05.360
The organization was supposed to get the Cinnid to be debating whether to make these FTC-mayors in the Cinnid business after it's considered all planned.

06:05.360 --> 06:15.360
Well, he said it voted to start aside the consideration of the civil rights measure until the bill's proposed to kill the two reorganization plans that have been considered.

06:15.360 --> 06:19.360
This successful effort was led by Senator Tassel-House.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.360
What were the reorganization plans?

06:21.360 --> 06:24.360
One of them was to have abolished the Office of General Counsel.

06:24.360 --> 06:31.360
That is the subtergeist Office of General Counsel and the National Labor Relations Board.

06:31.360 --> 06:36.360
And, thanks for his administrative and discretionary duties to the chairman before.

06:36.360 --> 06:41.360
That's the way that most of the boards here in Washington operate.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.360
That is, there's not a difference between your six.

06:45.360 --> 06:49.360
On the other hand, what is the question of the Secretary of the Secretary of the Secretary?

06:49.360 --> 06:52.360
Both of these plans were voted down.

06:52.360 --> 06:56.360
The first one was generally in line with the two-ver recommendation.

06:56.360 --> 07:01.360
And the second one, I think, was exactly in line with the two-ver recommendation.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.360
What action do you use to take to the House on this?

07:04.360 --> 07:14.360
Well, under the General Reorganization procedure, the plans go into effect unless either House was sentenced by a clear majority that is a comfortable position in the majority.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.360
This is proof.

07:15.360 --> 07:22.360
Now that the Senate has issued these plans about clear majority, neither of them will go into effect.

07:22.360 --> 07:28.360
Better to keep out of the House during the week, make some full sale cuts in the first week.

07:28.360 --> 07:36.360
The members have been voted for inability to make any appreciable cuts in government expenditure on the tomato holes they are left.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.360
That sounds a bit of a problem.

07:38.360 --> 07:42.360
From the following in line, the legislative process legislate cards up here.

07:42.360 --> 07:48.360
So whether a government can operate efficiently if these drafts is cut, are permitted to stand.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.360
Now, yes, that's best in the House. Make that.

07:51.360 --> 07:56.360
Now they are done across the board, the adoption of 10% for salaries and most civilian agencies.

07:56.360 --> 08:05.360
And if our record is pretty decent, then the defense agencies travel expenses will be reduced by 20% for civilian agencies.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.360
And by 5% I believe it was in the 10th days.

08:09.360 --> 08:15.360
Medical staff for the government's administration and the public health services were exempted by the House Act.

08:15.360 --> 08:20.360
Another amendment provides with 9 out of every 10 vacancies occurring in federal agencies.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.360
And the next year, it's not these bills.

08:23.360 --> 08:31.360
Now, you see the amendments at the House that are on the stand. How much of the President's distress for a $42.8 billion budget?

08:31.360 --> 08:36.360
Well, they asked the required if the budget by these does the $41 billion budget?

08:36.360 --> 08:39.360
Perhaps they had a House that was on the spot.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.360
And the first rating committee, she's before the election.

08:42.360 --> 08:50.360
Well, we would be such a squarely in the middle, I think, saying it was a cally, but the House Act is actually a budget.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.360
And the House Act, I hope, is good for it.

08:52.360 --> 08:59.360
But I do hope that this can go down, and we can smile a night where it's justified.

08:59.360 --> 09:06.360
And we won't have to resort to justice overall, to justice and everything, because some things that couldn't be reduced.

09:06.360 --> 09:13.360
And then other expenditures might have been reduced, even more drastic than 5 or 10 percent.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.360
You know, if I could just have a blind sign of the drive or blind cuttings.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.360
Well, I'd rather see it the other way than just blindness, but...

09:21.360 --> 09:29.360
The American East, Washington and the whole nation are interested in these strikes that you've had at Western Central Railway.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.360
What do you understand the details? Comprehensive.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.360
Well, everybody up here has certainly very much concerned about it.

09:36.360 --> 09:47.360
And there's a Southernhood of local-mortified women and engineers, the men and additional men on each multiple units of these, the school has these things.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.360
They say that this action man is needed for safe operation.

09:50.360 --> 09:58.360
The railroads on the other hand contain that this is others' other bedding, because they say the extra firemen perform no necessary functions.

09:58.360 --> 10:04.360
And at the extra pay to the extra man to nullify the savings, and to the operation of these people.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.360
But hasn't this argument been going on for a while?

10:07.360 --> 10:12.360
Yes, it has. In fact, two residential strike-finding boards have considered the problem.

10:12.360 --> 10:17.360
One I believe in 1943, and again in 1949.

10:17.360 --> 10:21.360
And they recommended that the extra man not be employed.

10:21.360 --> 10:27.360
Central question would seem to be, what to do about these two or more engines to displace.

10:27.360 --> 10:35.360
When a road took up the 46-dead-speech of the units, the hull-alarm swing of fire is over the high grade.

10:35.360 --> 10:41.360
Of course, we have no way of knowing what the railroads are saying about this matter in the full section.

10:41.360 --> 10:46.360
But it isn't an important element and unemployment occasion by technological problems.

10:47.360 --> 10:52.360
There's a Friday, you made a significant speech, especially on our foreign policy.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.360
Do you have a short break, mate?

10:54.360 --> 11:00.360
Well, I don't know if it's particularly significant, but I'd be glad to start to get a little resume.

11:00.360 --> 11:12.360
I call the fine Secretary of State Ashes Institute to do everything he could to realize something more from the confidence of foreign ministers, and we usually achieve in diplomatic policy.

11:12.360 --> 11:21.360
Our radar state department to get away from the traditional European method of displumbing, and as well as working principles of American democracy.

11:21.360 --> 11:27.360
That of course is embodied in the Atlantic Federation plan, which I've been proposing for so long.

11:27.360 --> 11:32.360
But so far, we are not making too much of a dent in the state department thinking.

11:32.360 --> 11:37.360
The American people have confidence in this democratic method of solving our problems.

11:37.360 --> 11:44.360
And I think the great majority of our people want to see this method effective, as you speak to us all about international problems.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.360
Frankly, I'm not too hopeful as my ladies are just counseling us.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.360
Those who plan our policy abroad will be effective.

11:51.360 --> 11:57.360
But I cannot remain silent while these things will fly out, noted to figures, the modern situations.

11:57.360 --> 12:04.360
The State Department, so far, has pulled a deployment to broken, is not solving the full world problems.

12:04.360 --> 12:09.360
And we must somehow invent our leaders that need nothing, must be applied to new situations.

12:09.360 --> 12:14.360
That is a big part of compensation of what I had to say to you, kind of Friday.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.360
That way, it will ride you easy saying you never lost the war or other times.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.360
That's exactly the case.

12:20.360 --> 12:26.360
The figure thing is that all the world diplomats say we must have folks who are union among the three people of the world.

12:26.360 --> 12:34.360
But as I told you, Friday, they say it must be spoken to unity among the fifth diplomats of those nations.

12:34.360 --> 12:39.360
The European method of experiments is failed every day, and everyone complaining,

12:39.360 --> 12:43.360
just by reading the headlines and listening to the news, starts there.

12:43.360 --> 12:49.360
And so now I want to give the three people of the world a chance to proceed and solving this problem,

12:49.360 --> 12:52.360
where the different methods failed and failed for a living.

12:53.360 --> 12:59.360
And all of this, in any time, the three people have federated, they have always succeeded.

12:59.360 --> 13:04.360
No federation of the three people has ever failed.

13:04.360 --> 13:09.360
No diplomatic alliance is dedicated on three, as ever succeeded.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.360
And Friday, and he learns the news is clear.

13:12.360 --> 13:19.360
And after I see that I have the time to divide it up, I have just no questions knowing if the action is kind of going out.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.360
I have a question for you next week.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.360
Thank you for coming in.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.360
All right, Friday, well, we will have some other things to talk about.

13:26.360 --> 13:31.360
The next week, I will talk again about the three people of the world.

13:31.360 --> 13:35.360
The four of them, the rest of the three people of the world, from your point of view,

13:35.360 --> 13:39.360
from your point of view, what the three people of the world may be very interested in,

13:39.360 --> 13:43.360
they are next to each other and say, you are back to being gay.

13:43.360 --> 13:47.360
There again, I will talk again about the five of them.

13:47.360 --> 13:51.360
There are two people, and I will talk again, so long for now.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.360
And you do now.

13:53.360 --> 14:03.360
There are two people of the world, and I will talk again about the three people.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.360
How about you all get my picture?

14:05.360 --> 14:07.360
No, I did not make it.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.360
No, I did not make it.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.360
I did not make it.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.360
No, I will talk about you.

14:15.360 --> 14:19.360
I am not joking on time, but I am born.

14:19.360 --> 14:23.360
I really do.
