WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.800
I'm very happy to have with me today in the studio one of the finest members of the United

00:08.800 --> 00:10.800
States Senate.

00:10.800 --> 00:17.500
Man who works hard for progressive legislation who is effective in his presentation of

00:17.500 --> 00:21.100
legislative proposals and of his viewpoint.

00:21.100 --> 00:27.120
He has been to Tennessee on many occasions and we consider him one of our Tennessee's

00:27.120 --> 00:33.360
and best friends and I think one of the very ableist members of the Senate, Wayne Morris

00:33.360 --> 00:35.520
of Oregon, it certainly is good to have you with us.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.800
Well, that's just very kind to let me visit with you and your constituents on this program.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.640
You can close your ears for just a moment because I know you're a modest man but I want

00:44.640 --> 00:50.080
to say to your constituents it's a privilege to work with us this keyfawper in the Senate

00:50.080 --> 00:55.800
and I want to thank him and view of his constituents for the wonderful help he was to me a few

00:55.800 --> 01:02.440
days ago as we carried through the Senate by a vote of 49 to 34, the federal aid education

01:02.440 --> 01:03.440
bill.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.840
As to his keyfawper was a great help to me.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.120
It's a bill that's going to be of great help to Tennessee because you're going to get

01:10.120 --> 01:16.240
a substantial contribution from the federal government to be of assistance in your schools

01:16.240 --> 01:20.600
but with complete state control of the expenditure of the money.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.400
Well Wayne, thank you very much for your nice remarks.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.800
We've been mighty thoughtful going around to Knoxville and other places in Tennessee

01:27.800 --> 01:33.320
making speeches to our people on several occasions.

01:33.320 --> 01:37.840
Senator Morris is a member of the Labor and Public Works Committee and is chairman of the

01:37.840 --> 01:44.760
Education Subcommittee and I think one of the best legislative handling of a bill that

01:44.760 --> 01:49.960
I have seen but ever since I've been in the United States Senate, why is the remarkable

01:49.960 --> 01:55.240
way that he steered the education bill through the United States Senate recently without

01:55.240 --> 02:01.720
any crippling amendments involving either race or religion got through a fine clean

02:01.720 --> 02:05.080
bill which is now in the House of Representatives.

02:05.080 --> 02:12.400
This bill I believe provides $850 million a year for school construction and to supplement

02:12.400 --> 02:15.600
teachers salaries over a three year period.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.600
Is that right?

02:16.600 --> 02:23.640
Yes, this is an $850 million per year bill and it's a trial bill for three years or

02:23.640 --> 02:25.400
a triad for three years.

02:25.400 --> 02:30.280
I'm satisfied that after three years the American people will insist that it be continued.

02:30.280 --> 02:35.280
But you know as to say the fear argument that's been used for so long against federal aid

02:35.280 --> 02:40.440
to education is that you can't have federal contributions to the states without the federal

02:40.440 --> 02:43.640
government somehow dominating education.

02:43.640 --> 02:48.880
Now there's no basis in that argument but as long as the fear exists you got to face

02:48.880 --> 02:50.240
up to the fear.

02:50.240 --> 02:54.160
So we have passed a bill that's for a three year trial period.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.820
It is a bill that has an equalization formula in it which simply means that the states that

02:59.820 --> 03:05.000
need the money the most will get the larger share of the money and why do we put it on

03:05.000 --> 03:11.920
that basis because we take the possession that every boy and girl in this country is entitled

03:11.920 --> 03:18.240
to an equal chance to develop his or her intellectual power and that's in the national interest

03:18.240 --> 03:20.720
and that's where the national interest comes in.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.080
Now how do we protect the states?

03:23.080 --> 03:28.320
We protect the states by making it perfectly clear in the bill that the money goes to the

03:28.320 --> 03:34.760
states is co-mingled with state educational funds is spent by the states in the cardinance

03:34.760 --> 03:36.920
with state educational policy.

03:36.920 --> 03:40.440
Now I've been in this struggle for many many years in the Senate.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.960
I've been in the Senate now going on 17 years.

03:42.960 --> 03:49.560
I was a co-sponsor of the Taff Bill in 47 of the Taff Thompson Bill in 49.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.760
We passed both of those through the Senate.

03:51.760 --> 03:57.200
I've introduced these bills year after year since I've been in the Senate and last year

03:57.200 --> 04:01.600
we passed what is known as Senate Bill number eight.

04:01.600 --> 04:06.360
It is almost identical with the bill that we just passed the other day in the Senate.

04:06.360 --> 04:07.360
I want to make one more point.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.960
I don't want to make a speech as this one.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.200
You are doing fine with the statement.

04:11.200 --> 04:17.520
I want to tell you people in Tennessee are very much interested in this bill and I think

04:17.520 --> 04:23.840
the great majority of people realize that we need it in Tennessee that will make available

04:23.840 --> 04:29.240
23 million five hundred thousand dollars for school construction and to supplement teacher

04:29.240 --> 04:31.560
salvers in the next fiscal year in Tennessee.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.560
And now?

04:32.560 --> 04:33.560
So you're making a fine speech.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
You go right on that one.

04:34.560 --> 04:40.720
Not only covers school construction and teach your salaries but you can also use it for any

04:40.720 --> 04:46.200
other educational purpose in public, elementary and secondary schools.

04:46.200 --> 04:51.320
For example, if you need to use it for equipment in your physics and chemistry laboratories

04:51.320 --> 04:53.320
it can be used for that purpose too.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.480
We leave that decision up to you at the state.

04:56.480 --> 05:03.400
But let me point out that I think the argument that helped us defeat those that keep stirring

05:03.400 --> 05:08.720
up opposition to federal aid to education with the false charge that it will lead to federal

05:08.720 --> 05:16.760
domination of schools is we pointed out that one third of the children in secondary and

05:16.760 --> 05:22.600
elementary schools in the country have been getting federal aid for 10 years and to the

05:22.600 --> 05:25.960
tune of two billions of dollars.

05:25.960 --> 05:31.320
All of us as taxpayers have contributed to about a third of the public school population

05:31.320 --> 05:36.360
in this country and elementary and secondary schools, two billion dollars.

05:36.360 --> 05:40.640
Under what is known is public law 8, 7, 4 and 8, 1, 5.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.920
Those are the two bills that cover the so-called federally impacted areas of the country

05:45.920 --> 05:51.080
where the federal government has an atomic energy plant or a military reservation or some

05:51.080 --> 05:57.960
other federal installation that brings in many families working for the federal government

05:57.960 --> 05:59.840
with many children.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.840
And then we have spent since said-

06:01.840 --> 06:07.040
In that connection we have a great many military installations in Tennessee, Oak Ridge,

06:07.040 --> 06:08.540
Tallahoma, Ploy.

06:08.540 --> 06:09.540
Yes.

06:09.540 --> 06:15.280
And may I say that the Senator Keefe offer was on the ball so to speak because the original

06:15.280 --> 06:20.200
bill that came before us and I had the- it's always unpleasant when you have to disagree

06:20.200 --> 06:21.360
with your administration.

06:21.360 --> 06:26.920
I had the unpleasant task of informing the administration that we would not accept that section of the

06:26.920 --> 06:31.960
original proposal of the administration bill that sought to cut back drastically on

06:31.960 --> 06:37.880
these school districts that are now receiving federal funds in the federally impacted areas.

06:37.880 --> 06:41.240
18 senators and your senator was one of them.

06:41.240 --> 06:45.720
18 senators that called our attention to the fact that it would do a great injustice

06:45.720 --> 06:46.920
to their states.

06:46.920 --> 06:52.200
So we struck that from the bill and we continue under this bill to provide this federal

06:52.200 --> 06:55.360
money for these federally impacted school districts.

06:55.920 --> 06:59.120
But then I want to take you back to 1863.

06:59.120 --> 07:08.920
In 1863 the moral act was signed which provided federal aids to every land grant college in

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
America.

07:09.920 --> 07:15.280
You people in Tennessee have been the beneficiaries of that to the tune of tens upon tens of thousands

07:15.280 --> 07:19.240
of dollars to your land grant colleges as there's every other state.

07:19.240 --> 07:24.720
And then we've had a whole series of other special forms of aid to the schools of the country

07:24.720 --> 07:25.880
for years.

07:25.880 --> 07:32.240
So what we have there is school lunch program is another example of it.

07:32.240 --> 07:39.640
So we just we just rode on this argument so to speak and the Senate once it got the facts

07:39.640 --> 07:44.480
saw that there was no basis in fact for the argument that our bill would jeopardize local

07:44.480 --> 07:45.800
control of education.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.560
I'm proud of this bill.

07:47.560 --> 07:52.280
I'm proud of the wonderful support that we got for our bill and I again want to thank

07:52.280 --> 07:54.280
Senator Keifal for for his help.

07:54.440 --> 07:59.240
Well I was a great legislative achievement and you were the generalist of the moral guiding

07:59.240 --> 08:04.520
us in the Senate and I have a feeling that such a good record was made and your arguments

08:04.520 --> 08:09.600
were so persuasive and favor of this bill that we have the best chance of getting a bill

08:09.600 --> 08:12.560
through the House of Representatives we've had in many many years.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.560
How do you feel about that?

08:13.560 --> 08:17.160
Well I'm very hopeful that we can get it through the House and if the people listening to this

08:17.160 --> 08:23.080
telecast want to help the school boys and girls of this country see to it that your

08:23.080 --> 08:28.720
House of Representatives know your views on it because I close my comment of this education

08:28.720 --> 08:33.080
bill with a truism I'd have you never forget.

08:33.080 --> 08:39.240
I consider this bill a great defense measure because as I've said so many times but we'll

08:39.240 --> 08:43.920
keep right on saying it until all the American people recognize it's truth.

08:43.920 --> 08:50.880
We just can't keep ahead of Russia in manpower but we Americans better see to it that we

08:50.880 --> 08:57.480
keep ahead of Russia in brain power and that's why we need this federal aid to education

08:57.480 --> 09:02.400
bill to help you people in the States meet your educational responsibilities because how

09:02.400 --> 09:08.640
you doing it now you're doing it by overtaxing your real property and the many of taxpayers

09:08.640 --> 09:13.200
listening to me who owns real property knows how right I am.

09:13.200 --> 09:19.640
We've already increased the taxes on real property to support our schools far below

09:19.640 --> 09:26.840
beyond the rule of fairness and it's about time that we get some tax help from the federal

09:26.840 --> 09:31.920
government that will help the local taxpayer meet the school expenses of this district.

09:31.920 --> 09:37.480
Well I wish we could go on about the education bill because it is so very important for all

09:37.480 --> 09:43.640
of us and we're certainly going to work hard to do what we can to get it through the House

09:43.640 --> 09:49.080
of Representatives and I hope that anyone interested may be in touch with our congressmen.

09:49.080 --> 09:56.960
But you know Senator Morris is a distinguished and has been for some time a member of the Foreign

09:56.960 --> 10:03.560
Relations Committee and as such he is the chairman of the Latin American subcommittee.

10:03.560 --> 10:09.160
In addition to this he has was the member of the United States delegation to the 15th

10:09.160 --> 10:12.240
General Assembly of the United Nations.

10:12.240 --> 10:16.520
We're all interested way in and don't have the benefit of hearing the executive testimony

10:16.520 --> 10:21.840
before the Foreign Relations Committee and how we stand and Latin America and what can

10:21.840 --> 10:27.880
we do to restore our prestige and get in better shape with our new births to the south

10:27.880 --> 10:28.880
of us.

10:28.880 --> 10:33.320
Well as to I wish I could report that in my opinion we stand high but we don't.

10:33.320 --> 10:39.320
I don't suppose our prestige has been lower in Latin America at any time in the last 20

10:39.320 --> 10:43.480
years than it has been during the last few years.

10:43.480 --> 10:47.360
I think our policy has been very bad in Latin America.

10:47.360 --> 10:53.440
I speak most respectfully and nonpartisanly but factually when I point out that the Latin

10:53.440 --> 10:59.960
American program of the preceding administration is chief cause I think for the great slump

10:59.960 --> 11:03.040
in Latin America and US relations.

11:03.040 --> 11:08.640
We've got to stop US unilateral action toward Latin America.

11:08.640 --> 11:14.040
We've got to adopt a program and present Kennedy's program now called Alliance Progress

11:14.040 --> 11:17.120
will accomplish that end if it's implemented.

11:17.120 --> 11:23.200
We've got to get our friends in Latin America to join with us in a cooperative Latin American

11:23.200 --> 11:24.200
program.

11:24.200 --> 11:30.700
And that means of course that the organization of American states which is based upon a treaty

11:30.700 --> 11:36.460
signed by 21 nations including us has really got to be implemented.

11:36.460 --> 11:41.740
And we've got to bring in our friends in Latin America to join with us in developing a

11:41.740 --> 11:44.780
Latin American program on a cooperative basis.

11:44.780 --> 11:50.020
And we've got to stop taking the attitude that we the United States are going to call

11:50.020 --> 11:51.660
the tune in Latin America.

11:51.660 --> 11:55.180
Well we're not going to do it even if we try.

11:55.180 --> 11:59.520
Because if we continue to follow the policy we've been following in Cuba and no one

11:59.520 --> 12:01.560
has opposed Castro more than I have.

12:01.560 --> 12:06.480
I have led the fight in the Senate as chairman of the subcommittee in Latin America against

12:06.480 --> 12:12.440
the Castro regime because I'm perfectly convinced that it's a comeline regime and that

12:12.440 --> 12:17.240
Moscow is dictating a large measure the policies of Castro.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.800
But that doesn't justify unilateral action on the part of the United States.

12:21.800 --> 12:28.800
And so I am urging that we go through the organization of American states and work out

12:28.800 --> 12:30.480
a cooperative program with them.

12:30.480 --> 12:36.640
As you know Estes I was one of the two congressional delegates to the Bogota conference last September

12:36.640 --> 12:39.280
that came back with the act of Bogota.

12:39.280 --> 12:45.920
The act of Bogota is an aid program or proposes an aid program for Latin America with United

12:45.920 --> 12:47.720
States help.

12:47.720 --> 12:52.520
But not with full payment by the United States and I want to very quickly say we have said

12:52.520 --> 12:56.000
very clearly and we must make it clear to Latin America.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.120
It will help Latin America if Latin America is willing to help itself.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.880
Now you say Mr. Senator what must Latin America do to get our help?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.440
Well I want to name a few things very quickly.

13:06.440 --> 13:11.240
You know the main past time in Latin America is tax evasion.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.080
The Latin Americans are going to have to pay taxes.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.560
They're going to have to raise money to help themselves.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.480
They got to have a program of land reform, social justice reform.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.680
That's the kind of a program that Senator the President Kennedy is supporting and that

13:24.680 --> 13:25.680
I endorse.

13:25.680 --> 13:31.960
Well I know that people who are viewing this program feel as I do that we're awfully sorry

13:31.960 --> 13:33.480
that it has to be brought to an end.

13:33.480 --> 13:38.880
It's been very fine of you to come and come down to Tennessee to see us soon and thank

13:38.880 --> 13:39.880
you very much.

13:39.880 --> 13:40.880
I'll be there very good on it.

13:40.880 --> 13:41.880
Thank you.

13:41.880 --> 13:42.680
That's all for now ladies and gentlemen.
