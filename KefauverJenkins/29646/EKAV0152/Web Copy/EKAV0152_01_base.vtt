WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The square of elected begin the, uh,

00:02.000 --> 00:07.000
things that money was the, not all together novel or starting and nothing,

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
that the guests are here at the place you're by to me,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
were happy to have you in the committee room,

00:12.000 --> 00:24.000
we have a standing unit of the committee that there could be no manifestations of a

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
approval or disapproval at any time,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
and the officers have a prevailing order from the committee,

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
so politely as truck from the room,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
those who decide to themselves deviling that committee in jump.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
And the chair says that he was very happy that I believe his memory

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
correctly had been no interruptions from the audience for any kind this week.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Nobody has violated the rules and make manifestations of a approval or disapproval.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
We are ready to begin with the committee.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Wilson, who are you pointing to?

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
I have a statement bearing on my relations with Mr. Jenkins that I would like to make.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I have informed Mr. Jenkins of my desire to make it.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Mr. Jenkins says that I is in charge of you have so informed that it feels

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
that the general discussion we had yesterday,

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I think it's probably a complete issue that has the opportunity to make a statement.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
It's quite short.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Yesterday in an open hearing, I stated that by unanimous vote of the subcommittee,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
that it's exactly session the previous evening, a resolution was passed,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
directing a special counsel, Mr. Jenkins, to confer with me and others

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
in an effort to reach a formula to expedite or shorten these hearings.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
I stated that for sure, in that resolution, this is Jenkins conferred with me.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
I further stated that I would not be satisfied with a formula whereby Senator McCarthy

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
would follow Mr. Stevens and be subjected to an examination and cross-examination

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
and that the hearing was then the end.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I stated that Mr. Jenkins concurred with me in my opinion that this should not be done.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Mr. Jenkins has conferred with me about what was said, and it is now my opinion that my statement

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
of yesterday morning left an erroneous impression which was all of which was inadvertent on my part,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
but occurred with this.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
Mr. Jenkins agreed with me that the termination of this hearing on that formula

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
would not enable any of the parties to present all of the facts pertaining to the issues.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
He did not express his opposition to such a formula, as he has always indicated

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
that the question of curtailing or terminating this hearing was entirely up to the subcommittee.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
I am not exactly a point of order with the terminating, two matters I would like to bring up.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Number one, the question is how long Mr. Stevens' laminar stamp has been read very frequently.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
He hasn't here long time now.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
The way we are going yesterday, it will take many, many days, and it is the cross-examination

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
of Mr. Stevens.

03:04.000 --> 03:12.000
I have had one of my stamp giving me an estimate of the time we spent in the questions and family answers.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
The interruptions yesterday, the best estimate we can get is the way spent in 20 and 25 minutes

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
asking questions, the rest of the time we have used up and what I consider very lengthy answers.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I assume the secretary thought he was answering directly.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
The interruptions, even mine, of course, Mr. Stevens, is the excuseer, and I have no choice

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
to ask all the questions in my staff and excuse me using improper pressure.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
Nevertheless, Mr. Chairman, I think that it is not exactly proper to keep one man on the stamp,

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
as long as Mr. Stevens has them, Stevens has been kept here.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I would like to very much therefore have a meeting of the committee this noon,

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
so if we can't work out some system whereby we can get a secretary a long weekend off,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
so I can come back next Monday and start the price.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
I just don't like keeping here any of these lights throughout this week.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I don't want to discuss that now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to have a meeting

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
because the committee this noon, if we couldn't executive sessions, I could discuss what I had in mind.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Mr. Chairman, I move that we've received with the hearings.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
The chair would like to inquire as to may have sent him a traffic weather

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
that's request for an executive session.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Deals were trying to find some way, if he understands it,

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
either of expediting the hearings or whether there's a suggestion that we find a way of possible

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
to change the order of witnesses, so that Mr. Stevens who has them under the lights

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
and before the committee for a long time, they sort of have a refresher period

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
that I'm to tell you to say perhaps until next Monday.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Mr. Chairman, I was not suggesting the executive sessions for any purposes.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
I expediting as I said before, I would not talk to Mr. Welch except under oath after the break of the agreement.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
I merely want to talk to the members of the committee about some way of giving Mr. Stevens a rest.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
He has an ask for one, he has not communicated with me that he wants one.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I have no indication from him that he wants her as.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
I think you have been vital to one, I'd like to discuss with the committee a change in the ground rule

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
without establishing a precedent so he can take time off.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
What were Dr. McQueen to move out of the middle of the game?

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
I would think not, but if we could find a way, it seems to me that we, to follow some other witness

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
and give Mr. Stevens a rest, the sheriff speaking for himself alone, feels that Mr. Stevens is entitled to arrest.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
He has done her a long time and he would certainly be persuaded tremendously by any suggestion

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
which would not destroy the equity of the hearings or change the rules that Wich would give.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Mr. Stevens, the sheriff, was the chair of a leave, he has which clearance.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
I mean, I'm having a committee meeting for that purpose and I would suggest that if we proceed to put the telephone

06:06.000 --> 06:15.000
monitor telephone calls in the director, that will take some time and it will give Mr. Stevens an opportunity to

06:15.000 --> 06:23.000
ensure his testimony to all of those telephone conversations that placed in the director.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
Mr. Lawyer, that's an act that's been acted upon by the committee about the long ago I can't remember over a week again.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Mr. Chairman, that connection I would like to ask you a question if I may.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
Well, there will be a question of which monitors calls our confidence as to how the money for the actors,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
all the monitors calls.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
I understand that I'm wrong with the action which is threatening.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
I understand that some of the army has supplied you with copies of all monitors calls.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I have never seen a single one yet.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Well, as I misinformed the suggestion, I have not received.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I have not received one.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
I have not seen copies of the monitors calls at the very bottom.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
In other words, you've been told all about them at all.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm here to ask you a question.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
Mr. Lawyer, this is the right distance to call an executive committee meeting at two o'clock in my office which I still do.

07:13.000 --> 07:21.000
And I hope that some of it will come some point of this so that we can release Mr. Stevens for the rest of the afternoon and he hopes longer to get a rest which I think is going to be.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Mr. Lawyer, this is the right distance to get a rest which I think is going to be.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Mr. Lawyer, another point for Mr. Chairman.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Mr. Lawyer, another point for Mr. Chairman.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
Mr. Lawyer, I just want to be sure that the committee members all understand that we'll have an executive committee meeting in my office at two o'clock.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Mr. Lawyer, you may be there.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Mr. Lawyer, I think if you are there, it's only fair that Mr. Welch also be there.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Mr. Lawyer, have you come?

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Mr. Lawyer, a son raised his things about me, sir.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
I think I would prefer not to it, sir.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Mr. Lawyer, I'm not gett to the subject.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
You have to take care.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
I haven't mind a bucket.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Yes, Mr. Chairman, the point of order.

07:54.000 --> 08:08.000
I understand the many men and decided, and I think rightly so, to put them monitor phone calls if it is proven that you have all the calls, if they are complete.

08:08.000 --> 08:21.000
I understand that at least some members of the committee on both sides of the aisle have either received the copies of the calls or have been fully informed of the contents of the calls.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I have not seen any of the calls.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
I do think that in view of the fact that Mr. Welch has seen all the calls.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Some of the committee members have.

08:31.000 --> 08:40.000
I believe it told me fair that I have access to those monitor calls also so I can check with my staff.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
The Chairman of other units, they think the calls have been included.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Other things have been held out.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
I think it is probably important that the Chairman in view of the evidence we had yesterday in regard to file shipping.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I want to make sure there is no monitor phone calls.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Mr. Chairman, the share will hold it after a week.

08:54.000 --> 09:06.000
I would like the permission of the Chair to read into the record of the wire which I sent to Mr. Stevens this morning.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Very brief.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I have a permission.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
That is not a possible.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It is not a point of order.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
It is not an early, now I have to send it to the level not good if the committee goes to work.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Mr. Chairman, this is how it is to do with...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
The Chairman has a justice.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Fairfield that the wire should not be read because the senator is not testifying at this time.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Mr. Chairman.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Mr. Welch, he is telling the committee to do the request.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
If he is not going to detect the wire but he does not believe it should be in public.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Mr. Chairman.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Mr. Chairman.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Mr. Chairman.

09:35.000 --> 09:48.000
Then I would like to pass this wire to the Chair with the request that he subpoena the material mentioned within this wire has to do with the letter.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Mr. Chairman.

09:50.000 --> 10:07.000
Mr. Chairman, everyone knows government is a continuous process and I got a little disdiscussed over the fact when I have been a state of official service in the whole life day after day if it is not necessary.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Now we have not called on Mr. Hentel.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
It is undetermined as to when we shall get there.

10:13.000 --> 10:24.000
There are so many tensions on the international horizon and as everyone knows, he is the secretary for international security affairs.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
And certainly it is not necessary to have both he and his council here.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
I wonder if the committee could not agree that Mr. Hentel is going back to work until some time as we have to have him.

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
If there is any objection for many members of the committee, it is missing Mr. Hentel until he is called by the committee.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:43.000 --> 10:52.000
And in the matter, I do not know whether Mr. Hentel has requested that he be released from attendance if he has been unwilling to grind it.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Mr. Hentel, I have his presence here.

10:57.000 --> 11:06.000
He is needed and his own interest and the sense of the charges against him, I do not think this committee has the right to order him to stay away until he is called.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
I think the chairman has found that any implication on the part of the agenda of no one knows if he was arguing with Mr. Hentel, I did not get that.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I thought it was something that we were not arguing him to be here.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
That is right.

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
Mr. Hentel, Mr. Hentel, you are certainly true that as the assistant secretary of the time for either of the members of the committee to be released from attendance.

11:26.000 --> 11:37.000
Mr. Hentel has a national security affairs. Mr. Hentel has numerous matters of prime importance to the nation filing up on his desk.

11:37.000 --> 11:55.000
I would say this, that if we can have an understanding that Mr. Hentel's name will not be brought into the hearings in his office, he will be prepared to be returned at any point and on any day.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
Or at any time when the suggestion is made that his name may commend these proceedings, and we shall come back.

12:04.000 --> 12:18.000
If the fact is satisfactory to the chair, if the fact is satisfactory to everybody here, Mr. Hentel, I am sure, will appreciate the opportunity to attend to his important official duties.

12:18.000 --> 12:31.000
Mr. Hentel's name might not be mentioned, but we should be able to reveal that none of the issues involving him would be discussed.

12:31.000 --> 12:47.000
Mr. Hentel's name is now the member of the committee, and staff and councils for all parties involved, that he may raise a point of order as a statement against any discussion of the issues involving Mr. Hentel's.

12:47.000 --> 12:54.000
Mr. Hentel, if I can get that to George now, then I would think Mr. Hentel might face the absence of Mr. Hentel here.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Does the chair hear any adjustments?

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
Mr. Hentel, I don't quite understand the chair's suggestion.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
You mean that in cost examining what concerns we cannot mention with the council's name?

13:07.000 --> 13:18.000
I mean, in that lecture, I am going to examine the secretary this morning, on a question which he was furway being countered, with the same hair he has today.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
He testified positively yesterday that Mr. Hent irs not present and he returned to the meeting with the chair and myself in the direction of the center potter.

13:26.000 --> 13:41.000
The night that there was someone who thought up the smear of the apparently unMr. Cohn and Mr. Carr, I find that Mr. Hentel was present, and that Mr. Stephen apparently had a considerable conference with him.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I will bring up that question.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Mr. Hentel, why would he present?

13:47.000 --> 13:55.000
Well, I just want to make it clear that I will not be crammed from asking which Mr. Hentel is present and which Mr. Hentel is present and which Mr. Hentel is present.

13:55.000 --> 14:13.000
I will say this Mr. Hentel, I certainly will be glad to go along with the chair, and so far is not raising any new issues about Mr. Hentel's concerns, but I can't refrain from trusting these witnesses as they appear.

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
The doubly true Mr. Hentel view of the fact that one of the allegations between Hentel and Mr. Hentel, Mr. Hentel, is not reminded.

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
Mr. Hentel, I can't help there for a certain time.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
May I say also, Mr. Hentel, for the benefit of Mr. Hentel and his counsel, while they are here.

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
I'm not sure this has been put forth clearly and conflated enough so they're fully worn.

14:41.000 --> 15:02.000
I do think the allegations in our specifications are broad enough to cover it, but I want to notify Mr. Hentel that when he gets on the ban, another witness is there on the ban, I will discuss in some detail from the standpoint of more than his part, because activities in Europe after he was notified that he would be made given a job he's now got.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I'm a fan of more.

15:04.000 --> 15:13.000
I believe that the action that the view of the type of questions, the family said, you're going to engage in this morning, at the Hentel, my third father, will want to be here.

15:13.000 --> 15:20.000
Mr. Hentel, I think we will at least remain through this month.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Very well.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Mr. Hentel, thank you.

15:23.000 --> 15:42.000
Mr. Hentel, yes today, I mean, the committee instructed me to confer with Jay at the Hoover, with respect to a copy of a letter allegedly in the files of the intelligence department of the Army, and declare that issue this morning.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I am now prepared to do so.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Prior to so early.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
I desire to ask the secretary one question.

15:49.000 --> 16:07.000
Mr. Stephen, since yesterday, Hentel, have you or not, through yourself, are those on the command, examined the files of the intelligence department at the Pentagon, with a special reference to the original as a letter about which you were questioning yesterday.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Yes sir.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
Say whether or not, that's a letter was found in that file or any other file.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Notice.

16:16.000 --> 16:23.000
And I'm as chairman, desire as dictated, send as I momentarily, and let me clarify that issue.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
And I desire to call as the next witness.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
My assistant counsel, one of my assistant counsel, and a member of my staff, Mr. Robert A. Collier.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
The Collier, please. Take the witness, please.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Nothing's born.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
That's just about it, yes, everybody.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
No, everyone loves that.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Hold no hand.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Sorry, major, I had to.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
You saw on this letter testimony you were about to give, as the truth, the whole truth, I had nothing but the truth, so I hope you guys.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I do.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Mr. Secretary, please change your phone name.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Robert A. Collier.

17:09.000 --> 17:16.000
Collier, you are a member of the staff, of my staff, assistant counsel.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Is that correct?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Yes sir.

17:18.000 --> 17:25.000
Mr. Collier, formally, have you or not been employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

17:25.000 --> 17:32.000
I was there, I was employed from April 1, 1941 until October 26, 1951.

17:32.000 --> 17:40.000
You were present yesterday at the noon when a discussion occurred with respect to a letter, with you give the data, as the Collier's escaped me.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
January 26, 1921.

17:42.000 --> 17:53.000
And that's which time the committee instructed me to either myself or if I, some member of my staff, confer personally with Mr. J. S. Orzuber, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Are you present?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Yes.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
So I'll ask you whether or not at the close of the meeting has assigned that task to you.

18:02.000 --> 18:10.000
You did say whether or not pursuant to that Mr. Collier, you conferred with Mr. Hoover personally.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
I did.

18:11.000 --> 18:20.000
At what time approximately, yesterday at the noon are you from approximately 515 until approximately 715?

18:20.000 --> 18:32.000
During the course of your conversation with Mr. Hoover, I will ask you whether or not be called upon you to procure and shoulder him the copy of the letter about which we are talking.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yes sir he did.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
And I've been dated January 26, 1951.

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
As a result of that, for Christmas, Mr. Hoover did or not you go to Mr. Cohn's office and procure that copy I did.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
And then they give the Mr. Hoover, I did.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
And was it shown to him?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yes sir.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm Mr. Collier.

18:52.000 --> 19:07.000
Now at this time, without my taking the time and still in the end, it's just exoriting the gains, I ask you to chronologically relate the incident for that conference with Mr. Hoover.

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
What was done, pursuant to the request of the committee, and what was said to you by Mr. Hoover.

19:15.000 --> 19:25.000
For underseating your instructions, I communicated with the FBI and within a very short period of time, a same day appointment with Mr. Hoover.

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
I went to see him having advised them with a date and the type of letter involved.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
Mr. Hoover at that time informed me that they had not found such a letter.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
We did have another letter of the same date.

19:41.000 --> 19:54.000
In order to be perfectly sure that they had obtained a correct letter, I returned to the Senate Office Billing and obtained from Roy Cohen and Senator McCarthy's office.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
The letter, which I now have in my hand in which was the one produced yesterday by Senator McCracken.

20:01.000 --> 20:11.000
I took that letter to Mr. Hoover, and at that time, he compared this letter with the letter in his position as the same date.

20:11.000 --> 20:20.000
I can now report to you that Mr. Hoover advised me that this letter is not identified as a letter when it sees this letter.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
This is the letter produced yesterday by Senator McCracken.

20:26.000 --> 20:39.000
This is not a carbon copy or a copy of any communication prepared or stamped by the FBI to general bowling on January 26, 1951 or any other date.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
The FBI has in its file a letter.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Are you now stating what Mr. Hoover personally had on the duty?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Yes, you may proceed.

20:49.000 --> 21:15.000
The FBI does have in its file a file copy of a letter dated January 26, 1951, the same date, prepared and stamped by the FBI to general bowling, which was a 15 page interdepart metal, metal ants, a carbon copy of last went to Major General Joseph F. Kowell, United States Air Force.

21:15.000 --> 21:35.000
Mr. Hoover, in comparing the two documents, advised me that the form of the carbon copy, which I have, one interduse, and the yellow copy of the FBI memorandum prepared on January 26 are materially different in form.

21:35.000 --> 21:42.000
I can recount for you, as Mr. Hoover advised me, the difference in that form.

21:42.000 --> 21:57.000
For the purpose of identification, I will refer to the document introduced yesterday as the carbon copy and the yellow copy in the FBI file today as a 15 page memorandum as the FBI original.

21:57.000 --> 22:08.000
On the FBI original, the word federal Bureau of Investigations is printed in large block letters and draws the top of the page.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
On the carbon copy, they were federal Bureau of Investigations just typed.

22:13.000 --> 22:28.000
The date, January 26, 1951 appears directly beneath the type F federal Bureau of Investigations on the carbon copy and is in a different position on the page of the FBI original.

22:28.000 --> 22:37.000
The carbon copy has, across the top, personal and confidential, the LA does.

22:37.000 --> 22:47.000
The FBI original has in the upper right hand corner the word confidential, the LA does.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
The memorandum, the FBI original, is in the form of an interdepartmental memorandum.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
It is not signed, it merely carries the name of the director and the FBI.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
The carbon copy would indicate a signature of what to be a fix.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
The FBI original was addressed to Major General A.R. Bowling.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
The carbon copy is addressed to Major General Bowling, the initial ARF, who went down.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
The same word, the system chief of staff, G2, Department of the Army appear on both documents.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
In the FBI original, the additional word for Pentagon appears.

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
That is not currently the carbon copy and the word Washington DC appear on both documents.

23:38.000 --> 23:48.000
The FBI original has the word from and then the word John Edgar Hoover director, federal Bureau of Investigations.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
That is not on the carbon copy.

23:51.000 --> 23:59.000
The FBI original has the word subject and then typed there on, Aeron AAROM.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
The FBI, the FBI, is the R.A.R.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
The R.A.R. is the R.A.R.

24:06.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm not sure if I'm going to say that, but the FBI original is the S.A.R.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Yes sir.

24:15.000 --> 24:23.000
In other words, the subject John Aeron, the FBI, is the FBI original.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
It does not appear on the carbon copy.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
This carbon copy carries the citation, sir.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
The FBI original carried no citation.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
This carbon copy is two and one-quarter pages in length.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
The FBI original is 15 pages in length.

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
The carbon copy at the end carries the word sincerely yours, J. Edgar Hoover director.

24:54.000 --> 25:04.000
That of course did not appear at the end of the FBI original, but actually appeared in the two-bomb relation in the beginning.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
The carbon copy shows no carbon copy being sent to anyone else.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Could I interrupt Mr. Chairman?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Would you like my pardon?

25:13.000 --> 25:23.000
Yes, I think if the cover of this thing is a point of order that we show that I had wired Mr. Sevens and asked him to produce the copies.

25:23.000 --> 25:31.000
The additional pages we did not have, I thought of eight pages, Mr. Youngman for the 15 pages.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I believe I asked eight pages.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
I think director should show that I had wired Mr. Sevens told him that I was asked that the additional pages would be made.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Great. That's a big audience here. 10 minutes for you that you have the questions.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Welcome, Mr. Chair.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Hansley Chair, I exceeded my request.

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
The request made to Mr. Sevens also by wire, let the additional pages be subpoenaed to the pages that I do not have.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I think that you should be...

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Sure, it's not yet had a time to examine the telegram that you sent up in the desk.

25:58.000 --> 26:07.000
I would like to pass the chairman a diagram that's gone, which will give you a more visual reference to the way these two letters were sent out.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Ladies, I'll make a point of order.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Point of order, Senator Sanders?

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
When the witness discusses the carbon copy, he might say the alleged carbon copy.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to know who alleged to the carbon copy.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
We never alleged to the carbon copy.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
The copy you made, Mr. Sanders.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
The FBI original on the last page thereof,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
shows the following.

26:42.000 --> 26:54.000
CC, Major General Joseph F. Tarrill, C-A-R-R-O-L-L, director, special investigations, the Infecture General, USAF.

26:54.000 --> 27:03.000
Now that is the difference in form alone, I'm distinguishing between form and substance.

27:03.000 --> 27:22.000
Mr. Hoover advised me, and examined the two documents in my presence, advised me that the substance of the original FBI 15 page memorandum,

27:22.000 --> 27:31.000
and the substance of the two-in-one-quarter page carbon copy,

27:31.000 --> 27:41.000
contained information relating to the same subject matter, and that in some instances,

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
the exact or identical language appeared in both documents.

27:46.000 --> 27:57.000
Other than that, Mr. Hoover feels that you further clarify it with reveal, possibly reveal the substance of the documents themselves,

27:57.000 --> 28:07.000
and on that point, Mr. Hoover asked me to inform you that he respectfully refers the committee to the Attorney General for his opinion,

28:07.000 --> 28:15.000
as to whether or not the contents can be made public in line with security requirements.

28:17.000 --> 28:26.000
And simply, language is from incidents identical, that would apparently be a global goal.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
A document.

28:27.000 --> 28:35.000
Collier had you in detail related all of the events, that staying in your conference with Mr. Hoover,

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
Professor, I have no further questions with the Chair.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
One question, Chair, is that certain, and I'm not sure if you can answer this question.

28:46.000 --> 28:55.000
Did you determine whether the FBI original was in the files of the military and available to Secretary Steve?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I'll go back to the question.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Ray asked me, I did not complete it.

29:00.000 --> 29:09.000
On that point, I determined that the yellow copy in the FBI file, which is the file copy,

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
tell you the following, and written note case, concerning the original,

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
for delivered to Donald Framer, the RMER G2,

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
127-51-WRP,

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
and representative of the FBI, Wesley C. Reynolds,

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
the carbon copy, to Major General Joseph F. Carroll,

29:34.000 --> 29:43.000
for the loading to a handwritten note, say, yellow, levied, LHTY, OSI-129-51,

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
ESS, initial standing for EDF-7.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
The original was a family delivery in 1951.

29:52.000 --> 29:59.000
They were served, and were delivered to C2 at that time.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
The Memorand number, which is January,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
the federal training on the one-to-one,

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
whenever I'm originally from the five-man copy was delivered personally by Mr. Ed Sanders,

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
to OSI-129-51.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
The chairman's agenda is that the fight papers that you hold are not

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
and exact duplicates are replica of the yellow sheet with you held.

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
The yellow sheet by the FBI, the white beams and the bios of Senator Carnocia.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
These yellow sheets are merely my notes,

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
and my own handwritten note, the yellow copy of the 15 page document,

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
I did not examine because it contained security information.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
I did not go into the substance of the document itself, and I'll see you in Title II.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
I received my answer from the examination made by Mr. Hoover.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
That yellow copy is now in the possession of the idea.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And if you were quoting Mr. Hoover,

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
and when you said that in some instances, the language was identical,

31:03.000 --> 31:10.000
that the subject matter was the subject matter, both of the FBI copies.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
And of the copies from Sendermy Traffy Files,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
because it deal with an identical subject,

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
should not be revealed in public,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
so the ruling of the Attorney General, is that correct?

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
I want to make it clear, Mr. Hoover did not, of course,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
refer to this carbon copy when he stated that,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
because actually this is not a carbon copy of any FBI document.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
He was referring to his own document, the 15 page memorandum,

31:34.000 --> 31:41.000
when he suggested that I respectfully refer to you to the Attorney General for his opinion.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
You were speaking for yourself then when you said that,

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
because you had told you that in some instances, the language was identical,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
that the subject matter was identical,

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
that you believe that without authorization from the Attorney General,

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
we should not discuss this that I'd correct, Mr. Hoover made no comment

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
and bring this carbon copy.
