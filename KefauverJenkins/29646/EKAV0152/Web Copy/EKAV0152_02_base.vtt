WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The documents which was...

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
That's an impression we can get against.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
No, no, no, no, no.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm not going to point it out.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
No, I'm not going to.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
It's a request to the chair, and it's a very important moment to him.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
It's a request of the chair that I'm now making.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
I am making a request that someone from the FBI

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
be called to tell us whether or not

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
all of the language in the document I submitted yesterday is not identical

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
to the language in the document submitted to the military

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
with the exception of where we listed the name of an individual

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
and put the name word after the regulatory.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
In some cases, not the regulatory, but the FBI, the FBI report.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Actuate, contains all the information.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I think we should ask Mr. Grover for one or another.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
He would object to having put him in the record.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Mr. Recrucce, I'm making the chair.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm not finished with the chair.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm not finished with the chair.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm not finished with the chair.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I am making a request to the chair.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I have very important request.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
The request is this.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
We have a document here concerning forthmanment,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
coming as a forthmanment.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I want them a warning to them.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I want them to know Mr. Chairman.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
If the chair will not now call someone from the bureau

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
who can bring down the documents they have not for public exhibitions

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
and tell us whether or not the language,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
all the language is not identical except that in this document

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
the individuals are merely named

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
and all security information is left out of this document

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
or in the FBI documents the security information is included.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
The chair will suggest that the defendant will send some questions

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
to interrogate the witness, but he can say his time

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
and to whether he can provide that information

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
as possible and he can't.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Send them a question.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
All right.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Our time will be gone.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Well, Mr. Chair.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
I make a point of order that the document that is presented

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
to us here, which we have not read,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
if any complies.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
And it contains only three pages out of a 15 page document

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
and the best evidence is the document itself,

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
which is available unless it's prohibited for security reasons.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
If it is prohibited by security reasons,

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
then these excerpt from it are not admissible at this hearing.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Yes, it is not prohibited.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Others are security orders and directives of the present.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Then the original document in the whole and complete

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
is the best evidence that should be produced.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
How that form is determined.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
So, yes, this document, that is, not identified

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
other than as containing some of the names

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
in some statements in the original document

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
as no place in these hearings until it is established

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
that the original document is not available

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
or if the security reasons that cannot be made available

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
then no part of it can be made available at this hearing.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
If the Chair understands the suggestion that Senator Macellan

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
is this, that we have our council

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
undertakes to determine now from the Attorney General

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
whether we can have made available in 15G

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
and if so, we can then make our own comparison

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
as to whether or not the material is left out,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
what is left out, what is retained,

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
and if we are not able to get to the 15G

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
and since they deal with identical subjects,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
then none of the materials should be admitted

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
to security reasons.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
That's correct.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
That's correct.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I've heard that in my interpretation.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I do.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Good to put the Chairman.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And I'm going to crack the under-point of order.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Well, I agree with considerable cost the Senator Marken saw

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
has said.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
I would say this, that I think it should be made clear

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
that we are not now requesting,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
never have requested that the security information

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
about these specific individuals be made a part of a record

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
that is in line with the ruling of council, the Judencians.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I do think that the language of the law

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
is that language is correct and verbated

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
and I have every reason to believe it is.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
That the language of the law,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
contains nothing of a security nature,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
except that it warns,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
admonishes those who are the President of the letter.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
I mean, let me make a fair distinction.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
The letter I'm not as miserable.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
The Chair has stated that must end our 15 pages

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
to submit the part of the record that none of us could.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I want to just agree with that, Mr. Chairman.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I think that you can delete,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
as our family was deleted in this letter,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
but these security reports me,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
specific individuals,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
the rest of the letter.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
I think it's extremely important.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Chair, I'm ready to rule.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Unless he's willing to be upset by here,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
calling down the committee,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
he will rule that the council's whether committee

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
can seek from the Attorney General,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
the permission suggested by Senator McLeod,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
which has been resided by him and by the Chair.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Mr. Chairman, am I over the point of order?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
You may make a point about it any time, Senator.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Not the committee has a responsibility,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
in view of the fact that there is now,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I was introduced yesterday afternoon,

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
a letter which supports to have come from Mr. J. Hector Hoover,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
and which we are now advised did not come from him,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
does not this committee have a responsibility

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
to ask the Attorney General or somebody,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
where that letter came from?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Mr. Hoover's name is being used,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
and I take it from the witness that he,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
that is Mr. Hoover, has denied the existence

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
of this letter, is that correct?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
This letter is not a copy of any document prepared for the...

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, one that he sent out,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
I think the committee has a great response to the other year,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
to determine where that letter came from.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I think I have a VHF request,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
and it might well be a proper one,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
but I think that we want to find out immediately.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
If whether or not we have a letter,

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
or a letter and a memorandum,

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
the interoperative communication,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
which is admissible, is evidence.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Mr. Hoover, you will determine that.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Point of order, Mr. Hoover.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I just get it available for evidence,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
because it does not violate the order.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Point of order, Mr. Hoover.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
That will be done, Mr. Hoover.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
That will be done, you may take the wine of wine.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Point of order, Mr. Hoover.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
The sheriff said that you had requested Mr. Brownell,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
a commission to use the entire 15-page document.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I would like to ask the sheriff to request,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
that if you cannot use the 15-page document,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I assume you will rule against you on that,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
because it contains names of informants,

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
ask him whether or not you can use that portion of the document,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
which was submitted yesterday.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Find out whether this is a verbatim,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
copy of the FBI memorandum or letter.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And if so, for there's any objection

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
to the introduction of the part of the document,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
omitting a name, which I submit against.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
But it's very important.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Yes, it has been said that it's proper to find out whether we can include any or all,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
or at least enough to determine whether or not that is a verbatim copy.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I'm Mr. Brownell.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Mr. Chairman.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes, I'm hearing whatever we can.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
You can get evidence in this state.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Mr. Chairman, you have further point of order.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I have, Mr. Jackson, this way,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
they completely fall asleep once he says that I represent yesterday.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
So this came from Mr. Hoover.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I made it very clear that I have never received anything from Zedger Hoover,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
that this was not for Zedger, Mr. Hoover.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Mr. Jackson knows that.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And I...

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Why not?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I'm not saying that in a rejection,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
if you said that they came from Mr. Hoover,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
here's a letter for porting to come from Mr. Hoover.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
It's signed by me.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Would you like to get the evidence on it before you make oil statement?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I'm not.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
It's a committee, and certainly it was pretty clear from the testimony yesterday,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
or the discussion here that this was a letter,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
for porting to have been signed by Jay and Mr. Hoover.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to know what that is.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Mr. Jackson, Mr. Chairman,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and I think one of order, Mr. Jackson,

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
has had very deliberately the crazy impression that this did not come from Zedger Hoover.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm sure the evidence will show that this did come from Zedger Hoover,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and that there has been a middle from it.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
That's true.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I would be saying with the testimony,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
if you'd just taken up the testimony,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I would admit.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm a rejection, as long as I testify,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I have got the corrective misdeeds.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
He has testified, and you have testified,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
and he has the money sent under oath,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
and he tries to get the chance to proceed.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Well, Mr. Chairman, that's just a point of order, Mr. Chairman.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I want the records to show.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
But on yesterday, so that we have clear the understanding

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
that you have made the choice to just, if you're willing to wait until you've ten minutes times,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
because it will be just a minute to make sure.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
I just want to make this point in connection with the point of order.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I really may hate to find a way.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
But on page 1722 of the record of the yesterday,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I made this, I asked this question.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
May I ask this question?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm a little confused.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
This is a copy of a letter.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
This is a statement.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
1722.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
This is a copy of a letter that is being introduced.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Now, that's quite clear.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I mean, I made that statement.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
It wasn't denied.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Now, again, this is what Mr. Chancin said.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
On page 1723, you know, were you reading the newspaper today?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Yes, I read what I said.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Now, I'm reading what Mr. Chancin said.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
On page 1723, Mr. Chancin, I'm getting ready to.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
I hold now on the basis of the copy of this letter,

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
on a assumption that no part of interest and no comp will be referred to a spurious manufacturer document,

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
that Senator McCarthy's property examination is a secretary with reference to this letter's holy comp.

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
And, again, on page 1724, Senator McCarthy said this.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
I want to question the secretary as to whether or not the original of this and other letters like it are in his file.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
And then, again, on page 1725, the record, this is what Senator McCarthy said.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
If Mr. Welp is going to say, there is not a copy of this in the Army file he should be formed because that statement is uncruased.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Well, that's very clear cut, May I repeat that, Mr. Chancin?

10:16.000 --> 10:25.000
This is the point of order, and the point is that the representation was made yesterday that this was not represented as a copy of the letter from Mr. Hoover.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
This is Senator McCarthy's statement on page 1725.

10:29.000 --> 10:38.000
If Mr. Welp is going to say, there is not a copy of this in the Army file, he should be formed because that statement is uncruased.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
I have very much of my hands, with the same nature of his possession.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
We have a document here which, according to all the information I have, is verified them.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
The report is given from the FBI, should be in the Army file.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
And I have sent it wire this morning to the Secretary asking for the...

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
The agenda, showing the derogatory material from each individual.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
And I think it is important for Mr. Jackson not to make these statements, but to create these impressions, and he hasn't seen the letters.

11:15.000 --> 11:23.000
If you would look at it, I'm sure we'll find that each and every word, I believe we'll find each and every word is identical.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
So the original letter would be exception.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
The fact that for our we list the names of Port Monmouth Employee.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
The right to say further is list of the names of Port Monmouth Employee.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And the word derogatory is put after it.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
In the FBI report, you will find the derogatory information, and perhaps the name is an informant.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
If that were included in the letter, Mr. Chairman, then it would be objectionable.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
We would be violating the rule by submitting a further committee.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
That security information is not in the letter.

11:55.000 --> 12:03.000
The meat of the letter is here, and I would suggest that we proceed now to examine this young man, so that he can give us a testimony for an article.

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
The chair was raised that he has already ruled that council is secure from the Attorney General.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
The evidence which we can get, if available to us, which will determine.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
The answer to the question is now being discussed under the guise of the point of order.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
Once we get that evidence, certainly the documents before it can be compared and the facts spread out.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I suggest that in the comment you receive the question.

12:29.000 --> 12:41.000
The due discuss with Mr. Hoover, or inquire of him how many copies of that 15 page memorandum was made.

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
The FBI presently had in its file the yellow file copy.

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
The original was sent to the general polling, and a carbon copy was sent to the general Carol.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
To my knowledge, no other copy.

13:00.000 --> 13:10.000
Well, did he state to use specifically whether any other copies were released or transmitted to anyone else at the time?

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
Yes, sir. The yellow copy indicated the distribution of all copies.

13:16.000 --> 13:24.000
And the only distribution shown on the yellow copy was that the original was the general polling and a carbon copy went to general Carol.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And other distribution would be shown.

13:26.000 --> 13:37.000
In other words, the records of the FBI according to Mr. Hoover indicate that there was only the original which went to general polling.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
And the yellow carbon copy which was placed in the permanent FBI file.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
That's correct. That is what the yellow shows.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
I don't want to speak to Mr. Hoover as it may be that I think it's pretty important to find that out.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
I'd like for you to inquire that the Hoover about that.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
I'd like to trace this letter to this memorandum.

14:01.000 --> 14:09.000
If this information that is alleged to be a part of that document,

14:09.000 --> 14:18.000
did not come from Mr. Hoover, and no other letter was released, then the only source it could have come from,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
was the security files of the Army.

14:22.000 --> 14:30.000
Let me say again, Senator McClellan, that Mr. Hoover said that this was not a carbon copy or a copy of any communication.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
I've spoken about the information in this document that has been presented to us.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It had to come from either.

14:37.000 --> 14:45.000
The carbon copy and the FBI files are from the original. That went to the Army.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Okay.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
The United States Air Force has made the copy.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
All right.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I thought.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Senator Carter, you did not have opportunity to leave.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
I'm a detective at the coffee in the FBI file.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Senator Gertan, I've personally avoided the exact same.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
You would therefore have no opportunity to...

15:07.000 --> 15:16.000
did not have opportunity and would not know whether language was identical insofar as the pages available are in terms.

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
Well, Mr. Hoover did say that it contains information relating to the same subject matter,

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
and that in some respects the exact language in both documents is the same.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
That's all.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Introduction.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Well, in talking with Mr. Hoover, did he say that the two letters were similar?

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
That is, the one presented here yesterday, and the interdepartmental memorandum that they...

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
that is the FBI forwarded to the Army and the copy to the Air Force.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Or were they entirely different?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Well, I don't want to put words in his mouth.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
He did not use the word similar.

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
No, but again, I'll use his language that in some respects the language in both documents is the same.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Well, in one case, if the three page letter, I believe, what is it?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
It's two and one quarter pages, two and one quarter, and the other 15 pages.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yes.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
Well, is the letter that was presented to the committee yesterday,

16:21.000 --> 16:28.000
a synopsis of the interdepartmental memorandum of the FBI's then?

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
Well, answer that question. I would have to characterize it myself.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
If you want my characterization based on what my examination is.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Based on your conversation with Mr. Hoover.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Now, this is, understand, is my opinion. He does not make this statement,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
and it's not to be attributed to him.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
In the case of many ways, surely my statement.

16:51.000 --> 17:02.000
It's my opinion that the document presented here yesterday is a summary of the 15 page document.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
In the form of a letter.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
In the form, the form has the thing which from the substance was materially changed.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Yes.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Well, the point is that it is represented that these two documents are the same.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Now, they contain the same language in some respects.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
Yes, but I mean, I'm talking about throughout.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
One, that's 15 pages.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
I'll get tested if I did not have an opportunity to read the 15 pages.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
I bet it's unfair to him to ask him to tell whether it's the same or not if it didn't read.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
Well, I mean based on your conversation with Mr. Hoover if you can't answer it, you can't.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Well, they relate to the same substance matter.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
That's what Mr. Hoover says.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
They do relate to the same substance.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Mr. Chairman.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Mr. Chairman.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Can you tell me your point of order?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Yes, I'm point of order.

17:45.000 --> 17:54.000
Mr. Backfield has stated that the qualification with the representative that this will be a carbon copy of the same.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
It's even an examiner letter.

17:55.000 --> 18:05.000
If you will find an page two to indicate in parentheses that security information is omitted in two different places.

18:05.000 --> 18:15.000
And I think before the senator makes these statements, he should examine yesterday's documents unless he has the reluctance Mr. Stevens had to glance at it.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Well, I haven't had a chance to see a copy.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I let it with.

18:19.000 --> 18:30.000
So, Mark, personal I believe and confidential on the envelope on the letter and it was suggested that the matter be first taken up with the FBI before we all start reading it.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I didn't read it.

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
Did Mr. Hoover indicate you were just a letter that was introduced to the President of the committee yesterday might have come from?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
That was the first time, of course, that he ever saw.

18:43.000 --> 18:49.000
And the only document in the bureau files is the carbon copy or the yellow copy of the 15 page memorandum.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
This is not a copy of any document in the bureau file.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I saw.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Senator Fletcher.

18:56.000 --> 19:09.000
Mr. Collier, did Mr. Hoover and his conversation with you state that it was possible that they could give a summary of the 15 page documents without having a copy in their file.

19:10.000 --> 19:26.000
No, no, I would say that Mr. Hoover's search files had to file search and the only memorandum that was sent to General Bowling on that state was the 15 page memorandum.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
And there is no other, there is no copy of this or anything like it in the bureau file.

19:32.000 --> 19:41.000
The only thing is the 15 page interdepartmental memorandum that was sent to General Bowling and a carbon copy to General Keller.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
Is my understanding of the set letter that you hold your hand?

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
It's not signed but it's tight.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
Mr. Judge, the difference basically is that this is a form of a letter.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
It starts out to the citation search and at the end, sincerely yours, Jay Etcher, Hoover Director.

20:01.000 --> 20:16.000
Whereas the FBI original 15 page document was in the form of state January 26, 51, 2, Major General A.R. Bowling from John Etcher, Hoover Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
Such a, that was that out. No signature appeared on that document. That is not a type of document, but his sign.

20:23.000 --> 20:30.000
Did Mr. Hoover express you any interest of how that about that document?

20:30.000 --> 20:40.000
No, sir, I merely talked to him concerning the facts as to whether or not this was authentic. I did not get an opinion from him on a dashboard, he didn't bother.

20:40.000 --> 21:00.000
Now what if he expressed any opinion as to whether the Army or the Air Force who had, I assume, the large 15 page documents that they could have made a synopsis of the 15 page documents in the 2.5 page letter that you know I have.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
And, and sent it out as a report from Jay, the Hoover.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
I can say categorically that Mr. Hoover in my presence did not make any, thanks or any such a thing.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Thank you, sir.

21:14.000 --> 21:28.000
Senator Simon, you do? Mr. Colleague, am I correct that Mr. Jay, Edgar Hoover has to, or suggested to this committee, that prior to the publication of this document,

21:28.000 --> 21:39.000
that it be a, the matter be consulted with the Attorney General of the United States to see whether the publication of the document was in the interest of the security of the United States, lies correct, Senator Simon.

21:39.000 --> 21:48.000
Mr. Chairman, I hope that we carry out the recommendation of Mr. Hoover in that regard prior to the release of the document.

21:48.000 --> 21:59.000
Mr. Chairman, may I then say that I reemphasize that it be done, Mr. Chairman?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
It will be done.

22:02.000 --> 22:13.000
I'd like to point out, if I may, to the committee that yesterday, I made a notice of the fact that the document was not signed by Mr. Hoover.

22:13.000 --> 22:22.000
One of the reasons for doing this is I received a great many documents, Mr. Hoover, during my term of office and the executive branch of the government.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.000
I never received one in this form, that's all I have to do.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Senator Whiteback?

22:32.000 --> 22:49.000
No enough about the particular FBI to know whether it has been customary when the Department of the Department of the United States is ready to have the director sign his name, or whether it's a name is merely typed by Mr. Nover.

22:49.000 --> 23:02.000
I spent over 10 and a half years in the FBI, the last six I spent as an administrative capacity for writing such memorandum as this, so I have some knowledge of them.

23:02.000 --> 23:12.000
The memorandum that was sent on January 26, 1951 is, as I said, an interdepartmental memorandum.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
It does not only original carry any signature or any initials.

23:17.000 --> 23:31.000
The yellow copy in the serial files does carry the signature of the person who actually prepared the memorandum, and detected it and detected it, as well as those approving that memorandum.

23:32.000 --> 23:44.000
Now, in some instances, those go all the way to Mr. Hoover, and he personally, initials them in some instances when he is out of town on business, someone does it in his big hand.

23:44.000 --> 23:58.000
But this memorandum, which I have in my hand, which is the one that's all in, is in the form of a letter, sir, and very true, it's in fairly yours, which would require then a signature of Jay at your Hoover.

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
And the memorandum is different from the form being used at that time.

24:04.000 --> 24:17.000
The interdepartmental memorandum I had is the type that was and is then used by the FBI in corresponding with other government departments and agencies in general courts of existence.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
Well, is this like the Murray or not for Mr. Hoover's design a carbon copy of a T-letter like that?

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
He would not sign the carbon copy of a letter, and it goes out over his signature and he would sign the original.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
It would be like this, it would be like the Sonaga for our own flat-trust.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Mr. Calier, am I?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I do not know the order of President.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
You will follow Mr. Welch.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm Mr. Smith, the chair of the committee of the President, Mr. Welch, with the first opportunity to question his book.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
I would have the first opportunity to touch and mine.

25:05.000 --> 25:15.000
This young man is called for the purpose of pressifying in regard to a document that my hand has introduced before I was...

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
Mr. Calier, you are correct, I have perfectly avoided it because it contains security information.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
I don't know what your answer will be, but may I ask you to answer your question?

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
Mr. Calier, am I correct in thinking that you did not read the 15-page document in the file to the FBI?

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
You are correct, I have perfectly avoided it because it contains security information.

25:38.000 --> 25:45.000
I don't know what your answer will be, but may I ask whether or not you read the short document about the actual question you in a moment?

25:45.000 --> 26:00.000
It's been a little hard on Smith to carry it around all night, I have read it to some extent, however I will say truthfully that I have insofar as possible avoided reading the entire document.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
I have merely read it with the idea of a centipede.

26:05.000 --> 26:15.000
That Mr. Calier is because you are as sharply aware as I am that it is a crime to hand these documents around, is that right?

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
Well, at least I'm afraid sir, we'll have to be your characterization of my...

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
Well, you know if the crime to disclose this security information do you not?

26:25.000 --> 26:37.000
I understand it, there is a quite eventual directive which requires all personnel to refrain from disclosing any information containing loyalty or security.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
Dan, were you in the courtroom yesterday when I declined to read the letter?

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
Yes sir, and when Secretary Steven declined to read the letter?

26:45.000 --> 26:53.000
Yes sir, and I have observed that of now so far as it was humanly possible for you to do so, you have declined to read the letter.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
That's right, I have read it.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
Would you hand me this hot document which I will not read?

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
I wish to call your attention only to what I saw yesterday.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
You of course have read the address, haven't you?

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
Yes sir, I have read the address and all parts of the form rather than the substripe.

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
Now I think I will do no wrong in my reasoning heading, federal Bureau of Investigation.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
January 26, 1951, are you following me, sir?

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Then appears the words which I read yesterday and which psychos me so.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
Personal and confidential be of the Ozon, is that right? That is correct.

27:37.000 --> 27:51.000
And then this purported carbon copy of a letter has this appearing, major general bowling, a distant, deep, or fast-deaf who departed the Army worse than these, these, sir.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
That is correct.

27:54.000 --> 28:06.000
Now passing the body of it which is coming only to the conclusion, it appears that the bottom of it is in barely your comma and then tight in capital letters.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
J. Edgar Hoover, director. Is that right?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
That is correct.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Come into tenure as I understand your testimony.

28:15.000 --> 28:25.000
This document that I hold in my hands is a carbon copy of pre-pricing nothing, is that right?

28:25.000 --> 28:33.000
I will say it, Mr. Hoover, inform me that it is not a carbon copy of a memorandum prepared or sent by the FDA.

28:33.000 --> 28:40.000
Let's have it straight from the shoulders. If I as you know, it's a carbon copy of pre-pricing nothing.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
The far as I know it is yet, but that's again it.

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
And so far as you know this document in this courtroom, from yesterday by Senator McCarthy, is a perfect poem.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Is that right?

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
That is your conclusion. I will not say that well.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
You just told us that it's a carbon copy of pre-pricing nothing.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
I've said it, it's not a copy of a document in the FBI file.

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
And I will not say that it is a copy of nothing because if it was placed as a carbon there must have been an origin.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
Well you would think so, but we can find no trace of an original canvas, not so yet.

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
Anywhere, no sir. And if no original of this document can be found,

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
would you go along with me there with my quainting wigs when I say it's a copy of pre-pricing nothing?

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
You're assuming that the original cannot be found.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
My investigation yesterday was to determine whether this was an authentic document.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
I have made no investigation to determine whether the original can be found or not.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
It may be that it can be found.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Well you can't find a copy of it in the FBI place, can you?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
No sir.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Now.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
You do not own your investigation.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Like it out.

30:04.000 --> 30:10.000
You are not as you sit in this chair in possession of a single fat,

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
which will allow you to believe that the documents which I now show you

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
is a copy of a carbon copy of any existing original letter.

30:21.000 --> 30:28.000
I made an examination yesterday to determine whether this was a copy of a document prepared or sent to the FBI.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I have not.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Well have you any doubts, sir, that it was presented in this room as if it were?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
I have not.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
I will never find really a proof of truth.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I do not now remember the...

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
Mr. Jenkins was handed a document which he believed to be a carbon copy of a letter?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Well I would be for Mr. Jenkins to say.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
Well did you believe it was a carbon copy of a letter when you first heard it in this room?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
It was referred to as a copy of a letter.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Yes.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
And I observed it.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
I can draw no further from this.

30:59.000 --> 31:07.000
And now as you sit in this room, you are unable to tell us all the information you have been able to make last night.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
you
