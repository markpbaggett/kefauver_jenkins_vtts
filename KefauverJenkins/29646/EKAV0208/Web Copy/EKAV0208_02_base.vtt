WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.560
So, uh, of course, I'm to be re-examined physically, I believe, in, uh, the early summer of

00:10.560 --> 00:11.560
1954.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.560
You mean 1953?

00:12.560 --> 00:13.560
You know, 1953, you're right.

00:13.560 --> 00:14.560
You're right, Summer.

00:14.560 --> 00:15.560
Do you mean June?

00:15.560 --> 00:16.560
Around that time, yes, sir.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.560
Well, Mr. Gold you knew in July of course.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.560
You knew ever since June.

00:19.560 --> 00:20.560
The day shine was likely to be over.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.560
He drafted the Army, didn't you?

00:22.560 --> 00:25.560
Sir, the first step was the physical of the re-examination.

00:25.560 --> 00:30.560
If he were kept in the status when she had been a physical disqualification, he could not

00:30.560 --> 00:31.560
have been.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.560
There was after he passed the physical examination or was found, it was found that the physical

00:35.560 --> 00:37.560
defect he had was remedied.

00:37.560 --> 00:42.560
Uh, from that point on, I would say he certainly was eligible for call back in the arm.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.560
So, you know, you know, you're right.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.560
Well, when did he face his physical?

00:46.560 --> 00:47.560
It was July, I believe, sir.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.560
In July?

00:48.560 --> 00:49.560
Yes, sir.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.560
The early part of July.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.560
Yes, sir.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.560
Now, when in July specifically?

00:52.560 --> 00:53.560
The early part.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.560
Sometimes before the day of July.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.560
Yes, sir.

00:55.560 --> 01:13.000
Then from a period prior to the eight-day of July until he was actually inducted on November

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
13th, you knew Mr. Cohn that they shine in all likelihood be inducted in the Army, did

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
you not?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yes, sir.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
Well, Mr. Cohn, I remember passing you that also.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yes, sir.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
The members of the staff unit, common knowledge among the members of the staff, that's where

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
they know the secrets, sir.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I bet it was certainly no secrets.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
That's what we understand, sir.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.360
Well, Mr. Cohn, did you not then when you realized that there was a senator that you were

01:52.360 --> 01:54.360
about to lose the member of your staff?

01:54.360 --> 01:58.000
Why did you not then take steps to replace this young man?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.200
So, it wasn't a question of replacing him or was the question of the work which he was

02:02.200 --> 02:05.000
doing and had previously been doing.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Well, I know, but now you knew it, sir.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Certainly, before the eight-day of July, the year the young man that was going to leave

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
it, do you mean to say that after July 8th, you gave him some many work to wish your man

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
to leave?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yes, sir.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
We used them long as we could.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Notwithstanding the fact that you knew that you know about when he was the inducted?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
No, sir.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
Did you know about what time or the nearly elapsed between the pricing of a physical examination

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
and the actual induction?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I think the time varies, sir.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
And in this case, it was July, August, September, October, four months, wasn't it?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yes, sir.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
And in spite of that fact, you continued to keep work to him from time to time.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Is that right, Mr. Gold?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yes, sir.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Knowing that ultimately you were meeting?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yes, sir.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
Well, can you explain to this committee why this McCarthy Committee, staying on this tremendously

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
important work, as you say?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
A digging out from you, this is subversive, and all that sort of thing.

03:10.000 --> 03:19.000
Head on its path, the young man, whom you knew you would lose, but to whom you say you continued

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
to assign additional work.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Now, Mr. Gold, why did you do that if you have any explanation?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yes, sir.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
The reason is that the work assigned to him was additional work dealing with matters on which

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
he had already begun to work and matters on which he had special knowledge.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
What character of work has he been doing and has he done from, we'll say in January,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
is that about anything, isn't it?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I think it's February, are you my wife?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
All right.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
January, February, what character of work have they assigned me doing from the insubcantiness

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
in climate, percent of the McCarthy up to GIA?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I would say just about everything, sir.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
For Mr. Gold, could you, could you be a little more particularly?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I could, sir.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And tell us just what character you're working to do now?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yes, sir.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
We're going to get along better now, you know, we'll get anxious.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes, sir.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
And you, you, you repeated the being, and I'm out of the now, one of the smartest lawyers in these parts.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I deny it, sir.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
We're all right.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
All right.

04:24.000 --> 04:32.000
Now, my question was, what character of work was Dave Shine doing from, we'll say early in February,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
assuming that when he came to send him a gun, that's it you guys.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Very well, sir.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
Dave Shine came with the committee of non-pacencelden originally to work on an investigation of the information,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
United States Information Program and the Voice of America,

04:49.000 --> 04:58.000
matters to which Dave had given a number of years study and writing before he did come with our committee.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
The type of work he did to answer your question was this.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
He interviewed personally and on many occasions, in fact most occasions, along,

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
I would say hundreds of witnesses working at the Voice of America and in various parts of the information program

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
and having knowledge of the Voice of America and the information program.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
He checked out the facts obtained from these witnesses, obtained documentation,

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
participated in the setting up of what were a large number of executive sessions and public hearings

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
held by this committee in connection with that investigation.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Now, behind the refugees, I ain't showing it.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
He interviewed hundreds of witnesses.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
He did.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
With respect to the Voice of America, we said.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
He did, sir.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
All right.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
Mr. Coleman, of course, he documented the names of those witnesses.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Clarson?

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
A document of the names of many of those witnesses, sir.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
And for not all of them, you mean me?

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
I can't say that he documented the names of all of them, sir.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
And you have tires in your office here in this building, didn't you, sir?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
We do, sir.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You have stenographers and secretaries, and you're disposal.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
We do, sir.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
You keep a file on each individual investigation?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
We do, sir.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm approaching heavy-tile on these signs, work with respect to the Voice of America, didn't you?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
So a limited extensor.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, where your files are, on other cases, to a limited extent?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Very probably, sir.

06:38.000 --> 06:47.000
Mr. Coleman, do you mean to tell us that they shine and can't arm this work with respect to the Voice of America?

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
Did not I steer his conference or interview with each witness, making memorandum for the file?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
No, sir.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
And you say there were hundreds of such witnesses?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes, sir.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
They were memorandum made of a trial briefs we call them.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'll interview with a great number of witnesses.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
There are a number of witnesses, as to whom no such trial briefs were memorandum, amazing.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I'd be glad to tell you why, sir.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Did you work with him in the interviewing of those hundreds of witnesses with respect to the Voice of America?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Some occasions I did, sir.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
I'm some I did not.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
On those occasions, when you worked with him, did you make a file?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm some I did, and some I did not.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Those in Washington I did.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Very frequently, those interviewed in New York, I did not.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Why did you not make a file on those in New York and a memorandum of,

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
I've at least just the nopsest of their testimonies, their names, and their ad-rates?

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
Sir, because when we were in Washington, we had our secretarial staff available down here,

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
and we would dictate after talking with the witness the trial brief for a memorandum.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
When we worked up in New York, we engaged and outside stenographer to come in

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
and do that same pipe work up in New York for us.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
That went on for a short period of time, and when the bill was submitted by the outside stenographer,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
that bill was disallowed by the Senate dispersing office, which said we had no right to have

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Senator Rehires, Senator Grafick help in New York.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
From that point on, what I believe we did not hire Senator Grafick help in New York.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
We made some pencil notes, some pen notes, but we did not maintain this trial brief system,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
which we did in the case of Washington witnesses.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Well, now you've shuffled back and forth between New York and Washington, didn't we did?

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
I mean, we didn't have us in order to register disposal of all times in New York,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
didn't we did not sir?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
But when you didn't have, you made pencil notes, you say?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
On some occasions we did sir.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
For Mr. Cohen, if you examine, they wit me.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
With respect to subversion, our subversity, half again,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
a divorce of America, whatever you want with us.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
Do you mean to tell us Mr. Cohen that you didn't vim and back?

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
Right down the name of that witness, his address, his telephone number?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Is that what you said?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
On all occasions we did not sir.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
On all occasions both, can you explain why you were, why you were supposed to always be?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I'm talking about material with this issue.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Witnesses are by whom you would expect to establish facts.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
I think if you interview the witness, then you know things you didn't gain a thing about it.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
And they, science, knowledge of that witness, wouldn't be important to you.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Not if he knew nothing on a particular point of course.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Well, it might develop with this one qualification, sir.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
It might develop that a witness would say something which we were not interested in on that point.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
Something might later arise and we would think back that there were witnesses we had talked to

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
who did have something to say on something which we weren't then interested in but which had come up later.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
That happened.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
But what you're telling me, sir, is now that you and Mr. Shahn would go and interview these witnesses

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
as to obtain the areas and knowledge, instead of the knowledge,

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
and would not of all times even make a notation, a memorandum of their names in their addresses.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Is that right Mr. Cohen?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Yes it is, sir.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
Well, can you give the committee any explanation of why you conducted your investigations in that manner?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Yes, sir.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
The first explanation I can give to the committee on that is I think members of the committee know

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
as we have a very limited staff, they work hard, they know no hours, they work nights,

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
they work times, they would not allow us the nographer to work.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
They talk on occasion to dozens of witnesses in different places on a day and on a night.

10:49.000 --> 11:00.000
This small group of people down on that staff do a job, a wonderful job which is not done by people many times in number

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I think in a lot of other places.

11:02.000 --> 11:11.000
And I think that if there are some lapses in efficiency or a file or the set-up is not what it might be at the end.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
At a large cooperation of something like that I think the members of the committee can understand the limitations under which we work.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
And if there is any blame to be attached for certain lack of efficiency on some things I am sure that blame is mine.

11:24.000 --> 11:37.000
Mr. Cohen, was it, was that one reason why you wanted to save China to your disposal, the social,

11:37.000 --> 11:46.000
the hiking was conducted in the army, that is, to give you the responsibility on his investigations with these witnesses.

11:46.000 --> 11:56.000
Generally, yes sir, you are right there, one important category was the fact that there have been witnesses to whom he had sought concerning

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
when we needed information for more complete information than we had.

12:00.000 --> 12:18.000
And going through file or going into other matters it became necessary and the Senate of Macrossi found it necessary on a number of occasions for us to communicate with Mr. Shine and get information from him or get clarification and advice from him on certain situations.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Well that's, when you would get that information from Mr. Shine.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yes sir.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Was that the documented information that he had or just what he had the larger here in his range in his mind?

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
A good deal of it sir was information which he had in his mind, we would sometimes go down with lists of witnesses.

12:36.000 --> 12:45.000
I came across one the other day and he would give us his recollection as to what those witnesses could or could not help us on, especially remember it.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
There were other occasions when there was not documentation.

12:50.000 --> 13:15.000
So when you realized that prior to July 8th, this young man was going to leave you, why didn't his limbs have him sit down with Mr. Nautilus, here in Washington and document all of this information that there was particularly with his own knowledge in about which nobody else knew.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
We just take certain steps along the line sir.

13:17.000 --> 13:28.000
I know Mr. Hohenberg, why didn't you do what I asked you there? Why didn't you have Bay Shine sit down with Mr. Lager Bernstein in effect now Bay? You're leaving us.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
You know facts that we want to know. So down here in Dictates because you're going, why didn't you do that, Mr. Hohen?

13:36.000 --> 13:47.000
We did not do that to a complete extensor because it was impossible for us at that time to anticipate every single thing that might arise on a later occasion.

13:47.000 --> 13:55.000
We tried to anticipate some of the important things. We tried to cover them. We were successful in front cases. And others we were not successful.

13:55.000 --> 14:09.000
Our communications were saved after he was in. We were about things which arose on the spot then and which needed clarification where we needed some information from him.

14:09.000 --> 14:19.000
And you say that subsequently July 8th when you knew you were going to continue to give additional assignments of work to Lee?

14:19.000 --> 14:31.000
He continued to work for us sir on matter. I don't believe he started any new matters. But he continued to work for us on matters which he had been working up until the very time he went into.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
Now in the main he's been working on matters pertaining to the birth of America we understand.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
That was certainly one of the very important things he was doing.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
What other important thing was you doing with school?

14:43.000 --> 14:57.000
He was working on preliminary investigations of the Army of another of a certain government intelligence agency, not the FBI.

14:57.000 --> 15:07.000
He was working on a preliminary investigation concerning possible delay in the development of the hydrogen bomb, possible communist connections.

15:07.000 --> 15:22.000
On the part of persons concerned with the development of the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb he was working on communist infiltration in the United Nations and UNESCO.

15:22.000 --> 15:33.000
He worked on the government printing office investigations. There are undoubtedly others that pose a one which specifically occurred in the right now.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
How many people were on your stand?

15:37.000 --> 15:47.000
Very few unfortunately I believe sir we had about nine or ten working men. That subject the correction I might be one or two of.

15:47.000 --> 16:05.000
I might say this was the Jenkins the setup at the beginning the first six months or so such that practically the only people working on certain things were Dave Shine and myself for some occasional help from one or two other investigators.

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
The rest of the subcommittee staff was working on investigations with which I had nothing to do under the direction of Senator McCartney.

16:13.000 --> 16:23.000
Well now Mr. Cohn from July 8th to November 3rd is the period of approximate the four months isn't it?

16:23.000 --> 16:31.000
I'm doing that for much paid you and the senator from which comes to you that this boy was leaving you.

16:31.000 --> 16:41.000
And in spite of that fact you're telling this committee that you did not have him being get his works heard.

16:41.000 --> 16:54.000
Get his report to him from Rita's memorandum so that you would have the benefit of all the knowledge that he had when they came that he put on the uniform of the United States Army.

16:54.000 --> 17:07.000
My answer to Jenkins there is that we took as many steps as we possibly could consistent with us that up to transfer work and say the things with which he was involved would be carried out without him.

17:07.000 --> 17:15.000
But we did not do what I just said we did not and could not have done a complete job we tried if we did not succeed.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
And on the other hand you could continue to assign additional work to the judge.

17:21.000 --> 17:31.000
When you say additional work Mr. Jenkins I don't think we are saying any work on any no investigation to Mr. Shine from that point on.

17:31.000 --> 17:44.000
Mr. Cohn since July 8th and report November 3rd, did you have files made up as a result of reports given by Dave Shine?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Sir undoubtedly reports given by him sir.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Are they Davey?

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
I don't know sir I haven't looked out the glance to insupply to you whatever we have.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Here was Davey.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
F***ing the officers I imagine.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
Now we've already just sent you down there with the examination of breams and proceed to MacArthur statements if you work.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
In all of the sudden they have thousands of files out there is that right?

18:04.000 --> 18:13.000
I am again going to say that I probably am guilty of inefficiency here sir but I don't believe I have ever personally gone through any of these.

18:13.000 --> 18:20.000
I would say that there must be a thousand files or something like that.

18:20.000 --> 18:27.000
Well if you go through the file on the voice of America I have not to sometimes.

18:27.000 --> 18:39.000
There is no file on the voice of America as such as I know Mr. Jenkins there are probably upwards of a hundred files dealing with the information program in the voice of America investigation.

18:40.000 --> 18:48.000
Mr. Carr keeps the file as a safety can I think according to an FCI technique which I think is good and it is somewhat difficult to understand.

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
But there are a great number of files on the voice of America and the information program investigation.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Mr. Cohn can you produce the earth in the report?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
It's documented.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
Made by Dave Shine between July and November 3rd.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
I imagine sir.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
You have that?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I am sure it will be one of the files because.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
You sure that you can.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Yes sir.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
What will you do sir?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I would be glad to see you.

19:14.000 --> 19:23.000
Can you Mr. Cohn produce the committee in its documents prepared by Dave Shine here is eight weeks training at four days?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I can.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
You can.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Yes sir.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
What were those reports on?

19:27.000 --> 19:43.000
The first of the principal things there was the three interim reports of this subcommittee on the investigation it conducted on the information agency in the voice of America specifically.

19:43.000 --> 19:54.000
The three interim reports are on number one I believe the engineering facilities of the voice of America subtitled bakery, Baker West.

19:54.000 --> 20:04.000
Number two the United States information centers and number three the information agency proper of the voice of America as a subdivision.

20:04.000 --> 20:20.000
What sections relating to those interim reports which appear in the annual report of the subcommittee substantial parts of those reports were prepared by Dave Shine while he was in the arms.

20:20.000 --> 20:28.000
And the further answer your question sir I imagine some of his notes are around some other things on those lines.

20:28.000 --> 20:39.000
So the principal reason that you wanted conferences was Mr. Shine if he was vested in the army was to assist you in preparing the reports that you spoken of.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
So I don't know if it was the most important information we got.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
What was the most important with Cohn?

20:44.000 --> 21:04.000
Well they might be a different sort of opinion on the fact about that some of the boys feel that the most important matter is discussed with him for interviews which he had conducted interviews which he had conducted concerning fort lineman and the radar installations and information which he had about that.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
For those interviews documented for me sir.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
For those interviews.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Riddings to writing.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
I don't know if they were or not.

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
I know that information was obtained from him and I know that certain action was taken on the basis of that information.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Who interviewed you?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
On that?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yes.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I talked to him about that.

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
Senator McCarthy talks on Jim Julianna talks on I believe Frank Cox.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
And sometimes you talk to him on the post report date?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Yes sir.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
So he was the fourth Dicks mystery Cohn.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Did he do any inventing any work for the committee?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Investigative?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yes.

21:43.000 --> 21:56.000
The only investigative work he would have done sir is I think that after training on certain weekends area of death the training I think it's a lot of that he did interview a number of witnesses.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
And do you know what respect the one subject?

22:00.000 --> 22:10.000
I can at this moment sir recall one dealing with communism in defense plans.

22:10.000 --> 22:18.000
I think that he talked with some witnesses he had been handling on the Voice of America and information program investigation.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Did he make a written memoranda of those interviews?

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
I am inclined to think that he did sir and backed on the Voice of America.

22:26.000 --> 22:33.000
I know he caused a witness to whom he talked to draw off a written report with certain statements and recommendations.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
I believe he had that written report sent to me with a copy for him.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I noticed that the other day.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Well, Mr. Cohn.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
So just back to the work then but Mr. Shane.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
The committee was the sport takes a little later.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
You being a lawyer of course.

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
Understand the importance of the independence of the three great branches of the government.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I just have to say.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
You understand the reason why it is a check in the development.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
And that one should be and must be entirely independent of the others.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
I think I can agree with you to a certain extent.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
I am sure you don't want my views on the separation of powers.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
I believe that there of necessity has to be a certain amount of overlapping and working together.

23:33.000 --> 23:39.000
I don't believe the complete independence of the three branches should mean the fight of one branch by another branch.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
You of course were originally the lady branch.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Yes sir.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
To take their seasons with the executive branch.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Yes sir.

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
And he knew this boy was about a member of the army.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
You knew it's time to rely on him.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Yes sir.

24:02.000 --> 24:10.000
I'll ask him Mr. Cohn whether or not you know the Sunday McCarthy first post the General Rebar on July 8th.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
I don't know the exact date but General Rebar says until I 8th I'm sure that's it.

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
And you heard General Rebar says that Senator McCarthy on that date has him for a direct commission.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
I don't know if the testimony was the senator asked him for it.

24:25.000 --> 24:33.000
I think there was sir. I'm correct that he wanted to know if Dave was qualified for a commission in the army.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
And what he should do and put those two get it.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Yes sir.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
I don't know if you want General Rebar said we're talking about the 8th they have you lying now.

24:43.000 --> 24:52.000
And General Rebar was the general in the army as you know and the men conducted the senator McCarthy.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
And he was the stand as the sort of a liaison officer between the army and the Senate.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
You knew that?

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
Well I know sir that it developed a general Rebar job was the processing of applications just such as this.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
I think you want General Rebar says on page 24.

25:11.000 --> 25:24.000
At that time Senator McCarthy informed me that he was very much interested in obtaining a direct reserve commission for his consultant Mr. D. David Cheyne.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
But the bone you heard General Rebar just about that didn't you?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Like this.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
You knew that Senator McCarthy did that didn't you?

25:31.000 --> 25:44.000
I the conversation I heard sir was Senator McCarthy asking General Rebar whether Dave Cheyne would qualify for a commission and if he would, how Dave would go about applying for it.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
And I point out further to you the testimony of General Rebar.

25:48.000 --> 26:00.000
The second point out is our recall is that he felt that Mr. Cheyne because of his background of investigating his investigative experience with the committee was fully qualified for a commission.

26:00.000 --> 26:14.000
Mr. Bone you as I am an occasion much yes sir and the father about that time as I recall it a few minutes back then he shaded my conversation with Senator Mr. Wright team in Mr. Roy Cohn game in the room.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
That's correct isn't it?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Yes sir.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
And he said his brother Mr. Cohn also emphasized that too is it Mr. Cohn?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Emphasize what sir?

26:26.000 --> 26:39.000
Emphasize if he says that he is that this boy I was qualified for reason of his investigative experience for a commission in the Army.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
I'm sure I could have said that.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And you emphasize that.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
I'm Mr. Cohn nothing wrong with that as far as I'm concerned.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Well I understand that if that's just the isolated days it's in nothing else.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And I didn't mean there was nothing wrong with the actor I don't think there is.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I meant there was nothing I have no disagreement with that testimony.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
But it's that time now.

26:57.000 --> 27:13.000
A United States Senator and you as the chief counsel we're talking to General Rebar about a commission for your friends, close companions and the members of the Casi Investigating Staff that's correct isn't it?

27:13.000 --> 27:30.000
It's correct that it's extensor we were talking to the man on Capitol Hill charged with the duty of processing applications such as this for people working on Capitol Hill about an application that might be filed by someone who was working on Capitol Hill.

27:30.000 --> 27:42.000
And you wanted his friend of yours and you wanted this member of the McCarty staff to receive a direct commission instead of entering the Army as a whole private duty.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I thought he was entitled to a commission.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
I know but I'm sorry. Oh yes I thought he was entitled to a commission. I told him.

27:48.000 --> 27:56.000
Yes. And Mr. Cohn I will ask you if it isn't a thing.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
That's from that time that is July 8th until the lights say July.

28:03.000 --> 28:12.000
It's eight of about 22 or 22 days. If he didn't call General Rebar practically every day.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
Who will respect the list of this commission for these day the chance.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
No sir. How many times did you call him?

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
I have no idea how many times sir I can give you a general idea.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
All right will you please do so.

28:25.000 --> 28:36.000
As we as General Rebar testified I believe when he was leaving Senate and McCarty's office the senators told me General Rebar's presence to follow the matter up with General Rebar.

28:36.000 --> 28:46.000
I did that. I don't know how many times I spoke to General Rebar I would say it might have been three times four times something like that.

28:46.000 --> 29:01.000
I do know sir that I would place a call to General Rebar and it would usually be two or three days before I would get the thoughts from he apparently spent most of his time up on Capitol Hill joining in and out of the offices of the various senators and the various committees.

29:01.000 --> 29:07.000
And he was a busy man and it was no easy job to get him on the telephone.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
I don't think I talked with him every day. He's got his age.

29:10.000 --> 29:18.000
Close exciteration. Mr. Cohn I'll ask you if you're bidding the emphasize with General Rebar than the facility for fees.

29:18.000 --> 29:26.000
Indeed it's getting this boy a commission knowing that once he was drafted it would then be too late to get a commission.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
I think that's a fair statement.

29:29.000 --> 29:36.000
Now how many times would you say Mr. Cohn that you called this general in the army about this one boy?

29:36.000 --> 29:47.000
I would think the follow-up call that to the conversation when General Rebar was going to look into it might have been four or three or four or five something like that.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
So it was carried in the month.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Over a period of some time.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Whatever it is sir three weeks.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
Did you deny that you called him practically everything that you called?

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Every day sir.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Yes.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
I certainly deny that I spoke with him every day.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Now about calling him every day.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
I might have told Francis the Revers in the office to place a call to General Rebar.

30:16.000 --> 30:23.000
If the call replaced the General Rebar and General Rebar were not there as a normal practice.

30:23.000 --> 30:31.000
Our secretary would place the call again that afternoon probably place it again the next morning.

30:31.000 --> 30:37.000
And I suppose that would go on until I got General Rebar on the phone and saw it.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
As far as my having spoke on the phone with General Rebar every day.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I don't think I did sir.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Mr. Cohn you know I'm sure I didn't.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
You know who General Rebar is?

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
You know it's a character.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You know it's a recognition book.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
It's not the same thing.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
It's not the same thing.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
It's not the same thing.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
It's not the same thing.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
It's not the same thing.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I know I know he has.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I have no reason to doubt that.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Yes sir.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I want to read you some testimony of the eight thirty to the records.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
General Rebar.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
I first met Christensen.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
How many telephone calls would you have to make you a thing?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
General Rebar.
