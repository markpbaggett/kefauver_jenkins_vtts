WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
about them to come on the graph in the Gavill,

00:02.500 --> 00:05.000
the Senator DeBorgeshot takes his place.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.500
And there's Mr. Mark Gallium.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.500
The Secretary of the Democratic Party.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.000
And Senator Mark.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
May we welcome to order?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.500
For the information of the newspaper,

00:20.500 --> 00:23.000
men, we will close at 12.15.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.500
Mr. Norris, that's 12.30.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.500
We can give the time to get over to the joint station

00:26.500 --> 00:29.500
of Congress to hear Emperor Harry Celessi.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.500
And we will resume promptly at 2 o'clock as you do.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.500
So the recess this noon will be 12.15 until 2.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.500
It's 12.30 from 2.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.500
To our guests in the committee room,

00:39.500 --> 00:42.500
the chair would like to extend the customary morning greetings

00:42.500 --> 00:44.500
and a word of welcome.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.500
And to point out to you, if you are here for the first time,

00:47.500 --> 00:50.500
that we have a standing committee room

00:50.500 --> 00:52.500
against any audible manifestations

00:52.500 --> 00:56.500
of approval or disapproval at any time in any manner.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.500
And the officers in the room and the plan clothesman

01:00.500 --> 01:02.500
have instructions from the committee

01:02.500 --> 01:05.500
to immediately escort from the room politely,

01:05.500 --> 01:07.500
but for what?

01:07.500 --> 01:12.500
Anyone who violates the terms by which you enter the committee room,

01:12.500 --> 01:16.500
which is to refrain entirely from manifestations of approval

01:16.500 --> 01:18.500
or disapproval.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.500
The audience has been splendid.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.500
I must say that from the standpoint of audience,

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
non-participation needs have been the most welcome.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.500
These have been the most welcome hearing of the chair

01:28.500 --> 01:30.500
has ever known as non-capital hill.

01:30.500 --> 01:34.500
And I want to salute once again the capital police

01:34.500 --> 01:37.500
and their associates and our friends in the audience

01:37.500 --> 01:41.500
for conforming completely with the committee room.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
To the country notwithstanding,

01:43.500 --> 01:46.500
we want the guards to remove from the room immediately

01:46.500 --> 01:49.500
anybody, if in a pre-how a day's spirit this morning,

01:49.500 --> 01:53.500
you should violate that standing admiration of the chair.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.500
You left off as of yesterday with counsel Jenkins

01:57.500 --> 02:01.500
engaging in direct examination of Mr. Corn,

02:01.500 --> 02:05.500
a witness on the so-called McCarthy Corn side of the country

02:05.500 --> 02:06.500
ratio.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.500
He will continue with this time with his direct examination,

02:09.500 --> 02:12.500
which he tells me he will conclude.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.500
A very short time, so wonderful,

02:15.500 --> 02:19.500
at which time will wipe off his smile,

02:19.500 --> 02:22.500
put on his crown and proceed with a crossing examination.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
Counsel Jenkins.

02:24.500 --> 02:30.500
The stone, I think, I have only two questions to ask you.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.500
One is with respect to the leaf payments.

02:34.500 --> 02:39.500
However the payment to you, I'll certain money by Mr. Adams,

02:39.500 --> 02:43.500
father, theater, and high spite tickets.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
Because I understand if you have another statement

02:45.500 --> 02:47.500
you desire to make with reference to that,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.500
so you can give it a grain.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.500
So I don't believe we brought out the fact that

02:52.500 --> 02:55.500
the repayment actually was made on February 18th

02:55.500 --> 03:00.500
and what the circumstances of it were.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.500
Now, is that all you hear to say about that is cool?

03:03.500 --> 03:05.500
Well, sir, if you think it is relevant,

03:05.500 --> 03:08.500
I would relate the payment to that money

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
and what Mr. Adams said in connection with paying it to me

03:11.500 --> 03:12.500
at that time.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.500
The committee may consider it relevant

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
and I ask you to do so.

03:16.500 --> 03:22.500
Mr. Adams, I told you yesterday about the February 12 telephone call

03:22.500 --> 03:25.500
and Mr. Adams told me to find out why I was ducking him

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
and why he didn't say me.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.500
I did see him at a subcommittee hearing,

03:31.500 --> 03:33.500
which I have necessity attended,

03:33.500 --> 03:37.500
and which he attended on February 18th.

03:37.500 --> 03:44.500
He took a roll of bills and stuck them in my pocket.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.500
As I recall, he was sitting in the jury box of the courtroom

03:47.500 --> 03:49.500
where the hearing was being held,

03:49.500 --> 03:52.500
and I was walking by the morning, he said,

03:52.500 --> 03:54.500
hello, and I said hello, and he reached over

03:54.500 --> 03:56.500
and just stuck this roll of bills in my pocket.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.500
I don't remember which pocket it was, he does.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.500
The private needs to hear this and handed it a letter

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
and he should leave it to the time,

04:04.500 --> 04:07.500
and it says it can pay some good news for Mr. Welch

04:07.500 --> 04:11.500
and it has the attention of Mr. Welch

04:11.500 --> 04:13.500
so that he can carry this good news with him over the weekend.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.500
This is a gesture to me by Senator McCarty.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.500
My dear Senator Month,

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
a gesture to Honorable Carly Months,

04:20.500 --> 04:20.500


04:20.500 --> 04:21.500
and the Office Building,

04:21.500 --> 04:24.500
Washington, 25, DC.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.500
I read only the first two paragraphs that I can tell

04:27.500 --> 04:29.500
from those two paragraphs that are going to be written

04:29.500 --> 04:33.500
to Mr. Welch and I want to send you the Boston happy.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.500
I just send them on.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.500
As you know, I have felt very strongly about the vicious

04:38.500 --> 04:41.500
and completely unfounded attacks by Mr. Stevens

04:41.500 --> 04:44.500
and Mr. Adams of our Mr. Frank Car,

04:44.500 --> 04:47.500
the chief of the investigating subcommittee staff.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.500
I was a number of senators,

04:49.500 --> 04:52.500
so every pointed out on Wednesday, May 26th,

04:52.500 --> 04:55.500
Adams and Stevens presented absolutely no evidence

04:55.500 --> 04:58.500
of any wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Car.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.500
When the senator is very properly dismissed the charges

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
against Frank Car on the ground that they had been proven false,

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
they couple that move without,

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
if that time appeared to be the logical course,

05:09.500 --> 05:12.500
I've also released him as a witness,

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
so he could get back on the job of directing

05:14.500 --> 05:18.500
the important pending investigations of the subcommittee.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.500
Mr. Car feels that while he has been cleared by the subcommittee

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
of all the Adams-Dven charges,

05:23.500 --> 05:26.500
nevertheless, he should be called as a witness.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.500
If after all the evidence on both sides is in,

05:29.500 --> 05:32.500
any member of the subcommittee or any principal wishes

05:32.500 --> 05:36.500
to question him, he feels as I do that while this investigation

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
was deliberately and cleverly planned

05:39.500 --> 05:42.500
by those who had a personal interest in side-tracking,

05:42.500 --> 05:44.500
I suppose you have come in,

05:44.500 --> 05:46.500
every member of the staff for this subcommittee

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
should be available to testify.

05:49.500 --> 05:53.500
While I strongly urge that the Sony Trump-Step-Falced charges

05:53.500 --> 05:55.500
against Mr. Car should be dismissed,

05:55.500 --> 05:58.500
I have made it very clear that I would advise all members

05:58.500 --> 06:02.500
of the staff to appear before this committee, if called.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.500
As you know, Mr. Car,

06:03.500 --> 06:05.500
I would like to take a card to note part of the discussions

06:05.500 --> 06:09.500
concerning his dismissal as a principal and as a witness.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.500
His position always has been that as an employee of the subcommittee,

06:13.500 --> 06:16.500
he would follow the instructions of this committee

06:16.500 --> 06:19.500
and would not volunteer advice unless asked for it.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.500
However, he was deeply disturbed to learn

06:22.500 --> 06:25.500
that this committee's action was interpreted by some,

06:25.500 --> 06:29.500
to mean that he would not be available to testify.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.500
As the chairman knows, while I deal with it technically,

06:32.500 --> 06:36.500
it was improper to dismiss the Henselmatter before I had an opportunity

06:36.500 --> 06:38.500
to give testimony thereon,

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
I made no objection because I thought that the President

06:40.500 --> 06:43.500
of Sikh Mishra Yardin, which precluded Mr. Hensel,

06:43.500 --> 06:47.500
testifying to any conversations, planning and so forth,

06:47.500 --> 06:50.500
which we know the matters of the executive branch in himself

06:50.500 --> 06:53.500
are the members of the executive branch in himself,

06:53.500 --> 06:56.500
major impossible ever to get the whole truth

06:56.500 --> 06:59.500
and that therefore the sharing should be ended

06:59.500 --> 07:02.500
as soon as possible so that we could get back to our work.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.500
I want to make it clear at this time, however,

07:05.500 --> 07:09.500
that if any senator or any interested pocket desires to question me

07:09.500 --> 07:11.500
with regard to the Henselmatter,

07:11.500 --> 07:15.500
I shall be ready and willing to answer such questions.

07:15.500 --> 07:19.500
You are very truly Joe McCarthy, U.S. senator.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
The letter will be made part of the record,

07:22.500 --> 07:25.500
and I think that should clarify the atmosphere Mr. Welch

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
and everybody should be happy and confirms the statement

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
that I made the other day when I said,

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
sonatorial bodies are reversible bodies.

07:32.500 --> 07:38.500
They do have the facility to meet problems as they arise.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
I think in fairness to Mr. Kowal,

07:40.500 --> 07:43.500
I should make one personal word and met him in the hall

07:43.500 --> 07:47.500
last night after this and said something in a jocular manner

07:47.500 --> 07:49.500
about how it's up to be an ex-witness

07:49.500 --> 07:52.500
or something of that kind or ex-principable

07:52.500 --> 07:55.500
and he told me at that time that he had never quite understood

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
his position at the committee table

07:57.500 --> 08:00.500
because he was here allegedly as a principal,

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
but it had ever been called upon and they round robin

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
of ten minutes of questioning.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
He had no counsel,

08:06.500 --> 08:09.500
and he did want me to know however that he felt

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
that he should have an opportunity to testify

08:11.500 --> 08:14.500
if anybody felt that he should.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.500
So I think the fact should be said in fairness to Frank Carr

08:17.500 --> 08:20.500
so that the strong, solid man Mr. Welch

08:20.500 --> 08:23.500
is available to you at any time that you want to have him testify.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.500
Mr. Kowal, you may proceed, Mr. Smith.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
Now, we'll take hold of you, maybe.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
You're answering the question.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
Yes, sir.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.500
Mr. Adams took the money in my pocket.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.500
And, toward that, I saw Mr. Adams out in the car

08:36.500 --> 08:41.500
and I asked him what it was all about.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.500
He told me that he wanted me to take the money

08:44.500 --> 08:48.500
and was for the theatre tickets and for the price-like tickets.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.500
I told him that as far as the theatre tickets were concerned,

08:51.500 --> 08:54.500
I would send the bill on to him

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
or let him know how much it was

08:56.500 --> 08:58.500
and didn't have to be concerned about that.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.500
As far as the price-like ticket was concerned,

09:01.500 --> 09:04.500
he was my guest and there was a number of months before

09:04.500 --> 09:08.500
and there was certainly no need for him to at this date

09:08.500 --> 09:10.500
give me any money for the ticket.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.500
He told me that on the price-like ticket,

09:13.500 --> 09:16.500
he knew that Dave Shrine had paid for the ticket.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.500
I told him he was quite wrong

09:18.500 --> 09:21.500
that Mr. Shrine had not paid for the ticket,

09:21.500 --> 09:23.500
but I had paid for the ticket.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
Mr. Adams, I might have seen him had jockily

09:25.500 --> 09:28.500
I assume suggested that Dave should pay for the ticket.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.500
I explained to Mr. Adams that I had paid for the ticket today,

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
but that's not.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.500
Mr. Adams said, well, anyway,

09:35.500 --> 09:37.500
I want to have all worked for the effect.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.500
I want to have all accounts between us close.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.500
It's very important to you and it's very important to me.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
I guess what he meant by that,

09:45.500 --> 09:47.500
I didn't quite understand it.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.500
He said to me, I hope,

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
words of the effect, I hope you will never know

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
what I do mean by that.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.500
But some people are trying to get me to do something.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.500
And I hope you don't know what it is.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.500
I hope you never find out.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
But we have to get the record straight now

10:02.500 --> 10:06.500
or we'll be embarrassing to us both later on.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
And under those circumstances,

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
I did not give him back the money.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
I kept it.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.500
I was wondering if that conversation was cool.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.500
The date of that conversation, sir,

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
was February the 18th, 1954,

10:18.500 --> 10:22.500
was the hearing at which major urban arrests was hit

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
in public session before the subcommittee.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
I believe it was the date of the arrest hearing.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.500
I believe that to be February 18th.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
Did you question him about who was trying to get him

10:32.500 --> 10:33.500
to do something?

10:33.500 --> 10:34.500
No, sir.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
He was never have to do.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.500
He was very mysterious about the whole thing.

10:37.500 --> 10:41.500
I did not understand in any detail what it was about.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.500
And he pressed this money on me on that occasion

10:44.500 --> 10:47.500
and made it very clear that he was determined

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
that I should take it

10:49.500 --> 10:51.500
and that there were very important reasons why I should.

10:51.500 --> 10:55.500
And I took it and that was that.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.500
Is it cool that you ever have a conversation with Mr. Adams

10:58.500 --> 11:00.500
with respect to the major Perez case?

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
I did, sir.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
Who was that?

11:02.500 --> 11:05.500
The first time I told Mr. Adams about major arrests

11:05.500 --> 11:08.500
was in December of 1953.

11:08.500 --> 11:12.500
I believe some time in the early part of December 1953.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
Would you relate what was said on that occasion?

11:14.500 --> 11:15.500
Yes, sir.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.500
I was in a discussion with Mr. Adams about this,

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
as I recall it, about this order,

11:20.500 --> 11:23.500
permitting the commissioning of communists.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.500
And I suggested to Mr. Adams that there were

11:26.500 --> 11:29.500
a number of communists who currently held commissions in the Army.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.500
Mr. Adams said that that was completely untrue

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
that there was not a single communist

11:34.500 --> 11:36.500
to hold a commission in the Army.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.500
I told him he was quite wrong.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.500
He asked me if I would give him the name of one.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.500
I gave him the name of one.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.500
I gave him the name of major, Irving Perez.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
He said he knew nothing about the situation,

11:49.500 --> 11:52.500
but he was positive that I was wrong.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
He said he checked on it.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.500
I talked to him about it a few days later.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.500
I don't remember exactly when, sir.

11:59.500 --> 12:05.500
And he said that he was taking action on the Perez case.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.500
I said, well, that means I'm right, doesn't it?

12:07.500 --> 12:08.500
He is a communist.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.500
Mr. Adams said, well, we're taking action on the case

12:11.500 --> 12:13.500
and the thing will be taken care of.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
I told the chairman about that.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.500
I told him about he knew about the Perez case.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
I told him about this.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.500
I told him I had told Mr. Adams.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.500
The chairman told me that we should give Mr. Adams

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
a certain period of time to take care of the case himself

12:29.500 --> 12:33.500
within the Army and get rid of Perez.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.500
I think the chairman mentioned the month

12:35.500 --> 12:38.500
or six weeks something along the line.

12:38.500 --> 12:42.500
I mentioned the case to Mr. Adams on a number of subsequent occasions,

12:42.500 --> 12:46.500
including some early and January.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.500
They finally came a time in mid-January and after that

12:50.500 --> 12:52.500
when Senator McCarthy kept questioning me

12:52.500 --> 12:55.500
as to whether they had gotten rid of Perez.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.500
I told him that as far as I knew they had not.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.500
The senator said he had waited long enough

13:00.500 --> 13:03.500
and that he wanted a subpoena served on Perez

13:03.500 --> 13:06.500
and he wanted him to produce before the subcommittee.

13:06.500 --> 13:10.500
On Saturday morning, January 30th, I believe we checked the date

13:10.500 --> 13:14.500
and that's it, in New York an executive session.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
Mr. Carl or the senator, I don't know him,

13:16.500 --> 13:19.500
invited Mr. Adams or some representative of the Army

13:19.500 --> 13:24.500
to be present to see whether or not this major was a communist

13:24.500 --> 13:28.500
and just what his testimony should be.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.500
No representative of the Army came.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.500
Major Perez came and then both the fifth amendment

13:34.500 --> 13:38.500
and then both the fifth amendment, just about everything.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.500
Communist Party membership, organizational activities,

13:41.500 --> 13:43.500
whether he was using his post in the Army

13:43.500 --> 13:46.500
to recruit soldiers into the Communist Party,

13:46.500 --> 13:49.500
whether he was holding Communist Party meetings at his home

13:49.500 --> 13:53.500
while he was stationed down at Camp Kilmer.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.500
Whether he had been a communist when he was promoted from Captain

13:56.500 --> 13:59.500
to Major and things along those lines.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.500
The testimony elicited the fact that in August of May,

14:03.500 --> 14:06.500
that Major Perez when he was commissioned there as a captain

14:06.500 --> 14:09.500
caught an open record as a communist.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.500
He was not a secret communist, he had an open record.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.500
The files of the New York City Police Department

14:14.500 --> 14:17.500
which were available to the Army, the G2, contained statements

14:17.500 --> 14:20.500
by informants showing that Perez had attended

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
Communist leadership school.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.500
Perez had been referred to in the daily worker

14:24.500 --> 14:26.500
as not a couple of years or a year or so before

14:26.500 --> 14:29.500
as they contributed to Communist defense law.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
Spited out of his commission to Captain.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.500
In August, it developed when the Army questioned

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
about his communist activity.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
Perez claimed the fifth amendment to the Army

14:39.500 --> 14:41.500
and in spite of the fact that he claimed the fifth amendment

14:41.500 --> 14:44.500
to the Army, they promoted him to the rank of Major.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.500
A couple of months thereafter.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.500
Senator McCoffee, the foot of mildly,

14:48.500 --> 14:51.500
was deeply distressed about the situation.

14:51.500 --> 14:54.500
And this was a Saturday.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
I believe on Monday, Monday morning,

14:56.500 --> 14:59.500
President McCoffee sent an open letter to Mr. Stevens

14:59.500 --> 15:01.500
who was then in the far east,

15:01.500 --> 15:04.500
and could expect it back in a day or so.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.500
Just to Mr. Stevens' office,

15:06.500 --> 15:08.500
stated all the facts in the Perez case

15:08.500 --> 15:11.500
and demanded that there be a court module of Major Perez

15:11.500 --> 15:16.500
and that action be taken against all of those responsible

15:16.500 --> 15:19.500
for commissioning, promoting, and promoting this

15:19.500 --> 15:21.500
Fifth Amendment commune.

15:21.500 --> 15:25.500
What was the agreement that I believe it was February 1, 1954?

15:25.500 --> 15:28.500
Does the senator ever receive a reply to that letter?

15:28.500 --> 15:30.500
He did, sir.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.500
Do you know the senator has a reply?

15:33.500 --> 15:36.500
The senator of the reply was a very long letter.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.500
I might say it said nothing.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.500
The senator had requested the names of those

15:40.500 --> 15:43.500
who had promoted who were responsible for the promotion of Perez,

15:43.500 --> 15:46.500
for responsible for the cancellation of his orders,

15:46.500 --> 15:48.500
for responsible for commissioning him.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.500
Mr. Stevens' letter was a long letter,

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
but it did not give any of the names,

15:52.500 --> 15:54.500
and of course to this day,

15:54.500 --> 15:55.500
of those names.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.500
Perez has been in honor of this charge.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.500
That's the important point, sir.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
Senator McCarthy wrote his letter.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.500
He was in the February 1,

16:01.500 --> 16:04.500
demanding that Perez not be honorably discharged,

16:04.500 --> 16:06.500
but saying that he should be court-washable

16:06.500 --> 16:09.500
for his conduct as an officer in the army,

16:09.500 --> 16:12.500
in defying the army by claiming the Fifth Amendment first

16:12.500 --> 16:15.500
of the army and then claiming the Fifth Amendment before this committee.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.500
And for other acts of communist activities,

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
Mr. Stevens was out of the country

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
and the letter was handled by Mr. Adda,

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
and Mr. Stevens be here.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.500
I know that from talking with Senator McCarthy,

16:27.500 --> 16:31.500
that Mr. Kraw was in touch with Mr. Adda about this matter,

16:31.500 --> 16:34.500
and that Mr. Kraw,

16:34.500 --> 16:40.500
earnestly, if Mr. Adda not to allow an honorable discharge

16:40.500 --> 16:44.500
to be issued to this Fifth Amendment Communist Major,

16:44.500 --> 16:47.500
he called him on numerous occasions.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
On February 1 and February 2,

16:49.500 --> 16:52.500
there were a few phone calls, a number of phone calls.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.500
Finally, we heard from other sources, Mr. Jenkins,

16:55.500 --> 16:58.500
that in spite of all this and in spite of the senator's letter,

16:58.500 --> 17:01.500
and before Mr. Stevens had a chance to return,

17:01.500 --> 17:05.500
that Major Perez was to be given an honorable discharge

17:05.500 --> 17:08.500
on the afternoon of February 2.

17:08.500 --> 17:12.500
I understand that Mr. Kraw, telephone Mr. Adams,

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
and beg them for the last time,

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
so telephone Mr. Adda can thank you all for your return.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.500
Till Mr. Stevens got back,

17:18.500 --> 17:21.500
saying it would be a very bad mistake

17:21.500 --> 17:24.500
to give an honorable discharge to this Fifth Amendment Communist.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
Mr. Adams declined to do this,

17:26.500 --> 17:29.500
and I believe that on February 2,

17:29.500 --> 17:33.500
an honorable discharge was given to Major Perez.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
I then know from Senator McCarthy, sir,

17:35.500 --> 17:38.500
that I believe on the night of February 3,

17:38.500 --> 17:40.500
or February 2, or February 3rd,

17:40.500 --> 17:41.500
I think probably the second.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.500
Senator McCarthy, telephone Mr. Adams,

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
and Mr. Adam Hall,

17:45.500 --> 17:48.500
and told Mr. Adams in no uncertain terms

17:48.500 --> 17:52.500
of what he thought of the manner in which Mr. Adam had handled the press case.

17:52.500 --> 17:56.500
Mr. Adams was directly responsible for failure

17:56.500 --> 18:00.500
to delay the honorable discharge despite open and public warning

18:00.500 --> 18:03.500
by Senator McCarthy that this honorable discharge

18:03.500 --> 18:06.500
would be a very serious mistake in that case.

18:06.500 --> 18:10.500
And the action on it should be held up until Mr. Stevens returned.

18:10.500 --> 18:14.500
And I know that that conversation took place.

18:14.500 --> 18:20.500
On the 18th, Mr. Adams was in New York when Major Perez appeared in public session.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
He didn't seem to want much.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.500
February, and that's the date Mr. Adams gave me back that money, sir.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.500
He paid me that money.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.500
Then General Swicker appeared that afternoon,

18:28.500 --> 18:33.500
and I won't go into that other than to say General Swicker

18:33.500 --> 18:36.500
had been cooperative with representatives of the staff,

18:36.500 --> 18:39.500
a representative of the staff of the subcommittee

18:39.500 --> 18:42.500
who had privately interviewed General Swicker.

18:42.500 --> 18:46.500
I believe these Saturday before General Swicker testified.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.500
General Swicker had told this investigator a lot of facts

18:50.500 --> 18:55.500
and a lot of important facts about how this First Amendment Communist had been promoted.

18:55.500 --> 19:00.500
And other things concerning this First Amendment Communist treatment in the Army.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.500
When General Swicker appeared before the committee,

19:03.500 --> 19:05.500
he was asked the very same question,

19:05.500 --> 19:08.500
and he just didn't give any answers.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
Just was quiet about the whole thing.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
Mr. Adams was next to him advising him,

19:12.500 --> 19:15.500
and it became very apparent from the questioning of the witnesses

19:15.500 --> 19:19.500
that Mr. Adams had been working on them the previous afternoon,

19:19.500 --> 19:24.500
and I believe it was the previous afternoon the day before Mr. Adams had gone up to speed him.

19:24.500 --> 19:29.500
And Senator McCarthy concluded that Mr. Adams had told them to keep quiet

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
and not give the committee the information.

19:31.500 --> 19:36.500
That did not help relations between Senator McCarthy and Mr. Adams at that point

19:36.500 --> 19:39.500
and the senator was quite annoyed about it.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.500
And he also told the General Swicker to develop.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.500
And on the next night, sir, February the 19th,

19:45.500 --> 19:48.500
Mr. Carr from New York spoke to Mr. Adams.

19:48.500 --> 19:52.500
Then called me and asked me if I would call Mr. Adams and talk to him

19:52.500 --> 19:57.500
to say that we could not avoid the further questioning of people like General Swicker

19:57.500 --> 20:02.500
and get in instead the person who had given General Swicker and others

20:02.500 --> 20:05.500
the orders to keep quiet.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.500
I called Mr. Adams and I told Mr. Adams that

20:08.500 --> 20:13.500
in just the General Swicker and the officers involved that the proper persons to produce

20:13.500 --> 20:18.500
was the man who had given the orders to silence the General Swicker and these other officers

20:18.500 --> 20:23.500
and let that man tell why he had ordered them to defy the committee.

20:23.500 --> 20:28.500
Mr. Adams did not agree and I remember we got into a,

20:28.500 --> 20:30.500
we're supposed to be a short conversation,

20:30.500 --> 20:33.500
but we got into an extended discussion of the forensic case

20:34.500 --> 20:40.500
in the course of which I told Mr. Adams that I had warned him about that case for a period of months

20:40.500 --> 20:43.500
and that he had done nothing about it.

20:43.500 --> 20:44.500
He admitted that.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.500
He said I think he had written one letter or made one phone call

20:47.500 --> 20:50.500
and it's forgotten to follow it up or haven't followed it up.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.500
Then I took up the question of the honorable discharge

20:53.500 --> 20:58.500
and Mr. Adams said, well, he just wasn't going to delay it and he didn't delay it and that was bad.

20:59.500 --> 21:05.500
And he said anyway, you seem to think the proof on Perez was awfully strong, I don't.

21:05.500 --> 21:12.500
I told him that I couldn't think of much stronger proof on anyone on a major or a captain in the army

21:12.500 --> 21:17.500
than the fact he claimed the Fifth Amendment before the army itself on a typical army

21:17.500 --> 21:19.500
loyalty to the United States form.

21:19.500 --> 21:26.500
The fact that the police filed contains the statements by New York City policemen

21:26.500 --> 21:30.500
who had been under cover agents and communists dealt with Perez

21:30.500 --> 21:34.500
that the daily work I mentioned in by name is a contribute at the communist defense fund

21:34.500 --> 21:37.500
and that he involved the First Amendment before the committee.

21:37.500 --> 21:44.500
And I added this statement that I was sure that the FBI had full information on Perez

21:44.500 --> 21:48.500
which had been available to Mr. Adams and to the people in the army.

21:48.500 --> 21:53.500
At that point Mr. Adams made some derogatory comments concerning the FBI

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
and now pays attention to their report.

21:55.500 --> 22:01.500
Anyway, they're just a lot of hearsay and I'm not going to listen to an FBI report about something like this.

22:01.500 --> 22:05.500
That expression does not happen to be along my way of thinking

22:05.500 --> 22:07.500
and there was not much more to the conversation.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.500
While I was talking with Mr. Adams, it was from a hotel room in Albany

22:11.500 --> 22:16.500
where we were conducting hearings. We had in Felix Infleman Wood in the photographer in the Aussie Hiscate

22:16.500 --> 22:23.500
and a friend of McLaughlin was present and two or three other people were in the room while I had this conversation with Mr. Adams.

22:23.500 --> 22:27.500
With the exception Mr. Jenkins of a casual meeting with Mr. Adams

22:27.500 --> 22:30.500
at the beginning of March at a hearing in the hearing room of the committee

22:30.500 --> 22:33.500
that which he again invited me out to lunch

22:33.500 --> 22:38.500
and which I declined. I have had, I believe, no further contacts with Mr. Adams.

22:38.500 --> 22:42.500
I have not seen Mr. Stevens since the 17th of November

22:42.500 --> 22:47.500
and I believe Sarah, this is about the substance of what you want me to tell you on this part of the examination.

22:47.500 --> 22:52.500
Mr. Cole, approximately how many times did he talk to Mr. Adams

22:52.500 --> 22:57.500
with respect to Major Carest and particularly with respect to the documents

22:57.500 --> 23:01.500
to which he just referred, which were in existence

23:01.500 --> 23:07.500
and which he was claim or say, shed light upon his coming strictly.

23:07.500 --> 23:12.500
Now Sarah, I don't recall having discussed the police department back in with Mr. Adams

23:12.500 --> 23:17.500
until this February 18th, February 19th incident.

23:17.500 --> 23:24.500
I did very definitely discuss with Mr. Adams the fact that I had information that that for us as an Army officer

23:24.500 --> 23:29.500
had defied the Army back in August that refused to answer questions from the Army and questions

23:29.500 --> 23:32.500
and that there was documentation written as to that.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.500
I am against documentation as a position of the Army.

23:35.500 --> 23:40.500
Of course it was. They have never given it to us but I am sure it is there.

23:40.500 --> 23:43.500
I am sure it is there and I am sure it is available to Mr. Adams.

23:43.500 --> 23:47.500
Did you say you have met Mr. Adams with the previous investigation of the system and before you committee?

23:47.500 --> 23:52.500
After I did not that I have to mention that Major Carest did take the Fifth Amendment before the committee.

23:52.500 --> 23:59.500
They were newspaper stories about it and I believe Mr. Adams was directly and personally advised by Mr. Clark

23:59.500 --> 24:03.500
as to exactly what had been transpired, exactly what had transpired.

24:03.500 --> 24:10.500
And Mr. Adams had been invited to find the car I believe to be present at this session when Major Carest testified.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.500
In fact I think Mr. Clark urged him to be there.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.500
And of course he testified higher to his discharge.

24:16.500 --> 24:24.500
He did. He testified and invoked the Fifth Amendment before I committee prior to the time the Army came from an honorable discharge.

24:24.500 --> 24:28.500
Do you know whether or not Senator McCarthy ever talked to Mr. Adams about the police?

24:28.500 --> 24:31.500
He said about the evidence you had against me.

24:31.500 --> 24:37.500
I know he talked to him on a number of occasions sir and I know specifically that Senator McCarthy telephoned Mr. Adams.

24:37.500 --> 24:45.500
I believe that Mr. Adams home on the night of February 2nd and told Mr. Adams just what he thought of the way in which Mr. Adams had handled the presca.

24:45.500 --> 24:49.500
And you say that you know that Mr. Frank Carr and likewise spoke to Mr. Adams.

24:49.500 --> 24:57.500
Yes sir and I know that Mr. Adams told Mr. Carr about some of the things which Senator McCarthy had told Mr. Adams about the way Mr. Adams had handled the presca.

24:57.500 --> 25:02.500
Have you ever ascertained who is responsible for the promotion?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.500
After it's mystical?

25:04.500 --> 25:16.500
Sir and a long number of months now and we have never despite frequent repeated written, oral, telephonic, personal and every other kind of request, plea and demand.

25:16.500 --> 25:20.500
And given that information and I doubt that we ever will be the way.

25:20.500 --> 25:24.500
Have you ever been given information or two as responsible for his honorable discharge?

25:24.500 --> 25:33.500
The only one we know of who dealt with his honorable discharge during that February 2nd period other than the twig of testimony is Mr. Adams.

25:33.500 --> 25:40.500
And we don't know just how major a role Mr. Adams played in that whether he was acting under orders from someone else or not.

25:40.500 --> 25:44.500
We have not been told and I'm sure no one can say that we haven't asked.

25:44.500 --> 25:49.500
Now Mr. Cohn as a final question on direct examination, yes sir.

25:49.500 --> 25:58.500
And with respect to yours and Senator McCarthy's charges against Mr. Stevens and the sad of us, is there any other fact now?

25:58.500 --> 26:01.500
Are there any other facts?

26:01.500 --> 26:07.500
When can your opinion shed light upon the truth or falsity of those charges that you now care to state to this committee?

26:07.500 --> 26:12.500
As far as our answer and our account of what happens sir, I believe I've given you the substance.

26:12.500 --> 26:22.500
I am sure that there are other incidents and other events which might shed light on this which I have overlooked or omitted because I knew they would be covered by others or on first examination.

26:22.500 --> 26:29.500
But I'm sure that the York Forest Examination and that of Mr. Welch and the senators of all of the facts will come after.

26:29.500 --> 26:38.500
Now let me make this statement and I don't make it be your benefit because you are perfectly aware of the role of the new role.

26:39.500 --> 26:46.500
A witch I serve but for the benefit of those who cheerfully shall we face?

26:46.500 --> 26:58.500
Mr. Cohn it is not a present thing to cross examine a witness and especially after one has conducted a direct examination.

26:59.500 --> 27:11.500
It has I think I should say and also been a painful thing to cross examine the secretary of the army and the stratum and others.

27:11.500 --> 27:21.500
And it is not a personal thing. It is purely official and in conformity was what I've deemed to be my duty.

27:22.500 --> 27:29.500
And I do hope that those who are interested in those who are hearing and seeing these proceedings will understand that.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.500
It's your duty sir and I'll do my best to answer your questions.

27:31.500 --> 27:44.500
Mr. Cohn, before we end this statement, one single word seems to me that in fairness to those in the room and those who listen,

27:44.500 --> 27:58.500
that the Council for the Committee should face a second time it's been said before that the names of those who were connected with the press discharge have been handed to the Council for the Committee days ago.

27:58.500 --> 28:02.500
Handed to the Council, sir, and handed right back to the army and we've never seen.

28:02.500 --> 28:09.500
No, you're quite wrong in that, Mr. O'erome. It was shuffled back and forth but it ends up in the position of my good and trusted friend Mr. Cohn.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.500
Mr. Jenkins, I'll show it to us. We'll be very happy.

28:12.500 --> 28:19.500
I believe that it's full in my position despite the fact that I tried to escape through responsibility.

28:19.500 --> 28:30.500
It is marked confidential. It has not been opened by me. I see no purpose whatsoever in its remaining in my position and I have no intention of opening that envelope.

28:30.500 --> 28:35.500
And I now tend to back Mr. Wilson, I do hope you will take it.

28:36.500 --> 28:43.500
Yes, Mr. Senator, we've destroyed the New York administration. I have seen chairs of the previous.

28:43.500 --> 28:59.500
Auditation by saying it's remaining in your hands until we have a chance to have an executive meeting to see what can be done if anything to get rid of its confidential status so that the country and the people may know who is responsible for major progress.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.500
I'll expect you to violate the confidential order.

29:02.500 --> 29:14.500
Now Mr. Cohn in order to channel the area of iron parry, let us again read the issue about which I desire to close the damage.

29:14.500 --> 29:24.500
And that is that you and Senator McCarthy and Mr. Carp are charged by Mr. Stevens and by Mr. Adams.

29:24.500 --> 29:33.500
Would you think improper means with them for the purposes of securing proper and so treatment for G. David Chai? You understand that, do you?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.500
Yes sir.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.500
The school now long has been known with Chai.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.500
I have known him well sir, I would say for about two years.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
Well how long have you known him?

29:44.500 --> 29:51.500
I might have met him prior to that two-year period casually or around town. I have no death and erection recollection of it but might have happened.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.500
I've been a viewer of me to New York City.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.500
Yes sir. And who is Mr. Chai?

29:56.500 --> 30:02.500
Well he's not, he's a native of the state of New York but he does spend a good deal of time in and around New York City.

30:02.500 --> 30:10.500
What was the occasion of your meeting him and coming in contact with him? Mr. Cohn? Was it official or was it social or otherwise?

30:10.500 --> 30:13.500
It was a luncheon arranged by a mutual friend.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.500
Approximately two years ago. Yes sir.

30:16.500 --> 30:26.500
Now Mr. Cohn has since that fine you and David Chai have been what we might call warm personal friends, have you not?

30:26.500 --> 30:28.500
He is one of my many good friends, are you?

30:28.500 --> 30:34.500
One of your many good friends and in all fairness Mr. Cohn is the fact that he is one of your best friends.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.500
We all have our best friends, there's no criticism of you all that account.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.500
Now of course not many our friends whom we love, I do.

30:41.500 --> 30:46.500
Sir, he's a relationship between you and David Chai has been very close for the past ten years.

30:46.500 --> 30:50.500
That's our he is one of the number of good friends I'm proud to have.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.500
You have no name socially?

30:51.500 --> 30:53.500
I have. This is in his home?

30:53.500 --> 30:54.500
Yes.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.500
Is this in your home?

30:55.500 --> 30:56.500
Yes sir.

30:56.500 --> 31:01.500
And you have perhaps double-dated together no reflection on you about that.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.500
You have a single young man as we understand you.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.500
We have an unknown.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.500
Really widely known in New York City?

31:06.500 --> 31:07.500
Yes sir.

31:08.500 --> 31:16.500
So when you came to the McCarthy Committee I leave you say in January 1953?

31:16.500 --> 31:17.500
Yes sir.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.500
Mr. Cohn came when?

31:19.500 --> 31:20.500
Uh.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.500
Mr. Chai.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.500
Uh, he came two or three weeks thereafter I believe.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.500
He came two or three weeks thereafter I believe.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.500
Oh he said.

31:25.500 --> 31:32.500
Now Mr. Cohn, Mr. Chai resigned.

31:32.500 --> 31:39.500
I have positioned in New York City in order to come with the McCarthy Committee.
