WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, I think all of us realize that the strength

00:07.760 --> 00:15.520
of the Western nations of Europe and the United States and Canada offer the greatest hope

00:15.520 --> 00:21.720
and assurance for peace if we can stand together and work together, all one for all and all

00:21.720 --> 00:26.960
for one, militarily, economically and politically.

00:26.960 --> 00:33.400
So that in 1940, man, the North Atlantic Treaty organization was created.

00:33.400 --> 00:39.240
And after this time, we have gotten along, although we've had many differences between the

00:39.240 --> 00:43.240
15 nations, composing what we call NATO.

00:43.240 --> 00:50.080
Many of us have been interested for a long, long time in having a citizens' commission

00:50.080 --> 00:56.680
to work as a, with other commissions of other NATO nations, a limited number to meet and

00:56.680 --> 01:03.180
to continue to discuss ways and means of improving the techniques and the operations and

01:03.180 --> 01:08.120
the unity of our North Atlantic Treaty organization.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.460
And last fall, this resolution was passed by the Congress of the United States after

01:12.460 --> 01:13.460
quite an effort.

01:13.460 --> 01:20.560
Then in March of this year, the United States Commission was created consisting of 20

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
members.

01:21.560 --> 01:26.440
Today, we're very honored in having with us the co-chair, one of the United States

01:26.440 --> 01:29.400
Citizens Commission on NATO.

01:29.400 --> 01:34.400
There men that you will know well, and it's a great privilege and pleasure to have with

01:34.400 --> 01:44.000
us in the studio, Mr. Will Clayton of Tennessee and Texas, a former great undersecretary of state

01:44.000 --> 01:48.040
and one of the fine and great men of our nation.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.800
Mr. Will is good to have you with us today.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.680
I certainly appreciate it.

01:52.680 --> 01:59.800
And then I'm Mr. Clayton's right is Mr. Christian Herder, a very able well-known governor,

01:59.800 --> 02:02.600
former governor of Massachusetts.

02:02.600 --> 02:07.740
And the Secretary of State who served with great distinction and merit and honor until we

02:07.740 --> 02:13.080
Democrats took over here recently.

02:13.080 --> 02:19.040
Mr. Will first, we and Tennessee have always been tremendously fond of you because you grew

02:19.040 --> 02:21.680
up, I believe, Jackson Tennessee.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.480
Thank you, I did.

02:25.480 --> 02:34.120
I was re-adding Jackson left there when I was 15 years old when I have a very warm spot

02:34.120 --> 02:35.760
in my heart for Tennessee.

02:35.760 --> 02:36.760
Yes, sir.

02:36.760 --> 02:45.520
And then after you became the head of Anderson Clayton Company, one of the greatest company

02:45.520 --> 02:49.800
in the world, and you were here in government.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.960
You found a place called Lookout Mountain and you built a home there and lived there for

02:53.960 --> 02:55.480
a number of years, didn't you?

02:55.480 --> 02:57.720
Yes.

02:57.720 --> 03:03.720
We had a summer home there and lived there for 20 summers, I think.

03:03.720 --> 03:08.280
Or I can certify it because it's a wonderful place to spend the summer.

03:08.280 --> 03:13.160
We have a between the bank and insurance company and I see and I have a summer house up there

03:13.160 --> 03:14.160
ourselves.

03:15.160 --> 03:25.160
Well, Mr. Herdur, tell us about the work of the United States Citizens Commission and

03:25.160 --> 03:27.960
what is the trouble with NATO at the present time?

03:27.960 --> 03:29.440
What are we aiming at?

03:29.440 --> 03:32.760
Well, you're right for a pretty wide field.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.760
Well, you're not taking a little part.

03:34.760 --> 03:42.240
LTV commissioners, you know, only got organized short and moderate deployment.

03:42.240 --> 03:47.640
In recent weeks, various members of the commission, including Rotate and myself, have been traveling

03:47.640 --> 03:48.640
to different countries.

03:48.640 --> 03:55.480
In order to stimulate the creation of similar committees in the NATO countries, so that

03:55.480 --> 04:01.400
in time we could organize the type of convention that was envisaged in the resolution.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.920
I think that that is progressing, but it's a slow process because in the good many cases

04:06.920 --> 04:10.800
it's not entirely clear just how the committee should be set up.

04:10.800 --> 04:15.360
And we have set a rather unusual precedent that others can't necessarily with some of

04:15.360 --> 04:19.200
their parliamentary restrictions for their own exactly the same detail.

04:19.200 --> 04:25.920
In to further work of the commissioners concerned, I agree entirely with the both right words

04:25.920 --> 04:26.920
that you said.

04:26.920 --> 04:33.600
But perhaps the most important thing today, the first priority from the point of view of

04:33.600 --> 04:39.240
the free world is to make certain that the free nations of the world as well as a large

04:39.240 --> 04:45.880
measure by the United Community should be upending from a military political and economic

04:45.880 --> 04:46.880
point of view.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.880
In those close unit days, it's possible to get.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.080
I have been different as you know.

04:53.080 --> 04:57.280
I think that it's so well known that I'm well and large going to the detail of the

04:57.280 --> 05:01.720
difficulty, but I think that among the free nations, this is a characteristic of free

05:01.720 --> 05:03.720
people that they do have differences.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.360
That's what makes us strong, I guess, with the other names.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.080
And I think that the responsibility that we have created in the members of our commission

05:11.080 --> 05:18.240
have is to examine other difficulties and to explore, as the resolution says, ways in

05:18.240 --> 05:26.760
which this group of the free world can strengthen the democratic free world in the various

05:26.760 --> 05:30.840
aspects that have been laid out particularly in the economic and the political field.

05:31.480 --> 05:38.400
Mr. Will, we use the think of NATO as a military alliance.

05:38.400 --> 05:47.120
And I know that you have another idea about an important part of NATO.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.920
Tell us about the other parts, the political and the economic.

05:51.920 --> 06:00.040
Well, I'm particularly interested in Article II of the NATO agreement, which provides

06:00.520 --> 06:10.920
that the members of NATO, which are now 15 countries, shall cooperate together from the

06:10.920 --> 06:22.720
point of view, strengthening the economic ties and cooperate in an economic sense as well

06:22.720 --> 06:24.920
as a military sense.

06:24.920 --> 06:35.760
And that Article II has not been put into operation to the extent that I think it should be.

06:35.760 --> 06:43.880
And we are hoping that we may be able to make some suggestions as a result of the deliberations

06:43.880 --> 06:50.040
of this United States Citizens Commission on NATO that will contribute to that end.

06:50.040 --> 06:54.440
Well, Chris and Harry said that you and he had been together to a number of nations.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.040
How have you been, Mr. Will?

06:56.040 --> 07:04.160
We visited London and then bond and then Rome and then Paris, the poor nations.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.600
And Mr. Harterson has been to Canada.

07:06.600 --> 07:12.040
And did you find what kind of reaction did you find among the people and the nations that

07:12.040 --> 07:13.200
you went to?

07:13.200 --> 07:19.680
We found a warm reception in all of those countries.

07:19.680 --> 07:27.280
And a desire to cooperate with us in every possible way.

07:27.280 --> 07:35.440
The, of course, this commission, setting up with this commission is rather a new thing

07:35.440 --> 07:36.960
in our country.

07:36.960 --> 07:43.280
And it certainly is new in that country that there should be a Citizens Commission that would

07:43.280 --> 07:51.200
report to together one but would have no right to commit to government in any way.

07:51.200 --> 07:58.640
Well, there is, I think, the commission we have is probably one of a very few of its

07:58.640 --> 07:59.640
type.

07:59.640 --> 08:05.440
But I have had the feeling that with a wise man, dedicated man like yourselves, and I want

08:05.440 --> 08:10.360
to say that I have never known a commission that had a blurr.

08:10.360 --> 08:16.480
May and while you do have one fine woman on the commission too, we received no compensation

08:16.480 --> 08:22.680
who has a matter of good for the world and for the country are giving us a time, thought

08:22.680 --> 08:28.520
and brains and influence toward this great effort.

08:28.520 --> 08:34.000
Kristen, Mr. Clayton said you had been up to Canada.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
What did the Canadians do about it?

08:36.000 --> 08:43.560
Well, the Canadians, I saw members of the government as well as the various members of the

08:43.560 --> 08:48.000
parliamentary bodies who were principally concerned many of them, the NATO parliamentarians.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.240
And they were going to work out a method of representation to set up a commission.

08:54.240 --> 09:00.840
The government interested, as you know, in Canada at the moment, there is a good deal

09:00.840 --> 09:07.840
of discussion going on because of the influence at least in some of Mr. MacMillan statements

09:07.840 --> 09:11.400
that the British are going to join the common market.

09:11.400 --> 09:17.280
Canada naturally wondering what one of the commonwealth countries is, what is going to become

09:17.280 --> 09:21.920
of the health special privileges as it comes in the country and the British market.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.000
So it's a pretty hot subject.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.400
But I think that the Canadians, all of those that I spoke to, feel about the exploration

09:30.400 --> 09:35.520
which commissions of this kind might make together might be very helpful and very useful.

09:35.520 --> 09:42.080
But I would like to know how about Mr. Diffinbacker, the Prime Minister of Canada.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.080
He's been very much interested in that, hasn't he?

09:44.080 --> 09:48.160
Yes, he's been very much interested, but he is very much concerned about this move for

09:48.160 --> 09:50.160
the British at the moment.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.280
And he is asked for a meeting of the Prime Ministers of all the commonwealth countries to discuss

09:54.280 --> 09:55.280
it.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.960
I don't know whether that will come about or not because I noticed that the British are sending

09:58.960 --> 10:05.480
very high ranking ministers to those countries now, to Australia, New Zealand and Canada

10:05.480 --> 10:06.480
to discuss the relation of the commonwealth.

10:06.480 --> 10:11.520
They're also sending one of our commissioners some of their Asiatic members of the commonwealth.

10:11.520 --> 10:16.880
Well, the negative, the NATO parliamentarians in Canada have a meeting and take action

10:16.880 --> 10:17.880
while you were there.

10:17.880 --> 10:22.440
They say they did, they discussed the thing from beginning to end, we've been over now discussing

10:22.440 --> 10:27.720
various phases of it and then the after-evolution favouring it.

10:27.720 --> 10:35.160
I believe that Greece, one of our NATO nations, has already set up a council or a commission

10:35.160 --> 10:38.200
similar to ours, how would they Mr. Will?

10:38.200 --> 10:43.560
Yes, and it's called a Hellenic-Cash Citizens Commission on NATO.

10:44.520 --> 10:49.440
I've always been impressed with the fact that if a military alliance is going to survive,

10:49.440 --> 10:55.800
if we're going to have unity and strength, that we had to have some better means of political

10:55.800 --> 11:02.160
consultation, not that we follow on another's political policy in every case, but we all

11:02.160 --> 11:07.520
at least each know what the others doing, like in the case, you were Secretary of State,

11:07.520 --> 11:08.520
I believe.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.600
I will, you Mr. Hearder, when the Suez of Fair came.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.080
I was under Secretary of that time.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.400
You were under Secretary of State.

11:16.400 --> 11:22.080
And the French and British took move, apparently had not been discussed with the United States

11:22.080 --> 11:25.200
all over it, involved the whole world.

11:25.200 --> 11:30.560
Is that part of the things that you will be talking about when you meet with these representatives

11:30.560 --> 11:31.560
of other countries?

11:31.560 --> 11:37.520
Well, one of the problems in NATO that has always arisen have been so-called political

11:37.520 --> 11:44.520
consultation, that is the effort to try to get a common meeting ground and a common policy.

11:44.520 --> 11:53.520
It has improved very, very considerably, but it is not going to be completely satisfactory

11:53.520 --> 11:59.600
in my way of thinking, until our political ties are stronger than they are at the present

11:59.600 --> 12:00.600
time.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.600
And that will be part of the things that you will try to bring about, Mr. Tudor.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.600
That's right.

12:05.600 --> 12:11.600
How do you view the General Western Atlantic picture at the present time, Mr. Will?

12:11.600 --> 12:24.600
I think that it illustrates very strongly the need for some means of bringing the Western,

12:24.600 --> 12:29.600
NATO countries and the OECD countries closer together.

12:29.600 --> 12:39.520
If we are to successfully defend ourselves in America against the monolithic power of the

12:39.520 --> 12:46.400
Soviet Union plus the Chinese, they have a billion people now which is one out of every

12:46.400 --> 12:48.600
three in the world.

12:48.600 --> 12:55.280
And if it ever should get to be two out of three, I think the world has lost its freedom.

12:55.280 --> 13:02.120
Well, I just want to say on my own, ladies and gentlemen, that I think that our great hope

13:02.120 --> 13:08.160
for peace is in the Atlantic community and free people standing together.

13:08.160 --> 13:14.760
I think that Mr. Clayton and Mr. Herder and the others on this commission are rendering

13:14.760 --> 13:20.120
a great public service and trying to bring about ways and means so that we can stand together

13:20.120 --> 13:21.120
well.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.040
We are indebted to them.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.640
It may make the difference between peace and war and the days to come.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.120
So Mr. Will, Clayton, I want to thank you very much for being with us.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
Thank you, Mr. Chris.

13:32.120 --> 13:35.920
It is all to nice to be here to come and thank you very much.
