00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
The key bomber is making the use of all of your signatures.

00:04.200 --> 00:09.300
Senator Keith Balver has completed his work in Europe as a member of the Senate Arms Services

00:09.300 --> 00:15.540
subcommittee investigating the malmedia trial to make the Senate himself resume these problems

00:15.540 --> 00:16.900
by the next rub test period.

00:16.900 --> 00:22.900
In the meantime, if you would accept a substitute, let's look at the news in your nation's capital

00:22.900 --> 00:25.900
as seen from your Senate resultants.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.900
The first item will be of unusual interest to those on the whole age of the system's

00:29.900 --> 00:32.900
roles and those who may be at a later time.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.900
A many years, Senator Keith Balver has been interested in the men and women of our nation.

00:36.900 --> 00:41.900
We have passed the meridian of this existence and abide in the later later stages of their

00:41.900 --> 00:42.900
moment on this earth.

00:42.900 --> 00:47.900
It has been his off-express act that our age should be enabled to grow old and raceful,

00:47.900 --> 00:51.900
and provide it for equally hard parts of the country.

00:51.900 --> 00:56.900
As he has pointed out repeatedly under the press and law, the state's match contributions

00:56.900 --> 00:59.900
of the federal government will be the payment of old age assistance.

00:59.900 --> 01:04.900
When a state puts up a dollar for dollar with the federal government, the richer states are

01:04.900 --> 01:08.900
able to provide more for their age and those in the poorest states.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.900
Compared to the poorest, Tennessee is a poorest state.

01:11.900 --> 01:17.900
For instance, California can pay its age in about twice as much as the age it is in Tennessee

01:18.900 --> 01:20.900
and the state's number of people.

01:20.900 --> 01:24.900
In this day of support crisis, minimum wages of the life, the cost of living will not very

01:24.900 --> 01:26.900
agree to yield a clean or among the different states.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.900
It probably costs a bit as much as it is in the California.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.900
The old age assistance program is based on the need.

01:33.900 --> 01:39.900
Certainly, the need of our older people is as great as the need of similar age folks in the

01:39.900 --> 01:40.900
states of Great-A-Well.

01:40.900 --> 01:46.900
As Senator Keith Balver is undertaking to correct this inequity, you may want to jot down

01:46.900 --> 01:50.900
the number of the bill he has filed in this Congress and I shall give it to you presently.

01:50.900 --> 01:55.900
The purpose of the key part of the bill is to equalize the payments, the federal government

01:55.900 --> 01:57.900
contributes for old age assistance in all the states.

01:57.900 --> 02:02.900
This is accomplished by changing the formula by which these funds are allocated.

02:02.900 --> 02:07.900
Under the key part of the bill, the age it of Tennessee received a substantial increase in

02:07.900 --> 02:08.900
compensation.

02:08.900 --> 02:13.900
The number of the bill introduced by Senator Keith Balver is S25.

02:14.900 --> 02:19.900
For obvious reasons, it would be difficult to pass this bill and next to impossible to

02:19.900 --> 02:22.900
have it considered at this session of 81st Congress.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.900
But it will be helpful if you will write to your own Congressmen.

02:25.900 --> 02:30.900
Have your friends and relations in other states to write to their Congressmen in Senate.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.900
Asking them to support S25.

02:33.900 --> 02:34.900
O4.

02:34.900 --> 02:38.900
The key part of the bill which would equalize old age assistance contributions by the federal government.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.900
All you need to do is mention the number of the bill.

02:41.900 --> 02:42.900
S25.

02:42.900 --> 02:43.900
O4.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.900
Yes, there will be opposition to this measure.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.900
There will be opposition from the wealthier states.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.900
There will be opposition from the big interest.

02:51.900 --> 02:56.900
There will even be opposition from citizens in the states that this bill will help the most.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.900
The Senator Keith Balver has been working on this matter a long time.

02:59.900 --> 03:04.900
He filed a bill while he was in the House of Representatives to accomplish the same purpose.

03:04.900 --> 03:08.900
He testified for it and worked for it before the House Ways and Means Commission.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.900
His efforts have already resulted in securing some relief.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.900
But the basic change has not yet been made.

03:15.900 --> 03:24.900
His bill also lowers his assistance age from 65 to 60 years and eliminates some of the strictest property home ownership position.

03:24.900 --> 03:29.900
Regardless of the prospect of opposition, regardless of the time it takes to do the job.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.900
Remember all the ways this is your government.

03:32.900 --> 03:38.900
It is public opinion that shapes the great extent of both of Europe Congress and the senators.

03:38.900 --> 03:42.900
If the people want this way as your past, the people can have it back.

03:42.900 --> 03:50.900
When the people speak and speak loudly enough, those in government who listen, having heard and understood, they act accordingly.

03:50.900 --> 03:55.900
Mr. Justice Wilder wrote a letter to the United States Supreme Court to state.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.900
He attended Maribal College, Maribal, Tennessee.

03:59.900 --> 04:05.900
He was a scholar with the last appointee of the late President Roosevelt, the highest court in Ireland.

04:05.900 --> 04:13.900
His death made it the responsibility of President Truman made his second appointee to the Supreme Court in two and sixty days.

04:13.900 --> 04:21.900
The talk around your nation's capital was in the direction of Attorney General Jay Howard McGrath, a captain for this place.

04:21.900 --> 04:27.900
With Mr. Truman's top advisor, Clark Clifford, rumored as the next Attorney General of the United States.

04:27.900 --> 04:32.900
It is customary for one justice at the high court to be a captain of faith.

04:32.900 --> 04:38.900
But the newest papers and commentators urged that President Truman disregard your religion, politics, and all else,

04:38.900 --> 04:43.900
to point to new justice purely on the basis of qualifications as a journalist.

04:43.900 --> 04:47.900
The Obama and the President announced Thursday that noon was a complete surprise.

04:47.900 --> 04:56.900
He named the former Senator Sherman Smith of Indiana, a member of the seventh Circuit Court of the United States Court of the fields.

04:56.900 --> 05:01.900
Judge Minton entered the Senate on the same day that President Truman feared.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.900
They are personal friends.

05:03.900 --> 05:08.900
Mr. Minton was a former administrative assistant to the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.900
It wasn't art at supporter of the Roosevelt program.

05:11.900 --> 05:17.900
His apartment will be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Senator Steve Fawhrer is now a member.

05:17.900 --> 05:27.900
Because he served some 30 President members of the Senate, as a good judicial record, is confirmation by the Senate, expected here as a matter of course.

05:27.900 --> 05:32.900
Well-pastured magazine in its October issue publishes the results of a poll.

05:32.900 --> 05:38.900
Not a Gallup poll, of course, but a poll of 211 newspaper-farrer's comments here in Washington.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.900
You see these Senators as we see them.

05:40.900 --> 05:47.900
These newsmen and radio newscasters were asked to select the best Senators and the worst Senators.

05:47.900 --> 05:58.900
Now what these newshalks think about it doesn't necessarily make it so, but these men are in a position to know from observation, just as you would know about the members of the City Council in your own own time.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.900
So for whatever it may be worth, here are their selections.

06:02.900 --> 06:08.900
The best Senator, according to these bar's comments, is Senator Robert H. Taff, the whole House Republican.

06:08.900 --> 06:13.900
The worst of the majority said is his colleague from Ohio, Senator John Brickard.

06:13.900 --> 06:20.900
The top Democrat Senators in their opinion is Senator Paul H. Douglas, a freshman of Senator from Illinois.

06:20.900 --> 06:25.900
They thought he was third best, trailing Senators Taff and Ben Inver.

06:25.900 --> 06:31.900
The ninth best, the 211 Washington reporters thought, was Senator S. P. Fawhrer of Tennessee.

06:31.900 --> 06:37.900
He and Senator Walter George of George were the only Senators among the first 10 names.

06:37.900 --> 06:43.900
On the other side of the measure, Senator T. Fawhrer plus 12 only list of worst Senators.

06:43.900 --> 06:51.900
So we in your Senators office are still at a loss as to whether Senator T. Fawhrer is considered one of the best or one of the worst Senators in Washington.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.900
One of the reporters declined to pick the worst Senators.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.900
The reason? Too much competition he said.

06:57.900 --> 07:02.900
Thursday night, the Senate extended the reciprocal trade agreements program.

07:02.900 --> 07:11.900
This is the legislation originally conceived by Tennessee's own Cornell Paul, which we described in some detail on the last broadcast.

07:11.900 --> 07:19.900
Final vote was better than 3 to 1. The important vote was on the Millican Pearl Point Amendment, which we also detailed last week.

07:19.900 --> 07:23.900
This amendment would have required the President to make public explanation to Congress.

07:23.900 --> 07:30.900
If he cut the custom, he used the low Pearl Point level, which the entire Commission considered injurious to our own domestic producers.

07:30.900 --> 07:37.900
The vote along was along party lines, and the amendment was defeated by five votes, 43 to 38.

07:37.900 --> 07:42.900
And so this whole trade program has continued for three years without any crippling amendments.

07:42.900 --> 07:50.900
Back crippling Pearl Point amendment written into the law by the Republican 80th Congress is now eliminated.

07:50.900 --> 07:54.900
Let me quote to you what Senator Kefaw were ahead and say about this program.

07:54.900 --> 08:02.900
I feel Senator Kefaw were said in one speech that one of the quarter stones of our foreign policy is the fall of reciprocal trade agreements program.

08:02.900 --> 08:09.900
Our great Tennessee and Cornell Paul, in my opinion, has made the greatest possible contribution toward world peace,

08:09.900 --> 08:19.900
and toward the welfare of our country, putting forth and fighting for the adoption of this plan, which enables nations to trade with one another, to understand one another.

08:19.900 --> 08:26.900
The continuation of the whole program Senator Kefaw were said absolutely is absolutely necessary in our own national interest.

08:26.900 --> 08:36.900
With an expanded agriculture and with backpriced producing almost half of the world's industrial output, it is vitally necessary that we trade with the rest of the world.

08:36.900 --> 08:46.900
The only way we can do this, the Senator continued, is by reciprocal adjustments of tariffs, such as provided for under the fall reciprocal trade agreements program.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.900
Now that's the end of Senator Kefaw's presentation.

08:49.900 --> 08:56.900
But Tennessee has felt benefits already from the new public housing law passed earlier this year.

08:56.900 --> 09:05.900
Your Senator's office was advised Thursday that the housing authority of the City of Kingsport had been assigned 225 units of low-rout rent public housing.

09:05.900 --> 09:20.900
This is only its initial share. The public housing administrator included these 225 units for Kingsport as a part of the national total of 810,000 units of low-rout public housing to be constructed during the next two years.

09:20.900 --> 09:28.900
100 of these houses will be built next 12 months, remaining 125 will be completed within 24 months.

09:28.900 --> 09:37.900
In addition, the Kingsport housing authority has requested a preliminary loan of 77,500 dollars, be used for planning the price.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.900
This loan must be approved by the President.

09:40.900 --> 09:50.900
And the dollar conference is ended here in the past week. Representatives of the American Canadian and British government held linked the sessions undertaking to help solve Britain's economic crisis.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.900
The British position is considered much improved as a result of these conferences.

09:54.900 --> 10:00.900
The net result is a program to place great Britain on a pay-as-you-go basis by 1952.

10:00.900 --> 10:06.900
Breed Britain was given more latitude in the use of ECA dollars in her purchasing from other nations.

10:06.900 --> 10:18.900
And the United States promised to see what could be done toward providing the British Empire with more dollars by stockpiling commodities such as rubber, tin and so forth from British colonial possessions.

10:18.900 --> 10:24.900
We are also pledged to try and ease our customs and trade practices to give Britain better markets in the United States.

10:24.900 --> 10:30.900
It goes almost without saying that any plans we have for a perpetual peace must include great Britain.

10:30.900 --> 10:39.900
Now that we recognize the fact that what affects other nations of the world also affects us, we must seek to it that democratic nations do not fail economically.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.900
War and international trade are interrelated.

10:42.900 --> 10:46.900
Economics calls war as much as any other single thing.

10:46.900 --> 10:50.900
It is good that the whole trade agreements program was extended at this time,

10:50.900 --> 10:55.900
to show to the world that we mean business about this business a remaining world minded.

10:55.900 --> 11:07.900
Nations which are unable to solve their dollar shorties problems such as Great Britain were advised to do by the international monetary fund to devide your their currencies as one way to ease their economic situation.

11:07.900 --> 11:19.900
This advice was sanctioned more or less by President Prumos, who said that I'm voting nothing but contribute more to the peace of the world that international cooperation in finance and development.

11:19.900 --> 11:28.900
He said further to delegates from 48 nations that a principle objective of his program is to remove obstacles to international trade.

11:28.900 --> 11:35.900
For those such as myself who are not well versed in physical matters, these matters may be complex.

11:35.900 --> 11:39.900
But complex or not, there is no doubt about their prime importance.

11:39.900 --> 11:44.900
We should inform ourselves about those problems as best we can.

11:44.900 --> 11:49.900
All Washington Watts distracts the situation the teen industry is fast-pleased.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.900
The Missouri Pacific Railroad is in the throat of a standstill strike.

11:52.900 --> 11:56.900
Stacks in the steel and coal industries are being predicted.

11:56.900 --> 12:03.900
It appears for a brief while in the past week, the big news would be the settlement of the differences between labor and management in the steel industry.

12:04.900 --> 12:09.900
The President's back-finding board recommended no fourth round of wage increases for labor at this time.

12:09.900 --> 12:18.900
The thought that the steel industry with huge profits could well afford to contribute an extra 10 cents an hour to pension and insurance funds for its employees.

12:18.900 --> 12:25.900
So the immediate reaction was that the differences in the steel industry would be settled without either a wage increase or a strike.

12:25.900 --> 12:30.900
By weeks in, however, it appeared that not a settlement, but only a truth had been reached.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.900
Here are few things we should bear in mind.

12:32.900 --> 12:37.900
In the first place, there is nothing compulsory about the findings of the fact that finding boards.

12:37.900 --> 12:44.900
It is recommended that the Union and Steel corporations work out the details of the pension plan by collective bargaining.

12:44.900 --> 12:50.900
As the board's findings are not binding on either side, more than the mere details can be gone into.

12:50.900 --> 12:56.900
At the moment this transcription is made, the Union is insisting on adoption of the board's full recommendations.

12:57.900 --> 13:03.900
While the company is in the gate, they were riskless prior to agreeing to a pension plan to which the employees contribute nothing.

13:03.900 --> 13:18.900
With labor legislation, the next order of business in the Senate following the arms implementation debate, you may rest assured that many Washington eyes and ears will be open to what transpires in the war of nerves between labor and management in the steel industry.

13:20.900 --> 13:25.900
Finally, we come to the it appears to me, the portion of this broad case.

13:25.900 --> 13:30.900
Statement time about the mayor of my own that should not be accepted as the views of Senator Steve Paul.

13:30.900 --> 13:38.900
But in my own opinion, the government of the United States may be breaking the face of its veterans by recent rulings of the Veterans Administration.

13:38.900 --> 13:50.900
Back while many of us are still in uniform, the Congress in accident-to-law, the so-called GI Bill of Rights, is an endless Senator Steve Paul, that was one of the original sponsors of this legislation in the House.

13:50.900 --> 13:55.900
The GI Bill included educational privileges for veterans to comply with.

13:55.900 --> 14:08.900
Several million veterans still have credit views on them because they have used none or only a part of educational benefits, which the Congress said they are entitled because of their duty and armed forces of the United States.
