00:30.000 --> 00:44.000
Charlie, you have certainly obviously a big question.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.440
The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that nickels are entitled to equal facilities on railroad

00:49.440 --> 00:52.000
batting cars and apparent title to age.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.840
Legal education and personal philosophy have offered by the state's decisions about

00:55.840 --> 00:56.840
the race.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.840
The first mentioned case was against the Southern Railroad.

01:00.840 --> 01:06.840
The other ruling cases originated in Texas in North New York and had to deal with the

01:06.840 --> 01:09.840
lawsuit for those states.

01:09.840 --> 01:23.840
Charlie, the Supreme Court is very careful in the opinion that they still held to the

01:23.840 --> 01:24.840
southern railroads case.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
They were maintaining the top in the separate political facilities.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
And I'm the proof and spars.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.840
The university cases are concerned was that they were not getting equal facilities so that

01:30.840 --> 01:33.840
those two cases are not quite as important as the railroad case.

01:33.840 --> 01:43.840
In the Southern Railroad case, they were still said that they were maintaining the top

01:43.840 --> 01:46.840
in the separate political facilities.

01:46.840 --> 01:53.840
But frankly, I find it very hard on facts to see how there's much less in the substance

01:53.840 --> 01:56.840
like that in the past.

01:56.840 --> 02:02.840
It looked like the person involved was getting the same facilities, the same price, the same

02:02.840 --> 02:03.840
maintenance.

02:03.840 --> 02:09.840
So as we are in this situation, this case doesn't need very much to the substance like the

02:09.840 --> 02:12.840
top in the Supreme Court still verbally stands back.

02:12.840 --> 02:19.840
So at least there's going to have to be a great deal of litigation to see just what

02:19.840 --> 02:22.840
the Supreme Court did mean.

02:22.840 --> 02:34.840
Well on Monday also the press ensigned into lower bill authorizing the expenditure of slightly

02:34.840 --> 02:38.840
more than $3 billion for foreign economic assistance.

02:38.840 --> 02:43.840
Included in that program was $35 million to assist in the development of factored areas

02:43.840 --> 02:44.840
of the world.

02:44.840 --> 02:49.840
This is just the beginning, of course, of the President's program for a great international cooperative

02:49.840 --> 02:54.840
enterprise by the achievement of a world of peace, freedom and a better economy.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.840
The bill signed by the President is merely the authorization.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.840
No funds have a judgment appropriate.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.840
This is a significant step in our foreign relations.

03:04.840 --> 03:09.840
With the exception of the point for programs, all of our other foreign aid programs are of emergency

03:09.840 --> 03:12.840
nature and are therefore temperate.

03:12.840 --> 03:17.840
The point for program on the other hand is long range in its scope and was to let a file of temporary

03:17.840 --> 03:23.840
gains made by the Marshall program and other programs and introduced a initiative and free

03:23.840 --> 03:26.840
enterprise to expand the world's economy.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.840
That is at least the intention of it.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.840
In no better way could we promote freedom and the muscles.

03:32.840 --> 03:39.840
Probably the first step will be the provision of technical assistance to underpiction of

03:39.840 --> 03:43.840
America, no matter how modernized and developed region.

03:43.840 --> 03:50.840
In other words, we will have technical missions to battle and teach people how to help themselves.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.840
Some of this work will be done through the United Nations organization, some through agreements

03:54.840 --> 04:00.840
with other national governments and some through five organizations already so engaged.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.840
Eventually, they've made support of this effort must come from five itself to the long-erased

04:05.840 --> 04:06.840
places.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.840
It is going to be successful.

04:08.840 --> 04:14.840
If the effort to induce private enterprise to invest in fact with areas is successful, we will

04:14.840 --> 04:20.840
achieve a new ideal in foreign aid and some relief for the collective pocketbook of the American

04:20.840 --> 04:21.840
people.

04:21.840 --> 04:24.840
How do you consider this a new idea?

04:24.840 --> 04:28.840
Do you think you're another, or do you think you're the best at everything?

04:28.840 --> 04:33.840
It is new and novel, Charlie, because it is a business-like investment by private enterprise

04:33.840 --> 04:37.840
for a profit as opposed to the British idea of a colonial empire.

04:37.840 --> 04:42.840
It will require a lot of energy and a lot of good faith, but if point four is successful,

04:42.840 --> 04:48.840
we will have obtained much and will have had something to hold on to after the martial

04:48.840 --> 04:49.840
program expires.

04:49.840 --> 05:05.840
Well, of course, Charlie, there is no certainty about it, but the forthcoming concept is to

05:05.840 --> 05:09.840
the effect that no tax bill will be considered before adjournment.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.840
Everybody is trying to get a adjourned here in Congress about July 31st.

05:13.840 --> 05:18.840
At this moment, the House Ways and Means Committee, which, as you know, must initiate all

05:18.840 --> 05:23.840
the tax legislation in Congress, hasn't completed the job of writing a bill.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.840
The thinking of some of the leaders of the program here in the Senate seems to be that it will

05:27.840 --> 05:30.840
be impossible for the Senate to complete action on this measure.

05:30.840 --> 05:36.840
At this Congress, unless it appears a house by the first of July, it didn't prepare the

05:36.840 --> 05:37.840
new tax bill.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.840
So, I have to admit that we were working in that.

05:41.840 --> 05:48.840
Yes, if I remember correctly, the President recommended that some 650 million in such taxes

05:48.840 --> 05:49.840
be eliminated.

05:49.840 --> 05:55.840
But he recommended also that the Congress make up the resulting deficit in revenue from other

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
sources.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.840
So, the implication is clear that the President may be expected to be fully exposed to tax

06:01.840 --> 06:04.840
repeals unless the deficiency is divided for elsewhere.

06:04.840 --> 06:14.840
Well, I understand unofficially that the Committee is at the 800 million mark and the PO-118

06:14.840 --> 06:21.840
is the terrible face of retail and at the 800 million gap is closed before the repeal reaches

06:21.840 --> 06:22.840
the House by now.

06:22.840 --> 06:27.840
I regret that the President placed this condition on his recommendation.

06:27.840 --> 06:32.840
The war is over and these exercises should be either repealed outright and most instances

06:32.840 --> 06:34.840
are substantial reviews.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.840
It hits the pocket books of too many people who are finding it hard enough already to make

06:39.840 --> 06:40.840
ends meet.

06:40.840 --> 06:46.840
At the same time, I am proposing some of the loopholes and various revenue statutes as the

06:46.840 --> 06:47.840
President recommends.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.840
I don't think they will be able to put the two together.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.840
The first place, Charlie, this is a good demonstration of our democracies, differences of opinion,

07:25.840 --> 07:27.840
honest differences, too, I think.

07:27.840 --> 07:32.840
But the distinguishing difference lies in the fact that one default is real listiques,

07:32.840 --> 07:34.840
other is idealistic.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.840
And they may undistarm and plan without the world's arm and preview.

07:39.840 --> 07:45.840
Of course, nothing would please me more than a workable plan for worldwide disarmament and the

07:45.840 --> 07:49.840
expenditure of more funds to advance the cause of the lasting peace.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.840
But I'm in shock, this agreement was centered in MacMahon and the 10 other members of Congress

07:54.840 --> 07:57.840
as to the wisdom of such a proposal at this time.

07:57.840 --> 08:03.840
As one of my colleagues, the Secretary-General of the last recent said, to have vision is

08:03.840 --> 08:08.840
nothing that could put on rose colored glasses and blinkers to prove there's another.

08:08.840 --> 08:14.840
If we were to look at this tree, we will see that the difficulty caused by the idealistic

08:14.840 --> 08:17.840
proposal when our blinkers blinded us to reality.

08:17.840 --> 08:22.840
After the First World War, we entered into a disarmament plan with Japan.

08:22.840 --> 08:29.840
In World War II, Japan had a nearly tragic, maybe naval advantage.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.840
I demobilization followed in the recent World War was to rapidly rapid.

08:33.840 --> 08:38.840
And as a result, we have been under pressure from the coming of the past five years.

08:38.840 --> 08:43.840
I had to think what the other democracies in the world would think if we suddenly lived through

08:43.840 --> 08:47.840
our leadership without warning or with warning for that matter.

08:47.840 --> 08:52.840
Whether or not they wanted that way, Russia's majesty's power with imperialistic notion

08:52.840 --> 08:55.840
then not overflowing the democracies of the world.

08:55.840 --> 09:00.840
So long as Soviet Russia is ruled by the communist, now in power, we would be entering into

09:00.840 --> 09:05.840
a national suicide act to agree to any disarmament approach.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.840
Immediately, we would power trade a Russian country.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.840
As General Marshall said Wednesday, the city of Putin is the worst thing we can do.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.840
The violent rallies render ourselves in Putin's worst.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.840
I the older one is for goals, but this is the time for reality.

09:27.840 --> 09:31.840
While with extreme pleasure, Charlie, each year the Southern Agustosalist,

09:31.840 --> 09:36.840
which recently combined with the magazine Farm and Rans at the Nashville,

09:36.840 --> 09:44.840
the head office, the lecture Young Man and the Young Woman as winners of the rural life contest.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.840
Now what's the end of this no-brake column?

09:46.840 --> 09:53.840
The associate editor of the magazine has these two winners here in Washington and here in our studio at this time.

09:53.840 --> 09:59.840
This column at the pleasure of have you and how these blended rural leaders as guests.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.840
And will you present the young lady who's with you?

10:02.840 --> 10:04.840
Hello, I'm having a wonderful time.

10:04.840 --> 10:08.840
Well, thank you, George, and Mrs. Nobby's column.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.840
I appreciate the opportunity of presenting the four-way winner in the rural life contest.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.840
The Sunday Young Man from the Cheater County State University,

10:17.840 --> 10:19.840
Pauline Bluff.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.840
Pauline Bluff, the winner of the annual holiday contest.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.840
Hello, I'm having a wonderful time.

10:25.840 --> 10:29.840
Well, thank you, George, and Mrs. Nobby's column.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.840
I appreciate the opportunity of presenting the four-way winner in the rural life contest.

10:33.840 --> 10:37.840
The Sunday Young Man from the Cheater County State University, Pauline Bluff.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.840
Pauline County is honored as the new one this contest.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.840
Will you tell us where you live?

10:43.840 --> 10:49.840
Pauline, will you tell us what the contest is and what George is all about?

10:49.840 --> 10:51.840
Good time kimse.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.840
Hope you can go out and do your best.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.840
Hope you can go out and do your best.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.840
Hope you can go out and do your best.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.840
Hope you can go out and do your best.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.840
Hope you can go out and do your best.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.840
Well, what subject was you after your own time?

11:05.840 --> 11:09.840
Actually, I'm not a member of the forum, but the first part.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.840
I'm special in arts.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.840
But I'm a good woman going to work for the city of New Zealand.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.840
I'm a wonderful woman.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.840
I'm about to be a great young woman.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.840
I'm about to be a great fermenter.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.840
I'm about to be a great fermenter.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.840
You have to be a great fermenter.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.840
I don't think you're a great fermenter.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.840
That's my first time.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.840
Well, how about another young farmer?

11:31.840 --> 11:33.840
Do you think the TVA unit sets for a bit?

11:33.840 --> 11:35.840
It's worth my life.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.840
I'm about to be a great fermenter.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.840
It's called a farm.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.840
It's called a farm.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
It's called a farm.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.840
It's called a farm.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.840
Well, howling is there.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.840
It's very good to have you and George Wooden on this occasion.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.840
I remember the last year that they just told him how the two winners.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.840
I think that you won the Alabama and the other ones in North Carolina.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.840
They had a great time in Washington and New York.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.840
I know that you and George,

12:05.840 --> 12:09.840
and you are the first of many talented New Yorkers and here in Washington.

12:09.840 --> 12:13.840
And George having our over-years lunch was beyond yesterday.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.840
It's the time you must start a number of hungers and you're in Tennessee.

12:17.840 --> 12:23.840
I didn't want to say Charlie also that one thing that 40's time off,

12:23.840 --> 12:27.840
that I like started the I had to close the office,

12:27.840 --> 12:33.840
and a humble and valid postage and meeting of not-examination kind of things.

12:33.840 --> 12:39.840
The first meeting was to get together with people who were empty-years in the various communities

12:39.840 --> 12:41.840
and kind of things and puppies.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.840
And the interest of having the humble and valid is all about the kind of things that are valid.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.840
The enthusiasm that this meeting was most inspired.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.840
It was also very heartening to time there,

12:53.840 --> 12:55.840
many public officials, members of the county court,

12:55.840 --> 13:03.840
and others who previously had been against including the humble and valid in the CDA.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.840
But because of the increased power demand of that section of the country,

13:07.840 --> 13:13.840
it's actually lost the tendency and some puppies to make the biggest possible contribution

13:13.840 --> 13:17.840
to the defense of our nation.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.840
We found that many of these leaders had changed their mind about the matter

13:21.840 --> 13:27.840
and are now all in favor of having humble and developed through its greatest full-centrality

13:27.840 --> 13:29.840
and by the Tennessee Valley of Florida.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.840
I hope that we can keep up this enthusiasm,

13:33.840 --> 13:35.840
and if we do, we're going to get to build a path.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.840
I thought we would sign off for it.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.840
There you are.

14:09.840 --> 14:15.840
So, I was certainly in good, right in the year, and that's right over on the subway now.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.840
And I don't know.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.840
I'll put it around and then I want to have a little bit of this.
