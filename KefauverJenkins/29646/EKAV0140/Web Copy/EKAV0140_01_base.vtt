WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.660
is not the same picture. As the one, the same picture in all detail as the one Mr.

00:12.660 --> 00:18.080
Wilson met. Yes sir, I can say that they are different pictures. There's no doubt about

00:18.080 --> 00:24.120
that. You have no way of knowing, of course, for the different photography. We took them

00:24.120 --> 00:28.520
over there, but the same photography were took them at a succeeding moment. No sir, as

00:28.520 --> 00:33.520
you remember there were two photographers and I have never seen any other pictures that

00:33.520 --> 00:38.520
they took. Unless these are two of them. Then we had a say Mr. Chairman, and I frankly

00:38.520 --> 00:44.520
can't see any good importance to this. We have the same police department Mr. Shining

00:44.520 --> 00:54.520
Faith, the same room smile Mr. Steven Faith, we have in one picture of the other and I

00:54.520 --> 01:01.520
would not get only one time on this. Council have any further questions? Mr. Chairman,

01:01.520 --> 01:08.520
I ask you to file the picture you sent or have sent from the office in New York City

01:08.520 --> 01:14.520
for the purposes of identification as exhibit one to your testimony. And the large blown

01:14.520 --> 01:19.520
up photograph being the second one exhibited as exhibit number two to your testimony and

01:19.520 --> 01:24.520
as to the importance and so identify those photographs and that is all I can ask Mr.

01:24.520 --> 01:29.520
Chairman, to be accepted and we call you to chair head no further questions. Mr. Shining

01:29.520 --> 01:38.520
at this time has Senator McCaw. Sir, the large picture is not by the other one, but

01:38.520 --> 01:45.520
by pleasure sir, then a touch of the testimony. I am not sure if the purpose of identifying

01:45.520 --> 01:50.520
the picture. Yes sir. Chair, I accept the exhibit in council that's permissible and

01:50.520 --> 01:59.520
we'll have it in record. Senator McCaw. Mr. Shining, I am Mr. Gear Testimony. You have never

01:59.520 --> 02:08.520
seen this picture that came from your wall from the time that you brought it to Washington

02:08.520 --> 02:14.520
and delivered it to the man whom you have identified. I did not open the fact that you

02:14.520 --> 02:21.520
saw. I opened it in my office when I got there to make sure the disc rooms are picture of

02:21.520 --> 02:27.520
secretary Stevens and myself, the one that Mr. Jenkins had requested. And then I asked one

02:27.520 --> 02:36.520
of the girls in the office to wrap it up again and I brought it in that form to me a one

02:36.520 --> 02:43.520
while I gave it to Mr. Nautcus. So that would mean you had not seen it since that

02:43.520 --> 02:55.520
was your testimony. Have you in company with others had some pictures looking at them since

02:55.520 --> 03:03.520
then that you recall? Have I heard what? Well, we'll make it a little more specific. Do you

03:03.520 --> 03:09.520
recall whether you had dinner last Friday night at the Colony House right across from

03:09.520 --> 03:20.520
the Mayflower Hotel? I do not recall having dinner there sir. Well do you say you did

03:20.520 --> 03:28.520
or did? I think I was asked to come in there and I believe I had some ice cream sir.

03:28.520 --> 03:35.520
Who will he in company with at the time? I will be by members of the staff sir.

03:35.520 --> 03:44.520
Members of the staff sir. Yes sir. Well will you? This was not a Friday sir. Why do I have

03:44.520 --> 03:50.520
a Friday? Might have had a Friday sir. I do not believe it was there. Well I will send you

03:50.520 --> 03:57.520
delivered to picture one. Yes sir. We've sent state. Did you at that time when the

03:57.520 --> 04:05.520
others have some pictures there? I mean you have some pictures of? Yes. At that time

04:05.520 --> 04:16.520
it's old state whether this picture was in the number. No other. There were good

04:16.520 --> 04:22.520
pictures. I have not seen this picture so far. That's why I understand you just say

04:22.520 --> 04:26.520
if you have, I'm prime clear of some of the pictures as much as you're in this city.

04:26.520 --> 04:32.520
One else, yes sir. Did you at that time have some other pictures there that you

04:32.520 --> 04:43.520
were examining? I may have sir. Well do you recall? Yes sir. I had another picture

04:43.520 --> 04:48.520
sir. What picture was that? This one I would not have thought you I'm the old

04:48.520 --> 04:55.520
I'm interested in was this picture or one different to this? This was a picture of

04:55.520 --> 05:02.520
members of the staff, the staff of the McCarthy and General Lawton. How many pictures,

05:02.520 --> 05:07.520
different pictures that you have there at the time? Just one sir. Just one big. Just

05:07.520 --> 05:13.520
sir. You now recall that incident. I do sir. That was you think last Friday night. I

05:13.520 --> 05:18.520
don't believe it was Friday sir. I believe it was sometimes last week. It may have

05:18.520 --> 05:25.520
no significance at all but just I wanted to let you clear it up. Just say this picture

05:25.520 --> 05:33.520
was not there. It was definitely not there. What's the other picture about the same size as this?

05:33.520 --> 05:40.520
I'm not sure whether they were the same size. They were the only one I thought

05:40.520 --> 05:46.520
you said they don't have one. You asked me to say whether the other picture was the same size

05:46.520 --> 05:53.520
as this one. That's right. I don't know whether they were the same size. Well I said

05:53.520 --> 06:01.520
about the same size. I'm trying to determine whether this thing was there and

06:01.520 --> 06:09.520
not it is one similar that might call somebody to make a mistaken identity. I believe

06:09.520 --> 06:15.520
this one is about an 8 by 10 sir and possibly the other one was 10 by 12 or 8 by 10.

06:15.520 --> 06:19.520
The larger than this you say. I'm not sure if sir.

06:19.520 --> 06:26.520
Let me try to put it on the other side of the phone. My dad is part of me. This is

06:26.520 --> 06:31.520
the private time deal. The picture is an innocent minimum. What's the identity of the

06:31.520 --> 06:36.520
country? The picture is the right time. I think it will be good. Well, Mr.

06:36.520 --> 06:43.520
Chairman, I believe I'd like to have the witness testify. I do not know that I can't

06:43.520 --> 06:49.520
see the other picture. I'm only trying to determine. I'd like to hear this picture was

06:49.520 --> 06:55.520
the picture and if not, whether someone else might have been mistaken and I'm

06:55.520 --> 07:01.520
taken to identify this picture and I'm asking him so he may also have president

07:01.520 --> 07:08.520
on the stand in this picture or the authenticity of it or whether it is doctor

07:08.520 --> 07:14.520
visit issue that he may clear out this thing. I would be very happy to sir. I remember

07:14.520 --> 07:21.520
the staff requested that I produce another picture. This was a picture taken when

07:22.520 --> 07:29.520
the committee was holding hearings on communist infiltration in the signal call of the

07:29.520 --> 07:40.520
army and I now recall at the staff has the picture and I understand how they can

07:40.520 --> 07:45.520
produce it if you'd like them to. All right, let's get it completely clear and

07:46.520 --> 07:52.520
accurate now. You did not have this picture but you did have another picture there

07:52.520 --> 07:57.520
at the top. Yes sir. I'll ask identify the time from your recollection if it was not

07:57.520 --> 08:03.520
last Friday night when was it might have been Thursday night sir. Either Thursday

08:03.520 --> 08:07.520
or Friday night of last week. Yes sir. Who was in the party with you?

08:07.520 --> 08:22.520
Ma'am. I think that Mr. Cron, Mr. Cron, Mr. Juliette, possibly one or two other members

08:22.520 --> 08:29.520
of the staff. Was the man whom you have made as the one whom you delivered this

08:29.520 --> 08:36.520
picture was he president at that time? I really don't remember that. Thank you.

08:37.520 --> 08:44.520
George and Masters. George and Masters is the ma'am I'm inquiring about was he president

08:44.520 --> 08:53.520
at that time. I don't recall for. I don't think he was. That is all from the president.

08:54.520 --> 09:00.520
Senator Jackson. Senator Jackson. Yes.

09:00.520 --> 09:10.520
This is I understood that you went up to New York on what day last week to get the picture.

09:10.520 --> 09:17.520
I wasn't. I wasn't even. When's the evening and you returned with what's the evening.

09:17.520 --> 09:22.520
I returned to the next day sir. You returned on Thursday. Yes sir.

09:22.520 --> 09:29.520
And then you delivered the picture on Thursday to Mr. and Masters. Yes sir.

09:29.520 --> 09:37.520
Was that Thursday morning or afternoon? It was just at the beginning of the afternoon there

09:38.520 --> 09:49.520
but did you come back from New York with I came along. Yes sir. Now you testified

09:49.520 --> 09:57.520
that you had no direct contact with the staff. That I had no direct contact with the staff.

09:57.520 --> 10:04.520
Well you testified in response. I assume since the hearing started in response to

10:04.520 --> 10:13.520
a Christmire Mr. Jenkins you said you had no sir. I said I have no direct contact with the staff.

10:13.520 --> 10:19.520
Very, very good. Is that you haven't talked with anyone on the staff.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.520
Not well hearing is going on sir because they're sitting right at the table sir.

10:23.520 --> 10:28.520
You haven't talked with anyone on the staff in the evening or any other time. Oh yes sir.

10:28.520 --> 10:35.520
I have been available and anxious and ready to cooperate in any way I can with members of the committee,

10:35.520 --> 10:42.520
with members of the staff and with the department of the I came. I thought you wanted to correct that because I did not say I had no direct contact.

10:42.520 --> 10:48.520
Very sure. I said during the hearing sir. I have not talked on the telephone with members of the staff.

10:48.520 --> 10:53.520
As far as I can remember. You mean during the formal hearing. Here's the open but you don't mean after all.

10:53.520 --> 10:59.520
No sir they have followed on me to do a great deal of work to produce many things.

10:59.520 --> 11:06.520
Does any member of the staff do any work for you in preparing anything for you? Yes sir.

11:06.520 --> 11:18.520
So some of the staff are assisting you then. No sir. If I am asked by the staff to write out something involving a report.

11:18.520 --> 11:25.520
I feel free to call upon the staff and have to stay in the proper date or look at some of these.

11:25.520 --> 11:32.520
We have a request for the staff to do any work for you. No sir.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.520
That's all.

11:36.520 --> 11:41.520
Senator Potter. Senator Samminton. Senator Poiseck.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.520
Senator Poiseck.

11:43.520 --> 11:48.520
All for you. Everything's human. No sir.

11:48.520 --> 12:06.520
By the time you have understood any understanding of the person's time with the specific meeting of the staff committee.

12:06.520 --> 12:12.520
The government operations committee to remain on its staff. Are they involved?

12:12.520 --> 12:19.520
Yes sir. You have any agreement in the situation's time with the staff committee to remain as a member of the staff.

12:19.520 --> 12:28.520
I am a pilot of the Army sir and I am not engaged by the staff committee except insofar as instructions are given to me to cooperate.

12:28.520 --> 12:34.520
Which I am ready as willing to do. Would you any army on the other 24th? I was there in three. Yes sir.

12:34.520 --> 12:45.520
I have used this copy of the committee's letter at that time. I have pleased to hear that somebody in my office typed out letter.

12:45.520 --> 12:54.520
I probably was informed of the picture that arrived and I didn't feel as though anything wrong with the...

12:54.520 --> 13:00.520
I don't feel as anything wrong with using that situation there. If they probably had it available. Are you still using?

13:00.520 --> 13:13.520
I am not sure. But you did use it on November 24th. Well, somebody in the office selected that for the letter. Although I don't see any official designation on that sir.

13:13.520 --> 13:21.520
Well, I am next. If I'm not bad, I'm just wondering whether you were authorized to use this stationery or be picking up private.

13:21.520 --> 13:33.520
I am really sure that sir... I haven't been here very patiently. Watching centers go far up the hill.

13:33.520 --> 13:41.520
I thought you were questioning this witness, according to Mr. Jenkins' statement, in regard to the authenticity of this photograph.

13:41.520 --> 13:53.520
If we wanted to wonder the question, whether or not you use the piece of my stationery at some time, it's been famine at all right. But if you can open this up, then I must...

13:53.520 --> 13:58.520
I must want to look at the sliding shoes off. So, I should determine a minor title to my rights to remember this.

13:58.520 --> 14:04.520
Point of order, Mr. Chairman. It's not a point of order. It's not a point of order, Mr. Chairman. That's the council stated.

14:04.520 --> 14:14.520
The finish. Council stated that we would only win with this turn. The question, and I often just do the photograph.

14:14.520 --> 14:23.520
The Chair would like to remind the Senator Toysack that the council is interested in. And I think that's before you return to the committee, Mr. Senator.

14:23.520 --> 14:32.520
That's a question at this time to pray with China to be addressed only to the authenticity of the photograph.

14:32.520 --> 14:37.520
You are all... You are recharming having heard that. You are returning the mission when I was over entering the road.

14:37.520 --> 14:42.520
Correct. You were returning. So, the Senator McRathie's point of order is well taken.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.520
I don't think you were here.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.520
Senator McRathie, any further questions?

14:49.520 --> 14:52.520
Mr. Council, the Chair has... What's the question?

14:52.520 --> 14:54.520
Yes, I do now.

14:54.520 --> 15:00.520
The Chair, in view of questions, ask you, Senator McRathie.

15:00.520 --> 15:08.520
I'm out of the mid-mire duty on behalf of this committee to ask you, Father, with reference to these photographs.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.520
Yes, sir.

15:10.520 --> 15:21.520
I understand you just say that last Friday evening you were at the Colony Club or Old Colony Club in Washington.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.520
I was nervous, sir.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.520
Last Thursday night.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.520
I believe it was Friday, sir, for the last 20 years.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.520
From the May 5th hotel.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.520
Yes, sir.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.520
And that Mr. Colony was present.

15:32.520 --> 15:33.520
Yes, sir.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.520
Mr. Colony was present.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.520
I believe he was, sir.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.520
He was present.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.520
Yes, sir.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.520
You were present.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.520
Yes, sir.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.520
And you were asked by Senator McRathie and the winner, not George.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.520
And that's just his present.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.520
You look all right.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.520
Yes, sir, I do.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.520
Your answer was that you didn't remember.

15:54.520 --> 16:01.520
My answer was, sir, that I do not recall that he was present, but I do not believe that he was.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.520
Was anybody else in the party outside of those that you named?

16:05.520 --> 16:07.520
That you distinctly recall?

16:07.520 --> 16:09.520
I don't distinctly recall anybody else.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.520
How the time of night was that party given?

16:11.520 --> 16:14.520
I don't know that it was the party.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.520
How the difference is?

16:15.520 --> 16:17.520
What time did the group resemble?

16:17.520 --> 16:19.520
I don't know.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.520
You know what I mean.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.520
I don't know.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.520
What did you go back?

16:22.520 --> 16:26.520
I came there after they had begun eating dinner, sir.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.520
What time of night?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.520
I don't know what time they ate dinner.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.520
Neither does the committee.

16:30.520 --> 16:34.520
I believe it must have been in the middle of the evening.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.520
What time is the middle of the evening?

16:37.520 --> 16:41.520
Nine or ten o'clock at the invitation did you come?

16:41.520 --> 16:46.520
I came with the request of either Mr. Coler or Mr. Carter.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.520
You came, you went alone.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.520
Yes, sir.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.520
Knowing that the assembly you was there?

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
Yes, sir.

16:53.520 --> 16:59.520
Mr. Schein, did you take this photograph with you that you referred to?

16:59.520 --> 17:05.520
A photograph of you Senator McCarthy and my best-sothers.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.520
Did you take it wrong with you when you went to the office?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
Is that old Coler and the club?

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
I never heard of it.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.520
I believe it's Coler and the Coler and the rest are on it.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.520
The watch?

17:14.520 --> 17:15.520
The Coler and the rest are on it.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.520
Not a spin point.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.520
It's the Coler and the rest are on it.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.520
Yes, sir.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.520
Did you take that photograph with you?

17:20.520 --> 17:21.520
Yes, sir.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.520
What was the occasion of you doing that?

17:24.520 --> 17:26.520
I believe I was asked to, sir.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.520
Pardon?

17:27.520 --> 17:29.520
I'm not sure, sir.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.520
Either Mr. Coler or Mr. Carter.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.520
No, I'm not sure, sir.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.520
I believe they wanted it, sir.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.520
I don't know the purpose.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.520
What was the request?

17:37.520 --> 17:41.520
I used Senator McCarthy and who lived?

17:41.520 --> 17:44.520
General Lawson is in the picture, sir.

17:44.520 --> 17:48.520
As far as you know, I recall it was the photograph of you three only.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.520
No, sir.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.520
Other members of the staff.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.520
Well, then you, General Lawson, Senator McCarthy.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.520
Mr. Coler, is that right?

17:57.520 --> 17:58.520
Yes, sir.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.520
Mr. Ulyanna?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.520
Yes, sir.

18:00.520 --> 18:01.520
Mr. Carter.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.520
I believe there was six in the picture, sir.

18:04.520 --> 18:13.520
What was the occasion of you being invited to come to the Coler and the rest, sir?

18:13.520 --> 18:17.520
And bring with you that particular photograph, why did they want it?

18:17.520 --> 18:19.520
I have no idea, sir.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.520
Well, you found out no doubt when you got there, what they wanted with it.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.520
Well, I've had a request for many things, sir, in the last several days.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.520
And I'm trying to comply with all of these requests.

18:30.520 --> 18:35.520
Well, now you were asked specifically whether or not George and Astus was there.

18:35.520 --> 18:44.520
And as I understand you, you say that this photograph that hung on your wall in New York City was delivered by you to George and Astus.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
Yes, sir.

18:45.520 --> 18:50.520
And you say you don't remember whether George and Astus was there at the Coler and the rest?

18:50.520 --> 18:52.520
I don't think he was there.

18:52.520 --> 18:56.520
Well, I know you first said as I record that you didn't remember whether.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.520
I'm not sure that he was there.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.520
Now, you remember what you ate there that night?

18:59.520 --> 19:00.520
You told us, sir.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.520
I did.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.520
Did you ate ice cream?

19:02.520 --> 19:03.520
I had a butter scotch and a nut.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
And you remember the time in the RAM?

19:05.520 --> 19:07.520
Butter scotch ice cream?

19:07.520 --> 19:08.520
Right, sir.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.520
Yes, sir.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.520
And it was not a large group of people, sir.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.520
I wouldn't say it was the last, sir.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.520
All right, you would say it was a small group.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.520
For several people, sir.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.520
Now, well, how many?

19:21.520 --> 19:23.520
You've named all of them, have you not?

19:23.520 --> 19:25.520
I...

19:25.520 --> 19:28.520
I don't know who I named, sir.

19:28.520 --> 19:31.520
I have this to shine what I want to give at this, this.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.520
And I know the committee wants to give at it.

19:34.520 --> 19:39.520
How is it that you love the bureaucratic graduates, aren't you not?

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
Rare, sir.

19:40.520 --> 19:47.520
And you have served this committee as a special consultant for some considerable time.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.520
That's correct, isn't it?

19:49.520 --> 19:50.520
Right, sir.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.520
Yes, sir.

19:51.520 --> 19:57.520
Now, Mr. Shine, the union to sell this committee here today under your own.

19:57.520 --> 20:06.520
That you do not remember today, Thursday, with whom you ate that ice cream,

20:06.520 --> 20:11.520
like Thursday, one week ago, at the colony restaurant here in Washington,

20:11.520 --> 20:13.520
is that what you're telling this committee?

20:13.520 --> 20:15.520
Oh, they're going to explain that, sir.

20:15.520 --> 20:19.520
Whether you have an explanation, I'm sure the committee would like to hear it.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.520
I am a private in the United States Army, sir.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.520
That does not affect your memory, does it?

20:25.520 --> 20:31.520
I think I have a fairly good memory, sir.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.520
All right, now.

20:33.520 --> 20:38.520
Couldn't we let the private finish his answer?

20:38.520 --> 20:41.520
If I have any more Bob, I'll apologize to you.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.520
Sir, when you're in the gasp, I'll apologize.

20:43.520 --> 20:49.520
Since I have been in the army, sir, I have been subjected to many pressures.

20:49.520 --> 20:52.520
I have to call upon to do many things.

20:52.520 --> 20:58.520
I have received many orders, quite a new age role for a private in the army to receive.

20:58.520 --> 21:02.520
And I have a pay gem for the rest of my ability.

21:02.520 --> 21:08.520
Since I came to Washington, I have at the request of many individuals attended many meetings.

21:09.520 --> 21:16.520
And this controversy has caused many of them to work late hours, including myself.

21:16.520 --> 21:27.520
And I really think it's quite natural that I can't remember who was at all of the meetings.

21:27.520 --> 21:35.520
Well, Mr. Shai, your explanation of the thing is, as we get it, that you're in the sort of a state of exhaust.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.520
I am not exhaustive, sir.

21:37.520 --> 21:41.520
I think, sir, when you were asking me about the meeting on Wednesday evening,

21:41.520 --> 21:46.520
and you asked me whether Mr. Cohn were present, and you said, perhaps Mr. Kyle was present,

21:46.520 --> 21:53.520
and perhaps other individuals were present, that you suffered from the same type of form or me that I suffered from now.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.520
I believe, Mr. Shai.

21:55.520 --> 22:04.520
I believe, the Committee believes, that perhaps I have been a little more visually engaged for the last week or two.

22:04.520 --> 22:10.520
And maybe you have, and there is some, I regret to say disparity in our ages.

22:10.520 --> 22:15.520
Well, sir, I certainly, but I'm asking you about a simple event.

22:15.520 --> 22:21.520
I certainly, we have, I certainly, of some five or just a few of me in one week ago.

22:21.520 --> 22:32.520
And when you said you didn't remember, whether or not George and that's just who happens to be the man that you delivered this New York photograph to,

22:32.520 --> 22:39.520
was present or not, I have felt that I should explore that specific further and I still think so.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.520
Well, I'll tell you why I can remember that I gave before orange you,

22:42.520 --> 22:47.520
but I was now in the haven to Mr. Shai and been here some week or ten days.

22:47.520 --> 22:53.520
Sir, haven't you been in Washington, or have you ever heard of Camp Royal, some week or ten days?

22:53.520 --> 22:55.520
I know, physically, it's all just right now.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.520
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.520
I'm getting off with sick of this.

22:59.520 --> 23:06.520
The Council, Council stated to the general that this would be respected to the photograph.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.520
I have restricted myself to that.

23:08.520 --> 23:14.520
Now we're delving into what type of ice cream the private eat last week.

23:14.520 --> 23:18.520
Now this has some, this has some relevancy to the photograph.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.520
Good. We'll go into it.

23:20.520 --> 23:24.520
But I think there's a limit to how ridiculous we can guess here.

23:24.520 --> 23:29.520
I say, Mr. Chairman, that this goes to the relevancy of the photograph

23:29.520 --> 23:39.520
if the proof develops that one week ago, approximately, this witness was in company with other members of the staff

23:39.520 --> 23:44.520
who he has mentioned and had a photograph with him.

23:44.520 --> 23:50.520
I say that it is a circumstance shedding light on the authenticity or lack of it

23:50.520 --> 23:54.520
of these photographs and I desire to pursue that examination, Father.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.520
May I speak, sir?

23:57.520 --> 23:59.520
May I finish my answer, sir?

23:59.520 --> 24:01.520
Yes, sir.

24:01.520 --> 24:06.520
You see, sir, when you sent me to New York to obtain this photograph,

24:06.520 --> 24:09.520
I did that other document, sir.

24:09.520 --> 24:18.520
I was very anxious to do answer because I understood you were quite anxious to have these things.

24:18.520 --> 24:25.520
And I went right to the airport, sir, down on the first plane.

24:25.520 --> 24:30.520
And when I came back from the Yorkshire, Mr. Amastus met me at the airplane.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.520
You testified all at now.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.520
Yes, sir.

24:33.520 --> 24:42.520
And therefore, I do remember giving him the photograph because he came with me to the office

24:42.520 --> 24:54.520
and as a matter of fact, one of the staff came in and said, let me see the picture of you and Secretary Stevens.

24:54.520 --> 25:01.520
And I said, we are better sent this right off because Mr. Jenkins is anxious to have it, so we better not open it.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.520
And I remember, Mr. Amastus taking the picture.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.520
I'm standing in the corridor.

25:07.520 --> 25:14.520
Because you were so anxious to have the picture and the documents there, I was quite anxious to comply with your wishes.

25:14.520 --> 25:24.520
And remember distinctly, the incident as to what I gave to the members of the staff on that evening.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.520
They have asked me for many things, sir.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.520
There was no urgency about this photograph.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.520
It was one of many things, perhaps, which they have requested.

25:34.520 --> 25:42.520
And I really didn't pay much attention to who was at the meeting.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.520
I merely came to the...

25:44.520 --> 25:45.520
How long have you been working?

25:45.520 --> 25:46.520
I didn't mean to cut you off.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.520
I think they were finished eating, sir.

25:48.520 --> 25:51.520
They asked me if I wanted anything.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.520
And I ordered some ice cream.

25:53.520 --> 25:58.520
And I believe I handed them whatever they asked for.

25:58.520 --> 26:02.520
And I think that we all left shortly thereafter.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.520
All right.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.520
I'll tell you the interview, I'm sure.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.520
A bigger party, I'm sure I'm sure.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.520
And I'm sure I don't mean to cut you off.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.520
I'm trying to...

26:10.520 --> 26:14.520
I think I can find out exactly who was there, sir.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.520
Not asking you that now.

26:16.520 --> 26:28.520
Mr. Shine, when I met you in Mr. Holmes' office, one evening, I requested after you had given me certain information.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.520
A photograph of you and the Secretary of the Army, did I not?

26:31.520 --> 26:32.520
You did, sir.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.520
Yes, sir.

26:33.520 --> 26:43.520
Now, Mr. Shine, you now know that I introduced his evidence from cross examination of the Secretary of the Army.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.520
A photograph of the Secretary and if you alone, you know that, don't you?

26:47.520 --> 26:48.520
Yes, sir.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.520
He doesn't know what I see.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.520
I do, sir.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
I know that, sir.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.520
Very well.

26:52.520 --> 26:56.520
It now develops that the photograph of Colonel...

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
Is it not?

26:57.520 --> 26:58.520
Is General Barney?

26:58.520 --> 26:59.520
Colonel Barney.

26:59.520 --> 27:00.520
Colonel Barney.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.520
Colonel Barney.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.520
Was admitted to that photograph, doesn't it?

27:04.520 --> 27:05.520
You know that?

27:05.520 --> 27:06.520
That's the fact.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.520
Yes, sir.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.520
Now we're trying to inquire about it.

27:09.520 --> 27:13.520
You went to the Colony Club and we should go tonight.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.520
Now, you know George and I just don't you.

27:16.520 --> 27:17.520
You know that?

27:17.520 --> 27:19.520
I do not know if you know him, Mr. Shine.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.520
I've known him for several months, sir.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.520
I do know him well.

27:22.520 --> 27:26.520
In fact, I think I've known him for longer than several months.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.520
Well, is he all the McCarthy Committee?

27:30.520 --> 27:32.520
Yes, sir. He's a member of the ZAC.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.520
Yes, sir.

27:33.520 --> 27:37.520
You worked with him day in and day out over the course of the last several months.

27:37.520 --> 27:43.520
Well, sir, he came with the committee lunch later than I did, sir.

27:43.520 --> 27:51.520
And if you were asked to bring a certain photograph to the Colony restaurant,

27:52.520 --> 28:00.520
if we could go tonight that this not include a photograph of the Secretary of the Army,

28:00.520 --> 28:01.520
which...

28:01.520 --> 28:02.520
Yes, sir.

28:02.520 --> 28:08.520
But only a photograph of Senator McCarthy and certain members of his staff, including yourself.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.520
And General Lawton, sir.

28:10.520 --> 28:13.520
Do you know I asked you again,

28:13.520 --> 28:20.520
why has any explanation given to you as to why they wanted you to bring that photograph?

28:20.520 --> 28:25.520
I think they thought possibly so that you might want to have it.

28:25.520 --> 28:33.520
Well, you know why such a photograph would shed any light on the issues of this conversation?

28:33.520 --> 28:36.520
I don't think you mean a controversy over the picture, sir.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.520
Oh, yes.

28:37.520 --> 28:42.520
And the controversy between the respecting parties to this...

28:42.520 --> 28:44.520
to this controversy.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.520
I have no idea that you pictured.

28:46.520 --> 28:51.520
Can you imagine why I would shed any light, whatever, on what we're investigating here?

28:51.520 --> 28:52.520
I don't know, sir.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.520
You don't know.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.520
I think if...

28:55.520 --> 29:01.520
Was it said or suggested to you, you say you thought maybe...

29:01.520 --> 29:07.520
Who ever asked you to bring it, conceived the idea that I might want it to?

29:07.520 --> 29:12.520
Was it suggested to you that I have borrowed for such a picture?

29:12.520 --> 29:13.520
No, sir.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.520
I think you know that it's...

29:15.520 --> 29:16.520
It was not, sir.

29:16.520 --> 29:20.520
Well, when you got there with me, was there any discussion about it?

29:20.520 --> 29:21.520
There was, sir.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.520
What was that discussion, may I answer?

29:23.520 --> 29:25.520
You tell what was there.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.520
Here's the picture.

29:27.520 --> 29:32.520
And there was discussion as to whether you might want to have it or not.

29:32.520 --> 29:40.520
Well, in what connection was it suggested that I would want such a picture to shed any light on what this committee is trying to decide?

29:40.520 --> 29:42.520
No particular connection, sir.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.520
You mean the same general?

29:44.520 --> 29:48.520
No, nothing in particular, but what generally was said about it?

29:48.520 --> 29:53.520
I believe so that the members of the staff are anxious to give you any and all information.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.520
So do you want me to finish?

29:55.520 --> 29:56.520
Okay.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.520
I have seen...

30:01.520 --> 30:04.520
How come an energetic lawyer has worked my time for my life?

30:04.520 --> 30:07.520
Most of them have the same reflection.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.520
So I'm just going to ask the next person.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.520
They don't wait for the answer.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.520
And almost the Welsh is not doing this purpose.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.520
Not Mr. Welsh, Mr. Jankus is not doing this purpose, mate.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.520
But sitting in the flat line with the Jankus,

30:19.520 --> 30:21.520
frankly, you were not giving the...

30:21.520 --> 30:22.520
No.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.520
...right of the chance to answer.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.520
Right.

30:24.520 --> 30:35.520
I agree, sir, that the members of the staff are anxious to give you any information documents or facts that will help to...

30:35.520 --> 30:45.520
present a full and fair picture of all activities relating to this current series of hearings.

30:45.520 --> 31:00.520
And I am not exactly sure what is in the minds of the individuals who have the photograph that I suggest there, respectfully, as that you ask for the photograph.

31:00.520 --> 31:05.520
And possibly you will find a relevant, and possibly you won't.

31:05.520 --> 31:09.520
Perhaps it's significant that they haven't given it to you.

31:09.520 --> 31:18.520
That's fine. Perhaps they don't think that you will find a relevant, and perhaps after you look at it, you will find that it's relevant.

31:18.520 --> 31:27.520
Mr. Shane, where do you get the picture that you took to the colony restroom?

31:27.520 --> 31:29.520
I had a witness, sir.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.520
Well, that you had it when you would not have been changed.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.520
I got it in the York City, sir.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.520
When?

31:36.520 --> 31:40.520
At the same time, you've left the other photograph.

31:40.520 --> 31:47.520
No, sir. I don't believe so, sir. I believe I got it last week, sir.

31:47.520 --> 31:52.520
Well, how far have you got it where you requested to get it by anyone?

31:52.520 --> 31:55.520
Or did you do it at your own voting in there? How about it?

31:55.520 --> 32:05.520
I'm not sure if you're aware of anyone specifically said, bring me a picture of you and set it in the McCarthy and General Lawton.

32:05.520 --> 32:15.520
But I know that in getting together certain documents and papers, which members of the staff have asked me to bring to the committee,

32:15.520 --> 32:22.520
that I included this particular document as I have excluded others.

32:22.520 --> 32:27.520
I have been asked for many things, and I haven't made any long lists.

32:27.520 --> 32:31.520
I've also been asked for categories of things, sir.
