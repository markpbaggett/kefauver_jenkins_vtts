00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
The category relative to the investigation by the committee of

00:04.960 --> 00:08.000
Communist infiltration into the signal for.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
My colleagues and my left are probably attention Mr.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Councilor.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Perhaps your question with Mr.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Anderson or the answer is misunderstood.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
There's something which is confusing because I think private

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
shines as a picture that he gave to the staff members at the

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
colony club a week ago tonight.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
You took sure you did your act last weekend so there's some

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
mix up there's a book and we fly.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
How far is Paul?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
How far is Paul?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Ah.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm not sure what I, what I gave it to these members of the staff but

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I think I gave it to them at the colony.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Mr. Shine, I ask you this one final question I'll be the

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
next.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
You say that George and Masters is the member of the

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
McCarthy's staff.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yes sir.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
You know him and you know him well and you worked with him for

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
months.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
That's correct didn't it?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Well I would say I worked with him for months sir but I have

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
worked with him sir.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yes sir.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Now why do you now tell this committee again?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
And we're even paying him to the office this is the

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
certainly photograph.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yes sir.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
You say he were with the gentleman we can go tonight with a

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
photograph of the colony rest and as I just do the

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
message that you did not remember whether George and Masters

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
was there or not.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
And you say that you had it comparatively easy for the

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
last week or 10 days.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
I don't say that so.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
All right I don't think that's right.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
Do you now tell this committee that you do not remember whether

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
or not on last Thursday night it's the colony

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
rest and George and Masters was present.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
You want me to give you the exact day sir and the exact

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
individual transfer.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
No.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
It was like very denied we understand the dreams.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Is it about that?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yes sir.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
The whole way around.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
When was it?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I have no pencil in my hand sir.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I have no notes here.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
What about the letters of blank fan?

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
I've been trying to answer your questions as quickly as you ask

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
them and if somebody will lend me a pencil.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Thank you.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I will try to figure out one of what.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Who's that please?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
That has number one.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
All right sir.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
And here's a calendar.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
If you need one, we'll you pay that calendar.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
I have the dates.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Today is 20 minutes or so.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Do you know the dates sir?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Mr. Jenkins do you know the dates?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Mr. Shine.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm not all the witness.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I am.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Well I'm just asking you if you know the dates.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm not in.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm trying to figure out the dates sir.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
29th I believe.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Right?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
29th.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
29th.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
29th.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes sir.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
That's what I thought was.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
You ready?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I'm ready.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
You ready?

03:48.000 --> 04:10.000
Five at G David Shine having been supplied with the fact that this is April 29th is now

04:10.000 --> 04:18.000
figuring back with the note pad and pencil as to whether he is meeting with members of the McCarthy Subcommittee staff

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
of the colony restaurant here in Washington was last Thursday night or last Friday night.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Chair would like to let the private scientist you may have what I must think of what he's now.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
Well, I'll find a sign of thinking what it would be proper to ask if the record you made clear of this time that

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
he's the chair and our council notified me that private time will be a witness.

04:45.000 --> 04:56.000
I think that's because the ordinary courtesy in the future knew the fact that members might staff and accused of misconduct.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
I believe that I should have at least five or ten minutes notice of who the makes witness will be.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
It's the courtesy which you extend and the court just one we always extend this committee.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
And we have a ruling from the chair and we have to be proceeding with the chair.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
The chair will end everything to be best.

05:15.000 --> 05:26.000
May I just make the record clear also that I was with the chair and I was with Mr. Jenkins up until sometime after two o'clock this afternoon.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
And I think it's very unfortunate that I not be notified.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I believe the proposal calls.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
I know there is no intention of doing anything wrong in the part of council.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
But if we could have an understanding of the contract appreciated very much.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
Chair is fairly certain that council did not know much more before ten or fifteen minutes before 50 standards called

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
because we discussed the matter after I arrived in the committee room when I came in to the committee room I was not sure then whether it's actually case.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
He was just going to continue whether we were going to have another witness.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
I did not know there was going to be Mr. Shine, a private shine until he was called.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I agree.

06:11.000 --> 06:11.000


06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I have a shine.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Sure.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
You see the questions have been coming on me very rapidly sir.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
And I don't know just one significant is to be placed on the days or the days.

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
So when it was suggested to me by Senator McClellan that I was with the colony on Thursday.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
I believe that he must have had reason to think I was there and I did not doubt that reason.

06:36.000 --> 06:50.000
But as I look at the calendar and try and ascertain the exact date and as I sit back and have had the opportunity to think about the individual's present.

06:50.000 --> 07:01.000
I believe I can tell you that the day was Monday that it was the 26th of April.

07:01.000 --> 07:13.000
And that Mr. Carr and Mr. Cone, Mr. Juliano, were the only members of the staff of the present that Mr. Hanna says was not present.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Then it was on Monday of this week.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yes sir.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Which was three days ago, yesterday, in the 29th.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yes sir.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
So, only three days of the last time.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
Right from the caucus room of the Senate office building in Washington.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
What is that with sir?

07:33.000 --> 07:41.000
Well, we're getting together, you know, I want to mean that as the colony residents on Thursday, Monday, 9th of this week.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I thought you meant the assembly of the material.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
And three days of the last now since the assembly of the new persons occurred. That's right, isn't it?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
That's the particular meeting.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yes sir.

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
And that is the meeting at which you have this picture of the Senator McCarthy, you know, the members of the staff.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
That's right.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I believe it was there.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
Now Mr. Shine, it was your answer was it not while ago.

08:11.000 --> 08:24.000
He was a little, a while ago, in response to a question by Senator McClelland, that you did not remember whether or not George and Masters was present as that meeting.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I'm a writer, I'm a role.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Frankly sir, I wasn't until just a few minutes ago focused upon a specific meeting.

08:31.000 --> 08:40.000
I thought that Senator McClelland was trying to ascertain when he asked his question as to whether the photograph I handed to the staff at the colony restaurant.

08:40.000 --> 08:49.000
It was the same photograph that I had been in, that was taken in McGuire Airport.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I didn't know that the date of the meeting was so significant.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Well, we think it is.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
It is.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
That's right.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
So I had not focused on any particular date.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And if you have one of the orders, just an account.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
I think the personnel's been supposed to be, you know, keep the record clear.

09:09.000 --> 09:19.000
Roughly how many nights this young man has had his dinner at the colony, so you realize the difficulty of focusing on anyone particular night,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
and telling you who is there and any particular night.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Senator of course has rights right now, that's all.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
That's all you might want to say.

09:27.000 --> 09:35.000
Mr. Shion, do I understand that since you have been back up here from Camp Barton, you have met at the Coliseum Restorant,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
with members to staff on other nights.

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
I have met them in a number of different places there, and several...

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
No colony clubs.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Yes sir, the colony restaurant.

09:49.000 --> 09:58.000
Well all right, a number of nights since you have been back from Camp Barton, I have come over there sir, to meet with them there sir.

09:58.000 --> 10:18.000
Have you met with the members of the staff whom you've named at the Coliseum Restorant, on any other occasions, since you have been in Washington or its environs, from Camp Barton in connection with this investigation,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
at which time you have any photographs with you?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
No sir, then.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm working point of order now.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
I will ask the chair, to do this my question.

10:32.000 --> 10:47.000
I will ask the chair to call upon Mr. Stevens, and those in the military who have the information to give the chair under hold.

10:47.000 --> 10:59.000
The information that the other in private shine and others connected to this investigation have been under CID surveillance.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
If so, who authorized how many individuals are involved in that surveillance?

11:05.000 --> 11:15.000
By CID you understand what I mean, I assume it's a term, and I think that's a very important point that should be covered now.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
I think we should order the secretary to produce the people who can give that information under hold.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Mr. Chairman, before I get to go.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Well, I may say this is not a very good question.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm not asking you to ask the question, I'm asking you to come to him, just to anyone.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
Well, Mr. Stevens, I am probably, does not know what the agenda should be, but to not.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Mr. Chairman, this is not a quick recrusting idly, ma'am.

11:41.000 --> 11:58.000
I think the chair would want to know whether the civilians in the front of gun are spending money and how many people think the CID have been employed in investigation surveillance, and anyone think of this investigation.

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
Mr. Chairman, that's no matter about which the secretary and other personnel may be examined later, of course, and send him.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
If he doesn't get fired, like he would do today.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
Mr. Chairman, I think the chair is a private child, he's not a composite witness on that point.

12:15.000 --> 12:23.000
Mr. Chairman, I didn't ask the chair to interrogate part of China, ma'am.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
I asked the chairman of this committee to order that information produced.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
If he does not have a plan to do it through cost examination of the civilians in the military, don't get fired before I can ask him a question.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
The perfectly proper thing may happen, but I think we should already have the time.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
There is the question, be we, then.

12:44.000 --> 12:57.000
I was, I was a president, at least, three meetings at the Comedy Restaurant during the past several days.

12:57.000 --> 13:08.000
I think that after the hearings, the staff have met with you, at other times, I believe, the executive sessions have been held.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
Sometimes they've asked me to meet them with the Senate office filling.

13:13.000 --> 13:23.000
Sometimes other places, on at least three occasions, they asked me to meet them eight, nine, ten o'clock at night while they were eating.

13:23.000 --> 13:35.000
All right, but you say you were present with members of the staff at the Comedy Restaurant, all only one occasion when you talk with your photograph is that right?

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
How did you say that? I'm over the goal.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Yes, sir. You're on the photograph.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
All right, stay well.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
And that person on Monday night of this week's 26th day of April is that correct?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I believe it was, sir.

13:51.000 --> 14:00.000
You are the scientist. You are the student of the Senate of the Southern Space, do you think you're not?

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I would not say that I did.

14:03.000 --> 14:15.000
Well, because he asked me about whether or not this picture was the famous, the one that hung on my wall, at least that's what I thought he asked me.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
And now it seems that the day that I gave it to the staff is the question.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
That is not whether they were the same.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
No, apparently I just understand the question.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Didn't understand.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It was an assembly of elements.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
The shadow did not understand the senator McClellan was asking you.

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
I thought I was meeting between you and those are members of the staff at the Comedy Restaurant, at which time there was a photograph.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Didn't you understand that?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I understand.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
And there was no limitation of that as Monday night of this week.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
That's correct.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
What you meant was that.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I don't know.

14:54.000 --> 15:05.000
And did you tell Senator McClellan in direct response to a direct question to the ask?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Do we?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, they're not.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
You've now delivered three days ago.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
You're one time a face of George and Max.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
This was person asking you, maybe you didn't remember.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Mr. Chairman, a point of order.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
He stated he did not remember whether George and Max was there last Friday night.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
The council has now asked me about Monday night.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Let's be fair with this young man.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
I'll start with no notice used to be called.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
May I ask if I could write a little bit of a point of order?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
No, I'm just a point of order.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Let's have it clear here.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
This young man was picked up.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
He's out on the business there and chair and structurally be on to be questioned about the authenticity of this photograph with him and Steven.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
Mr. McClellan was asking him about a meeting of dinner Friday night at the county.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Somebody else asked him about dinner Thursday night.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Now that he's still in I think it's completely unfair, right?

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
You say to him, you told Mr. McClellan you didn't know who was with you Monday night.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
He did not.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
He told Mr. McClellan he didn't know who was with him Friday night.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
He was asking me if he could sleep, said he was asked if he was with me.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm asking him now.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
You're still better than everyone else on the witness himself.

16:28.000 --> 16:37.000
Mr. McClellan was asking you about a meeting at the county restaurant where they pulled off the space.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
You've got what's on the microphone, and you're still alive.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
That's what I understood.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
And if you have now 10 points a day to spend tonight of this week.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I believe it, for sure.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Mr. Chairman.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Mr. Chairman.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
You have a point of order?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Yes.

16:56.000 --> 17:06.000
I, as your counsel's word for it, needs to be only discussed this photograph of Steven's and Cheyenne.

17:06.000 --> 17:14.000
For that reason I didn't do any other meetings at the county restaurant or elsewhere.

17:14.000 --> 17:22.000
I think we should make it clear now that we're going to interrogate Mr. Cheyenne about what color I stream.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I think that he was thinking on that occasion.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
He volunteered in the certain nights.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Who was with him very nice last week.

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
That we've opened the door far beyond the picture and it comes my turn to question him.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I will do exactly as counsel is doing.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
I did not ask him about the color of I stream.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
He was thinking on that occasion.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Yes, sir.

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
You have stated that Senator McLellan asked you about a meeting at the Colony of Restaurants.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
That's what jakeful the graph was present.

18:02.000 --> 18:10.000
Your reply was that you did not remember whether George and Masters was back.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
I now ask you this question.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
State whether or not on Monday evening.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
Out this week for the 26th day of April, there was a meeting between you and other members

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
who was there for the Colony of Restaurants here in the city of Washington.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
At which time you brought the fuller graphs with your packet now held before you.

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
And I ask you whether or not on that occasion George and Masters was present.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
Sir, I believe it was Monday night and I just want to leave the George and Masters was present.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.000
Why did you fail a minute or a minute a little while ago that he didn't recall when he was present or not?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
I didn't because I wasn't thought of all that it was also.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
And why did you fail me now that you believe he was present?

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
Because since I was first asked the question where I should give a few minutes to, I'll regret my memory.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Can you please get your nose?

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Well, the present is really much more present.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
And we can do it.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Mr. Chairman.

19:27.000 --> 19:36.000
Mr. Chairman is at front of a road in the respect you and I know you and the last things we're in time to announce you're now without any interruptions and acts as a ball.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Now tell me I sure will write it a little more.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
I have the question in the end now when you say yes George and Masters was present.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
How would you say no he was on present?

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
That three George and I have to go about with you six times this time.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
All I can say is that I do not believe he was present.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
You see I didn't have the picture of George and Masters and I do not believe he was there.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
But you won't believe that because we won't wear the other.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Is that it?

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
That's not possible to be down to the night.

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
And judge the way you hold your testimony in the life of your life.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Is that right?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Well, sir, I...

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
I wasn't paying particular attention to which members of the staff were present.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
I sat down at one end of the table and pulled out whatever they'd asked me to bring.

20:29.000 --> 20:39.000
It was at the close of the dinner and I would not say definitely whether George and Masters was there or not.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
But I would say that I'd be willing to confess you all the way back.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I don't think it wasn't there.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
But Mr. Jackson, this now final question.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
You are present and to believe it is it is.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
To leave your answer is it is.

20:58.000 --> 21:07.000
And for these seven men on this committee, the judge of the weight of the testimony

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
and the degree of weight they will attach to it.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Mr. Chairman.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
The life of the life that you've made your commitment.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Mr. Chairman.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
The life of the committee.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Mr. Chairman.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
The point of order is to consider one of orders.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
The point of order, Mr. Chairman.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I feel it's your seventh of order.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
So thank you.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The point of order, please.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Count, I know what's needed.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Yes, I did a very important point of order.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Mr. Chairman.

21:35.000 --> 21:42.000
I think in view of the fact that Mr. Chine was all here without warning.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
Notified that his testimony would only concern the photograph of Stevens.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
He's a private in the Army.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
He isn't flanked with counsel.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
When the Secretary of the Army was asked about charges that he delivered they made.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
And righting months ago, there was no criticism at all.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
When he said, I've got to go back to night and think it over.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Even those material subject to be charged.

22:10.000 --> 22:19.000
I think this abuse of the private who's just here alone with no warning is completely improper.

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
I think counsel is making a very improper spectacle.

22:25.000 --> 22:36.000
I'm not satisfied with the American people who are watching to judge the difference between the treatment of private chines without counsel, without warning.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
And the Secretary of the Army, Stevens, who has given him a chance to meet real.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Let me finish my point of order.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Give him overnight, one request.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
No criticism at all. No abuse.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
He's allowed to go home and figure out a statement by consulting with his counsel.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
I think it's a very unfair and proper thing to do.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
Maybe it will serve a purpose because the American people are watching this spectacle.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
Chair, Mr. Chine and the U. considers that I have abused you the same way.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
In any way or to any degree.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
I was saying so, but I am trying to cooperate with you.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Would you like me to finish this?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
I would like to have that answer my question first.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
I would say so, but I have decided to answer all of your questions.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
No, I didn't ask you that.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Sir, I'm in the process of answering your questions.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
It is the new consideration that I've abused you in any way or any degree.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
You say it in the most examining.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Sir, I have tried to answer all of your questions.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
The best of my ability.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
You've been firing at them very rapidly.

23:52.000 --> 24:03.000
And by the things I can try to answer them either rapidly or with time to consider more exactly.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
The specific that you're seeking.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
As to whether you've abused me or not.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
I can say to you that if you are abused me.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
Well, it doesn't bother me.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Well, well, you're there.

24:21.000 --> 24:30.000
I'll propose, Mr. Chine, that we take it slowly and easily.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
I will ask you the same question that I ask you again.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
You have been asked about the meeting at the Colony restaurant.

24:41.000 --> 24:49.000
Monday night of this week, which time you bought the photograph, which you now have before you.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
You were followed as further and often.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
George and I, this was present.

24:56.000 --> 25:05.000
Your answer was that, as I recall, you were not definitely sure one way.

25:05.000 --> 25:14.000
The other that you certainly would not give a positive, yes, I'm sure I have positive no answer.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
He is asking me.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Yes, sir.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
This was not a meeting as much.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
The members of the staff were there eating very late in the evening.

25:25.000 --> 25:33.000
And I came in and went to one end of the table and sat down to talk with Mr. Colony and Mr. Carr.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
And everybody left very shortly thereafter.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
I didn't say much, that's for sure.

25:40.000 --> 25:51.000
Now, Mr. Chine, are you consent to leave your answer as it is?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
And for this committee to appoint a vote, there's a way that it's requested.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask Mr. Colony in the lives of the lives that you've made.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Mr. Chairman, are you so content?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
One of our, Mr. Chairman.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
One of our, Mr. Chairman.

26:11.000 --> 26:20.000
I want to make a very strong point of order that this is the most improper exhibition I have ever seen.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
You have a lawyer here who brings about things one of the greatest criminal lawyers in the country,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
who has been badgering this private.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
He has told him ten times now, but he doesn't know whether or not George and Asus was there,

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
but to the best of his recollections, and Asus was not there.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
He can't get anything further by badgering this army pipe.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
I think it's in DC, and I think the chair should condemn it.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Mr. Chairman.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Council is proceeding with complete propriety during the same thing in a Turkey way.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Is this with us?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Our question of the Chairman is, Mr. Chairman.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Is this with us?

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
The question of the Chairman is, could you decide that he wants to have time to think it over with?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
And to see this is a big, should we rest time?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
The committee will give him the same consideration.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
The question of the Chairman that I've all heard, is the overalls of the point of order.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
I want to ask, was the question of Mr. American, wants me to make a rest time,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
and I'll wait a little bit.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I request them the form of point of order.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
May I ask now for my future information.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
How many times?

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
How long will this question re-ask?

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
How many times have I asked over before it gets to be badgering?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
These answers now about the...

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
The Council continues to ask questions that we have.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
Until we think the other thoughts that every possible idea of forgetting everything is information that they ask.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
I will discontinue the questioning of this witness when I get an answer.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
And allowing him to make this further statement.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
It was stated by Senator McCarthy just now, publicly, that Council for this committee,

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
bright about being a great, come-to-lawier, other greatest in the country, or in Tennessee.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
The senator was never more all in his life.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
I'm begging about one thing and one thing only.

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
And that is, to the best of my ability, I am pursuing this investigation

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
in order to develop the facts,

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
let the chips fall where they will, and regardless of personalities.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
That's all that I'm breaking about.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
And I break about it.

28:37.000 --> 28:43.000
Now, Mr. Shine, if you will give me an answer to this question,

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
yes or no, I shall have finished with you.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
And I can ask you.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
And I'll get just in the most gentle tones of which I am capable of.

29:01.000 --> 29:07.000
You were asked whether or not you attended the meeting at the Colony Restor.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
At which time you and other members of the committee were present.

29:13.000 --> 29:20.000
At which time you paired with you a photograph, which you have exhibited.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
And your answer was in the affirmative.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
You further answered that it occurred on Monday night the 26th day of this month.

29:29.000 --> 29:36.000
And you were further asked if George and I were the one who you say you were known for months.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
It was present on Monday, Jesus.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
And who is likewise the members of the committee?

29:44.000 --> 29:56.000
And your desire was that you refused to state definitely whether he was there or whether he wasn't a non-knowess.

29:56.000 --> 30:05.000
Are you contained to allow this investigating committee to evaluate your testimony?

30:06.000 --> 30:16.000
Given here to be in the light of your refusal to say whether a match just was present Monday night or not.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Are you or not?

30:18.000 --> 30:31.000
The committee sir, as far as I can say, will judge me not merely by the testimony of a few minutes by my entire testimony.

30:31.000 --> 30:39.000
They wish to judge my credibility by questions about dates.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
I have no way of stopping them sir and I'm certainly content that they do that.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
And you were given the opportunity to have counsel give the same.

30:52.000 --> 31:05.000
I was told when I was called to this room that I would be asked about the photograph that I was taken in the choir of Air Force Base.

31:05.000 --> 31:16.000
And I was given about five minutes notice to refresh my memory on the matter of the photograph taken in the choir of Air Force Base.

31:16.000 --> 31:23.000
I was not told that I would be asked about anything else sir. Do you now desire counsel?

31:23.000 --> 31:30.000
I think sir that at least I should talk to counsel about whether I should have counsel or not sir.

31:30.000 --> 31:42.000
Mr. Chairman, in view of that answer, I think it would be his to offer an unbearable to pursue this close examination of others.

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
And I shall not do so until private time has determined whether or not he desires counsel's presence.

31:50.000 --> 32:08.000
Chair has a question to ask and sure on which he will not require counsel has to do with the two photographs which the chair did not have an opportunity to examine except from the rear up until the very solidly has given him ample time to do so.

32:09.000 --> 32:16.000
We will hold those two photographs to try to sign and so that you can see them and so that Mr. Wolves can also see them.

32:16.000 --> 32:24.000
I want to be sure that what I ask is correct. Mr. Wolves will correct me if I am wrong.

32:24.000 --> 32:37.000
There has been some testimony up to now about there being two different tricks because of a difference of the left where a hand in an arm had been deleted from one picture

32:37.000 --> 32:47.000
and included in the other. And the difference in the insignia at the right I ask you to try the signs to look at the bottom of the big picture.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
And Mr. Wolves will look at the bottom of the big picture.

32:51.000 --> 33:06.000
Tell me whether I am right or wrong in the fact that in the big picture the bottom of the colonel Bradley's coat looks to be a couple of inches on the big picture.

33:06.000 --> 33:13.000
Tell me whether I am right or wrong in the big picture from the bottom of the ground from the top of the ground.
