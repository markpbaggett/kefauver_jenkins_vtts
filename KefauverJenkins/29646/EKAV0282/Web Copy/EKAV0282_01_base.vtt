WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Sean Rosskill Smith laughs challenges

00:23.340 --> 00:29.660
a

00:30.000 --> 00:35.080
and we propose to you and we propose to vary our programs with that type of

00:35.080 --> 00:40.440
broadcast but the usual purposes of this series is to report some of the views

00:40.440 --> 00:45.440
and activities. Now what did you wish to ask me about on this program challenge?

00:45.440 --> 00:51.040
The first item I have listed here is the cold strike which all of us are so happy with

00:51.040 --> 00:54.520
settled just a few hours following your discussion of the subject of the old

00:54.520 --> 00:59.880
band. Now we'll kind of move forward with the present request for authority to

00:59.880 --> 01:04.880
see the minds and the human future trouble. Well Charlie first on me said I was

01:04.880 --> 01:10.920
somewhat embarrassed about the broadcast last week because I was projecting what

01:10.920 --> 01:15.480
might happen in connection with the cold strike. We didn't know what was going to

01:15.480 --> 01:18.840
happen at the time we made the transcription but of course the time the

01:18.840 --> 01:23.720
broadcast was played by in Tennessee. It was released down there the cold strike

01:23.720 --> 01:28.040
had been settled but you asked whether the person is going to go at the

01:28.040 --> 01:32.360
old and ask for authority to seize the minds and the event of future trouble.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.040
No Charlie I was the person to start another message up to Congress in which

01:36.040 --> 01:41.000
he substitutes a request that a commission be set up to make a long-range study

01:41.000 --> 01:45.320
of labor managing of relations in the cold industry which he of course calls

01:45.320 --> 01:49.720
a sick industry. But it can be done calmly and not under the pressure of a

01:49.720 --> 01:54.840
threatened national disaster. I think that is a very wise and reasonable request

01:54.840 --> 01:59.160
and I'm all part. It's a bad thing when we reach the point of having to take

01:59.160 --> 02:03.480
over the minds to get cold. Well next senator I should like to get your

02:03.480 --> 02:08.280
comment on the charges by Senator Joseph McCarty that a communist fire

02:08.280 --> 02:11.640
reign exists in the State Department. Of course there are other

02:11.640 --> 02:16.120
comments in the State Department and I don't know if they if they're

02:16.120 --> 02:19.240
or they should be furied out immediately and suffered from their

02:19.240 --> 02:22.920
connections. I'm extremely doubtful that there is a

02:22.920 --> 02:27.320
as extensive a communist operation in the Department of State as Senator McCarty

02:27.320 --> 02:30.920
sensational of this flow is might lead us to think.

02:30.920 --> 02:34.680
And in a race, Senator McCarty is having the opportunity to present this

02:34.680 --> 02:39.160
phrase to a foreign relation subcommittee. And I believe the Senator

02:39.160 --> 02:43.400
Tadding who has been made chairman and the other members of this committee

02:43.400 --> 02:47.000
are sincere in their assertion that the hearings will be neither a white

02:47.000 --> 02:50.280
wash nor a witch hunt. Personally I'm glad to see the matter

02:50.280 --> 02:54.040
brought to a head and view of the wild charges in the past which could not be

02:54.040 --> 02:58.360
backed up when I showed our team. Before long Senator Tadding

02:58.360 --> 03:02.040
over, the Senate will act on measures passed by the Hosse

03:02.040 --> 03:05.800
representatives making Alaska and Hawaii states.

03:05.800 --> 03:09.640
Do you feel with this? Well I've been thinking about these territories

03:09.640 --> 03:12.600
a long time whether they should be states or not

03:12.680 --> 03:16.680
and I do approve of the action by the House of Representatives

03:16.680 --> 03:20.840
and I hope the Senate takes part to favor the same favorable action.

03:20.840 --> 03:24.680
I think the people above these territories are ready for statehood.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.040
A great deal of further alarm is a matter of fact that some of the western

03:28.040 --> 03:32.040
states were never brought into the unit. Senator it's going to make

03:32.040 --> 03:37.480
business for the flag manufacturers if we up the stars in the field of blue from

03:37.480 --> 03:41.960
40 to 50. These will be the first two states outside the continental

03:41.960 --> 03:45.160
United States. What will be taking on in unit

03:45.160 --> 03:49.240
bench responsibility if Alaska and Hawaii are granted statehood?

03:49.240 --> 03:52.280
Well I don't think so Charlie. They're an territorial

03:52.280 --> 03:56.280
possession and an attack on them as if there's an attack on us.

03:56.280 --> 03:59.240
Just as the attack on four of our rulers is strongly broke and

03:59.240 --> 04:03.960
comes back and close our immediate entry on the World War two.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.960
Would you say that the Senate will join the House in voting statehood?

04:07.960 --> 04:11.480
Very much I would prognostically predict things to come seem to be

04:11.480 --> 04:14.200
other Senate state-wide-of-the-peer persons.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.400
You are going today? I didn't know you were going to.

04:17.400 --> 04:21.560
Which is a great reason. I was worried that the bill was making it magic

04:21.560 --> 04:24.840
at least one militant mission. What are your views on this?

04:24.840 --> 04:30.200
Of course I stay at a mirror of academic question as presented by this bill.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.640
It's all a question of what kind of a man you are going to appoint.

04:33.720 --> 04:38.520
Not whether he has background as a soldier or scientist or an administrator of what

04:38.520 --> 04:41.320
have you. As a general proposition I think the

04:41.320 --> 04:45.320
military and civilian functions of government should be separated.

04:45.320 --> 04:49.480
The framers of the Constitution have this distinction in mind and making

04:49.480 --> 04:54.360
the persons of the United States a commander in chief of the armed forces.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.160
I've never been particularly strong on placing a man in

04:57.160 --> 05:02.280
house a civilian position really because of his good record military.

05:02.280 --> 05:06.760
If I may repeat myself I think the main thing to consider in all appointments

05:06.760 --> 05:10.520
is how well qualified is a man himself to do the job.

05:10.520 --> 05:15.720
I wouldn't turn him down just because he is in the past, made good in the armed

05:15.720 --> 05:21.880
services. I would appoint him solely on a loan on his outstanding record as a soldier.

05:21.880 --> 05:26.280
But in any event, when appointed I think he should be a civilian and not a

05:26.280 --> 05:29.400
military man. Well just as in the side Senator

05:29.400 --> 05:32.440
people were speaking of the Atomic Energy Commission.

05:32.440 --> 05:36.680
I saw where Mr. Lillin thought he recently resigned Chairman

05:36.680 --> 05:38.840
who had had some differences in the Playa's booths,

05:38.840 --> 05:41.000
Senator Schumer, Keller and Hickenlooper.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.960
One delivery here in Washington borrowed book and he was asked for references and gave

05:45.960 --> 05:49.720
these two gentlemen I had mentioned his references and he would bring the

05:49.720 --> 05:52.280
book back and was a good risk for the library.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.520
Yeah I imagine that the people in Washington and Congress have got

05:56.520 --> 06:00.520
in a larger lot better that than most of anything that's happened in a good

06:00.520 --> 06:03.160
while. But I want to say it's good to see that Mr. Lillin

06:03.160 --> 06:06.520
throws trials and tribulations with Congress having closed and

06:06.520 --> 06:10.200
delus is a sense of view. Senator there's a great deal of interest in

06:10.200 --> 06:14.520
HR 6000 which would extend the coverage under the social

06:14.520 --> 06:18.360
security program and you consider how this might affect tennis

06:18.360 --> 06:21.960
teams and grow benefits into the program? Yes I have Charlie.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.560
At the present time the Tennessee average monthly claimants far

06:25.560 --> 06:30.120
old age of survivors insurance which is commonly called social security by

06:30.120 --> 06:35.960
most dollars is $21.99. Under the proposed plan it would be

06:35.960 --> 06:41.560
increased $37.48 a month and Tennessee would still be below the

06:41.560 --> 06:47.960
national average of $44.20. Those receiving old age assistance would be

06:47.960 --> 06:54.040
increased from $27.41 to $71.71 which would still be

06:54.040 --> 06:58.600
under the present national average of $43.66.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.360
Families were dependent children now grow on average of $48

07:02.360 --> 07:06.600
in Tennessee and a new bill would raise their payment for families

07:06.600 --> 07:10.600
with an average of $65. The national average is now some

07:10.600 --> 07:23.160
cheap national average is now some cheap national average is now some cheap

07:23.160 --> 07:28.920
average of $65. The national average is now some cheap national average is now

07:28.920 --> 07:32.680
flying persons under the program in Tennessee would be increased

07:32.680 --> 07:38.760
from an average of $36 to $39. The national average in this classification is now

07:38.760 --> 07:40.680
$45. The national average is now $45. The national average is now $45.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.400
Senator, what is the present situation ladies, ladies,

07:43.400 --> 07:47.240
leave with regard to that bill? The Senate Finance Committee is

07:47.240 --> 07:51.320
here at this considering it. This is a committee of which Senator George of

07:51.320 --> 07:55.160
Georgia is chairman and I think for the past two months they have been

07:55.160 --> 07:58.920
taking testimony and hearing evidence about this bill.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.600
The bill they are working on increases social security payments to retired

08:02.600 --> 08:06.280
workers by about 70%. It would bring more persons

08:06.280 --> 08:11.560
under the program including about 11 million additional self-employed persons.

08:11.560 --> 08:15.560
The domestic worker workers, federal employees and so forth.

08:15.560 --> 08:20.200
Also veterans would be credited for the time spent in the service of the country.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.520
What are some of the arguments advanced for and against this bill?

08:24.520 --> 08:28.040
Well after the present time there was some 60 million persons

08:28.040 --> 08:32.280
games they employed in the United States. Only $35 million are covered

08:32.280 --> 08:36.280
under this social security program. There are some other arguments that they

08:36.280 --> 08:41.480
retirement benefits are still too small to keep the beneficiaries or some of them

08:41.480 --> 08:45.560
off of state relief. Then to retirement programs put into effect

08:45.560 --> 08:49.160
our private industry are far ahead of the government growth.

08:49.160 --> 08:53.400
So there is a tendency for business not to hire older workers

08:53.400 --> 08:57.160
and for workers to stay where they are and not seek better jobs.

08:57.160 --> 09:01.160
The argument is advanced also that the present benefits under the plan are not

09:01.160 --> 09:06.680
great enough to encourage workers to work constantly during their best years to build

09:06.680 --> 09:11.480
our benefits. I know it's the biggest argument against it is that it would add a cost

09:11.480 --> 09:17.960
to about 250 million a year. And then it's argued that some of the provisions

09:17.960 --> 09:23.400
of the bill were unjustly sure and some kind of crimes to imagine that the bill

09:23.400 --> 09:27.560
would be pretty well worked over between masturbating parts of the speed

09:27.560 --> 09:30.360
of the amendment. We expect to take it out.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.920
Would you tell our listeners a little something about the crime investigation

09:34.920 --> 09:39.400
used to pose and which is free? That's just stir all over the country.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.600
Well I didn't know it was a creative, a particular stir. There had been a

09:42.600 --> 09:47.080
something set about it but I think people who were looking for

09:47.080 --> 09:53.160
sensational news about it might be disappointed. I introduced a resolution asking for

09:53.160 --> 09:59.400
$50,000 to allow the judiciary committee of the Senate to investigate

09:59.400 --> 10:03.720
principally interstate gambling and related criminal activities.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.480
There has been so much smoke about the possibility that an organized criminal

10:07.480 --> 10:11.880
reign is facing the public and is attempting to correct some of our local

10:11.880 --> 10:15.880
governments that I decided the matter should be gone into.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.840
And many many states attorney generals and mayors and local officials

10:20.840 --> 10:25.320
requested such an investigation. I know many of our people must have read

10:25.320 --> 10:30.280
of the great power of tribute to some of the alleged big shot gamblers.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.960
Well when my resolution was referred to the judiciary committee

10:33.960 --> 10:38.520
it was assigned that $100 should be required to do the job assigned.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.680
After the committee concluded that we did not go into interstate gambling

10:42.680 --> 10:48.040
and investigation without having to look into other elements of interstate crime also.

10:48.040 --> 10:52.280
Is it your purpose to keep poverty to clean up crime conditions in the

10:52.280 --> 10:57.400
nearest American states? No, not at all. We never would be able to do that

10:57.400 --> 11:01.640
for this far time to do. That's the counter-abessions of the state

11:01.640 --> 11:06.440
county and municipal governments. Our purpose will be to find out what the

11:06.440 --> 11:11.880
situation is to uncover if they exist, organize crime rings which operate across

11:11.880 --> 11:15.240
state lines and with you that they interstate the

11:15.240 --> 11:21.240
commerce media to violate state and local laws as well as laws of the United States.

11:21.240 --> 11:26.040
This will include an investigation of the adequacy of existing federal

11:26.040 --> 11:29.880
stuff and a determination of whether additional or different

11:29.880 --> 11:34.760
federal laws are needed to reduce crime on a nationwide basis.

11:34.760 --> 11:39.720
As I get it, Dan, you prefer a purely legalistic inquiry

11:39.720 --> 11:43.880
rather than a headline seeking disclosure of a fund-to-furned group.

11:43.880 --> 11:48.120
Exactly, Charlotte. If I have anything to do with it,

11:48.120 --> 11:52.520
I want to hold many executive hearings before public hearings are held

11:52.520 --> 11:57.480
at which people's names might not be kicked around and maliciously and without any

11:57.480 --> 12:02.120
foundation in fact. We want to protect individual liberties in every way

12:02.120 --> 12:07.080
possible in this investigation. We want to get the full facts before any

12:07.080 --> 12:12.200
sensational charges are made. The purpose is remedial legislation and not

12:12.200 --> 12:16.840
sensational motorized. The Judiciary Committee is of course very

12:16.840 --> 12:21.080
serious about this matter. It will be a difficult test,

12:21.080 --> 12:24.920
it will require much time and hard work on the part of the committee

12:24.920 --> 12:29.560
and of the staff that might be too lengthy. But I think it's a job that must be

12:29.560 --> 12:34.120
undertaken and there's a great demand that from all over the

12:34.120 --> 12:38.840
United States that Congress go into the public. Senator Hattie, that old

12:38.840 --> 12:42.840
demon clock is getting around to leave 13 in the head.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.440
So until next week at this same period on this station,

12:46.440 --> 12:49.560
the Center for Justice Keith Barber will continue this series of weekly

12:49.560 --> 12:53.400
regular reports. This is Charlotte and he's saying good-bye for now from

12:53.400 --> 12:57.080
your Center for Justice in Washington and returning you to your local
