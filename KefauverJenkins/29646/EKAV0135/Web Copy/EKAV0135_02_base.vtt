WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
You're right and don't think too often that

00:04.520 --> 00:07.440
and in eight, so now, as I was going to be

00:07.440 --> 00:10.580
to be the very short time and the people in my party,

00:10.580 --> 00:13.280
or you yourself, or both of those who are in secret condition.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.880
That's right.

00:14.880 --> 00:18.480
My eighth contestable, the undoubtedly alerted

00:18.480 --> 00:21.080
the member of the staff to both him turn

00:21.080 --> 00:21.980
over to Sean.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.800
That's not particularly important, but I'm trying

00:24.800 --> 00:27.380
to find out because I think he testified.

00:27.380 --> 00:29.320
The best of your recollection,

00:29.320 --> 00:32.000
you had never been threatened that you'd be taken

00:32.000 --> 00:35.880
with trial to shine either alone or in the company

00:35.880 --> 00:37.480
with Colonel Brandenleeve.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.080
Mr. Adams, you're anybody else.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.000
The best of all, they're going to talk about tomorrow

00:41.000 --> 00:42.200
that collection, that's true.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.680
As I said, when Mr. Jenkins first faced me

00:46.680 --> 00:50.000
with the picture, it was possible that on occasion,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.480
that the picture was going to be taken,

00:51.480 --> 00:53.040
I would say, to people around thought

00:53.040 --> 00:56.080
why, among us, can more get in the picture.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.560
I've done that on the money, I think.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.600
So you do it all out?

00:58.600 --> 00:59.960
Yes, I'm sure that's right.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.480
And I see nothing improper about it.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.680
I'm simply trying to get the facts to be important.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.640
Because it's the best of your recollection

01:05.640 --> 01:07.800
then that on this occasion, that that probably

01:07.800 --> 01:08.680
is what happens.

01:08.680 --> 01:13.840
You arrive here, disembark from the plane,

01:13.840 --> 01:16.280
saw Mr. Shine, Colonel Brandenlee,

01:16.280 --> 01:17.920
saw that the target reason said it comes

01:17.920 --> 01:20.400
under together now and it never finished.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.280
I don't know if I said anything,

01:22.280 --> 01:23.960
I know I've been the picture.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.280
But whether I said anything or not, I can't be called.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.120
In other words, it seems to the chairman,

01:28.120 --> 01:29.760
one of two things must have happened.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.440
Easy you might, well, they've done that.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.800
It's not for the tribunal.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.760
Or else, try to the shine, must have muscled his way in,

01:36.760 --> 01:39.520
somehow to squeeze himself in between the secretary

01:39.520 --> 01:42.680
of the army and the commanding officer, Colonel Branden,

01:42.680 --> 01:44.360
which could seem less reasonable.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.720
One of those two things it seems to me must have happened.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.480
I'm trying to find out.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.800
And the best of your recollection,

01:49.800 --> 01:52.000
whether you think, try to the shine,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.400
wait for himself in there, if he's on an issue,

01:54.400 --> 01:57.640
whether he was invited by you, Jan and the one.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.480
I don't know.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.200
I don't have any recollection on that.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.320
I know there was a flash of a few foes.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.920
I think probably some of them are part of the,

02:03.920 --> 02:05.920
within one of the pictures.

02:05.920 --> 02:06.760
I don't know.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.840
If he was with my colleague who was there,

02:10.840 --> 02:13.480
I don't know whether she was in any or not.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.640
There were several flashers.

02:14.640 --> 02:15.640
I don't know how my picture is.

02:15.640 --> 02:16.880
Of course, all that's going to be,

02:16.880 --> 02:19.960
if it hasn't already been developed for you

02:19.960 --> 02:21.040
and for the committee.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.880
That's great.

02:21.880 --> 02:22.720
I'm not going in now,

02:22.720 --> 02:24.320
but I'm going to see some of the pictures.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.400
I'm simply trying to determine for the record,

02:27.400 --> 02:29.920
how the lineup was derived.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.480
I just don't recall.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.040
How many times did you have to do something to claim?

02:34.040 --> 02:35.800
Where Mr. Shine was at the time,

02:35.800 --> 02:38.240
I recall the sending from the plane.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.000
And one of the first things that I recall

02:41.000 --> 02:44.320
after getting off the plane was not

02:44.320 --> 02:47.760
to either the photographers or Shine or anybody else.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.440
That was that,

02:49.440 --> 02:52.560
I recognize that it's C-45,

02:52.560 --> 02:54.840
which is a small plane,

02:54.840 --> 02:57.440
that there would not be room for

02:57.440 --> 03:00.920
Santa McCarty's party and the baggage

03:00.920 --> 03:03.080
or the baggage that they had with him

03:03.080 --> 03:06.560
in order to go to Boston from Fort Dix.

03:06.560 --> 03:10.280
So my fine was working more than some business of the UK.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.200
And that was a good one to give the instruction

03:14.200 --> 03:15.480
of the baggage.

03:15.480 --> 03:19.840
They not removed from the C-47 by opposite from the Dix.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.960
If we kept the boy that had turned the party

03:21.960 --> 03:23.480
with Tate McFine,

03:23.480 --> 03:27.040
I took the C-45 and the fourth wave almost

03:27.040 --> 03:30.040
because I think if there is a record,

03:30.040 --> 03:32.600
it will show that I wasn't on that map

03:32.600 --> 03:34.320
or the more than,

03:34.320 --> 03:37.720
well, I'll say it was out of one plane.

03:37.720 --> 03:38.720
And then the other one,

03:38.720 --> 03:40.840
I might have practically on the ground a little more.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.160
I'd be very good at 10 minutes,

03:43.160 --> 03:45.320
I think very well thought.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.600
My time had expired, so I sent him a couple.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.240
That's the chairman and the ambassador

03:51.240 --> 03:53.960
to the tributeing to the expedition

03:53.960 --> 03:58.200
of this hearing and concluding with this,

03:58.200 --> 04:00.600
with this eye patch.

04:02.920 --> 04:06.440
As I say, there is a return I can't see you get to light.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.600
Oh, down here.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.200
Turn the jacket and take over.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.080
Turn the jacket and the other questions.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.600
Just two questions.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.840
On page 647 of the hearings to be

04:29.840 --> 04:40.160
yesterday, Senator DuVorjac asked Mr. Call,

04:40.160 --> 04:45.840
on a question, I quote, Senator DuVorjac,

04:45.840 --> 04:49.480
Mr. Call, who arranged the plane trip,

04:49.480 --> 04:51.440
Mr. Call, who arranged the plane trip

04:51.440 --> 04:56.000
on November 7 to 4th, Mr. Call.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.080
It was arranged on the assistance of the Secretary Stephen.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.160
He wanted to go down to 4th,

05:04.160 --> 05:08.760
Dick's and sail over to Dave Shine with us.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.680
Is that statement true or false?

05:12.680 --> 05:16.960
That statement certainly conveys a very, very

05:16.960 --> 05:18.320
false question.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.480
I was true, but when I got there,

05:20.480 --> 05:23.560
I spoke to Dave Shine, but I had no more idea

05:23.560 --> 05:26.240
of going to 4th, Dick's this morning

05:26.240 --> 05:28.840
and seeing Dave Shine or anybody else

05:28.840 --> 05:31.640
than the man in the moon.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.920
The trip was arranged because Mr. Call

05:33.920 --> 05:36.080
was going to go there anyhow and send him a car.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.480
He wanted to go, and I tried to.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.240
After their convenience in getting there.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.440
But would you stop that 4th, Dick, if Mr. Call

05:44.440 --> 05:47.800
had not wanted to stop there, or would you have gone straight

05:47.800 --> 05:51.120
to Washington DC straight to Washington DC?

05:51.120 --> 05:54.520
There.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.520
The chairman of the thought of questions

05:57.520 --> 06:02.040
except this, that I do reserve the right to cross

06:02.040 --> 06:09.040
examine Secretary Stephen after the testimony is in

06:09.040 --> 06:12.040
and connection with the pictures

06:12.040 --> 06:17.040
and if the transcripts are committed for the record.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.040
Anything that is offered?

06:20.040 --> 06:22.040
Anything that is offered or everything.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.440
Any member of the committee desires to have me call

06:24.440 --> 06:27.040
that any time Mr. Counsel, you can call.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.040
I have no further doubt.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.040
I'm going to turn the party.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.040
I'm going to turn the party to the next one.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.040
This morning, I had a chair.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.040
I think he got the two gentlemen following that.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.040
So, let me go.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.040
Just curious about the daily hearing for a start.

06:45.040 --> 06:51.040
That we submit to the chair the first hearing.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.040
It's not an executive session.

06:53.040 --> 06:56.040
I don't think the chair will want to make the hearing

06:56.040 --> 06:57.040
part of the record.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.040
But the chair, Counsel, may want to go

06:59.040 --> 07:02.040
and through these hearings and determine the date

07:02.040 --> 07:05.040
that the hearing is on the infiltration of communism

07:05.040 --> 07:07.040
and the military from the Army.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.040
Senator McPullin, the Vice Chair is

07:09.040 --> 07:12.040
morning to heat up the initiation of the date.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.040
We partner that, correct?

07:14.040 --> 07:19.040
Let's jam on the date that can be substantiated

07:19.040 --> 07:24.040
by any record in a date that's involved in this controversy.

07:24.040 --> 07:27.040
I think reference to the document if it's official

07:27.040 --> 07:30.040
that establishes a date as a proper.

07:30.040 --> 07:34.040
And if this is official transcript of the meeting,

07:34.040 --> 07:37.040
by reference to that date, it can be stipulated

07:37.040 --> 07:40.040
in the record that the date the hearings forget.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.040
Well, the senator, the gentleman that comes on me

07:43.040 --> 07:46.040
wasn't in the event that he can't get to the hearing.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.040
I'll make you take the question.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
That may have felt comfortable pointing them,

07:51.040 --> 07:54.040
externally, and the gnomists understanding point out

07:54.040 --> 07:59.040
that the first witness was a witness from the signal corps

07:59.040 --> 08:04.040
and he read our information on our part of the signal corps.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.040
I'm at the chair, but who we introduce this record

08:07.040 --> 08:09.040
or any part of it, I should like to have an offer

08:09.040 --> 08:12.040
given to examine it.

08:12.040 --> 08:16.040
I'm not prepared to class in a record and say I'm ready to admit it.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.040
I'm at the meeting, so they clearly,

08:19.040 --> 08:22.040
and the ranking Democrat member,

08:22.040 --> 08:25.040
the record of August 31st, number one,

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
number two, the record of September 1st,

08:27.040 --> 08:30.040
number three, the record of September,

08:30.040 --> 08:34.040
or, I think, a number four, the record of September 3rd.

08:34.040 --> 08:37.040
And I hope this material will not be made publicly

08:37.040 --> 08:39.040
because it's exactly the best one.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.040
Mr. Chairman.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.040
Chair and the chairman, if they're materially not to be introduced

08:42.040 --> 08:45.040
into the record, is the ranking Democrat member?

08:45.040 --> 08:48.040
Well, they found this to be in the course of the evening

08:48.040 --> 08:50.040
and advised this tomorrow whether they are.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.040
In fact, the transcript of the hearing is in the case of the dates

08:53.040 --> 08:54.040
of the insurance.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.040
Right?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
Very good.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.040
I think of my only company, Mr. Chairman.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.040
I like to mention Mr. Chair, but may I make an inquiry, sir?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
You may.

09:01.040 --> 09:06.040
I'm a little impressed always with records of executive sessions.

09:06.040 --> 09:09.040
I look on them as pretty important.

09:09.040 --> 09:14.040
Secret documents will as follows from what the senator has just done,

09:14.040 --> 09:18.040
the council sitting at this table may examine this record.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.040
Perfect.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
Sir, the other part of the date is your contract.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.040
I am informed that it is not a record of the fort mom material.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
I don't understand its percentage.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.040
It doesn't correct.

09:28.040 --> 09:33.040
It is a record of the investigation of coming to student filtration

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
of the signal core.

09:35.040 --> 09:41.040
And that all has to do with fort mom, that's the seat of the signal core operations

09:41.040 --> 09:42.040
as far as I know it.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.040
What a board of you may.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.040
You may examine the hearing of Mr. Wells

09:46.040 --> 09:49.040
to the extent of the champion to date in their authenticity.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.040
Only that, they are expected in hearings.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.040
And I don't know who you may call the contents available.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.040
These are not going to be any part of the discussion.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.040
Well, let's examine them.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
Next, right there.

09:58.040 --> 10:02.040
There's any one object that's proceeding to any part of this record,

10:02.040 --> 10:10.040
either by reference the date or otherwise be stipulated as a part of the testimony.

10:10.040 --> 10:14.040
Then it is proper and right in the only way they can be presented

10:15.040 --> 10:18.040
by someone that they can open and testify to the record.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.040
Then it does show that they can only be found.

10:21.040 --> 10:29.040
And Mr. Chairman, all right are these sentences and in mid three or four volumes of testimony

10:29.040 --> 10:32.040
without the slightest chance to examine it or know what's in it.

10:32.040 --> 10:36.040
I'm therefore forced at this point to object to Mr. Chairman.

10:36.040 --> 10:41.040
I do not believe the confessionalist introduced the volumes of testimony.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.040
Mr. Chairman, the sentence is simply a question of making, introducing the date

10:46.040 --> 10:50.040
at which the hearings of the investigation is put not together.

10:50.040 --> 10:56.040
No, I can not understand that the hearings of the fourth moment began prior to on top of age.

10:56.040 --> 11:00.040
That is why I remain so puzzled that what is not the offer.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.040
Mr. Chairman.

11:01.040 --> 11:06.040
And in the question of Mr. Chairman, I suggest that you, the fact that we have made available

11:06.040 --> 11:13.040
to the Army all executive sessions, I would suggest that Mr. Wells has been selected

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
as the attorney for Mr. Steven.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.040
Meanwhile, as an example of the records, I'm sure they will already be in them.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.040
I think he should be able to look up.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
Very well.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.040
The defendant, Mr. Wells, he may have a full of evidence to examine it here.

11:25.040 --> 11:30.040
But may I suggest if you please, sir, that they need not receive the evidence

11:30.040 --> 11:32.040
until someone on my spasms.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.040
And as I've seen this time, there being received down the ice.

11:35.040 --> 11:39.040
To the extent that I'm born of order, Mr. Chairman.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
And in the bottom.

11:40.040 --> 11:47.040
It is quite proper that after Mr. Wells examined them, if he desires to do so, he may object

11:47.040 --> 11:50.040
to their introduction upon any valid ground.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.040
Thank you, Senator.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
Now, let me see.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.040
Who is the...

11:57.040 --> 12:03.040
Is it available with the members of the Subcommittee of the Chair and Outlaws on Senator

12:03.040 --> 12:04.040
Adderston out of order?

12:04.040 --> 12:06.040
Excuse me, would you please, say not to me.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.040
The number of jurisdictions and address in the next.

12:09.040 --> 12:13.040
Mr. Chairman, the arsenae for the benefit of the committee that there's likely to be a record

12:13.040 --> 12:19.040
of on the international sugar 3.8 AM on a reservation that I offer.

12:19.040 --> 12:24.040
And that is suggested only for the attention the committee should come along about 4.30.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.040
Now, as we have in the...

12:29.040 --> 12:36.040
I think from time to time, members have to reexamine their own concept of black function here.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.040
Here's a controversy.

12:38.040 --> 12:44.040
And I shall not trouble about terminology here as to who's involved.

12:44.040 --> 12:53.040
But I do esteem my own responsibility to be that of one on a kind of board or committee of inquiry.

12:54.040 --> 13:05.040
He listens and evaluates all of the facts that are involved so that ultimately the questions that are before the committee can be resolved.

13:05.040 --> 13:14.040
I have observed both in the mail and in the prayers that there is a tenancy to believe that perhaps one ought to adopt,

13:14.040 --> 13:24.040
but I have been literature that too, and I thought I was cloned here with some quasi-judicial responsibility.

13:24.040 --> 13:32.040
And I intend to pursue it just as impartially, just as fair as I know how.

13:32.040 --> 13:40.040
And with that in mind, Mr. Secretary, I want to recur to one basic question.

13:40.040 --> 13:45.040
And in fortification, that last four or five other questions.

13:45.040 --> 13:59.040
The first date in your specification with respect to the allegation as to whether or not an improper influence was exerted in the half of private show.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.040
Or goes back to the eight day in July.

14:03.040 --> 14:07.040
And I think concerns itself with general revert is that correct?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
Yes sir.

14:08.040 --> 14:19.040
Has been the last specification or the last date of any specification that runs down to February 16th.

14:20.040 --> 14:33.040
That for magical purposes there is a period of about seven months from the time it was first alleged that improper influence was being exercised

14:33.040 --> 14:36.040
a down to February 16th.

14:36.040 --> 14:41.040
Now seven months it seems to me it's a rather long period.

14:41.040 --> 14:52.040
However, it didn't come into this picture until the second of October, because I think you're first beside it in the specification number four.

14:52.040 --> 14:58.040
That would be a period of about five months from October to February 16th.

14:58.040 --> 15:10.040
Now, the question that refers to me is this. Why did this run so long before some protest was made that undue influence was being exercised?

15:10.040 --> 15:14.040
And if so, to whom was the protest being made?

15:14.040 --> 15:34.040
Now it would have occurred to me that if I were in a creepy car hey, in a controversy, I say it in no sphere to reflection at all, but it seems to me it wouldn't require me to take seven months or five months to determine my course of action and to protest.

15:34.040 --> 15:48.040
If I felt that undue influence was exercised, here's all every in a calculation that starts on the 8th of July 1953 and goes down to the 16th of February 1954.

15:48.040 --> 16:00.040
Was there some reason for it that no protest was made into some sort of lead, either to use the barriers or to other members of the committee or to somebody else in authority?

16:00.040 --> 16:25.040
Well, I would say, and it is that there was almost daily contact on the part of my office with many after John Adams had to go to the Aeson of the thing and that there were things occurring which have been outlined in the ceremony starting back about the time you indicate one thing would happen and then another thing would happen.

16:25.040 --> 16:35.040
And now, when one looks back on it, the pattern in the life of time size is a great deal of more clear than it was at the time we were going through it.

16:35.040 --> 16:52.040
Because one of the basic things involved here is of course is theodore did not drive a child, receive special or preferential treatment while he was at Fort Dix.

16:52.040 --> 17:09.040
He didn't get to Fort Dix until his 10th day of November and the information was respected what transpired there during his stay at Fort Dix of course didn't become available until it's the later day.

17:09.040 --> 17:21.040
I think your question is in Excellent One, I personally have always operated in business and in this job on the basis of trying to cooperate and work things out.

17:21.040 --> 17:32.040
This happened to be one of those things but in the life of time size might have been handled some other way but the way of development is headed up at the time of Senator Potter's letter.

17:32.040 --> 17:43.040
This is actually starting with a very first allegation or first specification of the allegation that are before us, so that we're filed with the committee on the 13th of April.

17:43.040 --> 18:01.040
It says honor about July 8th or certain action was taken. Then when you get to number 2 it says throughout the period to live 15 to slide 30 various members of the staff of the subcommittee are dealt with this question of its recognition.

18:01.040 --> 18:20.040
And then number three honor about August 1 1953 in specification for honor about October 2 and so we go on down now as a reasonable and improved person and I hope that I may qualify under that operation.

18:20.040 --> 18:26.040
It would occur to me that if this had happened to me for a period of 60 days.

18:26.040 --> 18:41.040
I think I would register to protest somewhere either formally or even formally to other members of the committee to the folk committee to your chief who would have been the chief of the defense establishment.

18:41.040 --> 18:56.040
But this accumulation goes on for seven months from the time General Reed was named as first mentioned and it runs on for nearly five months from the time you were first mentioned in specification number 4.

18:56.040 --> 19:11.040
That seems like an undo time like if undoing force was really exercised and certainly there should have been a remonstration long before the 16th of February or their last.

19:11.040 --> 19:22.040
Now the other question is this before my time. You see the last date the date of the last allegation here is February 16th.

19:22.040 --> 19:30.040
On the 18th of February I recall of course I have to replace myself by whatever date I have here.

19:30.040 --> 19:35.040
It had the hearing in the argument I recall on the first occasion.

19:35.040 --> 19:42.040
I applied on a second date on this week's case that's correct and I was not present to a second occasion.

19:42.040 --> 19:53.040
But you see your last allegation is dated here February 16th. This week's case was heard on February 18th.

19:53.040 --> 20:07.040
So we went in until there was some kind of a spark before finally a protest was made in the form of the allegations that were sent to response to the letter from Senator Carter.

20:07.040 --> 20:20.040
It does seem to me not undo long time to let a condition like that run without at least making your feelings manifest to some source of authority at least.

20:20.040 --> 20:30.040
I don't argue for a moment who would should be. But I speaking only for myself and committing no matter what I think of it would happen to me.

20:30.040 --> 20:40.040
Under similar circumstances I would have registered some kind of a remunsched for somewhere long before the events of their weather link.

20:40.040 --> 20:50.040
Well Senator Dixon I was trying to work this thing out as we went along with Senator McCarthy and the staff.

20:50.040 --> 20:58.040
That was my desire. I didn't want to have a prayer for anything else. I believe that I know how to get along with people.

20:58.040 --> 21:10.040
I like people. I wanted to do this job. I wasn't carrying around on my shoulder. Let's say in December something that might have happened in October.

21:10.040 --> 21:27.040
This thing became accumulating and it finally became a pattern. And the reason now that we consider and look back over a period of five, seven months whatever it is is because we had to get together.

21:27.040 --> 21:43.040
All of the information and facts going on this case in order to submit it to you gentlemen. And that in a lot of hindsight makes it a very different looking thing than what it was when you were going to show it on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis.

21:43.040 --> 21:55.040
I have far been for me to suggest that as somebody else couldn't have handed handle it by her. I have no illusions about my ability to do something better than the next one.

21:55.040 --> 22:09.040
I think some of the probably could have. This happened to be the way I happened to be the way I handled it. I assure you that what I have done all the way along has been what I believe to be right and in the interest of the American people.

22:09.040 --> 22:25.040
All Mr. Secretary, I don't think there's this lightest doubt about the honorable attributes of your actions. But when you speak for instance about humbillion trillions in the law is within regard as I suppose as a species of duress.

22:25.040 --> 22:37.040
Now, I can imagine Jesus where duress continues for a long period of time or a short period but actually all of a period gives her a period of several months.

22:37.040 --> 22:43.040
Why would this man continue first from one side and then another?

22:43.040 --> 22:55.040
And here are the good things to me that give the developers a real wing this year. That's the number of months worse than me before the end of that last period.

22:55.040 --> 23:05.040
At this time I have expired my empire of time in signing in whether he would object if the chair would let's call on Senator Potter so we get back in the regular swing of things.

23:05.040 --> 23:21.040
Thank you. Mr. Trevon, Mr. Secretary, I think well at this time we get the so-called now famous letter.

23:21.040 --> 23:35.040
Yes, back in perfection. The city is the other day. There were many requests made for me and Potter the other members just to admit.

23:35.040 --> 23:55.040
That to allow information to keep working. Some of them are from the former newspaper archives. Others from the former medicals are here getting certain publications and magazines to talk.

23:55.040 --> 24:07.040
That a report didn't exist in the army and that the report had been promised to certain members of the Congress.

24:07.040 --> 24:23.040
Now I'll be very frank, Mr. Secretary, that the charges, the mass charges were serious.

24:23.040 --> 24:47.040
The two Zionists understand the charges. The charges to be that the charge of war. That this committee had used the investigating arm with the Congress and an effort to secure our special treatment for a former employee of the state.

24:47.040 --> 25:09.040
I felt it would be a great injustice for this report that was the last to already have been prepared. To get my hands on those persons who were not friendly to the commission, I don't say that in a partisan manner.

25:09.040 --> 25:21.040
I say that from a philosophy of government. Before the members of the committee had a chance to see the report.

25:21.040 --> 25:29.040
Therefore, I wrote this letter on RCA to the Secretary of Defense and to Wilson.

25:29.040 --> 25:37.040
I think probably well at this time I read the letter again.

25:37.040 --> 25:57.040
I have received many inquiries concerning an external pressure for prefectural treatment. In behalf of private G David Shaw, a former member of the staff of the Senate from the subcommittee on investigation.

25:57.040 --> 26:11.040
I request the following information as the member of the chief of the subcommittee.

26:11.040 --> 26:35.040
First, has private Gain received any preferential treatment whatsoever since becoming a member of the armed force. Second, has any effort whatsoever been made by any source of civil need with a funding subcommittee to accept private report the purpose of gaining preferential treatment for private Gain.

26:35.040 --> 26:45.040
First, I think the session has been made, which is advised me for the source, type, and indicators that have been made.

26:45.040 --> 26:52.040
If there is no information, then there is no foundation for the information coming to my attention.

26:52.040 --> 27:00.040
There is no more than proper and planned. The private Gain as well as the subcommittee is so involved.

27:01.040 --> 27:13.040
In the event, there is substance to the charges. However, the committee should have in its possession all the facts on which it may be immediate action.

27:13.040 --> 27:34.040
Now, that was a letter that I sent to the Secretary of Defense. And in return, I have received the charges of the allegations which now they made this for the Opposition in this press conference.

27:34.040 --> 27:42.040
I do not bring this up for four, four, one, six, or three.

27:43.040 --> 28:08.040
I will vote in as the charges information. And therefore, to avoid the very things that happened now, I hope that we could resolve any differences that might exist without the commission a public respect.

28:09.040 --> 28:26.040
Unfortunately, I just happened with my Republican colleagues in the committee. Unfortunately, and unfortunately, we were unable to resolve any differences that might have existed.

28:27.040 --> 28:52.040
And the report, not my report, became public. But another report became public, which was done in the many, the build-up, which we have there, which has taken time of the military to take time and to resolve something that once and

28:52.040 --> 28:59.040
once and for all, the benefits of the day are here.

28:59.040 --> 29:03.040
I have to say, Henry Jackson, I'm sorry, Henry. Here I am.

29:03.040 --> 29:17.040
Mr. Gill, I have an interest in expediting this hearing, but one of the questions, one of my distinguished colleagues, is, intrigued me a bit, and I would like to pursue it if I may with a witness for a minute.

29:17.040 --> 29:23.040
Miss Secretary, who is your superior? Mr. Wilson?

29:23.040 --> 29:29.040
You run a military department in the chain of command, as a civilian chief, isn't that correct? That's correct, sir.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.040
And you're part of the executive department of the Department of Defense.

29:32.040 --> 29:39.040
I am, yes. As I understand your testimony, you were worried about this matter and you were trying to work it out.

29:39.040 --> 29:45.040
That's right. Probably when did you speak to your superior about it?

29:45.040 --> 29:58.040
Well, I think right at the start, I spoke to Mr. Wilson and told him that we had, uh, the Senator McCarthy's committee had this problem in the first Army area, and that I was trying to work along with him and try to handle the situation.

29:58.040 --> 30:05.040
What was his advice to you? His advice was, go ahead and handle it. The best way you could, the way you'd drive that, that's right.

30:05.040 --> 30:10.040
Good, Mr. Wilson, report to you. The president.

30:10.040 --> 30:17.040
Mr. Wilson, advise to you with to go ahead and handle it the way you'd go at that. That's right. And that's what you've done. That's what I've done, sir.

30:17.040 --> 30:21.040
I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman. And the question.

30:21.040 --> 30:38.040
Secretary, you would call for any time since life July and the member of this company, the president of the Chairman of the Federal, you would confer with you many way or remember the first slide.

30:38.040 --> 30:54.040
You would be, Dr. Schler, here, Mr. Schler's question. Special qualifications which might be enabled him to procure a commission, no matter.

30:55.040 --> 31:17.040
Did you at any time ever convert with any member of this company, other than the Chairman, to discuss many of the issues relating to the Special qualifications which allegedly, David Schler's concept is no service in the Army, no senator to our check.

31:18.040 --> 31:22.040
Come up, nothing from me. Send him a card.

31:22.040 --> 31:33.040
Good to see you, Mr. Smourning. I asked you to have your council prepare a list of the military men for here in the room.

31:33.040 --> 31:38.040
Who's ordered here? Have that been prepared? Yes, sir.

31:38.040 --> 31:55.040
Man, man, make it very clear that this is no reflection at all upon the military men who are here. Some of them I don't know. Some of them I do know I know they have us standing, come my records, and I think outstanding individuals.

31:55.040 --> 32:06.040
The reason I ask you for this list is because I'm curious no why we have so many compliment generals sitting here warming their heels.
