WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
the Tennessee and Poland, concerning activities in your nation's capital, and to bring you

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
special features that people will fund for the events.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.280
For the past week, Washington has been compared to the past, but it is a common

00:43.280 --> 00:44.280
challenge.

00:44.280 --> 00:49.600
Somewhat similar to what it is for the fellow upstairs to rapidly use any minute to expect

00:49.600 --> 00:54.000
the world of games that has characterized Washington's past eight months, the night

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
through the silence once again.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
The House of Representatives in recent and will continue to be a process in the former

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
first.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
The Senate took a breather for a week, over the Labor Day weekend, and returned to Wednesday.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
It devoted most of the remaining week to debate on the reciprocal trade agreements

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
and programs.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
The action the Senate takes on this program is of a special interest to any nations.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
One of our most revered citizens of all times, Judge Cardell Paul, is the original author

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
of the reciprocal trade program.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
He has defeated the bar scene plan in the early 1930s when he serves our Secretary of State.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
The current debate is concerned with the further extension of the whole plan, and there remains

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
a little doubt that the Senate will go to extend the program, to extend the program, to

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
the House voting over well, to extend the trade program some seven months ago.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
The major issue is whether Congress will continue or eliminate the peril point for vision

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
of the trade agreements program.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Now let's take a look at this complex provision of the law and try to break it down into simple

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
terms.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
The initial thought or specific trade agreements plan authorised the President of the United

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
States to negotiate trade agreements with other nations, which would work to the mutual benefit

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
of all concerns.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
This meant that the United States departed from its usual course of protecting its own products

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
by means of a high protected territory in force.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
The Republican-Aviate Congress amended this law requiring the U.S. tariff commission

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
to notify the President when a point was reached in the concessions we granted other nations

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
in this agreement, which the Commission considered perilous to our own economy, thus the name

02:45.000 --> 02:45.000


02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Thereafter, the President would be called upon to explain these agreements in advance, and

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
then, broadly, I'm in such red tape that the program will be seriously crippled.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
In other words, ladies and gentlemen, this issue involves the aging arguments between the

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Republicans and the Democrats.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
Shall we have a high protected territory and export more than we implore for a Republican

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
philosophy, or shall we engage in a health-boost-too-way trade with other governments in a chief

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
free payment of our vast loans abroad as the Democrats think we should?

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Senator Keith Barber favors free trade and elimination of the perilous point provision.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
This is an important but complicated matter.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
It is good sense that the more we trade with other people, the better we will come to understand

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
them, and the better they will understand us, the better understanding improves our chances

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
for our lasting peace.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
The entire world, friends and four-life, watched with manifest interest, the conference of

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
American, British and Canadian fiscal experts here in Washington during the week.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
It is no secret that Britain is in serious economic crisis.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Some predict bankruptcy of her within a year, so unless her shortage of dollars is really

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
unlikely that the United States will agree.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
It is likely that the United States will agree to stockpile more British colonial products

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
to tend rubber in the light that we will relax our customers' requirements to make it easier

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
for Britain to sell here, and that private capital will be encouraged to develop enterprises

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
in a British Empire.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
Notification is expected to be made on the proposal that America really written of her role as

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
banker and promoter in the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
And those in the know say that devaluation of the dollar or any such radical step will

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
not be considered at this time.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Written the experts say is in much to be to be pulled out overnight.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, the B36 investigations continue.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
This time it's the Navy that's investigating.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
Trying to find out just who practiced her canary, spreading false rumors about these huge

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
claims affecting this and the circumstances of its adoption as the principal offensive weapon

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
of their course.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
A lot of plus will be raised, but we have seen many investigations in this session, all

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
of which, thus far, have fallen flat so far as the effective findings are concerned.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
And then there was a tip between the Secretary of Defense and Senator Albert Thomas.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
It seems that Senator Thomas requested Mr. Secretary Lewis Johnson to provide his committee

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
with a plan to make an inspection trip abroad.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Secretary replied it would be more economical for the group to go about commercial airlines.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
Senator didn't think so and called upon the Secretary or reports of traveling in government

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
planes on the part of members of the executive branch, as if to say, with the executive to do it,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
so can the legislative branch.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
But when temper is at cool to bid, the matter was settled to the satisfaction of all concerned.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
And the Thomas committee got its claim for its official travel.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Now for the remainder of our time, we should like to answer in narrative form.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Some of the questions we are asked from time to time, when starting procedures here in your office.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
The purpose of this program, as you know, is to bring your senators out this closer to the people

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
or a better understanding of what is done and more important why it is done.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
Of course time does not permit a full discourse on the subject, even if we knew all the answers,

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
which we do not. But having a fair refresh on the Washington scene a few months ago,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
we found the situation a little different than we expected in some particular,

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
and believe you will be interested in them also.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
In the first place, it could be your view that all our most of the work of Congress

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
takes place on the floor of the send in the house.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
This we find and beg to report to the smart from the banks.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
The real understood business activity and hard work is done in committees.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
The two bodies of Congress usually meet at noon, but the mornings are filled with committee meetings and hearings.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
It is there that all the boiling down, polishing up and perfecting our office.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
That is, if the proposed bill is ever actionally acted on at all.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Most bills, which are introduced, are in committee.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
The personnel of these committees is designated by the steering committee.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Assignments remain on the basis of seniority and unrequested to the various members.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Most senators have two committee assignments.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
11 of the 96, including Senator Keepover, are on three committees.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Sometimes all three of these committees will be meeting at the same time,

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
which makes for some hurry to hop in about the place to place on the part of the usually dignified senators.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
When a bill is introduced, it is referred to the appropriate committee.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
If this sponsor presses the committee, the bill is currently considered from every angle.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
On occasions, a subcommittee is appointed to hear witnesses on both sides of the question.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Reports are made and eventually committee reduces testimony on the bill to writing.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
And a printed report of the committee's findings and recommendations,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
a company's bill of an industry reported out for passage,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
which are the subjects of the base on the floor of the Senate.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Every senator has available a wealth of information about the bill,

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
and it is on the basis of these hearings and reports and the mail from back home

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
that he determines how he will vote.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Once reported out favorably, the bill is placed on the calendar and awaits its regular term.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
Although the majority leader is giving a great deal of leeway under Senate rules,

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
in determining in what order legislation will be considered.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Procedures in the two houses of Congress are different.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
In the House of Representatives, there are 435 members,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
and the time a bill may be debated is limited.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
The House resolves itself into a committee of the polls to consider the bill.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
A Tennessean representative, Jerry Cooper of Darsford,

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
is chairman of the committee of the whole and usually presides at these deliberations.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
After this preliminary discussion, the House then goes into session and does officially,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
but it has just done unofficial.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Another native of Tennessee, Speaker Sam Raver, who was born in Rome County,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
presides over this session.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
In the Senate debate is virtually unlimited.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Usually a bill may not be taken, so long as any of the 96 senators,

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
desires to be heard or heard further, and sometimes on and on and off,

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
deliberate organized attempts on the part of a few senators to postpone and unfavourable votes

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
by continuing debate is what is known as a filibuster.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
The president of the Senate, of course, is the vice president of the United States.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
And in his absence, the president of Pro Tempere is the official presiding officer.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Senator Kenneth D. McHeller, Tennessee is the current president of Pro Tempere.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
When a vote is about to be taken, or a forum called in,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
signals sound all over Capitol Hill.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And the congressman still has plenty of time to register his vote.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
The cause it requires about 45 minutes to call the House roll.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
The senators are less fortunate. They're only 96 senators.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
And they misguided from their office in the midi room,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
to the Senate floor to be recorded.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
In eight of this, a tram runs rapidly between the Senate office building

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and the Senate floor in the Capitol.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Under the street, in elevators, for senators only are available.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
Like there's not, the senator has determined days before how he will vote.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Unless he is participating in the debate, it's probable that he will be busy elsewhere

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
by the discussion on the floors and the progress.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
When the Senate photos taken, if the bill is passed,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
goes over to the House for similar consideration.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Sometimes the two houses differ in the form of the bill passed.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
When this occurs, a conference is necessary between committees from each House

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
to iron out the differences.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Each House must then agree to the report of the conference

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
and finalize the bill in identical language.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
In addition to the presiding officers, the two major parties in both houses

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
elect a majority leader and minority leader and majority and minority equips.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
The task of the quilt is to equip and line his party members on a vote along party lines

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
and to be sure those who support his party are present when a vote is taken.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
The quilt acts as his party leader in the absence of the majority or minority leader as the case may be.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
The majority quilt over in the House is yet another tenissian representative J. Percy Priest of Nashville.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
As you can see, the tenissians play a very important role in your Congress.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Another member of the delegation, representative Tom Murray of Jackson,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
is chairman of the House committee on post offices in civil service.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
At the present, because of extensive Paris to the Senate and House changes,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
visitors galleries are not available, but ordinarily they are.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
If you visited a section of one of the houses, however,

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
it is improbable that you would see either Vice President Barkley or Speaker Raven Presider.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
This is done ordinarily by various members to assure that proceedings are in accordance with the rules.

12:02.000 --> 12:11.000
The parliamentarians present it all times to advise the occupant of the chair how to rule when a point of order is raised from the floor.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
Following it then goes to the White House for approval or disprove of the president.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
He makes sign it into law, allowing it to become law without this signature or veto it.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
The Congress by sufficient majority may pass a bill into law following your presidential veto.

12:28.000 --> 12:35.000
As you will see readily, the enactment of a law by your Congress requires a great deal of time and careful study.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
There are times when the new government can never accomplish the bill of all the duties of parliamentary procedures.

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
At times, the people become provoked with the loan delay, but all in all, the more you are around Capitol Hill,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
the more you are impressed with the sincerity of your legislative talks.

12:52.000 --> 13:01.000
They all have the same motives in mind, but most part all of them will piece, prosperity, and happiness for all the people.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
They differ as to how these ends shall be attained.

13:05.000 --> 13:13.000
A democracy moves slowly, deliberately, but when we are prompted to criticize and complain, we should never lose sight of the fact.

13:13.000 --> 13:21.000
The grinding government of the United States is the most successful, the mind of mortal man as yet devised.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
And with the freezing pressure, we brought you up your public service administration to keep you clean.

13:27.000 --> 13:38.000
On the right of the streets of this time, the driving needs, safety, and the spread of your ass is keepover, saying that's all for now from your center of his office in Washington.
