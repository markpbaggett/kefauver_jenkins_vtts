WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.700
I told that by people who work under General Lawton, who had worked with him, and who knew.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.700
We had no doubt about General Lawton.

00:10.700 --> 00:16.840
We know that General Lawton was finally given three reigns of his own volition, an

00:16.840 --> 00:23.940
escape zone investigation, made certain systems, suspension report, Mama, he did sir.

00:23.940 --> 00:32.660
Now Mr. Coon, have you related all of the instruments with respect off October 29th and your

00:32.660 --> 00:36.940
twelve green notes are being carried to elaborate upon?

00:36.940 --> 00:41.320
Very briefly sir, as to what knowledge we gained from Green Width which convulsed and

00:41.320 --> 00:42.320
forth later.

00:42.320 --> 00:47.500
Again, with a brief reference of my mate to the public record, based on the information

00:47.500 --> 00:53.300
which we received from David Green Width on that day, we had drawn up a question and answer

00:53.300 --> 00:58.540
to that position which he swore to and which has become a part of the record of the subcommittee

00:58.540 --> 01:04.060
in which he described the fact that there has been espionage in the Army signal corps

01:04.060 --> 01:07.860
and that such activity might possibly still be continuing.

01:07.860 --> 01:12.780
In other words, that all the members of the ring had not been apprehended, but he said

01:12.780 --> 01:16.780
sir, I'm not going to read it if I may, I'm just going to read a sentence or two from it.

01:16.780 --> 01:17.780
Very well.

01:17.780 --> 01:18.780
Speak for itself.

01:18.780 --> 01:20.780
Mr. Green grads with A.

01:20.780 --> 01:21.780
Question.

01:21.780 --> 01:30.100
Did you learn and sirs, I said Ian South had been a communist spy and had admitted it

01:30.100 --> 01:33.540
and were popping the FBI in the government and we understand now that they're going

01:33.540 --> 01:34.540
to last.

01:34.540 --> 01:38.860
I think it's a fifteen years answer.

01:38.860 --> 01:42.820
Fifteen years answer.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.460
Green Width with A.

01:44.460 --> 01:45.460
Question.

01:45.460 --> 01:50.700
Did you learn if there was espionage in the Army signal corps?

01:50.700 --> 01:51.700
Yes.

01:51.700 --> 01:56.860
I learned that there was espionage in the Army signal corps.

01:56.860 --> 02:04.620
I learned that the Rosenberg ring took and obtained secrets from the Army signal corps

02:04.620 --> 02:07.860
and transmitted them to Russian questions.

02:07.860 --> 02:13.260
Would you give us some of the details concerning your knowledge of espionage in the signal corps?

02:13.260 --> 02:14.260
Answer.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.260
Yes.

02:15.260 --> 02:22.060
The Rosenberg told me that the Russians had a very small and a very poor electronic industry.

02:22.060 --> 02:28.580
This is of course another name for the radar industry and that it was of the utmost importance

02:28.580 --> 02:34.380
that information of an electronic nature, the obtained and gotten to him.

02:34.380 --> 02:40.300
Things like electronic valves, vacuum tubes, capacitors, transformers and various other

02:40.300 --> 02:46.180
electronic and radio components were some of the things he was interested in.

02:46.180 --> 02:52.380
Rosenberg also told me that he gave all of the true manuals he could get a hand sign

02:52.380 --> 02:57.380
to Russian, some of which were classified top secrets.

02:57.380 --> 03:04.660
Continually he said, about 1947 at a time when I was at when I was when it was a top United

03:04.660 --> 03:06.660
States scientific secret.

03:06.660 --> 03:12.160
Julius Rosenberg told me about information he had obtained from his friend relating

03:12.160 --> 03:17.140
to a thinking machine which would send out interceptor guided missiles to knock out

03:17.140 --> 03:23.180
and enemy guided missiles which had been detected by our radar and is of course predicted

03:23.180 --> 03:24.940
by our thinking machine.

03:24.940 --> 03:30.020
Rosenberg was discussing this information with me as I said before when it was a top American

03:30.020 --> 03:31.020
scientific secret.

03:31.020 --> 03:36.340
Of course it must be remembered that Rosenberg was employed by the signal corps.

03:36.340 --> 03:43.660
During World War II and worked at Fort Hornets in other places which were working on time

03:43.660 --> 03:49.780
or subcontracts for the signal corps such as the Amazon radio corporation.

03:49.780 --> 03:54.940
At one time too, Rosenberg was an inspector for the signal corps.

03:54.940 --> 04:00.540
After the war when Rosenberg and I were in business together in New York, Rosenberg

04:00.540 --> 04:05.620
used a signal corps contact in an attempt to obtain contracts for a technology product

04:05.620 --> 04:07.620
in a G&R engineering company.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.460
And just wanting to stop it.

04:09.460 --> 04:14.980
As a matter of fact, Julius made a number of tricks to signal corps officials in Philadelphia

04:14.980 --> 04:15.980
for this purpose.

04:15.980 --> 04:23.540
Once when I questioned Julius about the necessity of the frequent Philadelphia trick he ended

04:23.540 --> 04:30.140
that not only for the trick necessary for company business but also because he had to

04:30.140 --> 04:36.220
say his espionage contact.

04:36.220 --> 04:40.620
Then I think about the last question and answers I want to read with me these questions.

04:40.620 --> 04:46.020
Did Rosenberg tell you anything about working on the proximity cues while he was at the

04:46.020 --> 04:48.580
signal corps installation at Emmerton?

04:48.580 --> 04:49.580
Answer, yes.

04:49.580 --> 04:55.540
Rosenberg told me that while he was employed for the signal corps at Emmerton, he stole

04:55.540 --> 05:01.540
the proximity cues and gave it to the Russian.

05:01.540 --> 05:04.540
Greenberg then goes on to describe how Rosenberg accomplished his set.

05:04.540 --> 05:07.340
I want to mention who and who would you be reading?

05:07.340 --> 05:13.540
I have been reading from a foreign deposition by David Greenberg which is an evidence for

05:13.540 --> 05:16.100
the Matarbe committee.

05:16.100 --> 05:19.100
And I won't go on with that description.

05:19.100 --> 05:23.100
Greenberg told on with really the position taken by the Matarbe committee.

05:23.100 --> 05:28.100
It was not the testimony given between Greenberg and Corps to get this report.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.100
Oh no.

05:29.100 --> 05:32.100
We wanted Greenberg to actually come and testify before the committee.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.100
I will.

05:33.100 --> 05:37.660
The Justice Department would not submit it but they did submit it to take the deposition.

05:37.660 --> 05:41.100
The last question was taken by the significant decision.

05:41.100 --> 05:47.780
Question, when did the operation of the Rosenberg ring which had as its purpose the obtaining

05:47.780 --> 05:56.940
of radar secrets for Russia stopped and as far as I know these operations never stopped

05:56.940 --> 06:01.620
and could very possibly be continuing to this very day.

06:01.620 --> 06:06.020
And there are further details in the Greenberg testimony.

06:06.020 --> 06:12.180
First action if you need the Senator Matarbe's face on there about the fifth day of November

06:12.180 --> 06:19.180
which was referred to making a statement about continuing the investigation or holding hearings.

06:19.180 --> 06:22.180
These are the executive or public hearings on Fourth Moments.

06:22.180 --> 06:27.180
Well on the fifth of November which was just before the day before the quenching of Mr.

06:27.180 --> 06:40.180
Thiemont's office, Senator Matarbe stated publicly that it was his prime intention to hold public hearings on communist infiltration at the Fourth Moments on the radar laboratory.

06:40.180 --> 06:44.180
I will move statements or live statements carried in the crib.

06:44.180 --> 06:51.180
It was given my stipulations certified without reading my insert for the record to article one from the New York

06:51.180 --> 07:01.180
Health Tribune and one from the Washington Times held saying starting a full exposure of communist

07:01.180 --> 07:06.180
ethnicity and objectivity at the signal call laboratories and radar center at Fourth Moments

07:06.180 --> 07:14.640
and the majority was promised yesterday by Senator Joseph Almancourt MacCarpie when he begins hearing the U.S. Court House on

07:14.640 --> 07:17.640
May I file those for the record?

07:17.640 --> 07:24.180
The two stories updated Friday November 6th, 1953,

07:24.180 --> 07:31.180
were referred to statements made by Senator MacCarpie on Thursday, November 5th, 1953.

07:31.180 --> 07:38.180
That objection is filed as a jibberst, I think, 26 and 27 minutes of duck-a-dow, whatever the appropriate young result.

07:38.180 --> 07:43.180
28, 29, and an objection, right?

07:43.180 --> 07:52.180
Now it's the cold and you serious testimony, I don't think it would be denied by anyone that there was a mention in the panic on in the 6 days

07:52.180 --> 07:56.180
of November 6th, certainly will not be denied by me.

07:56.180 --> 08:04.180
I want the Royal Conclusion of that luncheon, we went from Mr. Cleveland, we went from Mr. Adams,

08:04.180 --> 08:09.180
and now we want to hear from Mr. Cohn that it was expected that to be clear, immediately.

08:09.180 --> 08:12.180
I'll tell you what went on in the best area.

08:12.180 --> 08:19.180
The luncheon was arranged by Mr. Adams, he said, as the request of Mr. C.

08:20.180 --> 08:32.180
Mr. Adams, I've been talking to us on October 21st and on subsequent occasions about what to be done to stop hearings and the investigation of our committee of mama.

08:32.180 --> 08:42.180
He indicated that he and Mr. Stevens would be very much pleased if we could work out some way of stopping it,

08:42.180 --> 08:50.180
that it was not helping either one of them, but it's been heard in the press, had to be in the position of Mr. Adams.

08:50.180 --> 08:53.180
No, I think actually the investigation was before that.

08:53.180 --> 08:59.180
I would say two or three days, I don't remember, just one fire can all be done on the 6th.

08:59.180 --> 09:06.180
Mr. Adams called me, I believe it was, although I have no clear recognition of the call.

09:06.180 --> 09:13.180
So, Mr. Adams of just one of us, Mr. Adams called me.

09:13.180 --> 09:28.180
And he said that, couldn't he and Mr. Stevens get one more back at the senator before the hearings got underway?

09:28.180 --> 09:39.180
And Mr. Stevens, with a deeply appreciative, if a little one should be held at his office, so that it doesn't matter to be discussed.

09:39.180 --> 09:45.180
I quote the chairman, Senator McCarthy, and answer him about it.

09:45.180 --> 09:53.180
He said, sure, Mr. Stevens thinks there's something he wants to talk to him about, he would be very glad to have lunch on.

09:53.180 --> 09:57.180
So, the meeting was set up. Senator McCarthy was expected.

09:57.180 --> 10:01.180
Frank was expected. Dave Shine was expected. I was expected.

10:01.180 --> 10:06.180
Now, why do you say Dave Shine was expected, Mr. Cohn, because he was there?

10:06.180 --> 10:11.180
Who would name the Jets, the inviteean?

10:11.180 --> 10:13.180
The direct call was Mr. Adams.

10:13.180 --> 10:18.180
So, you and the senator, and Dave Shine, and Frank Carr, being four in numbers?

10:18.180 --> 10:19.180
Yes.

10:19.180 --> 10:23.180
Mr. Adams, Mr. Adams, Mr. Kansas, Mr. Cohn, and Mr. Cohn, on November 6th.

10:23.180 --> 10:24.180
We work.

10:24.180 --> 10:29.180
And you say the prime purpose was to get one more crack at the senator, and in order for him to call out the four drummers.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.180
That was the answer.

10:30.180 --> 10:32.180
That's the subject.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.180
Who would name the Jets?

10:34.180 --> 10:38.180
From outside, there was the chairman, Frank, and my son.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.180
Why did Dave Shine not have been meddling?

10:40.180 --> 10:43.180
I don't remember details there. There were two or three reasons.

10:43.180 --> 10:48.180
I remember we passed the invitation on to him, but he had had an illness in his family number one,

10:48.180 --> 10:55.180
and number two, he had been inducted into the Army, and he had some reservations about drawing down to the secretary's office and having lunch.

10:55.180 --> 10:59.180
The school one happened to be in the gun on November 6th.

10:59.180 --> 11:02.180
The first time he called it, sir, he wants that in detail.

11:02.180 --> 11:04.180
I think it might be well.

11:04.180 --> 11:05.180
It's hard.

11:05.180 --> 11:11.180
The school certainly is the subject's mention that important facts to the issue, it's the only time I had lunch.

11:11.180 --> 11:18.180
The chairman's office, and I do remember it was out of all what happened there.

11:18.180 --> 11:23.180
I know that Frank Khan, I arrived before Senator McCarty, and then the senator came.

11:23.180 --> 11:28.180
Lunch and places were set for a day of shine.

11:28.180 --> 11:30.180
He did not say that his wife did not come.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.180
Mr. Stevens asked where he walked.

11:32.180 --> 11:41.180
I don't remember details of there were six places, or chairs, or places, or six.

11:41.180 --> 11:43.180
I think so, if that's a single essay.

11:43.180 --> 11:47.180
I don't remember the number six, Mr. Jenkins, while I do remember, they were a vacant place.

11:47.180 --> 11:50.180
If they have one more, that's an expected and a lie.

11:50.180 --> 11:53.180
And I remember Mr. Stevens asking if Dave were in trouble.

11:53.180 --> 11:59.180
And I think Mr. Adams had something to the effect that no, I had told Mr. Adams Dave probably would not be down.

11:59.180 --> 12:02.180
I also remember, we've been talking about pictures.

12:02.180 --> 12:08.180
So Mr. Stevens said that a couple of photographers at the Pentagon had wanted a picture of him,

12:08.180 --> 12:13.180
the secretary with Dave who was just an inductive as a private, and he had told him that he expected Dave for lunch

12:13.180 --> 12:15.180
and thought the picture could be taken there.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.180
My baby, you mean Dave?

12:17.180 --> 12:18.180
Yes, sir.

12:18.180 --> 12:19.180
You remember that distinctly?

12:19.180 --> 12:20.180
I do so.

12:20.180 --> 12:24.180
And you remember this week when you were saying Mr. Khan, positively, definitely.

12:24.180 --> 12:27.180
The shine was invited to be there on medication.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.180
Yes, sir.

12:28.180 --> 12:33.180
I know that I called him and told him that he was invited and expected and he said he didn't think he could come.

12:33.180 --> 12:34.180
I don't know how it does, and he was.

12:34.180 --> 12:39.180
And I remember telling Mr. Adams that I was the chairman, of course, would be there.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.180
But I was the there, that Frank would be there.

12:41.180 --> 12:48.180
I thought I made it pretty clear that Dave would not be there, but apparently Mr. Adams did not re-waste that to save.

12:48.180 --> 12:57.180
And you say that it was the secretary in person who said that he had hoped or expected to have his photograph taken with Dave?

12:57.180 --> 13:03.180
Well, sir, it was not that much of a federal case if I can use that term.

13:03.180 --> 13:11.180
It was simply a matter of a grandest of a couple of photographers in the Pentagon before they got a picture of the secretary of the Army

13:11.180 --> 13:17.180
and Dave Shine, who had been inducted as a private photography, could picture the half.

13:17.180 --> 13:23.180
They had made inquiries of Mr. Stevens' office, and Mr. Stevens had apparently said that he expected Dave to lunch that day

13:23.180 --> 13:26.180
and that the picture could be taken on that occasion.

13:26.180 --> 13:33.180
When Dave didn't show up, he asked where Dave was and mentioned he had told the photographer they probably could get that picture.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.180
Very well.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.180
I do remember that.

13:35.180 --> 13:37.180
There was no great point of it.

13:38.180 --> 13:41.180
Now what occurred there that day in addition to the things he detailed?

13:41.180 --> 13:43.180
It was a long session.

13:43.180 --> 13:48.180
Uh, as we understand about a VR session, yes, it was once.

13:48.180 --> 13:53.180
But we don't want you to consume VRs and setting a foot transfer there on that occasion.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.180
There's no danger of that.

13:55.180 --> 14:00.180
The American princess, Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Taylor, are the important things of cloud that day.

14:00.180 --> 14:03.180
Uh, by summary, sir, the important things for this.

14:04.180 --> 14:11.180
Mr. Steven and Mr. Adams wanted to know if there wasn't some way to stop the public hearing.

14:11.180 --> 14:16.180
The Senate of Macauv, he said with the help wasn't it some way we could get them the call box.

14:16.180 --> 14:25.180
Uh, Senate of Macauv, he said no, there was no way that the hearings would see help and that they should be help.

14:26.180 --> 14:32.180
Mr. Steven, next, uh, and he said no, but get a rundown of the public hearings.

14:32.180 --> 14:36.180
He was able to show up so he could be prepared for what was to come.

14:36.180 --> 14:39.180
Uh, he addressed that to Senator Macauv.

14:39.180 --> 14:44.180
Senator Macauv, he said, and I think Senator Macauv, he started giving an outline.

14:44.180 --> 14:52.180
And in many times to me, he said, told me that Mr. Talman just to see everything that was going to be brought out of the first public hearings.

14:52.180 --> 14:55.180
And he said there's some old man.

14:55.180 --> 15:00.180
Uh, I spent so much time as we understand it, you never had a public hearing.

15:00.180 --> 15:02.180
No, it's not through respect to mama.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.180
No, we had not.

15:03.180 --> 15:11.180
So, uh, I went into a detailed review of witnesses.

15:11.180 --> 15:20.180
We expected the call testimony that within all probability, the adult's then, uh, thankful on those lines showing that I remember I talked about this.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.180
Green glass deposition.

15:22.180 --> 15:41.180
Uh, I remember the Jenkins, I told the, I told Mr. Steven that our investigation shows that not only had to his Rosenberg been bound at my list, but probably a majority of members of the Rosenberg firing had at one time or another work to the Army signal floor and specifically down at four.

15:41.180 --> 15:47.180
Which was a pretty good indication of the how important the Russians thought those laboratories were.

15:47.180 --> 16:02.180
The television, that evidence we had showed that when an associate, a Julius Rosenberg and other members of his ring, had still been at one moment in the year 1953.

16:02.180 --> 16:20.180
That a group of them had moved out of mind, but that didn't mean much because they had moved into the federal telecommunications laboratory, which was a company doing subcontracting work for the Army signal corps and thought month so that they were doing just about the same thing at another place.

16:20.180 --> 16:43.180
I remember that we told Mr. Steven that one grant, if example, that was the case and it's a public record of a man named Joseph Levitt, for whom Julius Rosenberg was actually the reference of employment with the federal telecommunications laboratory and that this Joseph Levitt had been working at the federal telecommunications laboratory right down into 1953.

16:43.180 --> 16:51.180
Even though his employment application shows for all the cities, that Julius Rosenberg was one of the three people who got him the job.

16:51.180 --> 17:07.180
And there were a lot of other examples and it showed a very terrible situation of coming into infiltration over a period of time and of the presence of security.

17:07.180 --> 17:11.180
I gave that outline to Mr. Steven.

17:11.180 --> 17:15.180
It was like a very strange surprise.

17:15.180 --> 17:19.180
It's like the situation's existed Mr. Steven.

17:19.180 --> 17:25.180
I don't know that he was surprised, sir. He was disturbed.

17:25.180 --> 17:31.180
Well, it was made known that you and the students can continue your work to forthman look into how these open stations...

17:31.180 --> 17:55.180
Yes, sir. It's a matter of like Senator McCoppy went further. He said that even more important to him than the exposure of individual communists or security risks was the exposure of people within the Department of the Army who had covered up the security risks and communists and that made it possible for them to continue on the job until the committee came along.

17:55.180 --> 18:08.180
Mr. Cohn, what was said by either the Secretary or Mr. Adams on that occasion designed a super-sweaver influence to not hold these open hearings on Portland.

18:08.180 --> 18:20.180
So I don't know any about his design, but after this resettlement completed, I recall Mr. Steven got up and said, turns to Senator McCoppy and said, in effect, I don't remember if he's exact where it's Senator is.

18:20.180 --> 18:25.180
What's your first one, Mr. Cohn? I don't hear you.

18:25.180 --> 18:32.180
What was the second thing he said in substance senator is in his complete against that?

18:32.180 --> 18:34.180
Right now.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.180
I think that's all.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.180
We're trying to third time now.

18:37.180 --> 18:44.180
Mr. Jenkins, the Secretary stood up and addressed himself as Senator McCoppy, said where it's the effect senator.

18:44.180 --> 18:51.180
If you go through with these hearings, the public hearings, if you go into this oil he set up and everything else, I will have to resign.

18:51.180 --> 18:55.180
The Secretary of the Young, I've been here for 10 months.

18:55.180 --> 19:05.180
A lot of the people involved have been serving under me and it's my responsibility and I'm the partner who I'm just going to have to resign.

19:05.180 --> 19:10.180
Mr. Cohn, are you the epinism of students to stay in Maine, that's his statement?

19:10.180 --> 19:13.180
My annual run ID is the committee has on its witness page.

19:13.180 --> 19:18.180
Although there might be some difference in the burden in the terminology.

19:23.180 --> 19:30.180
Well, the termine is the chair that was the 7th inning, so it was a five-minute recess.

19:31.180 --> 19:52.180
I'm sure that the chair needs not have not reached the audience about the rule of the chair familiar against any audible manifestation of approval of this approval because I feel that most of you who were here before the recess are the same folks who are here now.

19:52.180 --> 19:55.180
Mr. Jenkins, you were interrogating.

19:55.180 --> 19:58.180
I don't see the witness.

20:00.180 --> 20:03.180
I don't see the witness.

20:05.180 --> 20:08.180
Move over there, you can't.

20:30.180 --> 20:33.180
Mr. Cohn, you can't.

20:40.180 --> 20:44.180
Mr. Cohn is not in the caucus room.

20:49.180 --> 20:56.180
The Senator Mon has been informed now that Mr. Cohn is back on his way to the Senate caucus room and will continue to testify.

20:57.180 --> 21:04.180
Mr. Cohn has certified his length on the statements of General Lockings before the executive session of the MacArthur Subcommittee.

21:04.180 --> 21:13.180
He's also told about the meeting of October 21st in which he spent the evening with Mr. Adams and New York City.

21:13.180 --> 21:36.180
Mr. Adams, we'll move to dinner and later on to the boxing match and the evening Mr. Adams hinted at or suggested that Army might be relieved of some of the pressure put on it if the MacArthur Subcommittee were to examine or go into a led communist infiltration in the Navy and in the Air Force.

21:36.180 --> 21:47.180
There is a small conference with Mr. Jenkins and Senator Mon in Senator McClub.

21:47.180 --> 21:53.180
Senator Simon, chatting with Mr. Bob Kennedy, the Council for the Nair.

22:07.180 --> 22:14.180
Mr. Jenkins is referring with the Social Council, Mr. Cohn.

22:23.180 --> 22:31.180
There is the empty witness chair where Mr. Cohn is supposed to be and is not at the moment during this small recess.

22:36.180 --> 22:42.180
We are not yet having Mr. Cohn in the witness chair and it will start in just a moment.

22:42.180 --> 22:55.180
The ABC television network is bringing you the complete hearings into the MacArthur Army controversy.

22:55.180 --> 23:15.180
Mr. Cohn is returned to the caucus room and goes now to Senator Mon in to Mr. Jenkins rather than return to the witness chair he's probably apologizing and talking over the course of his testimony for the next hour or so that is remaining prior to the recess for the afternoon.

23:15.180 --> 23:24.180
Then Mr. Cohn aggregates.

23:24.180 --> 23:27.660
And his rudder of supply starts for the session after they meet Senator Mon

23:27.660 --> 23:30.500
and they are called ... committee to order.

23:30.500 --> 23:37.140
곧 up to witness chair and the governor suddenly could be safe.

23:37.140 --> 23:43.180
長 it is a second Fleetkar who is in the process of direct examination

23:44.180 --> 23:50.180
and he will take up the cabinet at the face of the council tankings and proceed.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.380
More direct testimony by Mr. Cohn is now back in the witness chair and Mr.

23:55.380 --> 23:59.380
Chairman will cut only words hemigone on the one we seek to the lunch.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.380
Yes.

24:01.380 --> 24:02.380
And he had the ...

24:02.380 --> 24:04.380
when he took the respect.

24:05.380 --> 24:12.380
He had the countets the events up to the point where you said the Secretary of the Army stated that

24:13.380 --> 24:17.380
if his investigation continued he would have to resign and take a care of the Army.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.380
Yes sir.

24:19.380 --> 24:23.380
He said that to Senator McCarthy, Senator McCarthy, read why.

24:23.380 --> 24:28.380
You will call what Senator McCinnon McCinnon McCinnon McCinnon McCinnon's will fly well.

24:28.380 --> 24:29.380
Yes I do.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.380
What was it?

24:30.380 --> 24:34.380
Well, Senator what Senator McCinnon McCinnon said was that he thought Mr.

24:34.380 --> 24:40.380
Stavins was entirely too sensitive on the question of a personal effect it would have on Mr.

24:40.380 --> 24:41.380
Stavins.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.380
Senator it is not agreed.

24:42.380 --> 24:45.380
Senator Whitney is that much of a personal reflection on Mr. Stavins.

24:45.380 --> 24:52.380
He thought of Mr. Stavins today house cleaning job that he has no reason to be personally concerned.

24:53.380 --> 25:00.380
May the first time Senator McCinnon in the seats that he would visit from further investigation

25:00.380 --> 25:05.380
are the visits from holding public hearings who would reflect upon Martin Scohn's conduct?

25:05.380 --> 25:06.380
No.

25:07.380 --> 25:16.380
No Mr. Cole, an allegation is made and one of the committee may consider a serious allegation.

25:16.380 --> 25:23.380
The allegation being by human son of the Macriby that on that occasion November 6th, Mr.

25:23.380 --> 25:33.380
Stavins made some remarks or made some statements about you resisting from further investigation

25:34.380 --> 25:39.380
report, Martin going astute the Navy and the Air Force.

25:39.380 --> 25:49.380
I want you to tell us nearly as you can this subcommittee precisely what the Secretary of the Army said on that occasion with respect to that subject.

25:49.380 --> 25:52.380
Of course I can't give the exact word from Mr. Stavins.

25:52.380 --> 26:00.380
The substance was Mr. Stavins thought that we would look at timing and infiltration in the Navy and the Air Force for a while

26:00.380 --> 26:03.380
and give the Army a rest that that would be welcome.

26:06.380 --> 26:08.380
What reply was made to that to get you?

26:08.380 --> 26:14.380
Are the required by the Chairman wise for a number of points.

26:14.380 --> 26:21.380
I remember one or two of them were that first of all we could not stop an investigation.

26:21.380 --> 26:25.380
We had no facts warranting such an investigation at that time.

26:26.380 --> 26:36.380
Requires before you start investigating some place you have to have a preliminary investigation later groundwork and that takes weeks and sometimes months.

26:36.380 --> 26:44.380
That second of all we did not even have the information on which to predicate that preliminary investigation.

26:44.380 --> 26:47.380
The Secretary did not think that was feasible.

26:47.380 --> 26:54.380
He went on to explain that our next investigation was all set anyway and that that was not of the Navy or the Air Force but involved.

26:54.380 --> 26:58.380
Communists infiltration in defense plants.

26:58.380 --> 27:03.380
The presence of current communist party members in defense plants.

27:06.380 --> 27:12.380
Well, that's the second time the such a thing has been mentioned in your presence Mr. Kohn.

27:12.380 --> 27:15.380
It's the second time that I recall sir.

27:15.380 --> 27:17.380
There might have been others which I don't.

27:17.380 --> 27:23.380
I specifically recall this finalized specifically recall October 21st.

27:24.380 --> 27:27.380
This is recall any other time since the winter back.

27:27.380 --> 27:28.380
Yes.

27:28.380 --> 27:41.380
Now I might say that Mr. Kohn, the question of following that up is the Jenkins on the question of information which we were lacking.

27:41.380 --> 27:46.380
Mr. Adams did make a comment that there was no problem about that. He could get us the information.

27:46.380 --> 27:50.380
Yes, but the reason is the occasion of the mouth incident.

27:50.380 --> 27:54.380
No sir, that's not that's not that's not that was the same of them to six months.

27:54.380 --> 27:57.380
Now they were right. Now what does Mr. Adams see on the key?

27:57.380 --> 28:03.380
The substance of what he said was he could help us getting information on the Navy and the Air Force.

28:03.380 --> 28:18.380
I might say that the conversation changed when the Senate have mentioned that our next investigation was of communist infiltration in defense plants because Mr. Stevens or Mr. Adams immediately said that.

28:18.380 --> 28:26.380
If we were to investigate communist defense plants, does that light involve the defense department itself?

28:26.380 --> 28:42.380
Defense department personnel and does that would be very helpful to Mr. Stevens because it would remove the army as the skull object of the committee's investigation on communist infiltration in the military.

28:42.380 --> 28:57.380
Madam McIntyre, I remember it said while we had that investigation plan, we were already on it. We were going to go ahead on it and doing that simultaneously was going to ease Mr. Stevens' personal situation.

28:57.380 --> 29:07.380
Now make Mr. Stevens feel better about it. Mr. Stevens would lead a beneficiary of us going ahead with the communist infiltration defense plant.

29:07.380 --> 29:12.380
And they're not being used predicted such an investigation looking to the defense plants.

29:12.380 --> 29:23.380
We had for some time prior to that. And you say the secretary and Mr. Adams expressed the light or satisfaction of pleasure over the two years.

29:23.380 --> 29:31.380
Yes, they thought that that would spread around the flame a little bit and that would be they felt that would be very, very helpful.

29:31.380 --> 29:51.380
The ban and Senator McCarthy took the view that we were already on that other investigation. We were going ahead with it and it's running out along at the same time with kind of easement, the Stevens' situation personally and he said say to mine that he was very glad that that would be very soft.

29:51.380 --> 30:03.380
And was anything else said that significance? Our fingers that they are number six. The children that the children like when they were on your charges against the army.

30:03.380 --> 30:15.380
Now there are a lot of other things said, Sir, some generals came in, General Ridgeway came in, General Sudo and General Muget. And I had a tell the story all over again about our investigation of Fort Monmouth. It was more discussion.

30:15.380 --> 30:24.380
They were discussion about Dave Shine and completing his work for the committee while he was doing army training just about us Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams.

30:24.380 --> 30:30.380
What did it? And the long meeting but I think I covered the sudden stuff.

30:30.380 --> 30:42.380
It was a discussion from November 6th to November 24th and 25th. And with particular respect to the proposed removal of General Lotton from Fort Monmouth.

30:42.380 --> 30:48.380
I want you to tell the members of this committee what you know about that subject Mr. Colton.

30:48.380 --> 31:02.380
On November 24th Mr. Adams talked for the first time about definite concrete plans to remove General Lotton. Just what did Mr. Adams say?

31:02.380 --> 31:12.380
As I recall it, and very much to Jenkins that have been a lot of in between discussions between that tonight about October 14th when General Lotton made the statements which I read.

31:12.380 --> 31:20.380
They then came to the order that the instruction that he couldn't go along to Monmouth and it was apparent he was in the thought house.

31:20.380 --> 31:33.380
Then on November 24th Mr. Adams came up to New York. We had public hearings on communist infiltration and the only radar evidence.

31:33.380 --> 31:35.380
Mr. Colton, I am very...
