WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
See, one take, what? This had me two, twenty-one keyfower.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
from time to time on this program,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
other visitors and I have had an occasion to say something

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
about the Tom Bigby Waterway,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
in which I have been interested for a long, long time.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
I think it's important that all Tennesseans and people in Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
and the whole nation know about this very remarkable project.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
For our section of the country, I think it is the most important proposed development

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
that we have had since the coming of the Tennessee Valley Authority

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
back in 1933.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
It's going to affect our communities and our industry, our agriculture,

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
and will be a great advancement for every section of our state and several adjacent states.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
To describe and talk about the Tennessee Tom Bigby Waterway and more detail,

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
I have invited and I appreciate his acceptance, Colonel Robert C. Marshall,

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
who is the assistant director of the Civil Works Division of the Corps of Engineers

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
under whose jurisdiction this waterway comes.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
To come and tell us something about it and to tell the meaning of it

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
and what's going to be done to the listeners over this station.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Colonel Marshall, it's awfully good to have you with us

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
and we appreciate very much your coming here.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
You've been in the Corps of Engineers for many years, I believe, have you not?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Well, about 20, sir.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
And you were telling me that during the war you spent some time in the volunteer state.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I did indeed. It was my pleasure to be assigned to Camp Forest, Tennessee,

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
N.A.K.E.H. and also to engage in what we're then known as a Tennessee maneuver.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, Camp Forest was a very important military establishment.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
It has gone as you may know and our engineering development centers

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
occupy as much of the same territory, but we welcome you back to Tennessee

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
whenever you can come.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Thank you, sir.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
And Colonel Marshall, tell us something about the Tom Bigby Waterway.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
Show us where it starts and where it goes to and a little bit about the history of it if you would.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
Well, sir, the Tennessee Tom Bigby is known now as designed to connect the Tom Bigby River

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
with the Tennessee River.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
This route has been considered for many years.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
The early French settlers looked at the divide just below the Tennessee

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
and hoped to build a canal to the south in order to connect the Tennessee River with the Gulf.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Now, the Tom Bigby River comes up to about where this arrow is.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Is that correct?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Yes, sir.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
The natural stream terminates it about this area and then we would go into a canal type operation.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
As I recall back in the 1870s, the Corps of Engineers actually recommended the building

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
of a Charlotte Channel connecting the Gulf with the Tennessee River.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes, sir.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
In 1875, the Corps of Engineers rendered a report to the Congress indicating that a four foot channel

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
could be constructed essentially along this alignment at the cost of them as only $1,700,000.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Yes, sir.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
Another pick-up deck was built here, I believe, about 1935 or six.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yes, sir.

03:46.000 --> 03:55.000
And that is toward the Chattanooga from the, where the canal, where the waterway would enter.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
And with that high water that does make it possible for water to come down to the ten locks

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
of the Tennessee Tom Bigby waterway.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yes, sir.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
Just like Gattu and the Lake on the top of Panama Canal, it makes it possible.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yes, sir.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
The fact that Pickwick Pool is available and has an adequate supply of water which could be

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
diverted to the canal will permit the operation of these various locks.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
And in fact makes it canal much more feasible.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
I was in the House of Representatives at the time back in 1946 when the Tennessee Tom Bigby

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
was approved by the Congress in that year.

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
And then I believe that there was some restudy, a preparation for a restudy of 1956 or if the

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
engineers didn't make a restudy about that time.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
That's correct, sir.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
There was some debate and perhaps some doubts regarding the economic aspect of the project.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
And so we were directed to undertake a restudy of the economics which we have recently finished.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
And what is the report, the economics of this great development?

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, fundamentally, as in all our projects, the determination was made of the total cost

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
of the project.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
It's about $250 million, a little more than that.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
And then based on the 50-year, expected at least 50-year, expected economic life of the project,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
an annual cost was determined.

05:29.000 --> 05:38.000
An annual cost of about $12 million and compared to that annual cost, an annual benefit was also determined.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
And we then found that the benefit exceeded the cost and therefore that it was in fact an economically justifiable project.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
And how much traffic on the waterway view in this state will be the average over a period of 50 years?

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
About $12 million, a little over $12 million per year, sir.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
Now the details as I understand that how deep will the waterway be?

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
It will be a nine-foot project initially throughout its length.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
In constructing the 10 locks which you mentioned earlier, we will provide for 13 foot depths

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
in the later life of the project traffic warrant construction to that added depth.

06:23.000 --> 06:33.000
But fundamentally it will provide for a nine-foot navigable waterway, a varying widths 150 feet in some sections and wider in others.

06:33.000 --> 06:45.000
Yes, but eventually if it needed to be done, it could be a 13 foot depth and the blocks will be built so as to accommodate traffic with 13 foot depths.

06:45.000 --> 06:56.000
Then we will have a slack waterway from the Oehaw River near Perduca.

06:56.000 --> 07:05.000
Of course this is the Tennessee Lake, sometimes it's called the Kentucky Lake but related part in Tennessee is a slack water lake.

07:05.000 --> 07:16.000
And then the slack water all the way down to the go so that the barges and ships can go either way to the Oehaw in slack waters that...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
That's fundamentally correct, yes.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
If they want to go up the Tennessee to Knoxville, the water, of course the river is navigable and the water is comparatively slack.

07:26.000 --> 07:40.000
Then of course there is a canal between the Kentucky Lake and the Cumberland Barclay Lake on the Cumberland River which will make it available for traffic on the Cumberland.

07:40.000 --> 07:49.000
Now what will be shipped down the canal largely and figuratively economic benefits, Colonel Marshall?

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
We have predicted based on comparison of rates and market areas, areas, growth of population and the other factors.

07:59.000 --> 08:10.000
We predict a considerable movement of middle-western grains either to the Gulf and to southerly markets or perhaps to the Alabama Mississippi Georgia area.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
This would be feed grains primer or food grains that people have farmers in Tennessee who are absolutely.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
We also visualize that there is a potential movement of coal from Tennessee to markets in the south.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
Primarily the markets would be in the steam generation of electricity.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
Perhaps in Florida or even places that are where they use gas at the present time?

08:38.000 --> 08:48.000
Yes sir, Florida right now is a large consumer of Tennessee and Kentucky coal for its generation of electricity.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
We visualize that coal will remain competitive in that area.

08:53.000 --> 09:06.000
As we all know there is a great deal of coal in the Cumberland section of Kentucky and Tennessee which we hope will be subject to being barged on the Cumberland River.

09:07.000 --> 09:17.000
This east and middle Tennessee section has a great deal of coal so there is northern Alabama and of course western Kentucky is rich in coal.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
So you do envision a great deal of coal traffic down to the Gulf.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Very great potential yes sir.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
And then how about from the Gulf back north among the waterway?

09:29.000 --> 09:40.000
Apparently a waterway of this nature inherently lends itself to the movement of both commodities and probably the most significant is petroleum products.

09:40.000 --> 09:52.000
Well what of course benefit consumers along the waterway by virtue of less expensive transportation of heating fuels and gasoline?

09:52.000 --> 10:03.000
And there is also a potential and a predictable movement of fertilizers from the Caribbean and Florida area to the north.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Foss space and things that sort.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
So it is going to be one of the great important waterways in our country.

10:12.000 --> 10:32.000
The colonel as you know they good people along the Mississippi and Memphis, Vicksburg and New Orleans have now joined in recommending the development of the Tom Day because they do not feel that it meant the end that is going to interfere with the good traffic that they have on the Mississippi rivers.

10:32.000 --> 10:53.000
I think so sir I think Mississippi the state of Mississippi Alabama Tennessee and more recently Kentucky have joined together and formed an authority and this authority enhanced Mississippi and the other states recognized the advantage the flexibility and the cheap transportation that is afforded by this waterway.

10:53.000 --> 11:09.000
Yes there is a comeback between the states of Mississippi Alabama Tennessee and Kentucky and perhaps some other which was approved by Congress and they do have an association that has been very effective in pushing the Tom Day be waterway.

11:09.000 --> 11:35.000
The colonel I know this isn't a budget because your report didn't come to the Congress in time or to be or rather to the administration in time or to be put in the budget but it is my understanding that you can efficiently expand or your capability of expending for the next year, next fiscal year is a million dollars in advance planning for this waterway.

11:35.000 --> 11:55.000
Actually our planning is pretty well along so it would not only permit the completion of some added detail plans but actual construction could be initiated at the we would start at the most southerly the Gainesville Lock which is this area.

11:55.000 --> 12:07.000
And so that if we get the million dollars as we hope to and on the appropriations committee we are working for it for this next fiscal year you can actually begin some construction.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
That's correct sir.

12:08.000 --> 12:21.000
I understand that this may be a place where atomic energy will be used to good advantage in the blasting and the moving of dirt it may be necessary as part of the contemplation.

12:21.000 --> 12:36.000
This project does lend itself to the peaceful application of nuclear energy particularly in the section known as the divide cut which is just south of the Tennessee River.

12:36.000 --> 13:05.000
In this area the depth of cut is approximately 150 feet and by use of nuclear explosives detonated below the surface with no fallout or other radiation problems this excavation could be constructed at a cost at least 10% less expensive than if conventional excavation methods were used.

13:05.000 --> 13:34.000
So we do hope that the current test series and perhaps subsequent test series will provide the engineering and safety information necessary for us to more accurately determine these costs based on current information we are confident that it is feasible to employ nuclear explosives in this area.

13:34.000 --> 13:52.000
Well ladies and gentlemen I know that you've enjoyed having this explanation of this great new imaginative and wonderful project that's going to come our way by the explanation that's been made by Colonel Marshall and we thank you very much for being with us today my pleasure sir.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
Until next to the program that's all for now.
