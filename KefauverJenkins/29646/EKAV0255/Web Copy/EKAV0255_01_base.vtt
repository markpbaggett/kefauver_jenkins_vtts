00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The intervention was done with cylinder room exchange.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Is that right, son?

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Mr. Chairman, it is still in the room,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
and it's just as it is today.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
As far as I know, no one in my staff has ever used any

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
impropagnes to get any influence from Mr. Shine.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I believe Mr. McKaycee,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
and may I ask you for those telephone

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
suits you gave us the other day?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
I think, I think, over a significant first.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
I may see you, maybe,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
maybe available center, I'm sorry we don't have them at this

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
particular moment.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Can I proceed?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yes, please.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay, let's go to the office now and try this.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Okay.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
If there are any further statements on here,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
you'd get to make it this time now,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
and I assume there are life questions.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Now that you have those telephone suits before you?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
No, that's a particular time.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Not a particular time.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Now, something you go further in this letter,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
and the next thing you say,

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
this way, of course,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
have a right to do this individual.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
If you're idea now,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
how can I do that?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Mr. Cohen, you see,

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
please, counsel.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Mr. Carr, you see,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
some thousand thousand,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
there's a record you say.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Have a right to, from time to time,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
in a dean with the president of the Army and the secretary

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Mr. Steven, on behalf of China,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
if they did, it was individual.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
First, first, Mr. Mr....

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Now, then, let's take your time to that day.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
He says, I guess you know,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
and then make an explanation.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes, I will.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
What can mean? Is that life?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I will have to, yes, you know.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
And then I'll tell you,

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
because there's no other...

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Now, what is the answer?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
This is the answer, is it no?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
First, Mr. Duncan,

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
can you ask a question,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
in which facts are not an record?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I must correct you.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
There's no evidence.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Number one, Mr. Carr, ever intervene.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
There's a plan...

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Let me read the question.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Let me read the question.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
This way, of course,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
have a right to do this individual.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Now, do you mean the fact?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
That's the fact.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
That they had a right to do the same set forth in...

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
The first sentence of your letter to whip.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Any reason we were department in behalf of a farmer's house

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
in southern David China.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Like, do you mean Mr. Corn and Mr. Carr?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Other members of his house had a right to do that.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
We have to do this individual.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Now, Senator, I think...

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
The answer is...

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes, the answer is yes.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes, anybody has a right to do it.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
And then I...

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
At this point, Mr. Duncan,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
reads the...

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Into the record a recommendation...

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Of an individual who holds a position much higher than...

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Mr. Corn and Mr. Carr.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Mr. W. Dender, the Dean of Carbury College.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
May I read his recommendation?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I think you can call this intervention.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I think nothing improper about it.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
He says, I'm very happy to recommend Mr. Gerard David China

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
for a commission in the US Navy.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I've known David for almost ten years.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
He was a student of Philip's Academy and over...

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
When I taught there before I was in the Navy in the last war.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I had him for a year in one of my American history classes...

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And saw a great deal of him at that time.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Since then, I have seen him as a student of Harvard.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I came back to Harvard in 1945...

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And he was under my jurisdiction until he's graduation years...

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Or last summer.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I believe that he has exceptionally strong qualifications...

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
For a naval officer.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
He has developed greatly in the last few years...

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
And has now a person of unusual maturity and thoughtfulness.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
There's no question whatsoever...

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Of his integrity or of his loyalty to the United States.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
His greatest talent lies in the field of business management.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I know of no person of his age...

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Who has as much business ability as he has.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
He has a very orderly mind...

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
A capable of understanding complicated problems...

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And of working out practical solutions to them.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
He has an unusual amount of initiatives and imaginations...

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
About affairs and has I think a promising future ahead of him.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
He is a good judge of human beings...

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
And can work well with others.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
From the point of view of reliability...

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Intelligence, energy, initiatives...

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I can imagine few people...

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Better qualified for an officer's commission.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I say this on the basis of many discussions...

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
With him and along with friendship.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I recommend him strongly and without reservations.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
From the early years, W.J. Bender, D. D. Farber's Law College...

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
And I read...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
You know, Farber College.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
May I say this to the Senkans I read that in...

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Just to...

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And to turn them into a statement about the field of anyone...

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
As they write to recommend any other individual for a commission...

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
If he thinks that individual is qualified in so long...

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
As he does not exert any improper pressures...

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
And there were no improper pressures with him.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Does it mean you read the letter from the man in no way connected...

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
With any branch of the government of the United States of America?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I don't think he's connected with the government.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Here's top of courses.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
A part of the legislative branch of the government isn't it?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I think that's right.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
How Senator W.O.C. was the secretary of the Army...

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Mr. Steven Darmist Adam's example.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
To differentiate between a caller, a talker, a request...

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
On the part of Mr. Gorn and Mr. Carr...

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
In their official capacity.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
And in their individual or private capacity.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
How could he do it? How would he know?

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Simply because I told him repeatedly...

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
That by all my...

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Anyone my committee had a right approach to a five-per-commission.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Anyone my committee who had any knowledge of what an individual...

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Had not only the right for the duty to transmit the information...

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
To the proper authority.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
I told him, when I called again to lean over backwards...

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
He had not given any commissions to China...

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
And that he was dead, certainly, as entitled to it...

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So that there was no question whatsoever...

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
And Mr. Steven's mind, Mr. Cohn, I agree with that.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
Mr. Cohn, as far as I know, his conversation...

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
As far as I know, there was no...

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Special considerations.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
And as far as I know, there was no question whatsoever...

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
There was no question whatsoever.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I was curious, no one was going to be...

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
No, no.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Carr, you talk to the secretary.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
When Mr. Cohn or you are Mr. Carr...

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Any member of your staff talk to the secretary or the chancellor...

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
Any of you as far as you know, say now, Mr. Steven...

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
We're not here officially.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Not here, the United States, none of it.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
My...

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I think the council is not here in that capacity...

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
But we're here as individuals.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Was whatever done to you and Ollie?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Mr....

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Uh...

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I think when I thought to the secretary...

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I made it very clear I was taking a term of the committee...

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I made it very clear...

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And I just hit your feet just over and over...

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
That's because of that, I wanted him to lean over backwards...

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
And not give any considerations to Mr. Cohn...

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Mr. Carr as far as the testimony is concerned...

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Never spoke to Mr. Steven about this matter...

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And I think that...

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I think the best testimony on this with Mr. Jenkins...

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Is Mr. Steven's own testimony...

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Under all...

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
I'm saying 53-11 when he says all his conversation about...

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Cohn's thing to get the special consideration for Cohn...

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Is greatly exaggerated and the fact he says there's nothing to it.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Now when the secretary says that...

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I personally agree with this...

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
I believe he says that the senator is a cheap soul to take a day and that doesn't.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
On the seven occasions to lean over backwards...

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
To lean a thing for Cohn...

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Is that right?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I told the secretary specifically on the...

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
The date of the breakfast and the sign of the party...

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I told him...

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
In a letter, it's essentially the same thing, whatever you have before you...

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Uh...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Well, that's not...

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I think that's not about the current...

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Let me call your attention to the specific times when your late sir Tony Mac.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
May not, October.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
May 25-03 is the record.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
When you wait until I get the last minute...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
It's three seconds.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
That's 25-03.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
The senator is looking up this material and why we have the opportunity, but...

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh wait, maybe I've got it here.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Reading senator.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Wait, wait just one second.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
May 25-03.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Now we have him.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
He made a remark to the effect that time was not as much use to the committee...

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And was only interested in being photographed...

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
And that he hoped that nothing would happen to interfere with the processes of the draft...

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
And that time would be drafted.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Now you are a late sir by much Adams to have said...

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
As early as October 15th...

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
That you hope time would be drafted.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Now that's number one on your party if that occurs.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Is that a curse, senator?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
That is finally asking for a special consideration.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
But what I understand, I'm reviewing the number of times in which you're asking them to lean over backwards...

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And maybe if you say doing kind and injustice...

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Uh...

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
You've got a curse, senator.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Then you pick the position.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
That time just sees the same segment as any other boy.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Is that right?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
The position of the scientist should receive only what he was entitled to.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
There it is.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
And I want to step further and as I say I may have been unfair to Dave and this...

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
And I suggested that he lean over backwards.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
That means that in a fact, if there was any doubt...

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
But he not to give him the benefit of the doubt.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I did that however in the presence of Dave's time...

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
He agreed with me, otherwise I would not have done it.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Now I will prove you that it did defeat 25-29 of the record.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And the kids keep in mind he is still...

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
After all these promotions, after all the special considerations...

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
He is still a fighter.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I understand that.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
I'm asking you to refer to page 25...

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
...but in I as a record.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
And were you asking a question about 25 or three...

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
The question was...

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
...Sendir as a statement was that...

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
...albaticism, as early as October 15th...

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
...you were telling Adam...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
...not to do anything for sound.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Uh...

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't think that I ever told...

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
...like I'm sure I never told Adam that I hope Dave would be drafted.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Well you just just stayed with him, I think, on that occasion.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And indicated that he wanted nothing special done for him.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Is that right?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I think that's very well.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I think that's...

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I haven't been proceeding senators November 3rd.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Take 25-29 of the record.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
25-29.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
In which?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm Adam Says this.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm quite sure it was not a telephone call.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
But Senator McCarthy said to me that he did not feel that...

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
...this February duty for China was a good thing.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
That he felt that people...

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
...members of the President might be critical.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I still was him.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
A critical was China, a mythical...

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
...our list committee.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Mike's in cities it was a form of...

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
...preparations of seats.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
And he would prefer...

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
...and he asked if I had a range.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
They have a separate duty schedule.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
That's...

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
...the second time now Senator that she's taken a position.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
With the data...

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
...that you wanted nothing in the way of preferences done for days, I...

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
...next for the rest of the...

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Then on November 7th, the third time...

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
...when you call the secretary of the Army and the call was monitored...

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
...you in that conversation with messages of nothing be done, please.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
That's correct, isn't it?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
You're not correct.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Then Senator...

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
...honor about December 17th.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
You're led to have recommended a member of your staff...

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
...for intervening for China according to the testimony of Godhead.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
I'll ask you whether or not you took the same position on December 17th...

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
...you said it before taking the issue.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
That is if you wanted nothing done for China.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I never recommended any member of the staff...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
...because I didn't think that...

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
...but I think you take the position at that time on that day...

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
...September 17th.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I think you wanted him to have the same treatment as any other...

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
...private in the Army out of house.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I think I'm not the official Mr. Jenkins at all times...

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
...including that 70th day of September.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
And that would take...

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
...senatured by the count...

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
...at least four different times in this record...

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
...that you took that attitude.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
A little trick.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Send him a car safe fire, which is necessary for you and United States.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
The staffs, the party, is a record...

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
...and you are a mission at least...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
...four times...

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
...to the Department of the Army...

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
...to stressing them to do nothing...

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
...that would be considered...

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
...to the Department of Statement for China...

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
...if you didn't know and have certain knowledge...

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
...that efforts on the part of Dumbloty...

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
...perhaps members of your staff were being made...

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
...to the Department of the Army to get the opportunity for that.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I think Mr. Laird explained the letter already...

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
...and the result of that...

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
...well, sorry, it's my...

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
...the twenty-three...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
...one-eighths and twenty-three...

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
...so the staff will make long before we letter...

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
...the staffs will make twenty-four seconds...

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
...with explain letter briefly.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
As far as the monitor...

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
...we got to take some separately.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
As far as the monitor, four hundred sites of concerns...

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
...I had decided that, let it be unwise...

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
...they have given temporary duty with my committee.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
I felt I'd to tell the secretary of the atmosphere...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
...and I had discussed that matter.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
The family, the conversation with the Adam...

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
...and the trustee of other and up...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
...he should get the ID with the committee...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
...and I thought he said, nah...

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
...uh...

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
...that's been a lot of the other...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
...the other occasion that I'd recommended someone...

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
...that that's better than true.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I did not recommend that...

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
So, if you said that I'll let it be...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
...you'd say that if you wanted no preferences...

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
...you'd not let it be.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
No, I...

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
...I said that to Dr. Duncan of you...

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
...I don't want to get close to you, but to record those two...

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
...I said that at all times...

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
...I say to the position...

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
...that no one in my committee...

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
...that I'll be with the military science...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
...and get no special treatment.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
This is the position I take.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Period.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
But Senator, my question is...

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
...five of us is meant to say that...

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
...you have five days you on these occasions...

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
...that we have just...

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
...good times of year.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
The Parliament of the Army is three days...

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
...secondary, it's councillor...

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
...and not all these basic occasions say not here.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
The kind of just...

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
...another bar of these don't do anything...

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
...how the ordinary sector frames.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
No, no, no.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Senator, if you do that and you find it necessary...

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
...advisable to do that...

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
...if you didn't know...

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
...that Mr. Conor's done about it...

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
...it's putting a little too much pressure...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
...on the army to get something...

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
...how we ought to make them for this fall.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm about to tell you.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Well, that's what I want you to do.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I'll find it over again, Mr. Duncan.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
We've got to take the instance...

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
...one by one, the first one...

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
...over in the China Five-Planterns...

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
...there are students brought up another of our commissioners.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I'm a fan of mute.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I had to give him my position.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I did that.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
The next time when I talked to the madam...

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
...about not having...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
...signifying the temporary duty...

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
...it was because they had a funding...

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
...to CAD with my committee.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Temporary duty with my committee.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I discussed that Mr. Sine was the tone...

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
...we decided that was unwise.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Either I asked mute and not tell him...

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
...or getting the facts to let.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
The other...

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
...based with you mentioned...

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
...in December 17th.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Nothing occurred on that date.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
So, you know, not that out.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Now, what did the third...

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
...I think the third was the latter.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I'd explain that in full.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Tell you.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
You see, Mr. Duncan, I...

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
...as Chairman of the committee...

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
...of Mr. Duncan's firm, Mr. Adams...

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
...bring up a matter.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I had no choice but to...

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
...tell him how I...

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
...tell him about it and I did that.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
There's nothing secret about it.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
It's not that I don't know.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I don't know.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I don't know.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I don't know.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I don't know.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I don't know.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You were doing it in self defense.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
You know, I was.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Well, you say, Senator, that you did that...

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
...that on every occasion, if you ever talked to Mr. Sine...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
...the Miss Adams.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
You said, do not favor this by.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
And as I understand it, now you're telling the members of the committee...

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
...that Mr. Steven's and Mrs. Adams initiated a proposition...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
...of doing something out of the ordinary.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
You thought the hammer, right about that?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Well, I learned, for example, Mr. Steven was told Mr. Sine...

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
...and telling you the stuff he was looking for...

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
...from a Priceless Landland find.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I didn't like that.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I felt that was improper.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And I had no choice but to make that known...

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
...Mr. Adams and Mrs. Sine.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
When Mr. Adams said he brought up the question of...

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
...the day of drafts in the subway...

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
...I couldn't stand mute.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I thought it was to be drafted.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
He should do it as any other young man.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Just the logic Lancers.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Mr. Steven's over in the Sine Fortale...

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
...rather in the World War Fortale...

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
...brought up the question of a commission.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I either couldn't mute.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Or told him I felt.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
I told him I felt.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And I called him over and made sure he was standing there.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
That was, that was his early September 60th.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
I think that was the day.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
In the World War Fortale, the Shines of the Black...

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
...and the hero of the...

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
...Mr. Steven's brought up the subject, I did not.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'll do it in the subway in the subway station.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Is that what I said?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
In the subway also, Mr. Adams brought up the subject.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I did not.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
And you can't excuse me for answering them, Mrs. Sine.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
I can't handle them.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I'm not accusing you of anything.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm really asking you for the facts with reference to the...

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
...the subject because they think that...

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
...you will recall the Secretary said to them...

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
...on his acute order the subject of the commission...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
...for Shines on September 16th.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
You say that didn't happen.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
That is a completely incorrect statement.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I am his secretary himself.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Robert Steven.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I mean, I'm right.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
This is in the Shines of the Black...

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
...in September 16th that they shined in a commission.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Mr. Steven, Mr. Steven, so we don't appear to accuse him of poetry...

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
...Mr. Steven said that he was very hazy...

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
...about the conversation that morning.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I am not hazy about it.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Mr. Steven brought up the subject of Shines...

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
...and I don't want to go over the conversation again.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I don't want to go over the conversation again.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
But Mr. Steven brought up the subject.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
The usual column meeting with Mr. Steven...

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
...is on January 14th at the Cal Army.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Senator, what's the meeting with Mr. Steven?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
On January 14th.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
That's the...

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
...before he left for the parties for the...

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
...I...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Yes, I recall that meeting.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Senator, I call your attention to the facts that Mr. Steven...

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
...that's the facts.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
But what you give me the facts is...

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Based number 390, I'm tired.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
That's the Secretary of the Army, Mr. Fad...

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
...before this committee.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
That a Fad meeting of January 14th, 1954, to Cal Army.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
Senator, I'm a cardin, the course of this meeting...

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
...and I'm meeting Mervaigum.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
On four five occasions.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Senator, I'm a cardin, about as a question of whether or not...

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
...saving time could be a time in New York City...

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
...when his training was over.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Is that the courage, Senator MacArthur?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
No, not at not at the court.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Did you ask?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
That's 60-pound one-pound.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
The fact is, there's four or five times a week.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
But would you wait one minute for my rate this month?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Take 390.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
If you wait one minute for my rate, the market's called...

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
...and Steven's called me that day to come out.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
That's the number card they've called, Steven.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Senator MacArthur is looking through his notes at the moment...

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
...on the left, Mr. Car and the right, Mr. Car.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
In the background, to the left, Senator, Mr. Jim Juliana, has that meant...

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
...to be on the right.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Yes, I do. I'm the readingist, one of its all, on the same day...

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
...to play all the fighting mind.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
The question is, did I ask him to assign a day-time New York...

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
...the answer to this note?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
That is no.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Did you ask him one round?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
No, I'm not asking.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
No, Mr. Steven's asked to see me that day.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I did not ask him.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
But just so there's no question about this New York thing.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Mr. Car, Bob Steven's that day, talking about the...

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
...principles of the quarries, principally the question of how they're not really...

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
...dysent and are falling as the...

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
...wallyboard, while he was away, I told him we couldn't...

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
...and we wouldn't hurt him anyway.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
He did bring up the question of the inconvenience of the committee...

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
...of having to head down to see David at the camp.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Are you talking about, I don't get you, I have 14 people.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
I'm January 14th, I believe the camp board...

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
...nerdicts that are unaware of them.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
And he asked what I thought the day...

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
...would be of most benefits.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
I told him that I thought they would have to follow the usual...

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
...astitute tests and decide that themselves.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
He brought up the question of our investigation of...

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
...Army Intelligence, the textbook.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
And we discussed the possibility, the wisdom...

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
...of they're having a team.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
We agreed that it had to be headed by an officer at the Fish and Ranks...

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
...so we'd have access to all the materials.

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
And he suggested, I agree with him, that...

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
...if they could get 15 20 young men who were competent and sealed...

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
...to make a survey of the Army War Colleagues.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I told him about the various complaints we had about...

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
...the use of the coming to flying material.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
We are Army War Colleagues, type of lecturers...

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
...type of indoctrination material we had complaints about...

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
...give me examples of that.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
So, while we are very little on what points we had...

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
...some complaints about that by anything about that...

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
...and we just had a general discussion about...

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
...otherness, Ray couldn't do that themselves...

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
...without arguing it and he suggested that...

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
...he prompted you to stay in that particular type of work.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
And I said to him, and he agreed to be...

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
...I said to him that if he did...

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
...he had to be very, very careful not to appear to be...

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
...creating any forced birth for Dave Shine...

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
...because it would be misunderstood...

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
...it would be bad for the committee, bad for us...

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
...and the names of New York watching him...

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
...west point Army War Colleagues always mentioned...

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
...I made no request that Dave be assigned any flight.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Period. The only request I made was...

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
...that rather advice I gave to Secretary was that...

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
...he made very careful and handling anyone from my committee...

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
...so it wouldn't appear that...

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
...we were using our committee to get any...

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
...sputial considerations for him.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
As we understand it now, the very worst of the...

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
...specissary testimony is to...

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
...he suggested that Shine be assigned...

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
...to New York A.R. perhaps elsewhere...

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
...in that meeting on January 14th and not to be.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Is that correct now, Senator MacKythe?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Uh, it's the door beyond that.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
It's still in the federal New York area.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
How do you want the committee to see...

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
...the conversation about Kythe?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I don't think it had to do with New York so much...

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
...the first few inflations are all in the area.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Senator, those as we can get along...

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
...you say that positively and definitely...

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
...you did not ask the Secretary of the Army...

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
...to assign these kinds of New York A.R.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
So if you didn't ask him even one time, is that right?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
That is correct.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
But the subject of assignment for Shine was...

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
...the suspect that's correct.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
That is correct.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And that's the Secretary of the Army initiated.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
That's the second.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
That is correct.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
That is correct.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
The Secretary is not asking you to evaluate...

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
...his testimony in his packet, either.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I think the Secretary of the Ministry initiated the time...

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
...subject in his testimony.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Senator...

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
...you will call the testimony of Mr. Adams...

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
...with respect to the meeting in New York apartment...

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
...of January 23rd.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I recall his testimony...

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
...that out on page 26, 21 of the records.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
And in which he says that on that occasion...

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
...on the number of occasions...

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
...day leaving the Senator's rescatement...

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
...is inquired to why we didn't assign Shine to New York...

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
...and on to a three occasions.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
He accepted the extractic commitment from the meeting...

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
...that effect.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Did that happen, Senator?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
No, it's not.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
What's that?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
It's not bad.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Nothing.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
No substance in that room.
