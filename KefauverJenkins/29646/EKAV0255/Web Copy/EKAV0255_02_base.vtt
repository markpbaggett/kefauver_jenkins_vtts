WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Eight, eight to General Rebirth.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I heard his first morning.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
It's General Ryan's turn.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Thank you, sir.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
You got it, correct?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm paid to you reading from now, uh, Duncan.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
35, 09.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
35, 09.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
That's what I have left.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I wonder if it's very much important.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Let me give this back.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Get a good pile of nothing.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
I desire to see the mattresses or leads from this young man,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
born testimony introduced in this case.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Starting at the bottom of page 35,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
oh, wait, do you have the record?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm sorry, I'm sure you will correctly read it.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
We've been inbound at a proximity,

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
approximately four-part, or 430, in the afternoon of 9 January.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I returned to my quarters,

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
and my wife told me that I had a phone call from Mr. Coney,

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
New York City, and without being calling back.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I call Mr. Coneback.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
And we got into a discussion which later turned into an argument

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
about private, shiny, mean, homestead payments.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Did we get there from time of the Duncan Ryan on a radio?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I wonder if you could allow me to do so, please.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
That was a plan, I don't know if you look for it.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
On 10 January, we dismissed the terminology used in the agreement

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
that we had.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I told Mr. Coneback's administration to put private channel on TC

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
and they made the regimental commanders.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
And that the division's rendered general Ryan was completely

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
cognizant of the rat life.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
I told Mr. Coneback we considered TC part of private time changes,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
and that as far as we were concerned,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
he was not going to get all TC on same January.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Mr. Coneback was called in the green with me by the way.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Before and throughout, he said to some people,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
and I want to call your attention list,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
particularly Senator McCarthy,

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Mr. Coneback said to some people as poor dicted and they cooperated.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Mr. Coneback, and Lieutenant Miller,

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
had made things especially difficult for private time,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
and that he missed the Cone at a very long memory

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
and was never going to forget their names.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Now Senator, you heard the testimony of this young officer

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
about the Army.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And the little testimony?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
In which he's for, that's your chief counsel,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
make those statements, that's your senator.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Well, they're not, you have this just,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
it's just the first time that I'm going to do that you had ever heard.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
The testimony statement,

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
such a conversation I didn't see between Mr. Cone and this young man, Brown.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
I think that was, I can reason with Mr. Coneback.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Right here on the Whitney's fan, several days ago, several weeks ago,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
it seems to me. Right.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Any there, have you talked to Mr. Cone about that thing?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
No, I have not. You have not?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Except when I cross the mission of Stan.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
You have not made any inquiry of a nice to the Senator Paul for the exact statement?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
No, I heard him testify of the Paul.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I was found in the infest of fire.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I was found in the infest of fire.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Didn't you hear him testify?

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
That he might have said that in substance.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I did say it in substance.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
But his explanation was that he had heard that Colonel Ringard

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
had made his statement remark about this committee or his prejudice as worse.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Or it made some statement indicating that Ringard was not altogether a lawyer of the American citizen.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Don't you remember that sentence?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't believe that's a correct resume.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
He had a testimony with Christian Gettys.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I recall his testimony as well as that.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
He had heard Ringard.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I remember the word.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Ringard, Ringard, referred to the sculpture coming up.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
That's the dragon which was...

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes.

04:20.000 --> 04:34.000
Mr. Cohn told me that he had heard that Mr. Ringard had been referring to the coming of the exposure of witch hunts and condemning them.

04:34.000 --> 04:46.000
When it got less, Mr. Cohn agreed with me that there were too much work to do to do with that matter.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
But we should run a name check on him to see what's the thing that was on Ringard's recall.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
It turned up negative and it was...

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
We named it as negative, I believe.

04:59.000 --> 05:11.000
Mr. Cohn ever told you why he told this young officer that he was long remembered the name of his company commander Luke Sendinag, Captain Miller.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
He told me only, Stan, here on the road, and I'm fully satisfied with his testimony.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
What was it he said on the stand here under the road?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Not Miller, not Ringard Miller.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Mr. Dengons, I would not try to recap his testimony.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I think that's the...

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I think it's written here in the record.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
If you wanted I will dig it up.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I'll find dig it up to this.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I'm asking Senator May 8th to see if they get up.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Because I don't want to miss Christmas to come.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
What's that that's right, Senator?

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
In the life of all that it occurred before these not-

05:57.000 --> 06:07.000
Mr. Dengons number one, you're asking me about phone conversations about the time you know nothing except what I've heard here on the stand.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
I am satisfied with Mr. Cohn's testimony.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I would not consider this testimony even remotely as a spell.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Which young man's boy here, the 8th, who got her in line?

06:21.000 --> 06:29.000
That conversation, that statement, that I will long, that alone member.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
I will long remember the names of Ringard Miller.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
He says that occurred in the conversation.

06:37.000 --> 06:47.000
But had some of us linked with an argument between him and Mr. Cohn overshined doing KPGT.

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
Mr. Dengons, if I didn't have absolute complete confidence in Mr. Cohn, he would not be my chief counsel.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I have complete confidence in him.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
I have confidence in him telling the absolute truth the other day when he explained that conversation.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And beyond that I can give you no further information.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I wasn't there.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
I know nothing further about it.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
If he can point out something improper that Mr. Cohn did after that, he can point out that Mr. Cohn called.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Hey, which Mr. Cohn's not having called.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
If Mr. Cohn examined the which Mr. Cohn's not having examined him, if he did anything improper, then I'd be glad to hear that.

07:34.000 --> 07:43.000
I know of nothing improper that Mr. Adam, Mr. Steven, appointed up Mr. Cohn's part, except that Mr. Adam of the stand.

07:43.000 --> 07:56.000
He said that Mr. Cohn did not succeed in getting McCarthy's to call off the Sputinas for the memories of the Royalty Borg.

07:56.000 --> 08:07.000
And Mr. Cohn knows that Mr. Cohn knows and all the memories of the Sputians, sure know that that is one thing that I have self had to be done.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
There's no one to get me to call it off except the majority vote of the Committee.

08:13.000 --> 08:23.000
That's the only way, that's the only way the exposure, the exposure of those who have been covering up for Communists can be called off.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
If the Committee votes that I must call it off, I don't know, choice, I sincerely hope they will not do that.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
So, if you refer to your Memamam them all, December 17th.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Yes, sir, I read before you.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yes, sir.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Now, as I understand the city senator before you, let me ask you this question.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Under me, I have your thinking, Mr. Cohn.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
The time that suggested him is faith in him.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, this violent argument that is in sync between Mr. Cohn and Mr. Adams on December 17th.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Today the automobile will be right in New York City.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
We are in this, an argument over General Lawton, Mr. Cohn.

09:08.000 --> 09:23.000
And Adam was the signing as the reason General Lawton was to be relieved of his command was on the sound of what the fact that he had made certain soft speeches about certain colleges or youths.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Is that correct?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Oh, not speeches.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
So, say a thought.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Okay, say a thought.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yes.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
The sponsor of the der...

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I thought I remembered that correctly.

09:35.000 --> 09:45.000
And I want to read to you an excerpt from this Memamamam of December 17th.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
And I'm reading that part of it which is printed on three styles.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
You'll see.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
I was the Army's compilation of these Memamamamamamamam.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
The mission is calling in Cardiff and Senate No. 30, 187, 176, and 186.

10:01.000 --> 10:11.000
In talking to John Adams, today I learned the General Lawton who you have called for operating the committee and the soldiers, the persons, the court, by the way.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
It's about the meeting with the English and the Canadian.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
I Christian Adams, we are currently on this in a friendly manner.

10:18.000 --> 10:34.000
And find that the only reason that he can deal with this lawton in dice to military by helping to make it possible for us to expose the incredibly bad security setup which has existed as Fort Monmouth.

10:34.000 --> 10:45.000
Senator McCarthy, here's the set, in direct, contradictions, argued testimony here yesterday under oath, noted.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
Didn't can get to the Senator McCarthy on that with the same testify.

10:51.000 --> 11:09.000
That's our Adam, arguing you or stating you and the members of your staff, that this consideration of a relieving lawton was to be given because of statement,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
that he has made about certain colleges and universities.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I think that's the correct.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And didn't you send a message to the committee?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I think it's the right way of testimony.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
Didn't you yesterday say, did you say it today, did you solve a complaint?

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Our federal government, I'm not John, you know those are not the reasons.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
The words did that affect.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I think that's the correct way of saying it.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
That's the correct statement.

11:35.000 --> 11:51.000
But in this memorandum of December 17th, you stated Adam told you that the only reason they were completing the relief of lawton was on account of his cooperation with your committee and his police.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm a prosecutor.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm a prosecutor.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm a prosecutor.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm a prosecutor.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm a prosecutor.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I'm a prosecutor.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I'm a prosecutor.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm a prosecutor.

12:07.000 --> 12:19.000
Mr. Jenkins, as I have discussed with my staff over and over, I never played any credence on the phony claim that they were going to break a general.

12:19.000 --> 12:28.000
Because at a secret service meeting, he mentioned that most of those were suspended in certain policies.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I knew that was completely phony.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I touched them John and detailed.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
And as I say in a friendly manner, they called trusting and discussed with him the only reason.

12:38.000 --> 12:48.000
The only reason I could find for their attempts to hold breaking of lawton was because he had cooperated with the...

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
...comity.

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
I think that if the set-offs Mr. Jenkins, at the time Mr. Lawton and executive section of an atom was rare.

12:57.000 --> 13:09.000
When asked why he didn't suspend the security risk of coming to the background, the previous place, he pointed at me and he said Mr. Chairman,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
you are the reason why we can do it now.

13:12.000 --> 13:21.000
And I did not put any of the phony, completely phony reasons, advanced in this memorandum because I knew them.

13:21.000 --> 13:35.000
I knew now that the only reason, the only reason why they were going to break general lawton was because he dared to work with us.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
I knew that they have claimed, they have claimed over and over.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
They have claimed here in the witness stand that they are going to break this land because they made some statements.

13:46.000 --> 13:55.000
And I emphasize that a secret staff meeting, that most of those whom were suspended because of coming to the background, came from Section Colleges.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
I discussed that with Mr. Adams, we admitted that that was a perfectly proper statement.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
There was nothing wrong with it.

14:01.000 --> 14:14.000
Nothing wrong when a general was discussing with his staff security problems to point out how many of those were suspended, came from ex-challets, how many from Waikahallets, how many from Z-challets.

14:14.000 --> 14:25.000
And Mr. Adams and I, phony files, he used the words that the reason was because of that speech.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
We understood each other fully. There was no question of Mr. Adams, my end.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
During my mind and them, now he is there in his mind, our mind now, Mr. Stankham.

14:35.000 --> 14:45.000
That Mr. Lotton would have been broken, would have been broken because of his cooperation and that's why they proposed to breaking.

14:45.000 --> 14:57.000
When I said this, remember on an incident we were dictated on the night of the 16th and apparently was 10 stars on the 17th from there for a day to the 17th.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Let us look at it at the 16th.

15:01.000 --> 15:09.000
You say the number I know of the February 15th.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
Mr. John Adams, I question that very closely on this independent manner.

15:17.000 --> 15:26.000
And that's the only reason that he can give his living, locked in and dice the military, they're hitting the possible first-sixfold.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
He's ready to be back to Katie, so that which has existed in the Board of Moderners for us.

15:31.000 --> 15:53.000
Yes, he is, Mr. Stankham. He stated that the reason that that's by Adam, that are the proposed relief of Lotton, was that he had made statements, thought, or arguments, or thinking about colleges and universities. That's the right thing.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That's right.

15:55.000 --> 16:03.000
You now say, as I understand the Senator, by way of an explanation, I say the plan was not for you today.

16:03.000 --> 16:15.000
The You now say, Senator, that Adams advanced both reasons as the motive on the part of the Secretary of the League, Lotton, to we it.

16:15.000 --> 16:23.000
That Lotton, Cooper, he's the Army number one. I love that Cooper, he's with your committees.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
And have talked too much about colleges and universities.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Mr. Adams, I have heard about that.

16:29.000 --> 16:39.000
Mr. Adams never admitted that he was being broken because he cooperate with the committee.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
But in questioning him, there was no doubt in his mind, there was no doubt in my mind.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
He knew that I knew exactly why he was being broken.

16:49.000 --> 16:57.000
John Adams knew that he was not trying to fool me. He was not trying to fool me.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
He knew that I knew exactly the reason why Lotton was to be broken.

17:03.000 --> 17:17.000
And we had predicted, my assay, long before that, in our right to New York with General Lotton, that the result of his cooperation would be that he would not get a promotion.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
We didn't know they would go for part of the break.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
All right, now that he's gone at him, he'd not stayed on that date.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
That the reason Lotton was going to be relieved was because of his cooperation with the committee. That's right.

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
John has remembered methods either on that date or any other date.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
To me personally, the rest of the time he has made a weird clear.

17:40.000 --> 17:49.000
He has made it very clear in our conversation that he realized how foamy this other excuse was.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
It was so foamy that I would not put that in a memorandum even.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
My staff knew, my staff knew, I knew that this staff meeting,

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
at which he made some remarkable certain colleges, had nothing to do with his being told.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
But he never admitted and never stated that the reason Lotton was being relieved was because he had cooperated with the committee.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Now that's right, isn't it, sir?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Nothing so many words.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Well, that's what he made his way.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
What was the four as I remember yesterday, if they picked the 157?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Send them a message.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
5157.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Bob, they're looking for the record.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Are you ready, Senator?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
I am very ready.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Now, will I have it?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
You mean bringing a ventilality?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I...

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Let me go as far as to say that.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
If Adam told me they were thinking of relieving him,

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
the reason he gave was not that he had cooperated with the committee.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
And that's what now I understand you, Mr. Dyn.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Better film, film, I don't know any better.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
That's the morning afternoon, Senator.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Let me read this one more time.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
And I think if you remember, it was a bit better than now, I don't know.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
No, I think the memory is pretty good on this subject.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
A lot of not-fits me that.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I question Mr. Adam, I'm eating from this.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
The memorandum of December 17th, from Newton, this one, this one, from God.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
I question Adam very closely on this in a friendly manner,

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
and find that he only means in this he can deal.

19:37.000 --> 19:44.000
And I think, and find that he only means in this he can deal.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
He is that lost and imbibed this in fact the military,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
they're heading to make it possible for us to expose him,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
set it at security set up to the position.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
Then there is that thing that John Adam gave as the reason.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
And gave, and the only reason he could give,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
while relieving this state's general.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
And one thing we would think of as the state.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
But as a fact, that he cooperated with the committee,

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
now Senator, he is that Matthew direct contradiction of your testimony.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Then I invite you here now to explain to this committee,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
why isn't it?

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
And as far as I know Mr. Chairman, that's the last session I get as the senator.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I'll go to the rest.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
So what we said, Mr. Jackson, as I think you know,

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
I assume you've written the memorandum of lawsuit already.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
When you find that the witness comes in and gives you a long story,

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
you're inviting a memorandum to your assistant, you do that.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
You evaluate it and you give what reasons the man gave or what he actually knows.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
That was my evaluation of his story to me at that time.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
It's serious.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
There's nothing at very present to change my mind on that.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
I gave my fast here in evaluations of my conversation with Adam

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
and the only reason.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
The only reason.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
And I feel he had Zlan.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
The only reason that I feel that he could give Zlan.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
But he has given up town.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
He has because he has cooperated with the committee.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
And what's the other reason because that person is memorandum.

21:35.000 --> 21:42.000
I do not now, I never have, with any questions.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
In the only claim that they were going to break,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
a man they described as a great general,

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
because at a thickness-fath meeting,

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
he mentioned where the communist that we found came from.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
And if there Adam in his conversation with me

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
admitted in effect, that would not be a valid reason.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
He bill persisted in claiming that was the reason.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
We went over this in detail.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
And I consider it as such important that I admit that

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
the tone of Mr. Lawson the following night.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
When I talked to Mr. Lawson, we gave him the reason.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
I believe the same as the same here.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I think I also made a full loss of the phony reason

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
to play advanced.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
The same and I have completed my throat examination

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
and that face to which it's good game.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Very well, I'm going to be 10 minutes and a little bit scared.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
I think it's 10 minutes.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
And well, that's half the time that I'm going to be taking

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
the most of the time, which is the usual time for the

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
new day recess.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
From the McCarthy, you have said several times in the hearing

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
and quite unsatisfying this morning.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
If you go to Mr. Adam's or Mr. Seasons,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
that the only way that you could ever be induced

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
to call off the hearing that's what Man-Maw would be

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
by a majority vote of your committee.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
We're taking, but you know other reasons.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm not a service for the record.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
That such a vote was never taken by the committee.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
I believe it was never even suggested to the committee

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
that it takes such a vote.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Is that correct?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
No, that's a incorrect.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
You suggest to the committee that we call off the hearing

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
that's what Man-Maw?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
No.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
No, we're right.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Unless I, unless I felt that it should be called off,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I would not make a motion if I'd be called off.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I thought you were talking about calling him on.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I'm talking about calling him on.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Oh, no, I would not make a motion.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I would not make a motion.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
Any honest who attached itself to the committee is correct.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
For your review.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I would not make a motion to call off the hearing

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
because I think it's persons that they continue.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
So by the way, we call there was no presentation

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
made to the committee about calling it off.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
No, it's just nothing about calling it off.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
No, message conveyed to somebody

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
had indicated that they should be called off.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
No, it was called off by the, well, correct.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So that by a vote of the committee.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Now it is true that neither at the time

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
while the Democrats were off in the committee,

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
nor at any time after they returned to the committee,

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
was there any ever votes taken by the committee

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
to call off the hearing?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
No, neither any votes nor any motion.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
A lot of things.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Very well.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
During the first part of these investigations,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
I think the record shows pretty clearly

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
that there is a considerable degree of cooperation

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
between the Army, Representative and Mr. Seen

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
and Mr. Adam, and by our committee represented primarily

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
by you and Mr. Coral and Mr. Carp.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
That they attended executive hearings.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
You can start with what I'm about different matters.

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
They supply different records, rather than different files.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I want to establish if I can just what in your opinion

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
disjoints that is a cooperation.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
A hundred a month, I seem to be,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I seem to have been a part of courage

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
to be a complete cooperation of Joseph,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
as long as we were only taking out the individual coming.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
When we started trying to get the information

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
as soon as responsible for the special statements

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
of a system amendment measure,

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
when we tried to find out why they owed

25:46.000 --> 25:53.000
a Truman Royalty board had reversed some 33 out of 35 cases

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
and some individuals back to the radar laboratories

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
with tremendous records.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
When we wanted to know who did that,

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
why they did it, get the reason for it,

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
find out whether it was because of an order from higher up

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
or because of sympathy on the part of those on the board.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
Then we ran into almost what you call a blank wall.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
Partly for purposes of establishing the record of the task,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
and partly for purposes of looking ahead.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
I want to ten point just as silly as the gentleman me asked

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
the first whether you agreed a combustible in which

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
it conducts an investigation of a situation

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
existing in the executive agency,

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
it should do with the type of cooperation which

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
was manifest at least to the early stages

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
and the early weeks I believe the early months

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
of the investigation of the signal flight.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Yes, I think perhaps a better example

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
with the chairman would be the type of cooperation

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
we got from the government's printing office.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
There, the members of the Loyalty Board were allowed

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
to be called, they testified,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
by they cleared certain individuals.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
For example, we found for the first time

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
when a Mr. Miller was on the stand

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
in a one particular case,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
the case of Rothschild,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
he had a one time thick,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
clear and time and thick material.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
The final result was from 43 individuals

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
who could testify in regards to these

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
communist activities that none of them were called.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
I asked Mr. Miller, again I can't quote his vote

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
but it was all a matter of record.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Why did it not call any of those who could testify

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
as to his communist background?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
He said well they weren't all available

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
for just two, some of them I assume were still underground.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
I believe, and I just finished my,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
however we showed a letter from the FBI

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
saying that one of the undercover agents

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
would be available to testify about the communist activities

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
of the White and I believe the husband's food.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Then I asked him the question,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
as I say I can't quote his vote,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
but all of us were a bit of Mr. Miller,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
and he was the secretary of the board of the government.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
That's why he didn't have enough money to go on paying up.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Yes, government's printing up.

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
I said Mr. Miller, why didn't you call any of those individuals

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
who were available?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
The answer was roughly this,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
or it was not our practice to call anyone

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
who would give their regulatory information.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Well now, Mr. Brattonberg,

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
the new head of the printing office was shocked about as we were.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Since then he's completely overhauled that stuff

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
and I'll try to get one step further

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
with talking about the type of cooperation which is effective.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Keep in mind the printing office handles

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
a classified, fixed confidential material form

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
with every department as far as we know.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
So the communist fire layer would be as valuable as a communist fire

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
and perhaps a ten-year-old department.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
We had Mr. Hipsley, who was the acting chairman of the board,

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
on the stand and I asked him,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
and I believe the chair was there at the time I asked him this question.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I asked him the question,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
should I just quote this?

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
I'd to let me ask you this.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
The other day as I recall,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
you fed your board operating under the general rule.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
The general rule of mere membership

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
on the communist party was not sufficient to borrow workers

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
under your loyalty program.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
It's actually general rule under which you operate.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
And the answer, and say, $89,

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Mr. Hipsley, that is true.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
He says, I went further, sir, if I may take another moment,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
and told you the best Richardson,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
as the general's best Richardson was the top man

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
and the human loyalty program.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
He said, I went further, sir,

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
and told you the best Richardson gave us the philosophy behind that.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
He gave us a long-winded story about the facts that some time ago

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
he wanted to become a member of an organization

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
and he had no knowledge of the Charter and Bylaw,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
and he wanted to be a member,

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
not because of its Charter and Bylaws,

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
but because it has a nice library and books he wanted to read.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
He said it was the purpose of membership.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Why you belong, that was important.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
That was explanation. He was our guide.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I left out the name of the organization.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
The Mr. Chairman, we found here to the,

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
I think, to the consternation of the new head of the printing office

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
that they were operating under a rule that,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
even if they found a man,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
were a member of the Communist Party,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
a member of the Communist Party,

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
on the Communist Party discipline,

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
that he should not be barred under this misnamed loyalty program.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Now, what you could get beyond that I don't know,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
and that you could find him setting off a bomb.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Mr. Dunham, the typical operation, Mr. Charter,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
he doesn't have to go into the government printing off the printing office.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
So, the assembly to establish the fact that there was a cooperative feature.
