WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I'll be committee staff. That was my question. It might be

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
quite big. Have you ever heard of employees who saw staff

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
members of congressional committees being communist?

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
I believe that out here it works for a congressional committee

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
back in the 1930s in the middle of the 19th-30s.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
That is correct. That's an eye committee investigating the

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
munitions industry and there have been so many. Now I can name

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
state-of-the-ding several of them. Well, you do know that they happen

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
to drive a certain fact there was some connected with

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Senators who had never tried to limit it. I just want to

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
you know that there is a procedure for checking the

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
loyalty and security of all the executive employees.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
I know that there is a procedure for it so I know that that procedure is not always

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
followed. Have the commerce ever adopted a loyalty program for

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
zone employees or the employees of its committee? I don't know the details of that

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
so I know that on our committee we have the FBI to make a

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
check and see whether there is the regulatory information on anyone we're about to

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
employ. I know that members of our staff get a fight for

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
the sense department clearance if their work might require that.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
You might want to check that for the question and I will.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
We will perhaps include that and the other information you're going to give me.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Sure. Thank you. Have you ever received any information

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
that you have been on the staff from confidential informants?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Yes. While I was with the department just as more like an

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
understaffer of this committee I have received much valuable information from

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
people we might call confidential informants. Yes sir.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Has some confidential informants have they given you information?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Given information to other staff members in addition to you?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
No I'm sure they have.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Are you sure they have? Yes sir.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm sure they have. Do some investigators, secretary and file

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
for some access to the committee file? I don't know the details of that

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
time. They might. Now let's get to this hypothetical

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
secret document. Stop secret document again.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Wouldn't that be put in the committee file that the chairman received?

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
No way, sir. That's a hypothetical.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Yes, in other words I ask you what you would do with the top secret document.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I imagine if the work given to Senator McCarthy is

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
very good to not be put in the committee file.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
I imagine Senator McCarthy is very careful about

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
protecting the identity of people who are in front of you with information

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
and I think he takes certain steps to see that I know in some cases I don't know who

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
gives them information. I have an answer and I don't want to know.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Has everybody on the staff? Yes.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Mr. Chairman I think that's kind of the

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
principle for the senator not to take my time.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm trying to understand some of the

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
talking comments. Give me just a minute. Can I have a

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
ruling on that? I'm not going to take out of your time too many of the types of

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
comments. During a hundred times in the Charles

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Examination Mr. Cohn, I suggest that the transcript

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
of the meeting of which time Mr. Cohn was confirmed he made

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
the evidence. I find now Mr. Chairman that there was no transcript

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
that there were merely notes made by the

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
stenographer with President. I find that there was no mention

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
made in the introduction of any

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
in these notes. For me, all the private law business

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
these are confidential notes and I want to pass them to you.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
If any part of these you think should be part of the

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
record I personally have no objections

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
maybe some questions. I think that's fair. I

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
reason I read about this open a magazine.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
And I have never heard of the affiliation with the

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
private law firm. But that question I ask,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm going to say in the infernesty of the third,

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
there was no mention in the notes. There's another transcript of

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
the third, there was no mention in the

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
description. I have no recollection of

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
any of these. I have no recollection of any of these.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Mr. Cohn, do you believe that anyone can lawfully deny

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
access to the file or any part of the file to any member of a

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
congressional committee? Does anyone deny access?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I don't think that's anyone.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Well, it's a day that you believe that the chairman of the committee

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
or a majority ruling of the committee can deny file

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
to any member of the committee? I just don't know that

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
you would have no opinion on that.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Do you believe that you and the members of the committee are

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
bound by the laws of the United States Congress?

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Now let me read you from the Legislative Reorganization Act

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
of 1946 as amended.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
The committee hearings records data, charts, and file.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Shelby kept separate and distinct from the congressional office

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
records of the member serving as chairman of the committee.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
And such records shall be the property of the Congress.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
And all members of the committee and the respective houses

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
shall have access to such records.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Mr. Cohn, that's the law.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
My final question is, counsel for this committee.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Do you consider yourself bound by the law?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I consider myself bound by the law.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm not only because I'm counsel for the committee.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I consider myself bound by the law.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
For all purposes.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
At all times.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Yes, sir.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I sign up, Mr. Chairman.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Senator Gore-Tech?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
I'm a former, great deal about the important work which you do.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm trying to get forward.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
I'm a director of the knowing here.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Mr. Cohn, the committee, particularly a legal or an unspatcher

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
training, or other experience, which will qualify you for effective

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
anymore legal and no-paper notes, or I would say that legal and

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
newspaper work are not necessary for your efforts to come in with the spec.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
He know a critical deal about the communist movement in this country.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
He has studied it, he has written about it, and he was very much interested

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
in the movement he was willing to give us his time for nothing.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
And that was an offer of which we were very happy to remain reasonable.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
The main reason he was asked for is because he's gone into these services.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
No, so I was going to say that it's not the main reason he was employed.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I would say the main reason he was employed, there is.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Because the happens to have a good deal of knowledge much more than I did,

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
or any other member of the staff, on a particular investigation which we desire to

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
recommend to this committee, under state. He has been working on it for a period of

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
years. He had written on it, he knew a good deal more about it than we did.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
He was willing to come and he was willing to work for nothing.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
And he worked for two years experience with the enablegim to do a effective job.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Sir, I don't know, it's very much to judge sometimes about the security experience

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
enabling you to do a job. I've seen a lot of people,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
some of the lawshaks were supposed to have great experience who turn out and

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
they come in and they do a very bad job. I've seen other people who was paper,

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
I could not look quite as impressive, who come into a very outstanding job.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
The charge of state change is concerned sir. I would just as we let the judgment

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
of those who let them come with the committee be passed upon as a result of the work

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
which he did for this committee. He did a lot of work for this committee.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
I was just wondering what was the problem with me as this,

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
that it's a plan you and Mr. Shine, for the story is good.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
It's the best case of all the American and its operations there.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
It's a great deal of unfavorable news, a great deal of publicity.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
That's what he thinks, the top of the queue is doing a very efficient job

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
but on the other hand, they're doing a very nice, many people.

08:00.000 --> 08:08.000
I wonder whether that experience was right or the result of Mr. Shine not letting it in.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
He's just working the part.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
My answer to that would be no sir and I'm sorry you think Senator Dorscht

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
because a newspaper, a lot of newspapers in Europe particularly,

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
might do a smear job that you want to accept that without looking at the facts in the case

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
to see whether or not we did or it did not do a good job.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
As far as that trip was concerned, we were sent over there by the chairman

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
to do certain specific things and of things certain specific information.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
We did that, we did that, it's what we could.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
And I think a lot of circumstances, some of which have been asked before,

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
that's committee before, I think the State Department and certain elements in it

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
were no happier about our investigation than some other H.P.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
What's your word work?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Very effective work for the government.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
What's the work that's going on?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
I don't think too much appreciation.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
I try to fill the job that's best I can.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't do anything wrong, I want that call to my attention.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
In that case, in every other case, I ascend that I can, I carried out the assignment.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I was sent over there to do.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I wasn't referring to you as much as I was to Mr. Shine,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I was really trying to develop what is a lack of experience

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
and investigative work was responsible for the un favorable publicity

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
which you have seen gone up to.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
No sir, I was responsible for the un favorable publicity.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
It is the fact that there is a great deal of resentment in European nations particularly

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
that in this country, then in the Joe Matrotti and some other people are addressing themselves

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
to the job of cleaning out cotton.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
And I might say that some of these other countries that same jobs is not being done

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
perhaps the Chippie down.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, we were the most remote that in Britain and France,

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
and Italy and other countries from the Europe, the ADX,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
power agencies, communists, and their government was I'm wondering

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
whether you received cooperation from our own countries and the Americans

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
who you encountered in Europe, the European Union.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
So I would say particularly talking about high-cog in Germany,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
not only did we not receive cooperation,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
we were made the objects of a deliberate and a planned smear,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
involving newspapers which were subsidized and paid for by our evolving front by high-cog,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
which was doing the smear.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, what's going on?

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
I think that the data China received a submission in the summer of 1953

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
that was possibly controversial with Secretary Stevens and the Army

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
and just hearing my percent of oil.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
I do not think that I don't think that there was any staring at it whatsoever.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
And I'm sure nobody else.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You think that some other conflict would have developed between the South of the Mediterranean

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
and the officials in the Department of the United States.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
I hear it. You need to predict about conflict developing.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I know of no conflict developing here.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I was made aware of non-violence deceiving governments throughout.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Well, I'm still a minute.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, go ahead.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Our ground notes are, if you want to interrupt me there.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
And if I go out way on the pavement, I just made a mistake.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I say there's no conflict.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
It was certainly a lack of interoperational and throughout the period,

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
we have heard that our meetings and charges with the Department of the Army

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
would sign from the press to our terminate to hearing a big subcommittee

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
of Fort Monmouth. Now is that true or not?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
That is true.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
There's a plan might ask you to send it to our checks.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
But I said with this, that wildly events were supposedly going on.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams did nothing to make us aware of the fact that they thought

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
there was any conflict or that anyone was doing anything wrong.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
There's a little security there to have somebody come in and say that you were

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
abusing them and psychoccurating them.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
If there is such a word and things write back.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
And in the next, I have them courting and fighting out the lunch and dinner

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
and asking you to do things for him and continue a social relationship

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
over a period of time.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
What do you think you were?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Well, if you don't go out and send it, I can say this.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
It's a very secure thing to have somebody come in here and say that he was abused by me

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
because I call them up on the phone too much.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And then when I didn't call them up on the phone for a couple of weeks

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
to have him call me up at my home in New York and complain very bitterly

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
because he hadn't heard from me and I hadn't called him up.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
I would say, sir, that's the complaint and the charges on the part of Mr.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Stevens and Mr. Adam are not from good faith.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, let's eliminate the David Schlauer and the Hodgents

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
in this car suburbry.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
What would the situation be?

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
The relations between your sub-comedy background and the part of the arms?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
The relations with the sir, that Mr. Adam and Mr. Stevens

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
were doing their best to stop the committee from conducting its investigation

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
which is not something unique in the annals of history.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Most agencies which are being investigated don't like to be investigated

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
and they would be much happier if the committee pulled out.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
This was not a highly unusual situation to us, sir.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
If they were welcome to try, it was our job to see that they did not succeed.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
Well, certainly Mr. Tom, you do not believe that the Department of the Army

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
and the part of our Stevens were unwilling to expose in every possible manner

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
the process that security risks within the operations of sub-war commas.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
Sir, I think that Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adam had the,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
but I believe sir, to be the mistaken notion

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
that the exposure of these things would be a personal reflection on them

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
and would indicate to the public that they had been racked in the performance of their duty

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
and then it took this committee to come along and prop them into action

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
and I think that they were human enough not to want that situation to occur

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
and they acted as they fit.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
I don't think it was a question of covering them wanting communists in the Army.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Of course it wasn't.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
It was a question of them not wanting the resultant embarrassment

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
from the public uncovering of those few communists who infiltrated the Great Army

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
and of the people who were serving under Mr. Stevens or responsible.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
So this small infiltration in this very large Great Army.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
So your subcommittee is not so forward with the investigation of the ports of the communists.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
Do you believe that the partner of the Army will accelerate its activities there

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
and do everything possible to move out all of the rest of the age which we like to be there?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Do I believe that sir?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
No, I don't believe that sir.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
I believe that the many, the many of the committee staffs that there will be

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
a training to relaxation in efforts on the part of the Army in doing what it should do on these things

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
and I think the way they've handled the per-f-cate is just about the last straw in indicating

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
that there's a very strong need for...

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
There's one thing to say, the phone left, there's a bus meeting, a bus meeting, a bus meeting, a bus.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
It's a continuous work-out sports month.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
It is sir.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I'll follow.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
For the next questions begin while we have the opportunity.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
Let's return to our studios and cost the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
This is ABC television next to you.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
First Minister, I'm going to say that I...

15:16.000 --> 15:24.000
...for the extremely happy to see the comparison of your answers and the answers Mr. Seedham, Mr. Adam,

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
I appreciate it, you've answered all the questions.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Not duct any of them.

15:32.000 --> 15:47.000
I think your performance on the witness fan may be somewhat a key to why the opposition feels they must get rid of you at all costs.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
I think your performance here on the witness fan has justified the confidence that I had when we...

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
...and do so to take this job as Chief Counsel.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
I think we appreciate your confidence in me. That means more to me tonight.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Mr. Cohen, I'm more into questions.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I...

16:15.000 --> 16:23.000
...if I had handed to me the daily worker, it was the official daily worker.

16:30.000 --> 16:39.000
The child's on the side of the telegraph agency of the Communist Party, I guess there's no person left.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm thinking of the headline for the day of the planters, Wightens, Macarkey, the headquarter.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And then we...

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
...the boss...

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
...for the tower at the code of Macarkey's spy and network.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
Reading the balance of the boss, boss represents the manual of the tower, Democratic New York.

17:02.000 --> 17:12.000
And it is the resolution today, the origin, they just have to cut them to investigate what he called Macarkey's spy and network in the government.

17:12.000 --> 17:20.000
The smaller it said, the network is full of feeling, sleep, sleep, sleep, and violation of the law.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Now, when I asked you if it was going to move your...

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
...water-long record,

17:27.000 --> 17:41.000
...and helping to successfully prosecute traitors of this country, I was seeing you fully aware of the mystery of the daily worker, what it is, I am certain.

17:41.000 --> 17:50.000
And for the benefit of our American jury, we did watching this, could you tell us what the daily worker is?

17:50.000 --> 18:02.000
The daily worker is not the leading official publication of the Communist Party of the United States, which in turn, of course, is merely the local office of the worldwide communist and first.

18:02.000 --> 18:13.000
The daily worker, published in New York, has been named by people, including a man who had once been managing editors, as the sort of...

18:13.000 --> 18:25.000
...polograph wire that goes out every day to the Communist Party members throughout the country, giving them their instructions as the communists line is.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
How they should talk, how they should think, and what they should say.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
It is used to convey those instructions to members of the Communist conspiracy in this country.

18:34.000 --> 18:46.000
I might say that the evidence has shown that the line which the daily worker follows, is in the last and hour to set in Moscow, by the leaders of the worldwide communist conspiracy.

18:47.000 --> 19:05.000
And so there is no question as there are no comments or comments on the front. The daily worker is the medium by which the Communist Mark tells that the oil members throughout the country want to do what the line is.

19:05.000 --> 19:22.000
It is the most important that there are political affairs, which is a monthly theoretical magazine of the Communist Party of the United States in which the theories are set for us in a little bit more high-term language than in the daily worker.

19:22.000 --> 19:29.000
There are certain other communist publications, but I would certainly agree with you that the daily worker is number one.

19:30.000 --> 19:44.000
Once a chairman would like to make probably record the front page of the daily worker which presents up to the congresswoman in the front page which attacks us for having exposed communists.

19:44.000 --> 19:58.000
I would definitely not have been able to talk about this, but if you read that and if you read political affairs, you will find that a substantial portion of every single issue of the daily worker is devoted to attacks on you.

19:58.000 --> 20:21.000
That in political affairs which sets the keys of the top leadership of the Communist Party in its last issue, there is an article in which the Communist Party claimed a good deal of credit for recent attacks upon you and sets as the number one objective for Communists in the United States, the post-sensitization and attacks and attempts to discredit you.

20:21.000 --> 20:34.000
That is full of credit in the daily worker, the political affairs in every single communist publication stay in, stay out, month in, month out, there is no considerable doubt in the world about that.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
I am not attacked nearly as frequently as you are.

20:40.000 --> 20:52.000
I think you are running a good close second right now. They come to the party as you know, held a trial in which actually in New York, as I recall, I think they convicted me.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
You are infected. I think that your trial will be next by the time the party.

20:58.000 --> 21:13.000
Mr. Cohen, you and your unit of shine went through Europe. I think you are over there to go through the libraries and come back and report to me about Communists' work room, actually on the shelves.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
Mr. Dorshan, I expect to meet about that. I think why is it so important?

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
The man who is in charge of the program with theodore Kagan, is that right?

21:24.000 --> 21:36.000
So there were a number of the time that she gave us. The man who attacked the thing had as that part of high-talk to public affairs office. At the time we were over there, some 4,000 people working under him was the man named Theodore Kagan.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
Theodore Kagan is no longer with the information program. That's right.

21:43.000 --> 21:51.000
As far as you know, he is not there. In any event during our investigation, his resignation was accepted.

21:51.000 --> 22:03.000
I wonder if you would, I think this was some bearing upon the question, I'll put it towards you. I wonder if you would briefly outline the background of Mr. Kagan.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
We will get a better picture of the type of publicity that we received out of Europe.

22:09.000 --> 22:18.000
Mr. Kagan, who was acting head of the public affairs office in Highcock when we were over there investigating it, comes to me off hand number 1.

22:19.000 --> 22:37.000
Had signed a communist, a written pledge to the communist party of the United States in the form of a communist nominating petition, number 2 that was signed by him during the Hitler-Stolling Act when anyone was announced the reigns, I think, that knew just what the communists were upto.

22:38.000 --> 22:47.000
Number 3, he has been the author of a number of pro-communist plays. Number 4, those plays have been produced by a communist front organization.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
I won't mention the name because I am in doubt about one word and it's vital that it's been cited in the official subversive guide.

22:54.000 --> 23:01.000
And there was another number of other incidents indicating that Mr. Kagan has been affiliated with the communist movement.

23:02.000 --> 23:13.000
Mr. Kagan has brought back here for processing. Here at Gold, he admitted that he lived for approximately one year, but the man whom he knew to be a member of the communist party or a pro-communist party.

23:13.000 --> 23:28.000
That is my recollection, sir. And this man who wrote plays for the reproduced by a communist front, the man who was the individual over in Europe,

23:29.000 --> 23:39.000
who was not applying the press, for you would be, from Mr. Shann, to be advising them to, in effect, tell you that there's not that about that in my mind, too.

23:39.000 --> 23:48.000
And actually, with no operation whatsoever, there was a, you know, what to do, but you deserve it, sir.

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
There's a man, given the job of tailing you and Mr. Shann following you over place you might have.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Yes, sir, I ran into that man at the airport the other night here in Washington.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
No, I'm sure he wasn't following me. I think he's got to be. I think he's got to be at the state department now.

24:03.000 --> 24:23.000
Now, during your trip through Europe, did you find that we had subsidized and worked that time subsidizing papers that had editors, publishers who were, or at least had been members of the communist party?

24:23.000 --> 24:45.000
Yes, there's more than that, sir. That is true, but in addition to that, this fund which I've talked about that high-carcass, who subsidized finance, give money to certain German publications, some of the money which came from the American tax payers, was actually used by one of these newspapers to print up official propaganda for the communist party in Germany.

24:45.000 --> 25:09.000
Now, one of the results of your trip through Europe was the resignation of this man, Tagen, who was in charge of some 4,000 people, Tagen who had signed a pledge to support the communist party, Tagen who had admittedly lived with a communist, Tagen who wrote plays or produced by communist funds.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
One of the results of your trip was his resignation, he resigned during our investigation.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
And his time has expired into wealth.

25:17.000 --> 25:31.000
Mr. Cohn, yes. I was interested in signing a divorce tax, what did you about? What would have happened if Mr. Shine had secured a commission in the summer of 1953?

25:31.000 --> 25:41.000
You read all those questions, Mr. Cohn. Now, of course, in the summer of 1953, you were adding to the two of your commission for Mr. Shine.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
I thought he was qualified, sir, as one of the resigns and questions you were asking for to award and weren't you?

25:47.000 --> 25:55.000
So you say, anxious to throw a cure, I want to say this, I thought he was qualified, I recommended him, I was a reference on his application, yes sir.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Well, now, is that your answer, you were right there, for cure one for him?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
My answer is, as I have given to you, sir.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
It's simple, yes, there wasn't. Yes sir. You were.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Of course, sir. I thought he was in title, I don't think.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
Thank you, entitled. You've enlisted some pretty high-powered people to help get one, didn't you?

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
No, sir, I can't agree with your terminology there, that does not give a fairy.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
Well, let's see. Well, sir, let's see, Mr. Cohn.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
I can see a question, you say I enlisted, sir. Well, high-powered people to help him get it, what happened with this, sir?

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
I don't ask you what happened, I ask you if you enlisted, certain high-powered people, did you or did you?

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Sir, yes or no, did you or did you?

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
What was the last question? Mr. Lallag, I want to give you yes or no answer.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
So you don't want to? How do you do?

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
If you want to, I'd like to give you yes or no answer.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
All right, let me start again with you.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
The first time I met Mr. Cohn, it may I be committed to complete one sentence.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
Well, Mr. Cohn, I'm going to try to have this witness be responded to the answers.

26:56.000 --> 27:03.000
And I would like to start again, if I may, could I start again, that the corner would you like to make a speech now?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
If you would like to make a speech speech, you know what's there always?

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
Well, I would say you exist. I would like to give you responsive answers, and I would like to give you as many yes or no answers as I can.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
There are times, sir, when I cannot agree with some of the adjectives which you put in your hand,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
I would like to difficult for me to give you the answer I would like to.

27:21.000 --> 27:28.000
If you wish to ask me, did I think Shine would qualify for a commission and did I recommend him for one? My answer is yes, sir.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
We've already covered that, you said you were anxious to get him on.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I didn't do, I told you what happened, sir.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Yeah, and you said you were anxious to get him on.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Now, do you want to change that or say bye?

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
Sir, I think my testimony is very clear to the committee. It's just what happened and just what I wanted.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
This is only a moment of no life, sir. Yes or no, where you anxious to get him on.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
If you said yes, do you want to change it or say bye?

27:49.000 --> 27:58.000
Sir, I want to leave then exactly what I've said concerning the events of Mr. Shine, filing an application for a commission.

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
Well, you want me to go all over the game and ask you once more in simple English, where you anxious to get shiny commissions.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Sir, I can only tell you what happened. I can't say your word, anxious.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
Where you and the only guy that was known, what your own state of mind was, there's no problem.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
I don't think it works anymore, but there's no blankness to get him on.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Sir, I thought he was qualified for it and I recommended you as he was like anxious,

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
that is a difficult question for me to answer. I thought he was qualified for one.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
I recommend it. I recommended him that one.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
But you can't tell us whether you were interested in the results.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
And you were interested in the final.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Sir, and you wanted to get one.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Sir, the largest would take us so long.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
The reason it takes so long is to welcome you and I.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
You put some adjectives in your question, which is a little bit difficult for me to go along with.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Well, I want to try to give you, yes or no, you'll follow me.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
We're all the reasons I'm kind of a star.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
Now the first conference that took place in respect to a commission for Shine,

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
took place in the office of the United States Senator, didn't it?

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Yes sir.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
That's thirty-high-powered stuff in the defenders.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Is that right?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I can't answer that sir.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
And there was President in that office, a general.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Is that right?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
General Rieber was there, yes.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
That's pretty high-powered stuff isn't it?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Mr. Welch, I...

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Well, just the answer, no. Is that high-powered or not?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Mr. Welch, I want to give you, yes or no, answer.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Well, just no, then. Just tell me, is that high-powered or not?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Well, this is calling you.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
No, Senator.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
I don't know what he means, but high-powered.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
I think the chairman, though.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Mr. Coleman, do you mind if I say what Aaron is for everything?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
All right, I need to ask for more details about it,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
about it's meant by the entities.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Yes sir.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Officer Thorpe, let's strike out high-powered.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
You're right again.

30:03.000 --> 30:10.000
If you had a senator there, you had a very important public official there, didn't you?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Yes sir, I'd be senator.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
And if you had a general there, you had a very important army of people.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Yes sir.

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
And if you had Mr. Role and Coleman, there you had a very important council

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
to an important committee there, didn't you?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Committee is important.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Right.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
You think it's a call in any ordinary little guy from my state of Iowa

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
who's commanding that sort of attention?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
I hope so sir.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
You think he comes?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Yes sir.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
You think any little old guy off a farm in Iowa?

30:43.000 --> 30:51.000
And would like a commission now, could Matt have a conference between the senator and the general and you?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Sir, I don't think with Iowa.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Yes sir.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
You think a little boy from the farm can get away with that?

30:57.000 --> 31:06.000
My answer to you Mr. Role is, I think Iowa might exclude me if the person from Iowa were contacted, senator,

31:06.000 --> 31:14.000
taken over, I'm sure that senator Haken-Roper would, what someone is is office, what's called General Reiber,

31:14.000 --> 31:21.000
what someone on his bed and seat, that's the application, wasn't given from attention.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Yes sir.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
So whether we haven't got all officers in no private in our army is this is all funny sir.

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
Could that tell you from Iowa, in this is the part of general Walter Beagle's best suit?

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
I don't know.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
You don't think so?

31:36.000 --> 31:45.000
Yes sir.
