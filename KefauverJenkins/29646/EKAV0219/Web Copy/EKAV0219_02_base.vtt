00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I didn't ask you that, Mrs. Holmes.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
I'm just asking you if we didn't have pretty good forces at work.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Mr. Welfke, I just can't take these.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
That is a letter. Are you modest about your own position?

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
No, sir. I'm not only modest about my own position.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Well, two gentlemen and the senator is pretty good-stop, isn't it?

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
For me, sir, two gentlemen and the senator is pretty good-stop.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
You say pretty good-stop, sir.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
General Reaver, sir.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I think you're fine.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Well, sir, do you think you're that good?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I have no record.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I have no record.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I have hardly fucking fifteen years of record, sir.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
And would you read the question, please, Mr. Reaver?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
The question on the other hand.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
And the other hand.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Question, two gentlemen and the senator is pretty good-stop.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
That's it. He's a pretty good-stop, sir.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
General Reaver has the job here with the staff.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'll call for us in these applications.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm in question.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Right.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I'll go ahead and ask you.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I'll go ahead and ask you.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'll go ahead and ask you.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I'll go ahead and ask you.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'll go ahead and ask you.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I'll call for us in these applications.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
But I asked you.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
What General Reaver's job is, sir?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I think.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
What do you think?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
You ask you what General Reaver has the artisticity

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
and you face talking and Nancy is, yes, sirs.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
So, I had a call.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
General Reaver, sir, had the job ofuring the army

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
and congressmen, it was his job

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
to send a sir to process applications for commissions

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
and for other things he had a fair to a system

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
in doing that, that was his duty.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
And he would stay in and they ask, go to the office.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
The office is a very sensitive and kind-wishment

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
up on the hill for that purpose.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
And I'm sure that thousands of times in the court

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
that he would talk with the senator with the congressmen

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
and get the application.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I believe he spoke with Senator McCarthy once and once alone.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And we heard that three or four times in this room

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
already Mr. Cohn.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I thought we had to.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Right.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
So that you aren't adding anything to the record

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
when you tell us that.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Well.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Now may I ask you this, Mr. Cohn?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I understand you to say, Mr. Dvorakshad.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
But if Shion has got a commission in the summer of 1953

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
and were on uniform and his one bar shall we say?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
One bar?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I mean, shall we say one bar on uniform?

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
How are you ending for as a kind-wishment?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, we ending for...

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah. One bar, two bars?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
The question is, why does fallification get high?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
How are you ending for?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I don't think there's any discussion about that.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
So you weren't ending for anything less than one silver bar

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and a shoulder were you?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, I assume that a second of the time

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
would be the lowest commission drank that you could get now.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
All right. Now if he's got it, you're in the form.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
And he's silver bar on uniform.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Did you say one silver bar, sir?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
No. I'd better say...

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Gold bar.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
That's right, sir.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm really talking about a second lose hand.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
That was, I can't get you right. Is that right?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I can't say that, sir.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Was your aim a little higher?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
No, sir. The aim was...

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
There's not any lower than second lose hand.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Well, that's what I mean, too.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
That's that...

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Second of the time, I believe, is the lowest commission drank in the army.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Was that the maximum aim you had for days

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
and sometimes in there was no discussion about any further.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
It's a question of what is qualifications.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
What an idea, sir.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
If he got it, he'd do it in the form.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
When I asked him what's time I was...

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I thought so.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
You get it.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
The time it requires you round the million turns.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
What do you think?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I won't tell the problems of the day.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
During your testimony earlier, Mr. Cologne,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
either on cross-addomination or direct examination,

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
you brought in the frequently the name of Aaron Coleman.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
And it runs in my mind that the evidence in connection

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
with Aaron Coleman did back to 1946 to 1947

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
when the...

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
He started it out from documents from what my month was 46, like with 46.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
A question I would like to ask is,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
does Aaron Coleman have any bearing on the...

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
What's the...

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
What's my mind about situation as of now?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
When did he...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
He's still working here or when did he leave?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Or was it there at the time the investigation began?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
It was...

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
What relevance is does the Coleman matter have?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Our Coleman was suspended after this committee began its investigation

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
since then to much.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And I believe this case is in process of...

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
The loyalty for our channel now.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Well, I understand that he had been suspended before the investigation began.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Are you sure this suspension just went...

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
After your investigation began?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
My understanding, yes, sir.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
My understanding is that this suspension of Coleman took place

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
sometime late in September.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm subject to correction on that.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm quite sure.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
As I recall, when I thought Mr. Stevens about me...

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I'd recommend you give us an exact date and you'll find out the exact date.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I think that would have to come from Mr. Stevens.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
We would not have to date.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Say what have to date?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
We don't know the exact date, sir.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
It is right.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I was suspended.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Well, we were told that by Mr. Stevens, yes.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And you are sure that he was working here at the time the investigation began?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yes, sir.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Coming out of another subject,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
you mentioned that at many of the cross-conferences,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
which took place following the second hearing,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Adam and Stevens were present.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
And I think he said that they did not complain about the nature of the best conferences at that time.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Is that right?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yes, sir.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
What if hasn't had all of the best conferences?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I think there might have been some hearings with one or the other,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
and they were not up in there.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
But there were very few, I think Mr. Adams, all of them,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
who said that they were there at half of the best conferences.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
There were 25% of the best conferences.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I was 75% of the best conferences.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I was about 80 or 90% of them.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
They were there at 80 or 90% of them.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
That's my best estimate, not?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yes.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
Are you willing to tell us, Committee, under oath to the best conferences at none of those best conferences?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Because they make any complaints about the nature of what's the matter of the matter,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
for your use, that's about the hearing?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Yes, sir. I certainly recall them.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
No complaint of any kind.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I recall no complaint of any kind,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
for Mr. Adams, for Mr. Stevens.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
How about some difference to the best conferences?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
They tell you the next day or the next time you mess them up,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
or the next time you mess them up professionally?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
No.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
You shouldn't have said this. You shouldn't have said that.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
This is Mr. Jefferson's death. This is going too far.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I recall those questions.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
When did you first learn that they were unhappy about the nature of the publicity

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
flowing from the best conferences, following the executive meetings at these hearings, sir?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Do I never say this before?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
No, sir.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Neither one of them would ever throw anything before.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
No, sir.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
They're right there.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
There are no other than any challenge to the accuracy of anything which has been said by Senator McCarthy,

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
or on my staff, sir.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
I did say that they were unhappy about the whole thing, and about the...

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
...back to the whole thing with being publicized.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
But on this narrow issue, which they talked about,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and that your questioning me about,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
whether they have a claim there was any inaccuracy or misleading impression,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I recall no complaint being made to.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
You mentioned that Adams, referring to Shine,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
you as the term Hotsie to you, more frequently than you use the term Shine.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Is that right?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yes, sir.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You sure about that?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
That one, and without obvious, my first estimate,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
that one involved counting up to number of times he mentioned,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I have no way of feeling that that would be the best thing.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
You are sure to use the term Hotsie to a good many times?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I answer.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Not just two of the times.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yes, sir.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Now, let's get this, Mr. Cohn.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
You and Adams were playing for social friends.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
You went around the flight flights together to see it together,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
the search club together, had a lot of meetings together.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
But if you're honest, opinion is the wronging mess by the term Hotsie.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Do you think it in a suspicious manner,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
or is there something kind of ominous about the way he used the word Hotsie?

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Oh, I think so in a lot of occasions he used it in a suspicious manner.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
I think another occasion might have been a little bit serious about it.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Another word, your relationships with him were such that

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
if he was going to use the word Hotsie,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
it could well have been used in a friendly or a suspicious manner

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
without indicating really something ominous is going to happen to shine

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
if you didn't do that and didn't do that.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It could have been so different.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
Was there a considerable amount of banker between you and Adams?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
As contrasts and let us say, between Adams and McCarthy,

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
or you and even a few people instead worked at the same level,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
were there things that he had in the levity

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
which in stark, Christmas might look pretty serious if he was just a friend?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
There's no doubt about that turn. I can give you a sample.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
The word Hotsie might have been a certain extent.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
It's very hard for you to read this out.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
It's mine, I'm not eternally.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
It could have used that word suspiciously on a number of occasions, sir.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't call it that.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
The word Hotsie is responsible for some of the things that you said to him.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Mr. Adams, reduce your print.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Looks a lot more ominous than they would appear with the inflection

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
and the environments that obtained at the time they were there.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Sure.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
In other words, you think that both of you might have talked to each other

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
a little tougher than he actually mentioned.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
He worked with him last time.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I wasn't just a question of his tougher.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
It's just a question of taking any normal conversation between two people

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
and what they say and how they say it.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And then if you try to put it down and black and white and repeat it for six months afterwards,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
you just don't get the picture at all.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
There's a good money in it.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Going to the matter of these tickets,

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
did you purchase your provided Mr. Adams for a theater and for a flight flight?

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
I think the test and money was just four months after the ticket to the theater

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
reflected then two months after the tickets to the flight flight from Lincoln to William Brothers.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yes sir.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
I am not sure whether you just decided to whether he tried to pay you earlier

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
or whether you did not.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
On the fantasy kit, sir, my recollection is he asked me about them earlier.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
I told him when I got them that when I knew Ramas they were,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I would certainly tell him and I would certainly take the money.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
I do not recall any conversation about the flight flight tickets until the time he had me for it.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Do you remember when he made you for the flight flight?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Yes sir, for the early 18th.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
February the 18th?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Yes sir.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
He claimed you did the theater ticket because that's the same time.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Give me the follow-up money the same time.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
And I think he tested by the set time, the President is trying to say he has to do something

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
that I want to do that money because that is the way it is.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
That's the problem.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Did he imply that something might be?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
No, there's no detail.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
You have testifies that at the Fort Maunmouth collection

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
where the irritations developed for you, that you were angry.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
You have to try to believe that at that time,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
and everything being made on the part of the army,

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
to induce send them a tripe to issue a press release which they have to protect.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
There was more for that actually than the baby poster

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
and then there was some more going up on the plane.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
The Fort Maunmouth was to have an issue that the Fort Maunmouth meeting was about right.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
It was not beginning.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
There was not.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
There seems equipment to this inquiry to determine how much flight you played in the non-issuements

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
that were especially.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yes sir.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
What did you do without this way?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I carried messages back and forth between them.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Mr. Adams and Senator McCarty on the 19th, on the 20th, I was completely out of the picture

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
because they were talking to each other.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Are you believe that I ask you this question under oath?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Do you believe that you not put an included in the Fort Maunmouth keep it all?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
As you say, no.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
What's going on here on the hurry that you go by case?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Do you think Senator McCarty was done in the issue that's special?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Well, I think he would have asked you to get.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I do not, sir.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
You do not.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
No, sir.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
You don't think that you contribute as in any way into the back that the press release does not issue the not, sir?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm sure I did.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
If you try this way, does Senator not take issue?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I did not, sir.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I'll just assume what Senator Pratt has said about it.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
By what have happened in regard to one phase of this case,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
it's the second to third time that you had talked to Mr. Season,

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
though especially Mr. Adams about shine and his defense and his location and his commission,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
you have been given the reply, which I think you should have been given,

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
as they told the situation proper, and they had said to look young man,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
stick to the work of Kishat, we're going to run out.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
In that effect, I believe I testified under oath that when Mr. Adams came to me

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
and placed in juxtaposition to problems that you're confronting him,

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I said as far as the shine mattered, Johnny, that's a sense of the story.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Because if there's anything to that, you should have told the phone and should tell him now.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Tell him you own film.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Take care of your own shop.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
We're going to run the army.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
We don't want you telling us anything at all about shine.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
So, they have done that.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
How will you run that?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I'll have it in the match, so I'm sure if there were anything improper.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
In any discussion we have a had with them about shine.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Whether it's proper enough, if Thursday has kept you out of the trigger in the army,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
you ran your committee, but I'll defend you out of here.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
You want a question, that wasn't that.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
My time has expired.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
For the next senator starts his questioning, let's return to our studio

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
to cut the cover to commit our stations to identify himself.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
It's all us, this is ABC television report.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
There's three fans who've got two top programs for it, and I have 730.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
The objective on state of charge is on the line of 10.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
This is the documented charge is made by you, Senator McCarty,

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
and Mr. Carr, I guess Mr. Stevens, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Hensley,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
is not that the answer we filed for yesterday.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Well, you thought of an answer.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yes.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
As a lawyer, I'm going to ask if there doesn't contain charges.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
What do you say about it?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
What we say about that, sir, we did not initiate the thing.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
What we did is...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I didn't ask you for anything, Mr. Cohnam-Charts.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
If this document I'm asking you is a lawyer,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
if it doesn't contain charges, sir, as we say right here,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
this document contains, quote, what we consider to be,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
certain data thrown by us with a re-align.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Well, I am a part of the data. Don't you make charges?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
They could send us an oral.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
They could send us an oral.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
They are charges.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That's a certainly beacon.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
All right.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
They can't solve, they consider that, and you consider them when you make them, didn't you?

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
No, sir. What we consider them when we make them was,

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
a setting that records straight and giving them back about what had actually happened.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Let us go down and start and see if there's some charges in it.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
What is he using that thing?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Yes, sir.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Here, paragraph number one, let's take them as a condor.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
In your paragraph, if you're number one, just,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
you state the most recent documents for Mr. Stevens

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
and Mr. Adams contains what an eye on allegations against the subcommittee and against needs.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Insofar as these allegations suggest the use of them for me,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
they are without basis in fact.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Just now, that is referring to the documents that,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
that are phonological documents of that,

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
are the Army at previously released to the press or released to the committee and it's got to the press.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
That's the document you referred to as in.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, that was the second Army document.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Oh, you're referring to the one in file as a committee?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Yes, the specification file.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
All right, the specification, I think that was 29.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
All right.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Now, the new space that is insofar as it charges,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
the use of them for me,

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
that is without basis in fact.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Now, you try that through, that it was up in,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
was in and is now without basis in fact.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Yes, sir.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
All right.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
I turn to your paragraph number three.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
And that goes from it.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
In their attempt, that is very referred to Stevens and Adams.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
In their attempt to stop our exposure of the misunderstanding of communist infiltration into the Army,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
is that not a charge they were and we just say, so sir.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Yes, it is a charge, isn't it?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It's a different.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
That's another one.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
That's another one.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
I think it's a different one.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
I think it's a different one.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
I think it's a different one.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
I think it's a different one.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Were you a lawyer?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Yes, another one.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Well, if I did that, that's a different one.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
All right.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Are you going to not be pleased to know whether that cost his to charge?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Make somebody wait.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
What we try to consider this, but we know that this is all things.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I'm not asking you what the consistent is.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
What is it?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
It is a legal document.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
It is not a charge.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
It is a statement by us, sir, so this committee, I read a detail.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
If you want me to record that way, that's all right and leave.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
But you and I both know it's a charge of Miss Konda.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I want to ask you whether you consider what that statement says,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
as being in Papa Konda.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
All in the part of Miss DeSeed is in the matter.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I would say it could be considered that, yes sir.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
You would say it could be considered that.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
You've been able to answer questions here and go into the future and say,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
what would have happened on something contingency?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
I don't know.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
You know that is a charge of the in Papa Konda,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
so in the part of Miss DeSeed, I would say certainly that this committee

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
could control about the investigation.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Can you tell us any other construction that you possibly just be placed on?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Well, that's for the committee.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
You don't want to say.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
No, sir.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
You took right nothing.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
No, sir.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I will tell you what happened and what they said and what I had it.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
It has happened.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Here it is, sir.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Mr. Chairman.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm asking you if you consider this charge.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Mr. Chairman, say me, I ask that.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
I don't even want to let you see what the Sunnish is answering.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
Well, I would have left it to the witness where the whole world has seen it.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
And I have an outfit that asks him this question.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
And I interrupt you.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
No, sir.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
What I want to thank you.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Honored Assistant Chief.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Honored Assistant Chief.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Honored Assistant Chief.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Sir, I'm on this question of charge.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Maybe I will use any word you want me to about it.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I don't want to use any except what you want to swear to.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Right.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
What I want to say, sir, is that such as a chose and accurate recital by our events which

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
had occurred in the course of our relationship with Mr. Steven and Mr. Adam.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
All right.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Let's go down there further now.

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
In the same paragraph number three as the conclusion of it, still referring to Mr. Adam and Mr.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Steven.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
I read, they should further be instructed to tell the sub-soaked committee what's

18:04.000 --> 18:12.000
and for who is pulling the string for what to protect those who in turn have protected

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
tips from them in the commoners.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Do you regard that as a charge?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
That's been in the conscious language, sir.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I think it's good language.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And maybe you might, but I don't know.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm trying to find out the truth.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Yes, sir.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Do you regard that as a charge against them that they are troubling commoners?

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
I consider that to be a request and a statement of fact.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, a statement of fact is a charge that they have effect commoners, is it not?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Certainly, can you do that?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Could we conclude that?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Yes.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
You may have heard the concrete conclusion that, didn't you?

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
When you're about to start in the colonite, maybe if I think something here, I can say

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
a lot of times in the future on this one word, charge.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
This whole thing, well, I'll see you reading on this side of my phone.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
So, I'm on free to just start.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
All right, sir.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
If you want to open all that up, we want to treat it with the charge.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Are you free to do something else?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Yes, sir.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I have to explain.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
I wanted to make a visit.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
This whole thing, of course, is held up the work of this committee for a period of months.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
You are in service.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
This is the next charge you're sending specialifications by this committee.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
That's what I had submitted and I've treated as a charge.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Specification.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
And it's not the statement was made against you.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Would you consider the charge?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Certainly, my turn.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
These are the...

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Thank you, sir.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
These are specifications.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
I understand.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Right.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
But I expect the petition as base for the charge is enough.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
As long as you don't know that they're outflowers.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
In order...

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't want to appear to be...

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
You don't want to appear?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I don't want to appear to be crawling about a technicality here.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I wonder why you want to...

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I want to go.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
I'll tell you why, sir.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I want to make it very clear to everybody.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
The things here, you were not brought about by us.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Well, I didn't ask you that.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Everybody knows how to hear you and you're brought about already.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Well, but we are only these charges.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Now, he's approving on my guest's building.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
That's what I'm trying to do.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Just to all of us, every question you ask me is spent by every statement in here, which I make.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
That's what I want, because I don't want to do this.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
As what I'm trying to get you to do, my driver's...

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
I can't see it as a charge, and if you want to tell this to me...

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
Now, that you do not see it as a charge, you have the right to do so.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I, which I say then, that I can show it as specification,

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
setting forth the details of our relationship of Mr. Steele and Mr. Adams,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
which were filed by us, with the committee at the direction of the committee.

20:13.000 --> 20:20.000
All right, so you think that this detail statement has the effect of charge even as the students

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
in the shadow of the top-knit and comment.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Now, you think that's the least commonest?

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Now, I'm trying to find out if we get somebody up there at the top-knit.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Yes, I think that's the same as that of me, nothing to me in this statement.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Well, I think you made it to our gear that's due and we can suspect the way that it's been quicker.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
We can do it. Because sooner we can get to it each year.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I think the point is that you say, following comments,

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I think in our last paragraph, we make pretty clear just what we think they fit.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Or is it not a... I'm sure that Mr. Steele and Mr. Adams...

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
That's all just a little further.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
In this same paragraph, turn over there, let's read it.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
I read another sentence from the same paragraph.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
The report. The report is in quotation here.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
Indicating the report that I assume you mean the report that I think is a chronological event.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Or just talk that three. Yes, sir. There's a number here.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
No, it's number four. I'm four. The next paragraph.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
Yes. I read the statement. The report has had some...

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I call your attention to the next word.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
The plan of that.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
Of derailing the inquiry into security matters,

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
pertaining the commoners infiltration in their army,

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
and the second phase, these and the ministrations are all...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Yes, sir. Then it was a plan,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
premeditated, acts of that as a decision, the list of reports,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
that yes, this committed a stop investigating the army.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Is that correct?

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
I believe sir, that that is certainly one of the important reasons why this is all done.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And that is the statement maybe, or any now,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
specified on the old baddies too. Yes, sir.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
All right, let's go to the next one.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
paragraph five, as you have it, number.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
I call your attention to the first sentence from that paragraph.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
As further evidence of the bitch honesty,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
of the attack that's on my spare,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
patient due, Mr. Stevens and the drabors,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I call your attention and support.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
What's the issue on them?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
Your general's mammograph copy, and it's time on the third stage to get,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I don't know whether you as far as far as I'm concerned,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
spend your time as expected.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
We get back to it today.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Okay, for later.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.000
Mr. Cohen, what was your general revered rank when the merc's representations may have been made,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
with respect to Dave Sean?

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Here we go. I can't honestly say so. I think he's the major general.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Well, he is the major general now.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Yes, sir.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
And I wondered whether at that time he was a brigadier general.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I just found out that.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
Now it's chairman, and I direct his particular, Mr. Wells,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
who needs no aid, of course, of my people's talents,

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
but I wanted to be sure, at least as far as the union's never been Illinois,

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
it's concerned that no misimpression may have created as much harm.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
Applications or a manifestation of an interest in a commission in the Army

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
is handled in the my office.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
Because when I get a letter from somebody else,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
it is protest.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
Whether he comes to see me or not, that's making it difficult.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
Every interest that is manifested is given the same kind of attention.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
So that if this young civilist on the far right elsewhere,

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
everything she's got to meditate for qualification for a commission,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
it is put in the middle.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
So he might say that in survival, my people,

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
I think might be considered as high power that he has a center in his company.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
And then I proceed to process this in the same manner.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
If it's an Air Force commission, I talk to General Kelly.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
If it was an Army commission, I talk to General Lee Reapers.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I think on occasions I have felt a criminal health.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I have talked to others.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
So it always I tried when this whoever will be a non-offer,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
so I thought I'm the guilty.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
Be he a criminal or a brigadier, General or an army commission.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
And I certainly want the people in my own face and all.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
But every one of those applications is received good attention

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
and we just have very fastly knew how far.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
So at least they can say they had a senator, a general of their clients.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
Even though we've been just keen to form a letter,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
they can't say they'd like to have a commission.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Any army? Maybe.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Manager.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
Mr. Cohn, there's been some reference during the course of their hearings

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
to the lack of staff and not adequate staff personnel.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Let me ask you this question.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
I have just recently learned that there are some extra staff personnel working on these.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
There are some staff personnel working on the other staff personnel

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
working on the other staff personnel investigations that are not paid by the committee.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Is that correct?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
There's no other way.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
In other words, there's anyone.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
All the people that are working on the other staff personnel investigations

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
are employees of the Senate.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
So I mean Mr. Cohn was not an employee of the Senate.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
He was the non-paid consultant.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I get the information.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
As far as I know, sir, everybody's an employee there.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
And that is a lot of people we have picking up information for us and things like that

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
or not an employee to print things.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
Yes, and I get this mainly on some of the nights in the run.

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
But I think that I have a lot of two people on my office payroll

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
who are working full time with the committee.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
That's because of the women's budget, which we have.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
I'm not sure if we didn't have the minister Duffy who had paid

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
for my office working full time with the committee.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
I think there's also one secretary.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm not sure.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Let me explain it if I may.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
The reason is that we've got a very limited budget.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
And I had a surplus on my office payroll.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I put someone on my payroll,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
and I don't have them work on the investigating committee.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'll be glad to give you all the details.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Yes, well, I'm always referring to the subcommittee.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm not referring to the office, so that I understand them that all people working on the subcommittee

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
on investigations, staff people,

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
or either employee of the subcommittee

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
or from send them a card of these office.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Certainly, by the way, I know employees who are volunteering

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
or are people as volunteers or paid out of five of them.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Not that I know.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Just wanted to get the record straight on.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Yes.
