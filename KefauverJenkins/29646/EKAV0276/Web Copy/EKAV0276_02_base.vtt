00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm sorry, I just...

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Just one minute.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
I might want to ask one to clarify.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
I beg your pardon.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
One minute, see if I can just play with my counsel

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
for cross examining me.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I beg your pardon.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I beg your pardon.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I beg your pardon.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
I beg your pardon.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I beg your pardon.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I beg your pardon.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Senator McCarthy and Mr. Roy Kroner, now in conference,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
over a couple of material in this questioning by Mr. Welch.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I beg your pardon.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you, Mr. Welch.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Senator, I think you were mistaken about a date

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
or about someone being in New York.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
And that in my book is not a crime.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
I do want to read to you from the bottom of page 617,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
all of the records.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
You would one note again.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm out.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Have you had...

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
The last paragraph on the page you say,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
this is you kept trying.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Now you ask me about the 17th.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
On the 17th, I may have discussed that in the morning

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
at Holy Square.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I did it almost every day,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
but the conversation you have referenced

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
in the last paragraph,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I believe, that was about General Law,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
about the breaking of General Law.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
So maybe four of that, and I'm interpolating,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
that was in the 16th.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Then maybe four of that, Mr. Adam,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
and brought that matter up.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Mr. Kohn and Mr. Karr were not in town.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Now that he was like crack with you now.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
No, not like crack that.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Mr. Kohn and Mr. Karr were not in town on the evening.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
They left sometime late in the afternoon.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
We were holding hearings over us

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
in the courthouse of Holy Square.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, incidentally,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I don't call it a crime to make a little mistake of this.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Adam, what do you think?

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Adam himself was not in New York on the 16th, sir.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
If he was in New York on the 16th.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Well, in any event, Mr. Kohn and Mr. Karr

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
were not in the 10th of the hearings.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
The 10th of the hearings are revolving at the 16th.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
In any event, Mr. Kohn and Mr. Karr

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
were in New York on the 16th throughout the day.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
No, not throughout the day.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Until the hearings adjourned.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
No, they left sometime in the afternoon.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Well, they were in the hearings the next morning.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
They were there the next morning.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Have you the records of the hearings

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
on the 16th handing senator?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I do not, but I'm sure we can get them here.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
I have them here.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Mr. Kohn, that's a couple.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
I assure you that you will have a chance to check my accuracy

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
against the records so that I will read and chat with you.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
This I am reading from Senate Resolution 40 Part 6.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
It's headed S, RES 40, very much for a familiar to you

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
than the Part 6.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
On page 237, it says Wednesday, December 16, 1953.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Summary of such a video on investigations of the Committee

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
on Government Operations.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Among those present are the following.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Present also is the phrase,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Roy M. Cohen-Chief Council,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Francis Tinkar Executive Director,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
and Daniel G. Buckley Executive Council.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Is that refresher recollection that they're having in there?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I told you that they had been there until

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
sometime in the afternoon Mr. Adams was there.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Also, I do not recall what time John came in.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, I think he came in sometime in the afternoon.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
I know he stayed after Mr. Well, I want to Mr. Carly.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm more interested at the moment in Mr. Cohen and Mr. Car.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Now, I take 281 of the same documents.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
It says, whereupon at 4.15 p.m.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
The Committee reads this until the following day 30 December 17, 1953

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
at 10.30 a.m.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
So that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Carly were with you until 4.15 p.m.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Where they now?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I don't think so.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
The public questions are at all when they're expected to question.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Well, each and every of that public question is...

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
If you were normal, we normally didn't put work at 4.15 p.m.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
If you were looked at page 280 and page it gets lost as I slip it over,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
you will see what I'm talking about.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
And when you look at it, I'd like to have it back.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Yes, you may, sir.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
We had a public question, didn't we?

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
First, I'm going to send that exact one session after that.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
You just remember what time you left that time.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
How do we even get to that?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
How do we even get to that?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
We have a public question.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Yes, ma'am.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Mr. Wells, follow your attention to something that you obviously missed here.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
I say we're not going to executive session for the benefit of the members of the press.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
There will be no press conference anything after the executive session.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
We'll run out of the late.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
We have a great number of witnesses to hear.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
If I may, I'll ask now the room to clear it so that we can go into executive session.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
The public session will resume at 10.30 tomorrow morning.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
So the 4.15 recess, or the public session, we then went into executive session.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Well, Mr. Colton said an executive session, as I recall, quite a long time.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Mr. Colton and Mr. Cai with you.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
You want to go to the floor?

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Mr. Wells, I have a...

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I have a...

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
I asked Mr. Colton and they told me they were there after the beginning of the executive session.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
The last left-door class here began.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Well, that might well be.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
In that event, they were there as late as 4.15, which is the time that the public session ends.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
And for some little period, at least their after, while the executive session began.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
That is their recollection.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I thought they had left the...

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
The question is satisfactory to me.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
From the executive session.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
I take it you would not be after be running an executive session without one or the other of them,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
was you, Senator?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yes.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
And it is that your recollection that they both left sometime after 4.15.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
That's right.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
Now, at some time, on that day, as I understand your testimony, you dictated over the telephone,

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
the memorandum that became number six in the printed document, from which we have worked here.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
That is right.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
At what time?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Did you dictate that?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
At what time of day?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Mr. Rolstein would have no idea.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
I call my office, constantly, and I keep no diary.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I have no idea what time of day.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Let me see the record.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
5.25.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh, one more time.

06:57.000 --> 07:08.000
Well, I assume that strike it out.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
How late, when you were out of town, how late is the...

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Mid-Adisclin in your office?

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Sometimes, at 6.00, sometimes 7.00, sometimes 8.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Sometimes 9.00, and Mary works very, very long on your large.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, my...

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
I often call at the 9.30 of my time.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
It could be that my secretary is listening to me.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
My observation is that when I'm out of town, you can barely have to go home, about the time's business ends.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Is that inaccurate as human's and fiscal?

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
No, Mary just goes to work until she cleans up all the work that she thinks must have cleaned up for that day.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
Well, can you not help me at all as to the probable time of day when you dictated this memorandum's signature?

07:53.000 --> 08:03.000
No, if I were to guess it, I'd be purely a guess, but I would guess it was during the time when I had come to eat in the evening.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
That might be 6.30, it might be 7 o'clock.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
I don't even know whether we had an evening's question last night, it seems to me.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I don't think we did.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
You know what?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Yes, but it's a problem.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
It's a problem around 6.30.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
You know what became of this memorandum after you dictated it was the sentinel you are?

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm going to say if the time is important, we can check with the telephone company, and I'm sure they will be able to give us the exact time of the call.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Well, we may have some records to help you.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I don't think time is enormously important.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
I assume this was dictated some time around, you know, not later than say 6 or 7 o'clock.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It's quite a minute.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Wait a minute.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Wait a minute.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
What happened?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Would that be a fair assumption?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:10.000 --> 09:19.000
Well, would it be, now this may be corrected if the telephone calls help you, would it be a fair assumption that it was probably dictated by 6 or 7 o'clock?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
I say it to be fairly against.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I don't remember what time.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
No, mine.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
If it be after the executive session, oh, it won't be around 6.30.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Seven o'clock.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I might have an eighth minute, and I am.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Now, we can get the phone slip on that.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Perhaps we can.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.000
Now, Senator, can you tell us whether or not, and I just, the record seems to me ambiguous on this point, but I think you will know,

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
was the memorandum stayed up to New York, so you would have it as a matter to discuss the next day.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
No, or kept in Washington.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.500
It does not send up New York, in fact, I doubt very much, but that this memorandum has ever seen them as their car, Mr. Cohn, because the next

09:58.500 --> 10:01.000
noon we had such a very extensive discussion about this.

10:01.000 --> 10:11.000
It would have been a waste of time to show them this memorandum. The reason it was a bit of dictated was because I was leaving town the next day, and I wanted to discuss their time.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
Incidentally, as you're leaving town the next day, that's the day that appears on the memorandum because it wasn't transcribed the night you telephoned it in.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
From frankly, and very...

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And where did you go to the next day, Senator?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I spoke to...

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Mr. Cohn will have to leave.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I think it was Chicago, I don't know.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And it's what time did you leave?

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
I think you went to the long art that you not, as you came up town with Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Adams.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yes, sir.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
You were also at what time? You left the hotel to go to a plane.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
I called it when some number one's worked off, but again I wasn't able to give it exact time.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Thank you.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Now would you look at the memorandum, Senator?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And up.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
That's Mr. James Juliana talking to Senator McCarty now.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Present to us, Senator.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Would you look at the memorandum now, which is number six and then is December 17th, Senator?

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
No, the opening phrase of it is a follow-up.

11:16.000 --> 11:26.000
In talking to John Adams today, I learned that General Law, who, as you recall, cooperates fully with the committee,

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
in exposure of the verses that Fort Monmouth is about to be revealed in his command, really.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
Let me read that first pause again in talking to John Adams today.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
What's going to be you told us?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
That you knew that on November 24 and 25.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
I told you that subject was brought up, so I suddenly believed in that.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
And that they, and that Adams then said they were going to kick him out the next day.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I didn't so tough times.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, Mr. Cohn did.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Right.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And you believed Mr. Cohn's testimony?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I believe Mr. Cohn's testimony.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
And you had a conversation with Adams about it on November 24, the night of November 24,

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
which resulted in a telephone conversation in your presence on the 25th.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Is that right, sir?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I had a conversation with Mr. Cohn's, right?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
What's the time that's inspiring?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Are you saying, John?

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
The Jackson Sussex and the Sheriff House of the Senator Smelleth.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Am I right?

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
I just want to ask one of the other things that I'm going to do.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I'm taking the...

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Senator McCrack and Wynn, the Committee convenes, is customary for the official report here.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
To note the presence of every member and every staff member who is present, is that correct?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I'm sorry, I was really in the loop for somebody to pass by.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Yeah, Wynn, the committee section is convened.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
It's customary for the official report here to note the presence, right?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
While the every member and every staff member will maybe pass.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Right.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Now, if and when.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
A member or a staff member should leave the meeting at any time.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I think it's not actually noted on the record.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Can I tell you why I missed your first question?

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
I just got to know here from somebody saying that Mary said,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
hit me for a raise, or this particular moment after we testified about it a long time.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Oh, right.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Well, I just want to be sure that that's the...

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
That's the...

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
The record normally shows who is there at the beginning of the hearing.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
However, if a son of her leaves, or someone leaves during the hearing,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
or if someone comes in during the hearing,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
normally the official report does not...

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Right that down, I think that's right.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
The right thing.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
So that's a...

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
What he has noted at the beginning of the hearing, you know,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
a physical report of the hearing.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
It would not be conclusion at all that those things can be put in place.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Well, they're hearing it, you know.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
No, I just want to make sure that that's actually...

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
No, I'm sorry, but I have no meaning at all.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
That's all.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
That's all.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Not strong.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm not...

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
If I don't fully sense it, there's some questions.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
We just throw up the phone matter so we can run into something else.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
We can just...

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I'm taking the organ care.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
It's a health...

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Well, I'll read that.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Suddenly I read the second sentence of that document.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
I questioned Adam very closely on this in a friendly manner.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
And find that the only reason he can give us is that Lawton embarrassed the military

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
by helping to make it possible for us to expose the incredibly bad security set up

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
which has existed as far as Mama was.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
With Senator, Adam's had told you that on the night of November 24th.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
No, Adam's had never admitted to the anti-S and the middle of it up to this date.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
This is a resume of what I Arsenal guessed from my first name, Adam.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
But on the night of November 24th, he was asking why they were going to do it.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
I did.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
And he told you?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
He told me...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
What do you also told me in a 16th?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Well, how many told you on the 24th?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Two weeks, I made a statement to him.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Well, I'd like to know what he told you on the night of the 24th.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I'll tell you.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Please do sir.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Nothing else?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
No, thank you, ma'am.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Thank you.

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
On both the 24th and on the 16th, John tried to follow the sections.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
Well, they were breaking this journal because he had mentioned that a staff meeting

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
that certain of those brothers and the majority of those, and we exposed

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
because of communist action, both in certain colleges and universities.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
It was conversation.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Mr. Adams knew and I knew that the owner was never breaking the law firm because of his

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
cooperation with the committee.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Don't fuss about that.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Where were you with that?

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
I was when you questioned him closely as you said you did on December 16th.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
And I don't remember the room number.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
It was in the courthouse at Holy Square, New York.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Who was there?

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
Mr. Adams and I were there.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I don't think there was anyone else present.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Neither Mr. Cone nor Mr. Cone.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
So that's the evening of the Cone with the Cone of the last?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yes.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Now, isn't it a fact cemetery?

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
It is true that you learned this whole story on November 24th and 25th.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I have heard the...

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I've made my Miss Adams on November 24th.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Including the reasons that's why they were trying to do it and including the

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
mom row of some that you thought were false.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
That's right.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
But at that time, as I said, I didn't believe that...

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Well, Senator, they were coming to say that they had fallen through the

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
blocks.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
On December 16th, I was more firmly convinced that perhaps they were going to go through it

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
on the 17th.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I may say I was rather firmly convinced.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
Yes, but you dictate this memorandum to Washington on the night of the 16th.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
That's right.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And it wasn't strictly accurate.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
When you said you were talking to Don Adams today, I learned that General Lawman,

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
who did you recall, cooperated fully with the committee in exposure of subversive

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
support, monmouth, it's about to be relieved of his command.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Not that, sir.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
If it weren't highly accurate, it would say I'm talking to Don Adams today,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I learned for the second time.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Is that not correct?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Yes, accurate, Mr. Lawman.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Isn't it correct?

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Wouldn't it be correct to say I learned for the second time?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
No, I think this is a...

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Can anything be clearer?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
I think this is a completely accurate resume as the...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Can any...?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
The testimony...

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
Man, I'm famous, sir, well, but the other day, I think it's a good analysis of this.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
The other day, I heard a...

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
A man...

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I'm sorry, man.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
I heard a man who's being impregnated around the further Congress.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
So they pressed conference for half an hour.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
He said, I'm not going around.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
I will not run.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
He gave all the good reasons in the world.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
When he got through, a newsman walked up to one of the men with a presence.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And said, well, he said, he said, yes.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Well, that was a correct resume as the...

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Of the news conference.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
I think this is a very accurate resume of...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
The information I got from Mr. Adam.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
But isn't it a fact senator that on December 24th, you will learn...

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
On November 24th, you will learn that General Lawman was about to be released in his command.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
On November 24th, Mr. Adam made a test that they would release in his command.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
That's right.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
And that's all you're doing on the 7th and 16th, isn't it?

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
On the 24th, I didn't believe that they could do this.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
And you didn't buy the...

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
By the 16th, and he brought it up again,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
he gave me the definite date of January 1st.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
While I still wasn't fully convinced, I was impressed that they might show through with this.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
And you didn't make a memorandum of it when he told you the first time, did you?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
To wait on November 24th.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
No, because Mr....

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
When you got around, you were leaking.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Well, don't make any such a tone, it was present at that time.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
So I wasn't making a memorandum of Mr. Cohn.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I just...

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Now I have that answer, Ed.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
You asked me if I made a memorandum of the 24th.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
I still lost the chair, but I had to be...

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
A roll call goes to the members of President,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
where he has to get over the right way,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
to have this roll call doubled in gas, after no reason,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and when we can be in about 10 minutes.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I'll be right back.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I'll be right back.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I'll be right back.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I'll be right back.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I'll be right back.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
You have just heard, Chair, the Chairman, declare a brief recess,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
so that the members of this committee can go over here and vote on the floor of the Senate.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
The ABC Television Network is bringing you the complete hearings

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
into the McCarthy Army controversy.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And there you see the senators lead the caucus room,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
to go over to the floor of the Senate,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
to vote on a measure not before that party.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
That means the Senate is going to be in the late 14th of the year,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
because there was a...

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Another of those resolutions,

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
concerning the Son of the North Koreanthay being introduced,

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
and I was asked to stay over there until it was disclosed

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
and I was asked to look over there.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
Well, there is a rule that the Chairman himself and Poland is finding

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
self-reliant, the opening morning,

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
not to conduct any of the hearings in the absence of representations from both parties.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
I wonder if Mr. Duckett, if you would try to locate one of our Democratic colleagues.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
They were here a moment ago, and they were all gone,

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
and I don't wonder if we can be in the committee until we have bipartisan representations.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Well, I think this opportunity to ask,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
if you know whether or not more votes are imminent to that end,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
we thought there were, but I think it's not now.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So I think we'll be able to run on,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and I might say to the Senate,

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
because of the folks in the test score and the radio,

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
the committee is resolved to go through tonight until we've been told

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
that there's no way we have to run on the late.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Mr. Duckett, are you looking for a Democrat?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Yes, I am.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
They reported to the committee,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and the rules today.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Now is the case.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
That's a lot of votes.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Senator McCarr, a month has...

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
I think we asked him to use the call of the...

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Committee back to the committee until the Democrats,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
first time the McCarthy now.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I just hear that from you.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Who had reached that? You want to go over here?

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
There's about the same and one of those points.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
A layman.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
They reported to those days.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Sorry, I'm not surprised.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
May I come to order?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
We're worried about the matter.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
The exact same here.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
We have a bipartisan representation made in chair.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Remind the audience.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I assume that most of you will hear what is before the meeting.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Around this final day of the hearing,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
we are especially hopeful that the audience will maintain

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
the no-branded cooperation

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
as the main one, the capital for the Democratic Senate,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
yet to now plan for the audience.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Showing force to the rules,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
victory to the end of the hearing.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
You remove the legally, but politely and firmly from the room,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
and you, by guest, can violate the terms under which they came.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Mr. Welk, so you can keep your advice as many as six minutes left

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
so you have to come and go around,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
who will be surrounded by the vote of the House,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
who may proceed to your effect.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
How much time left on this one?

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Senator, I was inquiring about...

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
Memorand of number six, the one of December 17, 1953.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
May I now attract your attention to the last two lines of the Memorand.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
It's either of you talked about Stevens before I do.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
I suggest that you bring these facts to his attention,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
in that he may not be aware of this situation.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
Did you contemplate that Mr. Carr might be seeing Secretary Stevens before you did?

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Memorand would seem to so indicate...

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
...where you also contemplating that Mr. Carr might see him before you did?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Mr. Memorand would seem to so indicate...

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
...well, was that what you were contemplating that Mr. Carr would actually be seeing the Secretary of the Army before you did?

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Well, when I say a few there, you talked about Stevens before I do.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
I suggest you bring these facts to his attention, that's exactly what I meant.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Yes.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
...but if they saw him before I did...

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
...he may not be aware of this situation.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
What was there about Lawton, Mr. Stevens was not aware of.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
I don't know.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
You certainly can't take this to anything about Lawton, Stevens didn't know, can you?

23:52.000 --> 24:01.000
I still have difficulty believing that Lawton Stevens will try to break a man whom he described as a great general.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
No, because he was worked with our committee.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
I have difficulty, I think it's a matter that...

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
...at that time I felt it's if he's taken up with Lawton.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Difficult is quite different.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Sir, from your point of view.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I can't see what.

24:16.000 --> 24:24.000
There was about the Lawton situation of which Stevens could possibly have been unaware, can you?

24:24.000 --> 24:31.000
Mr. Melkwell, one day you've criticized me not having brought matters above Stevens' attention.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
The day you've criticized me for bringing him to his attention, I tell you this should be brought to me to his attention.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Well, you thought it should be brought to his attention.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
May Lawton's situation.

24:41.000 --> 24:48.000
Well, Mr. Senator McCarthy, if he's been having Friday in the Lawton's way, why he's stirring up the trouble?

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
I don't agree that Mr. Stevens is moving party in any of this.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
What do you mean?

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
I think there is someone else.

24:56.000 --> 25:04.000
You mean this excess senator Seth, your boy, Cole and Kyle either of them.

25:05.000 --> 25:12.000
Where's the force to tell Secretary Stevens something about the Lawton's situation of which he was unaware?

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
First let me correct the part of your question.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
You said your boy, Kyle and Cole and I say that you're a man, Kyle.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
Let me say that Kyle and Cole and I are more men.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Well, I got to the point.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
There are two men and I've been contacted for a long time.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I had them grow up before you said that.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Let's call them man.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Now what is there that those two men have?

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Let's do that now.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Now what is your question?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Don't you know Senator?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
What's your question?

25:42.000 --> 25:50.000
My question is, what was there that Mr. Cole and Mr. Kyle could convey to Secretary Stevens?

25:50.000 --> 25:57.000
As a result of your addicating this memorandum, that Secretary Stevens didn't know three times over.

25:57.000 --> 26:04.000
Mr. Welch is very clear that I was adjusting.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
They convey to Mr. Stevens the information that the memorandum is.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm not supposed to get it.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Would you like to let your addiness rest there?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
But is my answer correct?

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
No, as I understand it, you never thought.
