00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I don't follow you at all Mr. Wilson.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
All right, I think you're going to do it.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
I asked you something else, Senator,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
and would you think it over a moment?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
If I'll think it over as long as you want to,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
may I say that I think that any person in the government

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
who knows of communism and knows of prison,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
who knows there's no action being taken,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I think he should get impatient,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
extremely impatient.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I think he should bring the information

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
to the government.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I think he should bring the information

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
to the government.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I think he should bring the information

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
to the proper committee.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
One other question, Senator,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
and I guess I won't charm you with it.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It makes me a little...

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Are you ever, in any sense,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
uneasy about this system of informants

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
on which your committee relies so much?

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I am uneasy because more people in government

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
don't have the loyalty, don't have the guts.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
To give the proper committee the information

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
which we should hear.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Do you understand, my thing,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
that I personally wish there were other good ways

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
to do it, the innovation to having a...

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
If you buy on each other,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
it seems a little uncomfortable.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
If you could suggest Mr. Welch,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
how we can expose these communists

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
in a more delicate fashion,

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
if you can suggest some way of getting information

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
other than the co-workers of Twitter,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
if you can suggest Mr. Welch

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
that we have exposed a single communist

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
which should not have been exposed,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
then maybe we can get on with this fussing

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
but up to this point Mr. Welch,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
as I listen to your questioning,

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
you are intimating that there is something wrong

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
about the head of an investigating committee

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
and I was elected head of the committee

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
by unanimous vote of the summit.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
It's the watchdog committee if we can follow that.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Our job Mr. Welch,

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
our job is to dig out how meanism, corruption,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
treason, anything which is improper.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Now, when you suggest that a person is a spy

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
because he gives us

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
the represent of the people,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
the information of wrongdoing Mr. Welch,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
I think inadvertently doing a great disservice

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
to those loyal government employees.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Senator, it is not my business to blow

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
the viewful of other people in government

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
but the administration does boast of the fact

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
that quietly and steadily and surely

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
they too are moving out,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
communist and communist synthesizers.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You must have heard that, haven't you?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes, I think the right...

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Must be true, isn't it?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I think the work here to this administration

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
has been rather impressive.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Now Senator,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
since I am determined to reach at least

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
something in your examination

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
that seemed to be of some importance,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I wish the turn to the matter of general law.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
You will recall, Senator,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
that there were two sets of dates

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
in respect to general law,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
which seemed to me of importance.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
The first two sets of dates

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
on November 24 and 25,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
and then,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
November 16 and 17,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
do you agree to that, sir?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I just want to get to the chase

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
to Mr. Welch and First appearance

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
and getting that I...

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I missed what you said, Mr. Welch.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I think he first appeared

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
in October 14, before David's office.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
To which I am attracting your attention, sir,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
and about which I wish to talk to you,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
are the dates when Mr. Adams came to New York

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
and talked to you

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
and certainly on the 16th and 17th

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
or on the 17th, talked to you in this time,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Mr. Cohen,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
and when he came to New York on November 24 and 25,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
and talked to you and Mr. Cohen about general law.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes, sir.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
You remember those two sets of dates?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I recall those two sets of dates.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, I think...

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Would you wait till I get my memory in them on that?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Indeed, sir. I think I should like you to have it.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I think you'll want to question them.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
The memory in them,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
is probably lost in America.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Yes, Mr. Welch?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I know.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Have you?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Have you such memory in it before your knowledge will aid you

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
in refreshing your recollection?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I have a memory on them,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
dated December 17, 1953.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, that's the one that was one of your relief,

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
America.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
That is one of the dictated on the evening of the 16th.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Yes, I'm turning our attention first,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Senator, to the dates November 24 and 25.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
You remember those dates?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I remember that.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
In this connection,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
and with Mr. Adams in New York

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
and talking about general law,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
the telephone call from Adams first,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
and you were opposed to what your attitude would be.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
If he were relieved and the telephone call from Adams

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
to Stevens and all that story,

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
are you familiar with that, sir?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
That was November 24.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
It's up to second, I think, that we had...

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I didn't really have a connection to that.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I suggest that you confer with Mr. Cohn

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
or whatever you think you need.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
The earliest date of the law.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I'm sorry.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Senator MacI, I think, conferring with this Chief Council.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Mr. Roy Cohn.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Senator McClallon.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Senator Simonton.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I just want to get the dates straight here.

06:26.000 --> 06:36.000
The 24th date was revolved

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
with the date that I...

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Many brought...

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
That's right.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
...answering some statements made by the former president.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
That's right.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
And I think you talked to Mr. Adams

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
on that day or on the next day or perhaps both.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Mr. Adams and Larry Cohn came to the studio.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Right.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Well, I was waiting to brought him here.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
If you would look, Senator,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I can tell you a place or two to look in the record

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
where you would get some...

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I don't have to write.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm going to write a lecture.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Twenty-four-one-six-five.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Volume 22.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I know.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
4048.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
4048.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
This is Jessica Cohn's testifying.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And you have served his name appearing

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
at the very top of the page to use Senator.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Then the second time down four inches.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
And the second paragraph of that statement by Mr. Cohn

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I will read to you.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So I'll read to the tail end of the first paragraph

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
and which your Adams is supposed to have said to Mr. Cohn.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I have some news which I am going to have to break gently

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
to Senator McCartney.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And then this comment on the test.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I ask him what it was.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
He said the need.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
We are now at a point where we are going to get down

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
to business about getting rid of law.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
He said he had worked for Mr. Stevens.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
And the state plans to relieve general law

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
and that he has command the next day.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Would you call for the minister for your reading?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I thought you were with me.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Let's go over it again Senator.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Because I do want you to have it in mind.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
You're starting the...

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Let's go over it again.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
This is Jessica Cohn saying I want to go over

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
just to last and ever again.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Mr. Cohn is saying and you will see a poll.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
I have some news about the middle of the page.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And I'm looking for it.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Are you ready for me Senator?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm ready.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
You're quite proper that you should ask Mr. Cohn.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I wouldn't plan on ever completely ready for it.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Right.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Right where I would say the middle of the page

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
is a quotation from Mr. Cohn's testimony.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Forting Adams and to this effect.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
I have some news which I'm going to have to break down

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
by this Senator McCarthy.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
You with me now Senator.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
You with me now.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I asked him what it was.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
He said to me quote,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
we know our attic point where we are going to get down

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
to business about getting rid of law.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
He said he had worked for Mr. Stevens

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
and that they planned to relieve general law

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
and that he was command the next day.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Now would you turn the page over to 4049?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Are you there sir?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
I am.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Now running your eye up from the bottom of the page

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
until you see the name Mr. Cohn.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
And you see the words the first thing here.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
The first thing he said on November 24th,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
he might have given detail I don't know.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Was it Mr. Stevens that made concrete plans

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
to remove general law?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
That Mr. Stevens had it very much on his mind

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
and was very anxious to get rid of general law.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And intended to do so,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
hoped to be able to do so the next day.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
But the first wine Mr. Adams

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
to brought the sausage with Senator McCarthy

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
and why to know whether or not Senator McCarthy

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
would make a public issue out of General Lawton's dismissal.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
For those two sections of the record senator,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
plus your talk with Mr. Cohn,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
refresh your recollection as to those two dates

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
of November 24th, 25th and respected General Lawton.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Well, I don't need senator Price.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
You now have it well in mind, is that right?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I think fairly well in mind.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Where would you say that John Adams

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
first spoke to you about this then plan

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
to remove General Lawton the next day?

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Whether that's a broadcast or after the broadcast?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Mr. Wilson, frankly, don't know

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
just where and when John Adams first brought up

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
the subjects I know that Adams

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
made it clear shortly after Mr. Lawton appeared

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
the first time.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Well, I'm talking to the way we finished.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I know you want the information.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I'm trying to give you all I can.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
I can't give you a date or a particular time of the day.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Mr. Lawton appeared on October 14th, I believe.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
That's right.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
And at that time, I think that was the day he was asked

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
why he did not get the people of communist records

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
out of Fort Monmouth before we started our investigation.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
And I can't quote him, quote him first, but in a fact,

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
he said it was not until this committee started to act.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
From that time onwards, it was very clear

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
that Mr. Adams was not happy with Mr. Lawton.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Now you'll ask me to say when, where, what he said.

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
I frankly can't give you any specific time or place

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
because John Adams and I and Ryan Frank,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
others people had lunch almost every day.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
We had dinner many evenings during these hearings.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
And it was a thing that just sort of grew

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
and I knew him the night of the 24th when I was over

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
to make this broad gas dancing Mr. Truman.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
Mr. Adams then brought up the question of the eminent

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
removal of Mr. Lawton.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
Well, while they're going around and while we have the softening

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
of the gas for him and his tenders from my left.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
Is Mr. Cohen? Mr. Wells here, no comment.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
Senator, there's no question here pending.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I'm sure you would miss the process.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Which has to do with whether you heard it morning or noon

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
or night of the 24th.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I do wish to know what your recollection is

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
as to when you heard it if you can come on recollection.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
And my intention is to strike that out.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
At what time of the night or of the evening was your broadcast?

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
Oh, I believe it was 9 o'clock, it's 30.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Not really 11 o'clock, it's an interesting time.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
How long a broadcast?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah, an hour or a think.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And that's that, you and Mr. Adams and others,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
is that right?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
And it's Cohen and who else if anyone?

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
And we had a number of people there for a number of people.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I think Frank Carr among them, what they're not.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I think Frank was there.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
You weren't there, were you?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I think Frank Carr and Mr. Cohen were the only members of staff.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And where were you?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
They're so difficult about saying where you were.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
It's there.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
None whatsoever.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Is that the broadcast in session?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I don't know the address.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I'll give up the test for everything.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, no in any event.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
At least.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
At least that early.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
As I understand it, it's the test only both for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Carr.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
And now for you.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And perhaps earlier for you.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
At least on that evening or by the time that the whole day was ended.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
You have learned at UNO that this proposed relief of General Law in the Court,

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
was certainly imminent in the sense of being hotly considered by Steven.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I knew they were threatening this.

14:52.000 --> 15:00.000
And frankly, Mr. Welch did not believe that they were going to do it.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Well, I only...

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
That isn't what they could.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
I've read you to Mr. Cohen's testimony to the effect on in two places

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
that he said they were considering making the removal of the very next day.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
There's no question he said that, but as I...

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
I talked to Mr. Adam so often.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
He had tried very good salesman, John,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
and he had tried so often to find some of these hearings.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
But I never knew when he was bluffing when he was serious.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
Well, in any event you knew full well that he appeared to be instructed by Steven

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
to find out what your attitude would be.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
If he was afraid you of you here, they busted law.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Is that right, sir?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Uh, he appeared to be, but, ma'am, I say, uh...

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
But I did not say to these threats too seriously.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
Well, you took it seriously enough so you stated what you would do with it.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Did it? Did you not, Senator?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Well, I'm very sorry, Mr. Welch.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I'm a little embarrassed. If you was referred to having me wait,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
well, I see you talking to them to call, and I'm very glad to do so.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Uh, would you mind?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I may say I will have to talk to Mr. Cohn.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Johnson may about the law, because most of the conversations on law,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
and the world is in the same as Mr. Cohn.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yes.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Now would you meet that last question, Mr. reporter?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
The fire will be in question.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I know.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
What?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
You're not sure, sir?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Well, I think it's what you were doing today.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Did you not find her?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Do you understand that question?

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't think I have stated, but I don't think I have stated what I was doing.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
Well, in any of that you indicated that you wouldn't keep quiet, did you not?

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
I don't believe I talked about keeping quiet.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
I made it very clear that I knew that if they broke law,

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
it would be because of his cooperation with the committee.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
And that you were going to raise the right of the law?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I never raised the right of the law.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Well, you were going to do something in true McCarthy style

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
to make it into just, to indicate you didn't approve of firing law.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Isn't that right, sir?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You and I have my differ of laws.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Let's prove which are these stylists.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Well, I'm there, my sheriff.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It's more than a quiet perimeter.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm just a young person.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
I'm getting an article.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
No, I frankly didn't say too much attention to that kind of reflection.

17:22.000 --> 17:36.000
But if you said it, I let John know that I would consider any action taken against Mr. Lawson.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
As a result, for a first law operation.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
And in your presence on the next afternoon,

17:43.000 --> 17:53.000
John Adams, telephone, secretary Steven, and said in substance.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Yes, sir.

17:56.000 --> 18:03.000
And said in substance, you aren't going to get off easy with the Fenetary if you fire law.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
Yes, I was president when Mr. Adams told the secretary.

18:08.000 --> 18:17.000
And I don't call the conversation except the indicator that I realized the reason for the substance breaking law.

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
And it follows from what we have just testified to, does it not senator, that on that occasion.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.000
Whatever you said, was it not to shut Adams up for at least a while, was that right?

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
No, I frankly couldn't believe the Bob Stevens.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
After he had been telling us he was going to cooperate with us.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
After I knew that he had called Lawson and told him to cooperate at least to a certain extent,

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
I couldn't conceive the Bob Stevens wanting to break Lawson for that cooperation.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
It's just a two-sided secretary.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.000
I frankly didn't say too much attention to it, but I didn't make it clear to Mr. Adams that I knew that if they...

19:00.000 --> 19:12.000
...Rose Lawson, that the only reason they were breaking him was because he did help us expose the people of Chameleon's records in the radar laboratory.

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
And if you were not going to keep quiet, you say dead breaking.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
I don't think we did just so that I would keep quiet enough.

19:22.000 --> 19:29.000
Apparently you must have glared at him enough or something so that on the 2050 call Stevens and said,

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
I think the senator will raise a rocket if you fire Lawson.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Mr. Jenkins, you've seen me for a long time. I don't think I'm glared at anyone.

19:38.000 --> 19:50.000
I was somewhat disturbed. I didn't believe that the Texas two-series, I didn't involve Stevens to do this.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
I made it very clear that I, you say, dead, I knew the reason for it.

19:56.000 --> 20:04.000
I don't think we raised the question of what I would say. I believe in President Adams that he could have soon...

20:04.000 --> 20:12.000
...to the favor to break his general because they helped us expose Chameleon's records that I would have discussed that.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
And very frankly, I would have.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
Well now let's go forward to the next day because this batter came up again, did it not?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It came up quite often.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
And it came up just as strong as ever on the 16th and 17th of December, didn't it?

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I think the 17th was the day it came up stronger.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
Well, that's the day on which say we had to ride a town after the Varsin and Gaster, is that right?

20:43.000 --> 20:52.000
Just let me say this, but on the 16th, I think for the first time, and I made a mistake on the 16th,

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
I believe for the first time that President Adams gave us the date that they were going to release the last.

20:58.000 --> 21:06.000
No, no, because on the 24th and 25th, Mr. Connerty gave you the date of the very next day.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
I...

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
No, I read that to you again, sir.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
We didn't read it, and I heard the testimony.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
And that was a very sudden and very common mistake, wasn't it?

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
I don't... I'm not sure... I don't evaluate much of the testimony.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
He's... he's got a lot of...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I'm not sure about a memory, I think, any man I know.

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
If he says they were going to release the next day, why I would abide by the act I frankly don't recall,

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
but he says the next day, I know that on the 16th, he said January 1st.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Now, Mr. Conner testified that he said the next day,

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
I am sure that Mr. Conner's memory would be good on that.

21:46.000 --> 21:55.000
As I say, Mr. Conner, Mr. Adams had much more conversation about this, but you remember when I started talking to you about 24th, 25,

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
I read you from page 404A, where Mr. Conner testified,

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
folks, that they planned to release General Lawton of his command the next day.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
You remember my reading after you said that?

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
I remember you reading it in the man's saying that...

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
I know that he was threatening that they would release Lawton.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
I personally don't recall what he said the next day, but Mr. Conner said it was the next day,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I am sure that Mr. Conner's right.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
And it turns up again, Mr. Conner's testimony, which I read to you here,

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
the 4 on page 4049, where Mr. Conner testified,

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
that Mr. Steven said it very much on his mind, and was very anxious to get rid of General Lawton and intended to do so,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
folks, to be able to do so the next day.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
Now, can we have it quite firmly fixed, this is the second time I have been over,

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
that on November 24 and 25 on November 24,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Adam just talking about kicking Lawton out the next day.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Mr. Richard, thank you.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
Well, Mr. Sir, well, I'm very sorry.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Mr. Wilker, well...

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
I can only tell you when I remember, I know it would be very easy for me to say yes,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
I remember all the things that Roy has remembered.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
I knew that they were talking about an eminent breaking of Lawton.

23:16.000 --> 23:25.000
Now, as I say, much more of the conversation was with Mr. Conner's problems with me.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
It Roy Conner said that the Christ Booker moving the next day, I'm sure that's right.

23:29.000 --> 23:38.000
The first specific date that I had fixed in my mind was on the 16th of December,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
when I called my office, and I had to stick to the memorandum.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
At that time, he gave me the date January 1st.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
I understand that you say that, and I'll come back to that in a moment.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
And before we got type-tracked, Senator, I thought I heard you say that you had been mistaken

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
about a date or about someone's presence in New York, and I think I know what you wanted to tell me,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
and what you now do so.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
There's nothing I want to tell you.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Well, do it, too. I just have an answer to your question.

24:07.000 --> 24:13.000
Well, I thought you had in mind that you testified in direct that on the 16th of December,

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Mr. Conner and Mr. Colton were not in town. Did you have that in mind?

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
Mr. Conner, Mr. Colton were in town during the day.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
We held hearings over at Holy Square in the morning.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Yes, we have.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
We held hearings over at Holy Square during the day.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
They were not there in the evening, and I called Mr. Adam and several times,

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
and I'm trying to locate Mr. Conner's, Mr. Conner's also to talk to Mr. Adam about the loss.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And Matt here, principally, talks about the loss in the matter.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I'm 10 at 10 in the game tonight.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
I have had, and then the problem is going to be my life.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
Mr. Conner, back to you, Mr. Walsh, for another 10 minutes.
