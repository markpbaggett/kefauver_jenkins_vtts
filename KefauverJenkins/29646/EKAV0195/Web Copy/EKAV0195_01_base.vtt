WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Can I have a piece, I'm the order?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Carol began the afternoon session by welcoming our guest to the committee

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
room this afternoon and advising those who have not been here before about

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
standing committee rules that there are to be no audible manifestations of

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
approval or disapproval of any kind at any time by our guests in the audience.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
The officers in charge of the meeting have standing instructions from the committee

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
to politely but immediately remove from the committee room any of our guests who

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
violate the terms by which they enter the room which included respect for the

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
committee rules not to engage in any audible manifestations of any type.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm happy to say that we have had virtually 100% co-operations from the audience and

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
better than that from the officers in charge throughout the hearings and we can

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
continue to believe that we will enjoy that type of co-operations in all events

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
along as you respect that rule of the committee you are welcome as I get.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
We concluded this morning that I guess we would have called a new witness

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
potential that's right then would you call a new witness we had concluded with

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
the chairman this time I decided to call a new witness Colonel Murray who has not been

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
told.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Mr. Chairman, could I say a word about let's just say this before we begin.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Mr. Jackson said this morning that he would like to have Colonel Blue call.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I would like to report direct to you Mr. Jackson that Colonel Blue came to the

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Pentagon and it being seen by a position he has every reason to think that

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
the petition will say that he can testify at three.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
You were good enough to say that if he were to come into the rule you would interrupt

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
whatever witnesses on this stand so that he may go on.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And I have told Colonel Blue that if the doctor says he may testify at an

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
quite competent he will he'd come direct to this table.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I would only agree with the committee to interrupt whatever testimony that is

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
so that Colonel Blue can testify if he goes to the police.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Thank you, kind.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I have a question that I'm expanding a little bit there and you may stand out of

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
me before it, sir.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
You found me quite a testimony about the given testimony so hold to that nothing

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
but the truth they'll help you get.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I do.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
You'll let me see it.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm trying to defend this particular testimony as you deal with the

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
judge because we've got this one.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Will you please tell the committee your full name?

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
John F. T. Murray, what is your rank Lieutenant Colonel United States Thomas?

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
Sir Murray, I will ask you whether or not you have seen or examined certain

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
charts that were exhibited to the committee this morning and which appeared now

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
to be on exhibition at the other end of the table.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Perhaps.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
Please throw the committee who prepared those charts.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
The two charts on display at the end of the committee table was prepared by

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
Draftman whose name is Eugene Wood.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
He is employed in Monday his supervision I should say.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
He is a supervisor of Draftman.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
I do not know whether he could do this chart himself or had it done in the

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
fund his supervision.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
Under this supervision Colonel, where those charts get the other hand,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
generally mine.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
I will ask you the first to take this draft of the chart entitled,

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
G. David Shion with his serial number on it and I believe that he appears to be

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
covered up as that I've miscommed with you please.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Mr. Tom Mayer, please.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Please turn around this way just a little bit.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I can see it now.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Colonel Mary, I desire to examine you first with respect to the chart

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
now on exhibition and hidden, targeted G. David Shion US with the serial number

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
which I will get I'm unable to read their dismisses.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
What is that chart represent Colonel Murray?

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
The chart is the representation of David Shion's three months,

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
more or less basic training and four sticks and jerseys.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
If I may say to the state three months,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
more or less during November and December and January part of January.

05:07.000 --> 05:15.000
Now, Colonel, I want you to explain in detail that chart and particularly

05:15.000 --> 05:24.000
the month, the hearts of the chart which seem to have been painted or chopped in black

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
represent.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Contemporaneously with the publication of the event,

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
the first epitome graphically portrayed shine experience and four sticks

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
was Nishie.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.000
I saw a chart of the somewhat tight to the one now before you.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
When I was assigned to the Secretary Staff on 27th of March,

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
the chart was examined by me and other officers working with me.

06:05.000 --> 06:12.000
We use the records that have been provided for us by the parties of four sticks.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
How many found certain minor discrepancies?

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
We sent a picture of Rothschild through four sticks and had it brought up today.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
When the information was returned to us,

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
we then had this chart drawn up by a draftman in the Pentagon building.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
All right, Colonel, what news of black marks on this chart represents?

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And why are they today?

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
The black marks were on the first chart that I saw,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
the original prototype of this one.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
The pattern was continued when we brought the chart up today and made certain minor corrections.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Why the color blank was chosen?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
I don't know. I didn't choose.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Did you know who directed the making of the first chart that you saw?

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
Once I arrived up, you said you directed the making of the present chart now on exhibition.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
When the first chart was brought to my attention,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
I essentially used some way as an exhibit.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
If we ever brought these to pass into the open,

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
the second chart of this one used to be here now is merely a continuation of the project that was initiated.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Why the color blank and white was elected?

07:49.000 --> 07:57.000
I don't know. I thought it was a way of portraying graphically the time the shine was captured from the post.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
So, at criminal Marie, it said it's decidedly what it is to die and to represent it yet.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
The black marks indicating the time that the private time was awaiting the post.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Did that correct? Yes.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
And you see that this is a revision of the first one and a correction of the one you first saw.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
Based on a third domination of all the material which is submitted to us by the party to Fort Thich.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
And the one now hungry examination has before you had turned them in order to identify it.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
May I ask you now?

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
And as the first to file it, as we did, it should be effective on me.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
So that it will be in the record officially.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
And it will be treated as file as I am the judge which the chairman has alluded to the testimony of Colonel Murray.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
He still filed it so much.

08:50.000 --> 08:58.000
And Colonel, the black marks on the chart now before you represent the time the stated shine was the way it was proposed to Fort Thich.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
That is correct. It is not just.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Out of that, it is too well or not.

09:04.000 --> 09:15.000
Those black marks, it is in the time that Mr. Stein was the way from Fort Thich, on normal basis.

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
It includes all the time that he was away from Fort Thich including the period of subsequent to his induction.

09:23.000 --> 09:31.000
The period he spent in New York, the period when he had authorized that as well as the unauthorized that.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
Now there are items which ought to have a safari, I know that we know unauthorized.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Yes, there are certain normal cases to which each excited is entitled.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Are they not? Yes.

09:44.000 --> 09:52.000
And in the chart now before, there are black marks on the date of all the excited shine in New York.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Stein enjoyed his normal cases. That's correct. It is not correct.

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
Yes. Then in addition to the normal cases to which he and every other private are entitled.

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
There are black marks on the date upon which excited shine was the way on which we shall show.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
We say abnormal places as the result of request for him.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Yes. That's correct.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yes.

10:19.000 --> 10:26.000
And you're understanding, Colonel, that all of the things other than the normal days,

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
the normal places from private shine was the way he was the way as a result of leaving him back.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
This is a secretary of the Army just to have him, so Colonel Lann is that you are understanding.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
Since then, I believe that his absence from Fort Dick was probably covered by a pass given him by a company commander.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
After it has been checked when it was an abnormal request.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
As far as you know, Colonel Murray, and he did the year after, told me if he was not,

10:57.000 --> 11:04.000
that he was never a way at any time, except by proper authorization from his superior.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
That is correct, he is not.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
I do not know whether he was or was not, but I know that these charges here did not indicate

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
absence of other than those which were covered by request in the committee or were there

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
blue key absence of each trainee in his company.

11:24.000 --> 11:33.000
Then apparently these absence is in place those that those to blue key is normally entitled.

11:33.000 --> 11:42.000
Thus those, I suppose, a distinction has been made as those other requests by the committee staff.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
That is correct, he is not.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yes sir.

11:45.000 --> 11:55.000
In Colonel, the charge indicates that on the normal days when there is any other private turn title to title,

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
there are black marks covering those days.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
That is correct yes sir.

12:03.000 --> 12:11.000
And the charge likewise contains black marks on the date point he is away as a result of special

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
dispensation given him as a result of the request for the committee staff.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
That is correct.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yes sir.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
I think we ought to say that the black marks were merely to portray it graphically.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
There is nothing.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
It does not mean a black mark was made on shine directives.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
No but on the charge they are black.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
We are talking about the charge now.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yes sir.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
At Colonel Marie and I am not the testing in cash any assertions or reflections on you whatever

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
I merely try to develop the fact you understand that.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
Now Colonel Marie, that was prepared for exhibition here upon the hearing of these controversies

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I think.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yes sir.

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
And it was only for this committee to be finished, counsel to the committee and the committee

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
and would be placed in record here as a part of the Army's evidence.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Yes sir and I believe it was.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
And you believe it was this morning.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Now sir I think that the copies of each of these charts were presented to members of the

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
staff by me sometime by us this morning.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
About a week and so I go I believe.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
And then.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
Now Colonel I will ask you and I will ask Mr. Cohn down there if he was in so kind as to

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
the room we tried to which we have been referring and particularly the Army's corn where we may

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
refer to it.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
He is the president.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I will let him set a be by.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
I now show you another chart, Colonel.

13:43.000 --> 13:52.000
And as I read from Mr. Hainville and this distance, if there is a typical authorized absences

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
for the two tenants around a little bit, that's better.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
A typical authorized absences for the average trainee undergoing training cycle while

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
as signs to come make these 47th Infantry Regiment, what makes you dirty.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
And you see that chart everywhere.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I must have cared that chart, Colonel Murray.

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
As far as I know that chart was prepared by the same Mr. Ward that I have mentioned before,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
that is under his two positions.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
And under whose direction was that chart, I gave the instructions to have a chart of this type prepared

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
as a comparison.

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
Now, Colonel, the chart has it appears now he has not as it was when it makes you obvious.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I thought it was not.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
When it left you office and when it was put on exhibition here this morning,

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
where you hear this morning, Colonel Murray, after I was, did you bring those charts with you?

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I didn't tie them in here that I placed them on the museum.

14:56.000 --> 15:05.000
When the charts were literally a mandatory, it was put on the easel and on exhibition here before the committee and the CD audience,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
it had no black marks on it.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Did it?

15:09.000 --> 15:18.000
No sir, I think this morning I placed both charts on the same easel with the G-Day's Shine chart on top.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
As far as I know, the other chart was not displayed to anyone until set of the metadly,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
took it upon itself to remove the first chart.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
I wonder if it's a triangle light, not a bad thing.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
The other chart here is open with the G-Day on my artwork of dinner.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
Not so many not.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
The Colonel and the one to which he announced for him was placed on the easel this morning.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
It had not been, had the benefit of the handy words of the Senator from Wisconsin.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Is that right?

15:52.000 --> 15:59.000
That is right, and was fully white and was devoured in a black mark forever.

15:59.000 --> 16:13.000
No sir, I think that the charts that we initially presented had certain black marks of a different height in these spaces for the end of the summer and throughout January.

16:13.000 --> 16:21.000
Those I think you can still see through the overprint that the Senator and his staff placed on there.

16:21.000 --> 16:30.000
Those marks, I think, have healed salmon and everybody that has received a copy of this this morning can read them on the show.

16:30.000 --> 16:42.000
It indicates as the title of the chart describes that these typical authorized absences of an average trainee in the company that the private shine was defined.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
Very on that kind of looking at the charts, which we are now referring to.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
I know it's on Tuesday in the month of November.

16:52.000 --> 17:05.000
So I think it's a black square, a black figure of black marks at that place.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
He has placed the black mark there.

17:09.000 --> 17:23.000
Now, normally, would the average typical private, at Thursday, have had that they all, I do not know for sure.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
I believe that that was the day that the shine was adopted.

17:27.000 --> 17:35.000
The bars I would call about induction procedures, they have packed up into a train and taken to the camp.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
I think the average private and his situation would have spent Tuesday night at 4 p.m.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
But would he have been all on the Tuesday prior to the hour of induction?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Yes. I presume he would.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
He would have come in in the evening on Tuesday.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
I think they generally induct soldiers in the morning, sir, but I'm not sure of that.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
Clearly, you know what the significance of the black mark is on the chart where now he's examining on Tuesday in November.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
So, some of the metophe puts him on mark on it.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
So, I don't know what, but what was you here when he put it on there?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Yes, sir, I saw him put it on there.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
And he put it on there while General Ram was being examined, did he not?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I believe it is.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I didn't get that.

18:19.000 --> 18:30.000
You recall that he put it on there with a consent and approval of General Ram and there's a result of General Ram statement that he was proper.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
So, he was going to be blacked out on the chart where now he's examining.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
I don't recall what General Ram said at that time.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
You see all of the black marks on the prison chart now, do you not?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yes, sir.

18:45.000 --> 18:54.000
Clearly, if the prison chart has been prepared just like the chart of these, you may be shy.

18:54.000 --> 19:07.000
Using black marks on the prison chart, where they were bear the same significance to that chart as the black marks bear on the shine chart.

19:07.000 --> 19:20.000
I'll ask you, it isn't a fact that the chart has, that the chart has now worked upon by the senator from Wisconsin,

19:20.000 --> 19:27.000
fairly and actively represents the records of the typical inductee of Fort State.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
No, sir, it does not.

19:29.000 --> 19:42.000
In what respect is the different journals, Marielle, on the third of November, sir, the average trainee would have gone to Fort Dick for a sign of private-shined enough.

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
On the 23rd of November, I see no black marks on the shine chart.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
Yes, I believe there is one on the typical trainee chart.

19:54.000 --> 20:03.000
On the 31st of December, or the Christmas period, I think General Ryan has adequately explained that except in the case of emergency,

20:03.000 --> 20:12.000
the men of shines company would have been entitled to only one of those two passes, so we could not have both steps of them blacked out.

20:12.000 --> 20:21.000
And on the 16th of the last day, whether it be black marks placed on the average trainee chart,

20:21.000 --> 20:30.000
there would be no need for that because they, so far as we know, the average trainee awaited to the end of the period,

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
whereas the private shine was allowed to leave somewhat early on that day.

20:35.000 --> 20:48.000
Mr. Daykin, Mr. Chairman, Colonel Blue has entered the room, I have spoken to him, in durable case condition, it would be pleasant that he could go on now.

20:48.000 --> 21:02.000
He talked with our right, he has family with our other women, and he may shut down, and we turn to Colonel Marie, and continue to be sworn.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.000
While Colonel Blue is coming to the stand and is to be sworn in, let's return to our studio to cost the country to permit our patients to identify themselves.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
This is ABC Television Network.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
What's going on?

21:25.000 --> 21:32.000
You saw me throw the testimony you were about to give, but the whole truth is that nothing but the truth you are up to, I do.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
You may be seated. Mr. Poet who may proceed with the questioning, may you please.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
Mr. Maynard, well, because I have a new member of our staff, and no one else.

21:44.000 --> 21:55.000
Mr. Maynard was not new to him, he was the first to be here, as a member of our committee of counsel, and we have to hear Charlie and Mr. Feet.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
Will you please first take your full name, your rank, and your place in the title?

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
Can the April of the Colonel as states army, an executive officer, as the Secretary Army is on?

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
For how long is Colonel Blue, have you been executive officer in the Secretary's office?

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
I first joined the Secretary's office in 1951, after I came back from Korea.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
I've been there since, I've been executive officer since, about a month and a half before Mr. Pace went.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
The president of the Secretary has come to believe that you first came to the United States Army.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
1937, I'm listed in the English Reserve. Got a commission tonight.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
The Colonel is full, the Michael L. Polo works at 4.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
I'm listed in the English Reserve in 1937.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
The commission of second looked at an event from Trey in 1937, about six months later.

22:51.000 --> 23:00.000
The activity of 1940, the commission of regular army officer in 1946, an undudicensed.

23:00.000 --> 23:11.000
In your capacity, Colonel Blue, as executive officer, you have seen things that do not matter to the committee of the personnel,

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
the staff of the Democratic Committee and Mr. Adams and the Secretary himself.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
Yes, my job is administrative job, most of the personnel is assistant to Mr. Steve.

23:24.000 --> 23:33.000
I first arranged many administrative details for various meetings and Senate McCarthy, or Mr. Cohen, as Secretary had.

23:33.000 --> 23:42.000
I only put one personal experience or opportunity to watch the Committee an action that was to port Monmouth, Kirk, and Rod, October 20th.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
I'm using the committee to do what the committee actually asked for.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
The Agamere Medical Rangeman.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
The Secretary had said that he wanted to go to Monmouth.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
I think some days preceding that, he had not been there before, I think.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Finally made his decision.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
I made the final arrangements for the airplane, the day preceding the trip.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Of course, I would include the time to take off, who was to go.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
What the time space factors were, who was me, this and so forth.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I did that.

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
Were you threatened, at the time, the matter was assessed as to the purpose of that trip, sir?

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
A lot of the issues that I, my recollections correct, if there were two purposes.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
First, currently, you will answer my question, will you say it when you plan for discussion?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Part of the time, I believe there was.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
In fact, you did learn what those purposes were.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Yes, 90, we all failed what the purposes were.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Law and Mr. Stevens had never been to Port Monmouth since he had been Secretary of the Army.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
That was one he desired to go up there.

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
And as I understood, there was to be, as long as Mr. McConnie was having an investigation of the Monmouth area,

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
or activities there about, it seemed like a good idea to be Secretary.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.000
I just discussed those activities on the spot, so those I believe were the two purposes.

25:06.000 --> 25:16.000
I'm getting down to the move of that trip, was there any more incident that happened on that trip on the 20th of October?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Yes, I think so.

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
It's been recounted here before, the incident of the denial of entrance of Mr. Cohn,

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
others of the party to the Secret Arts, classified laboratory.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Were you planning to serve in the hands?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Yes, I was president most of the time.

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
We left the main administrative building, or what the headquarters building would probably be called,

25:40.000 --> 25:49.000
and a mortar cave, several other modules, went around the area a little bit and then ended up in front of this building.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
I thought I'd be on the field for the sake of when you arrived at the building.

25:54.000 --> 26:01.000
Right there, there's the Secretary of the Honours, Senator McConnie, Senator Smith of New Jersey,

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
representing the often clothed, General Lawton was there, he commanded the post,

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
General George Back, Chief Signal Officer, Mr. John Adams, myself,

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
and the general lawton staff, of course, who was normally beaver, I do not know all of them.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Mr. Jones, the Senator Potter's office, and Mr. Harold Reigns,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
and I was told from Senator Dickson's office.

26:29.000 --> 26:37.000
And Mr. Cohn, I believe that was part of what was the building that you approached at that time?

26:37.000 --> 26:44.000
Well, there was a building that contained classified communications or radar apparatus.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
Was there a certain person there, the engineers that were building in certain persons who did not enter?

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Yes sir.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
And what was the reason for that, General Boliv?

26:54.000 --> 27:01.000
Well, it could possibly be my fault in a way because I arranged a trip and I got a telephone call from Monmouth

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
that day before asking if any special classification arrangement should be made,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
and I said no one none other than normal.

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
And we drove up to the private building and the option, other than the, I believe it was a civilian in charge of the building,

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
but it may have been the security officer that for someone's challenge,

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
the entrance of all members in the party to the inner regions of the building.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
And Mr. Stevens made a decision then that he would take in all those,

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
of course, who had authorized the military for Mr. Gohan or classified,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
except that type of classified information in addition.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
He would all find me firm on me when he went to give that experience,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
and went into the work moment itself.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
He's one of the people that had been communicating the type of security clearance he had.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Yes sir.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
Mr. Adams has testified that I fact that I didn't pay much attention to that.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
I understand that there were two different charges of that I just give.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
I was given one of fact that paid no attention to it because I've been on many military courses

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
and the routine problems was all concerned.

28:06.000 --> 28:12.000
I'm not familiar with the details as well, Mr. Keller was at the routine conversation,

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
which was answers to the building.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Would you like to go on and go ahead?

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
The security officer who the individual was challenged the entrance,

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
the right of entry to this building, then was overruled by the secretary

28:30.000 --> 28:37.000
as it pertained to the elected representatives of Congress who were there.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
I started to stay out and one of the officers recognized me and said,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
come on in here and tie the tinnitus tie in the door.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
And, uh, God, I suppose, maybe ten or fifteen feet.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
There was a tall way going into the intersection of the building.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
I heard someone building up the storm outside,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
and I turned around and went out.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
Mr. Collins, Mr. Adams, we're there. Mr. Collins was quite I read.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
That's not getting allowed into this building.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
You can't identify any other people who were praising me that time on the outside.

29:12.000 --> 29:19.000
Well, I have since learned that the fence corals near there,

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
that the, uh, let's see what's in there, Mr. Slattery.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
I think he has charged with a particular portion of the laboratory.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
It was present.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
I believe I met him for the first time, then.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
Mr. Rainville and Mr. Jones were in the vicinity.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I think they were across the road, however.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
This was what a large group, and they had de-truck to decar what they wanted to call it,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
and it's echelons that are rare.

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
The smaller part, I didn't catch up with the ITs until two minutes after I got to the headquarters.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm sure the strikers line there.

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
Um, quite considerable amount of dental law and staff that probably have been there too soon.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
So why do the emery go to meet you in so currently?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
You may want to stay at my next account.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I agree with you, Britain.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Yes, sir.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
And it's like you said, this is, this is, this is, this is war with the Army.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I don't understand why you let communist work in here.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
You won't let me in.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
I've been cleared like for classified information.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
I have access to FDI files when I want them.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
I, um, been doing this just to embarrass me.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
We'll investigate the heck out of you.

30:40.000 --> 30:47.000
Um, if anyone on said it, there was no need for him to stay there to remain there that day.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
And it takes investigation to, to, uh, New York.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
He won the car to get out of there and go back to New York.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
I made somebody mark about, well, it wasn't done to embarrass you.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
I mean, you know, he's got to have security regulations.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
Uh, he said, well, if people here just don't know how to do anything, they're doing it to embarrass me.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
And if you repeat it, we'll investigate the heck out of them again.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
Thank you.
