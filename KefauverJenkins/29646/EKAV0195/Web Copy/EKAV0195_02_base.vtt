00:00.000 --> 00:03.560
The road was crossed several times.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.560
It was not a stationary group.

00:05.560 --> 00:11.200
Um, I thought that that in substance is the...

00:11.200 --> 00:13.200
The gesture point went off.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.640
What was the condition of Mr. Cohn that that time was being angry and disturbed on the

00:17.640 --> 00:19.840
one end of being calm on the other end?

00:19.840 --> 00:23.440
Well, first I had never personally met Mr. Cohn before.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.440
I talked with him on a phone.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.440
I don't think that I was sitting before.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.440
I thought he was very angry.

00:28.440 --> 00:34.840
I do not know his characteristic makeup, so maybe he wasn't, but I thought he was quite

00:34.840 --> 00:35.840
angry.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.840
I thought he was going to talk, but...

00:39.840 --> 00:40.840
What was the effect?

00:40.840 --> 00:44.840
Because his time that fell on me was kind of over there.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.840
Because it was exciting, because you were not.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.440
Well, I was embarrassed, first, because he was against a North-South post.

00:52.440 --> 00:58.080
Um, I had never had an experience with congressional committees, so I didn't know whether

00:58.080 --> 01:00.880
he really was entitled to cleanse or not.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.040
I didn't think he was.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.040
And then my decision was for...

01:05.040 --> 01:11.760
I'd recommend the court marbles that there be no unusual cleanse as given.

01:11.760 --> 01:18.760
The incident was surprising to me because I didn't expect it.

01:18.760 --> 01:25.440
I was also happy and happy because I knew that Mr. Adams had had some conversations with

01:25.440 --> 01:28.040
Mr. Cohn and sent him a copy of body questions.

01:28.040 --> 01:36.320
Personally, I had not liked the type of investigation or the public did was coming out about

01:36.320 --> 01:38.560
the army because I'm glad he earned it.

01:38.560 --> 01:43.760
And then I think we do a good job about Rodding Thomas.

01:43.760 --> 01:48.720
And I was afraid that in my own life, I'm hearing people talk, but maybe Mr. Cohn was

01:48.720 --> 01:51.720
just so I'd not send that pressure to the South.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
That was in that, so...

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
I had no interest.

01:54.720 --> 01:55.720
I had no interest.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.560
What was the opinion importance of this trace of the case that caused me to start by a

02:00.560 --> 02:03.720
little group of officers here before?

02:03.720 --> 02:11.360
Prior to the arrangement for the trip, I was in Mr. Stephen's office.

02:11.360 --> 02:17.360
I think probably on there, so before, I'm not sure the date made with 17.

02:17.360 --> 02:22.880
When Mr. Adams said if he was going to prepare something like that, and he talked to

02:22.880 --> 02:28.320
him and he talked in general about how he would prepare for my memory, so he was right.

02:28.320 --> 02:34.240
It was to the effect that the investigations that Ford Monmouth has served in no particular

02:34.240 --> 02:35.240
useful process.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.240
They have brought forth no knowledge of the union.

02:37.240 --> 02:42.480
I mean, did not now already have, that the publicity would damage from the national

02:42.480 --> 02:44.480
and the national standpoint.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.480
And we have good relations with the committee, but that's my knowledge.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.880
I'm just being a bystander in most of it.

02:52.880 --> 02:58.840
And we know he was a part of the question he shouldn't go out trying to responsibility

02:58.840 --> 02:59.840
over the army.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.840
That was the assumption.

03:00.840 --> 03:05.880
Now, on the air, Mr. Adams had that question, he's willing.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.880
I know he showed it to Senator McCarthy.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.880
I do not remember Mr. Cohen looking at it, but he may have.

03:10.880 --> 03:16.320
I think perhaps he did because, as we got off the plane, Mr. Adams gave me this question,

03:16.320 --> 03:20.400
and I think that he used to have some changes in it, and I asked that I have him money

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
to grasp up there.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.560
Of course, I used the army's chain of command.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.000
I gave him to the test court, and he got to money to grasp.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I did not read them.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Those were ones of the activists.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
You know, we made sure it changed again the press release.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.280
They were made to best of my knowledge between Mr. Adams and Mr. Cohen, and they sent

03:40.280 --> 03:41.280
him a copy on the plane.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.760
I did not pay any attention to that, so it was a big unfortunate.

03:43.760 --> 03:49.680
Now, there's a second building infected in which Mr. Cohen was not admitted.

03:49.680 --> 03:50.680
I think there was.

03:50.680 --> 03:55.560
I don't know what is that created anything because, on the left, the first building, the

03:55.560 --> 04:01.600
weather worked in the next place, and everybody knew who he was, and who couldn't go in,

04:01.600 --> 04:04.560
so I'm just a little bit of writing that that's all.

04:04.560 --> 04:10.680
I think Mr. Cohen was taken to another building to show some non-class, to be shown some

04:10.680 --> 04:13.320
non-classified data and no information.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.440
But about that time, I was getting concerned with getting more of a case back and making

04:18.440 --> 04:21.880
sure everybody got the top of charge, and I remember his little hazy on that.

04:21.880 --> 04:27.160
What was the effect upon Mr. Adams of Mr. Cohen's outburst?

04:27.160 --> 04:34.440
Well, as I can't tell you what was in his mind, his expression, and the care that he

04:34.440 --> 04:41.680
didn't like that he felt uncomfortable, that he was concerned about the press release because

04:41.680 --> 04:45.920
he told me he was.

04:45.920 --> 04:53.760
And Mr. Downley, uncomfortable situation, he tried to talk to Mr. Cohen.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.280
Well, he's easily perfectly, I believe.

04:58.280 --> 05:04.120
As you would do to any guest in your house or in your own installation where something

05:04.120 --> 05:06.120
unpleasant might have happened.

05:06.120 --> 05:10.120
Were you likewise there, because you were going to be a little bit, once you know that

05:10.120 --> 05:11.120
date?

05:11.120 --> 05:12.120
Yes sir.

05:12.120 --> 05:20.560
For example, when the secretary made some statements in the nature of an apology, yes sir.

05:20.560 --> 05:24.960
Did you feel that an apology was in order?

05:24.960 --> 05:30.720
Well, apologies, no matter the definition, I guess, on each top of an individual, but

05:30.720 --> 05:35.000
the students are very gentlemanly type of man.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.680
Had I been the man doing it, I might have been a little rougher on Mr. Cohen.

05:40.680 --> 05:45.040
Mr. Stevens was trying to make me feel at home, I think.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.760
And he wanted to know that it was not his personal insult or anything like that, this was

05:48.760 --> 05:49.760
a matter of regulation.

05:49.760 --> 05:57.160
And it was his decision he made it right or wrong, he decided he hurt his children.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.000
Some would take the origin of apology or this would not.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.840
But I say I might have had a little differently, it's a matter of an individual take.

06:04.840 --> 06:09.840
Now, the number of this great army of which you play your proud, and of which we are all

06:09.840 --> 06:15.040
proud, with great proud mutations, the secretary of self-destruct, did you feel that it was

06:15.040 --> 06:20.460
becoming to the highest officer of that army to make an apology to Mr. Cohen and Mr.

06:20.460 --> 06:21.460
Stevens?

06:21.460 --> 06:25.960
It's never unbecoming to be polite as much as you nature, unless Mr. Stevens' nature.

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
I think it was.

06:26.960 --> 06:27.960
I think it was.

06:27.960 --> 06:28.960
I said I would not have done it that way, but then I'm not Mr. Stevens.

06:28.960 --> 06:35.960
You said that you had gone down the hallway about chemical patients.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.960
You heard an explosion back there and it came around and went back to talk to Mr. Cohen.

06:40.960 --> 06:47.960
And then just a minute, as you were further, and you said you had since blown away, you

06:47.960 --> 06:50.960
had been able to see the situation.

06:50.960 --> 06:57.960
And then just a minute, as you were further, and you said you had since blown away, that

06:57.960 --> 07:00.960
Lieutenant Carl was present in the office.

07:00.960 --> 07:01.960
It's not a court.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.960
Of course, it's not a court, it's not a court, it's present in Mr. Slotter.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.960
I'm curious to know why you put it that way.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.960
Well, since blown away, he went back and saw that he was under that.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.960
No, I met him there for the first time.

07:15.960 --> 07:19.960
I go up to first with the secretary and fly it off and we show out about hundreds of people.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.960
In other words, you saw those two in the town, and they were going on the work of the secretary.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.960
I met him the first time and I was at an memory of him then sometimes.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.960
He went by a few people around, and he was the driver to the car.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.960
I've taken no particular attention until it made it off.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.960
You can find anybody else here who's named you new at the time.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.960
You recognize anybody at the time.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.960
Well, I know quite a few of the officers at Martin's there, and I have to laboratory,

07:47.960 --> 07:49.960
but most of them I met at the other building.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.960
If it's a particular building, I don't think so.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.960
I have no need to, that you can identify as having over the conversation in a building.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.960
You may know that maybe it's Mr. Ring, though overheard it, I don't know, sir.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.960
I think he was crossed the road.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.960
Maybe it's Mr. Jones, then.

08:03.960 --> 08:08.960
He said that as you've progressed to the 60th column, he was facing back and forth across the road.

08:08.960 --> 08:09.960
So, you might have heard him from now.

08:09.960 --> 08:10.960
I could have been there.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.960
It was about 20, 30 feet wide or maybe less.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.960
It was a great and a good day outside.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.960
I was in front of the door.

08:17.960 --> 08:23.960
The conversation was a little loud, I suppose, but he was very audible.

08:23.960 --> 08:24.960
Well, I imagined it was.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.960
Although I don't remember him raising his voice too greatly.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.960
I mean, he goes at possibly them as far as you know, the time the conversation was going to be over.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
He was very glad.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.960
The time is cord.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.960
Mr. Schottelings, Mr. Jones, Mr. Ring.

08:37.960 --> 08:38.960
I mean that, sir.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.960
Anybody else who's assigned to a match?

08:42.960 --> 08:45.960
Well, there are many things if you can identify it.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.960
If you're asked, Mr. Adams, of course, was best.

08:47.960 --> 08:48.960
You're right.

08:48.960 --> 08:55.960
Did you stay with Mr. Kohn throughout the underage of these security courtes?

08:55.960 --> 09:00.960
I don't know that we wrote back on the same side from the security of building.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.960
I'm going to follow the target within this particular book.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.960
If you stay with Mr. Kohn throughout that infection, you're most of the time.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.960
I think I left him and I wonder what's the city new building that's probably the other building.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.960
I was pressing on the short, but I don't even know what to say at all.

09:13.960 --> 09:23.960
Did he remain hourly and allocated and household without the credit of the infection or did you have to explain the situation?

09:23.960 --> 09:24.960
Playkitty to someone.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.960
Well, it was sort of a slow summer, I think, sir.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.960
It came down from the hotbed all the way to the center.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.960
You make some progress.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.960
It's quite a work of work.

09:36.960 --> 09:42.960
You know, I'm the last man in the world normally to object to pressing by the chair of the matured, yet anywhere.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.960
But when I saw that there's no question about the fact that Mr. Kohn was here at this time,

09:47.960 --> 09:50.960
and I'm glad it's worked on the overnight access of the building.

09:50.960 --> 09:56.960
But there's nothing whatsoever to do with the army charges of clutches to get special considerations.

09:56.960 --> 10:04.960
I'm willing to increase in that any platform that's Kohn's here at this, that land over here at the Jones area.

10:04.960 --> 10:09.960
Why are we wasting time on something that's not in the trend that I don't know?

10:09.960 --> 10:12.960
Why are we going to do this?

10:16.960 --> 10:18.960
I'm really up to this point.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.960
If Tom's waiting at the conversation, he's right Mr. Kohn, he's something to be affected.

10:22.960 --> 10:28.960
To the world, I was only in the end up to get the heck out of the army, etc.

10:28.960 --> 10:36.960
Was this at the age that he was at what you call a hot boil or by the time he got down the way to school?

10:36.960 --> 10:39.960
I'd say it reasonably up towards the top of the notch, sir.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.960
That's his beginning.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.960
He's right there. He went out there.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.960
That's good. But I'd say this conversation lasts at maybe 15 or 20 minutes.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.960
But again, I do not know Mr. Kohn well.

10:51.960 --> 10:57.960
That was the first time so I had to rename somebody else and judge how his tent was locked off.

10:57.960 --> 11:03.960
As an important officer in the army, if you have a considerable consideration of something serious and dire,

11:03.960 --> 11:06.960
it was going to happen to the army now.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.960
Well, I've always done with the opinion so that the American Army can take care of itself,

11:10.960 --> 11:13.960
or I don't want you to see people try to get a hold of it and do something to it.

11:13.960 --> 11:18.960
You were not particularly concerned and simply was done with the alleged actions.

11:18.960 --> 11:19.960
That's right.

11:19.960 --> 11:25.960
So, you know, if I run this temporarily, I think some official business, then the good.

11:25.960 --> 11:35.960
So, I'm a little bit of a fine-time to agree with the Senator McCartney that this has no greater world-shaking bearing upon the issue that it's the fall.

11:35.960 --> 11:45.960
But certainly these explosive, never-the-mind is intensified, too, and ventilated, but he's freely in the theory.

11:45.960 --> 11:50.960
So, I suppose there's no nothing law, so I'm taking a just little step further.

11:51.960 --> 11:57.960
Did you all leave Washington on the same plane with the exception of Senator Smith and Representative Alton Paul?

11:57.960 --> 11:58.960
That's right, sir.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.960
And what time did you leave Washington?

12:00.960 --> 12:03.960
About 10-15, sir.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.960
And what was the plan about coming back to Washington?

12:07.960 --> 12:12.960
We were flied up on the same plane when the study starts, our inspection of that.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.960
And when did you actually leave for this to come back?

12:15.960 --> 12:16.960
This is for months, sir.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.960
I need it for months.

12:19.960 --> 12:23.960
Well, I think we must have left before we got in Washington.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.960
I believe about 4-15 in the afternoon.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.960
I have to check that to the action.

12:27.960 --> 12:32.960
It's about an hour and an hour and seven minutes flight, and about two minutes drive from Fort Monty.

12:32.960 --> 12:38.960
Well, that means that you land a day roughly about a hour and 11.30, and when less day is probably about three a month.

12:38.960 --> 12:39.960
That's about right.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.960
So, you had substantially about three and a half hours there.

12:42.960 --> 12:43.960
That's one after three.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.960
Well, now what year did it plan when you went up there?

12:46.960 --> 12:49.960
What was the occupying today?

12:49.960 --> 12:53.960
Well, I've been having to do with particular plans for the occupying.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.960
If they have to, one, the secretary had never expected Fort Monty.

12:57.960 --> 13:05.960
There's other routines that you find yourself in when the secretary of the Army goes on the post, especially if he has been there.

13:05.960 --> 13:09.960
He has obviously met with a commanding officer and goes on to do select staff that he wants.

13:09.960 --> 13:15.960
And when they were showing him the post, the post is best life.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.960
I do not know, precisely what was in general, my mind.

13:20.960 --> 13:26.960
I know that he had planned to explain to us what the purpose of the post was, that portion of the post was.

13:26.960 --> 13:34.960
And talk about the loyalty, security problems, or procedures, not specific problems, because that's what he did.

13:35.960 --> 13:46.960
And that, after having arrived, arrived, bringing interviews, getting shaken down, so to speak, getting it out, getting slight orientation of what the post was about,

13:46.960 --> 13:52.960
and taking this motorcade around, coming back and talking while we had lunch.

13:52.960 --> 13:58.960
And then sent him a staff that was like a pair having a first conference, when he signed up, that took all the time.

13:59.960 --> 14:04.960
Well, no, couldn't lie, not a very high-pass man, here, as far as my office is concerned.

14:04.960 --> 14:15.960
But as certainly a reluctant to let a staff man go, spend the day on a social chaunt, on a site that he goes away on a public business, then does something worth laughing, constructions.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.960
And that was the reason for asking whether there was a plan.

14:18.960 --> 14:27.960
Now, he had to leave my office directly at 9 o'clock to get down to the airport, and get back, perhaps, to have that five in the afternoon, so he would go on a whole week.

14:28.960 --> 14:34.960
Now, that was the truth, the rest of the members of the committee said, and that leads up to this question.

14:34.960 --> 14:45.960
If you took a whole day and took a crowd of people up there who are busy, off the Capitol Hill, and suddenly you got up to 11 o'clock that bothered the secret things, and they couldn't get in,

14:45.960 --> 14:52.960
would you be ILA-2, would you be mad? Not a few ways to devil, and suddenly it's far and not a few one of them want any of my business.

14:52.960 --> 14:58.960
Well, now they make a lot of noise, home, gloating, and tempered, and getting a little explosive and aggressive.

14:58.960 --> 15:03.960
I don't know what attitude to one of my assistant experts up there, he has never told me about it.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.960
He said to stay, and he spent the day, I said, what did you do?

15:07.960 --> 15:21.960
He said, well, if the company is exactly nothing, which was when he got to the place where there was some things that probably would have been interesting, we couldn't get in, and then the army hadn't either made provisions for the necessary clearances before that Washington.

15:22.960 --> 15:28.960
And he made under those circumstances, frankly the junior senator, Illinois would have been mad if the devil had gone.

15:28.960 --> 15:35.960
Well, maybe so, I didn't get the impression that Hell's Angel was very mad. He spent far better time with me.

15:36.960 --> 15:42.960
He wrote a powerful, so we'll reach out for about 10 minutes until we can go and open the back.

15:51.960 --> 16:02.960
You have just heard the chairman declare a brief recess. The ABC television network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army controversy.

16:03.960 --> 16:19.960
The noise that you heard just a few moments ago is the other system, which is the complete all over Capitol Hill.

16:19.960 --> 16:31.960
It is complete in all the Carter, the Senate office building, here in the Great Caucus Room, in the Carter to the Capitol itself, the Carter to the House Office building, even down the basement in the subways.

16:31.960 --> 16:44.960
All over Capitol Hill, the buzzer system was called the members of the Senate and the members of the House to the floor when a quorum is being called or a vote is being called or a roll call is being called.

16:44.960 --> 16:58.960
And that was the noise that you heard just a few moments ago, and the result was announced a moment later by Senator Montenegro when he said that they would have to recess for a few minutes while the members of the committee went over to the floor of the Senate to vote.

17:01.960 --> 17:23.960
And of course this is a brief respite for the members of the committee, for the members of the press, the reporters of the covering this session and also for the spectators who are here in the caucus room to witness the hearing today, this is the 20th day of the hearing.

17:23.960 --> 17:35.960
It must have sang clear the associate council, Mr. Jenkins, there is Mr. Truett on the left, Mr. Cohn, Senator and Mr. Jim Juliano on the right.

17:35.960 --> 17:52.960
The gentleman, to see back to the young chap with the crew cut in the heavy, a large, maharmed room, black with sitting there, just behind the macadie edge of the table, is a member of the staff of the Senate Radio and Television Gout.

17:52.960 --> 18:05.960
And he is there to help out the television and radio correspondent, that is Bob Hopp.

18:05.960 --> 18:18.960
He's there quite frequently and I'm sure that you have wondered who he is, so often in the background, just behind Senator McCarty, chap with the crew cut in the heavy and black with Bob Hopp, a member of the staff of the Senate Radio and Television Gout.

18:18.960 --> 18:26.960
And he is helping out all of the radio and television correspondent, the lady there in the light, great suit, with Mrs. Ruth Youngwatch, the committee clerk.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.960
And now here is Gunner Back.

18:29.960 --> 18:38.960
This is Gunner Back speaking from the Senate Caucus Room and here is the special council of the Bob Committee investigating the McCarthy Army case.

18:38.960 --> 18:45.960
Mr. Ray Jenkins, Mr. Jenkins, the reporters have been asking you and I might as well begin by asking you what's your forecast and for the quitting day.

18:45.960 --> 18:53.960
I think to be the main question. Back I am sure that we will put one day next week, I guess would be the latter part of the week.

18:54.960 --> 19:01.960
You think we'll finish next week? I am, I'm sure of that. And you have no feeling that Gunner McCarty will stay on the stand as long as the Stephen said.

19:01.960 --> 19:10.960
I certainly do not. That is based on my knowledge of what Senator McCarty knows about the issues in this controversy.

19:10.960 --> 19:21.960
It is based on Mr. Welch's statement, made openly as I remember, that he has no plans or intentions, whatever of cross-examining Senator McCarty.

19:21.960 --> 19:30.960
He has a great length and there is a bachelor's position on the part of all of the parties to speed these gains.

19:30.960 --> 19:39.960
And I am sure that and how they handle their security procedures. Then I would assume it would get something out of them unless they already knew.

19:39.960 --> 19:44.960
This equipment in this building, I have seen much military radar radio equipment.

19:44.960 --> 19:50.960
Frankly, he would have had to have a vote only to find out what was in there. I do not think anyone could have looked at it.

19:50.960 --> 19:56.960
It was a layman and either gained anything or lost anything from that particular court.

19:56.960 --> 20:05.960
It would be up to Mr. Rainville's judgment as to what he got from the trip, as it would be to any individual who went.

20:06.960 --> 20:07.960
I think that is.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.960
Thought the only conclusion I could draw from.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.960
Well, now Colonel Fisher is a wholly speculative person.

20:14.960 --> 20:24.960
If you had a clear view of that at the time you were making these time and face the arrangements, would you have gotten clear in for every body of the party to end of that laboratory?

20:24.960 --> 20:28.960
Not more so of a certain that they had a need to know that information.

20:28.960 --> 20:33.960
That's a prime prerequisite of security classification military service.

20:33.960 --> 20:39.960
Even as it turned on the Secretary of the Army's office, I am not allowed to have information that I have no need to know.

20:39.960 --> 20:47.960
So I was asked to ask your name beforehand. I did not have time. That's why I made an association. I made that on the day of the day.

20:47.960 --> 20:53.960
Well, now there's been a bit of a speculation as to whether Mr. Comberton type of the end of that software or not.

20:54.960 --> 21:00.960
Do you know whether he had a high clearance on other locations before this moment?

21:00.960 --> 21:08.960
No, I do not know. Well, now I understand the years that he did have that he was made available to him.

21:08.960 --> 21:16.960
Great many details concerning confidential matters. Because he did, you know, as a matter of fact, I think it was the case.

21:16.960 --> 21:22.960
I have a fire that he had come into the deck of a secretive and confidential data.

21:22.960 --> 21:31.960
I don't doubt the description of that, there are however the military persons who was in charge of classified information or equipment.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.960
Cannot afford to take chance.

21:34.960 --> 21:44.960
And I think in the answer to the time that you always must make the choice against the person seeking interest and the interest unless you specifically and precisely know.

21:44.960 --> 21:49.960
We did not know on this case and I know no investigation has occurred and made that test to take your time.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.960
Well, come on.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.960
No doubt that I will vote on the time of the time.

21:53.960 --> 21:58.960
I'll let me have one question and then I should have concluded with some of the votes.

21:58.960 --> 22:05.960
I'm fully sensible about what you say, but I still make the point, you know, that a whole day with the voters of this is that late.

22:05.960 --> 22:23.960
When they come to that one piece of information they might have done or a satisfaction of going into a theft of a fee something that was quite worthwhile, the answer was that no plan was made for their clearance and what those thoughts do to the average temper.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.960
I think that's just a little.

22:25.960 --> 22:31.960
Attocation, the language that is picked in a higher note than ordinary conversation.

22:31.960 --> 22:37.960
And I think if something in the nature of a statement that, well, this means an investigation from here on out.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.960
But we're going to elect the army.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.960
Or this is the end of the secretary's job.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.960
That's in the great American manner in the great American tradition.

22:47.960 --> 22:55.960
How we go in for those expressions that deal with the supervot here.

22:55.960 --> 23:01.960
And frankly, I can't make too much out of that incident on the basis of the testimony.

23:01.960 --> 23:08.960
A little bit of my line, sir, and I may have made that statement I was in a reprimanded immediate.

23:09.960 --> 23:15.960
Well, Colonel, I was in the army once and I can understand your deliverance.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.960
I'm not telling you that, sir.
