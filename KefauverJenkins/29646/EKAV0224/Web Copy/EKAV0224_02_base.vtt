WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
And avoiding an embarrassing situation.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.800
I also know, sir, that these agencies do not have the subpoena power as does this committee

00:11.800 --> 00:17.980
and that failing to have the subpoena power, they deprive of a very important weapon in

00:17.980 --> 00:20.880
fighting communism and subversion.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.000
And I've not regarded it as serres and adversary proceeding.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.360
I think it's a matter of working together to get a result.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.360
I think in that the executive has to play a vital part.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.360
And I think in that, suits are the Congress.

00:34.360 --> 00:38.360
And that committee is the particular, but also by a vital part.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.360
I see no conflict between the folks.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.360
Well, I didn't want you to draw that inference.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.360
Yes, conflict or distinction.

00:45.360 --> 00:52.360
Everyone recognizes that the investigations subcommittee has done a mostly effective work

00:52.360 --> 00:53.360
at Fort Monmouth.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.360
But it is disturbing to me.

00:56.360 --> 01:03.360
And I'm sure to the American people, if we are to draw the inference, that only the subcommittee

01:03.360 --> 01:11.360
is in a position to do this important work, so far subversives and security risks are concerned.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.360
What would you recommend that be done?

01:13.360 --> 01:19.360
Certainly within the limited personnel of the staff that it takes as I say years to accomplish this.

01:19.360 --> 01:26.360
And we cannot justify taking so much time to the Congress take cognizance of this.

01:26.360 --> 01:36.360
Or is work wage something be done to allow the Department of the Army to this sinister minutes?

01:36.360 --> 01:39.360
Well, sorry, we've done everything we can to arouse them.

01:39.360 --> 01:44.360
So we've acquainted them with the good deal of information, which we have about the situation.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.360
I think the answer you have questions directly.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.360
There is, of course, your right, and the Washington, Washington, Washington, Washington.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.360
The limit on what this or any other committee can do.

01:51.360 --> 01:57.360
But I think if everybody has a responsibility in this important field, does work and work hard

01:57.360 --> 02:00.360
and that we all work together, a lot can be accomplished.

02:00.360 --> 02:07.360
I know that this committee has been responsible for the removal from defense plans and from places in the Army

02:07.360 --> 02:10.360
of a number of communists during the past year.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.360
If we had gotten only one out, I think that would have been an accomplishment.

02:13.360 --> 02:19.360
The fact that many have been gotten about, I think, is the very great credit of the members of the committee.

02:19.360 --> 02:28.360
The last time, and I would make Senator's Warshak, is if we could get information such as that requested on the preps case, a little bit faster.

02:28.360 --> 02:38.360
And find out who is the rest of the bottom, who is responsible for promoting a government communist for the rank of major.

02:38.360 --> 02:48.360
After that communist has invoked the federal amendments to the Army, for knowing that, promoted, for knowing that, did other things in his favor,

02:48.360 --> 02:52.360
and permitted him to be in contact with other military personnel.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.360
We could get that information.

02:54.360 --> 02:59.360
And find out all the people who decided this man should be given an honorable discharge.

02:59.360 --> 03:04.360
If we get to those people, I think we will have taken another step forward in this fight.

03:04.360 --> 03:10.360
You think, then, that this subcommittee can accomplish this task without any additional assistance?

03:10.360 --> 03:20.360
Mucher. I think the subcommittee needs all the help it can get from other committees of Congress, from the executive agencies and the investigative agencies.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.360
I think we all have to work together.

03:22.360 --> 03:33.360
I would agree with you that the job is probably too big to be done 100%, but everybody working together certainly can't be done 100% by people working alone or in conflict with each other.

03:34.360 --> 03:43.360
Everybody recognizes that the FBI has done exceptional work in compiling these files of subversives.

03:43.360 --> 03:51.360
What can be done is anything to ensure the immediate availability and the effective use of these files.

03:52.360 --> 04:02.360
A lot of very great problems, Senator Dorscht. These files, sir, you very correctly stated, still contain the vital information and they are forward.

04:02.360 --> 04:08.360
It's not to us, unfortunately, we don't get them, but government agencies, do get them.

04:08.360 --> 04:15.360
The departments concern, do get them. The defense plan concerns the security, the military security liaison, do get them.

04:16.360 --> 04:21.360
Then the question you raised, Senator Dorscht, I guess what can be done about it when they get them and don't do anything about them?

04:21.360 --> 04:26.360
Ignore the information in them, and that has certainly happened in a number of cases.

04:26.360 --> 04:41.360
I would say one answer, sir, is the committee, such as this, to come along and point out the failure to act as an example of inefficiency in the executive, which is our mandate under the legislative reorganization act.

04:41.360 --> 04:46.360
When we do that, when we point that out, we self-usually don't follow.

04:46.360 --> 04:56.360
Mr. Cohn, we're reminded almost daily of the possibility of involvement in war in the China, Southeast Asia.

04:56.360 --> 05:01.360
The Americans, people have apprehension and fear over that possible intervention.

05:02.360 --> 05:18.360
It seems to me that right here at home, if we face involvement, that we ought to take advantage of every opportunity, such as safety guard, our military forces, so that we can rely upon them in case of war.

05:18.360 --> 05:30.360
What can we do more specifically to ensure an immediate house cleaning of these subversive elements so that the Americans, people will know that in case of involvement in war,

05:31.360 --> 05:43.360
in the coming months, that we can present a united front instead of inviting the possibility of sabotage right here in the military forces.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.360
Senator Chac, I'm sorry to have to answer this question.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.360
Yes, sir, Senator Chac, that's very big and a very important question.

05:49.360 --> 05:55.360
I'm sure it could probably be answered a lot better by the members of this committee, or by the way, because the Amoris Curie is the missing I have.

05:56.360 --> 06:01.360
All I can give you is my opinion there. I think there are a number of things which can be done.

06:01.360 --> 06:07.360
I think one thing is that all of us should work together. In other words, the executive has its responsibility.

06:07.360 --> 06:14.360
The Congress has its responsibility. There is no need for any conflict whatsoever.

06:14.360 --> 06:21.360
The two should operate in age and in health of each other, in getting these subversives and communists out.

06:21.360 --> 06:37.360
As far as this committee is concerned, sir, I would say if we could continue the way we were before, holding these serious executive sessions, public areas, exposing these communists and traitors, getting them out of the front plan, getting them out of positions in the army and other places.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.360
But that would be a big step forward.

06:40.360 --> 06:50.360
The particular problem that you mentioned about safeguarding these plans, I think another important step lies in dealing in some ways with the problem of communist dominates.

06:50.360 --> 07:03.360
Certain thoughts of certain labor unions, such as United Electrical Workers, which have thousands of members in defense plans doing vital war secrets.

07:03.360 --> 07:17.360
Some way must be found of coping with those unions and stopping them. When the leaders of those unions invoke the fifth amendment of the Communist Party membership, the membership in activity in the communist conspiracy,

07:17.360 --> 07:36.360
there must be some way must be found, sir, to prevent those unions from manning vital defense plans and vital war plans. Those about a field of good many problems, which are presented, which I'm sure people are very familiar with, and I can have better suggestions for dealing with them.

07:36.360 --> 07:48.360
And in the graph, do you have time? They like also, we can to get to council wealth for his time in the chair of hope still. We know the yielding for the prior additional time.

07:48.360 --> 08:02.360
Mr. Cohen, you're questioning there was one of the facts that the result of your trip through Europe,

08:03.360 --> 08:18.360
serving the libraries, the memory of Cagan, because that's what I was the fact that Mr. Cagan had written plays of a predict for the Communist Party, rather by communist front.

08:19.360 --> 08:30.360
That he lived with the communists for quite some time knowing the communists. He signed this pledge and that he said I am ten to support the coming election.

08:30.360 --> 08:36.360
And I do hereby nominate the following name person of the candidate of the communist party.

08:36.360 --> 08:42.360
I believe there's brought out the fact that Mr. Cagan at the time you went to Europe was holding once again.

08:43.360 --> 08:53.360
Mr. Cagan, when I saw him serve as the acting director of the Public Affairs Office for the High Commissioner of Germany, he had some 4,000 people working under.

08:53.360 --> 08:59.360
Having to do with the information which we dispensed in Europe, the right?

08:59.360 --> 09:08.360
Yes, our information and a statement of the position of the United States and the free world and the fight against communists.

09:09.360 --> 09:15.360
Mr. Cagan, I think you're yesterday Mr. Cagan, there's come to my attention information which I think is a committee meeting with you once.

09:15.360 --> 09:33.360
But first let me ask you, your call was submitted under oath by Mr. Steven, that it was a New York paper called the New York Code, that seems to get the charges against Mr. Cagan.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.360
That's true, sir.

09:36.360 --> 09:42.360
I want to tell you now Mr. Cagan and I have Mr. Cagan.

09:42.360 --> 09:55.360
Now I'm telling you now that I have learned that Mr. Cagan, from I'm afraid that the communist pledge of the pledge of support to communist party,

09:56.360 --> 10:08.360
the individual who lives with communist world plays of communist front produced, is now working for the paper, if you can follow it left.

10:08.360 --> 10:17.360
And I avoid saying newspaper, which instigated the charges against Mr. Cagan.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.360
If all in other words Mr. Cagan, I follow that.

10:20.360 --> 10:34.360
I'm a man who has had our information program, trying to pledge the thing of support to communist, New York Post which instigated the charges which resulted in all this time spent here.

10:34.360 --> 10:42.360
So we find now that Mr. Cagan is one of the men on the New York Post, you think that might have some significance?

10:42.360 --> 10:50.360
I think it has the greatest, I don't say I'm surprised by it, sir, that he is working that they've employed him, but it does have a great deal of significance I think.

10:50.360 --> 11:03.360
Mr. Cagan, you have been with this committee, I've listened by Mr. Cagan, Chairman, with a few days after the Cagan Chairman, etc.

11:03.360 --> 11:11.360
You and I have also heard the charge, we don't like the method of the committee, we don't like the way the witnesses are treated.

11:11.360 --> 11:16.360
You know, we never find any, we're giving any specific things.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.360
Yes sir.

11:18.360 --> 11:29.360
I have interviewed, I believe thousands of witnesses, who have had over 500 witnesses of the paper for the Committee on the Rose,

11:29.360 --> 11:33.360
and I asked you this, did you ever see any of them with the charges?

11:33.360 --> 11:34.360
I did not check.

11:34.360 --> 11:55.360
Now, I think that the shining example of Mr. Cagan was a general, and I never knew before that a general could be intimidated by a few questions, I thought we had a fairly tough army, and I think most of them would not be intimidated by being asked to tell us truth.

11:55.360 --> 12:22.360
But could I ask you this, is it correct that the Mr. Licker was told, we had heard that he might possibly have a heart condition that we insisted on these lawyers, that he's doctor-fifty-siding, that the doctor was instructed, that if he felt the examination became too vigorous, if he felt the Mr. Licker was being excited in any way,

12:22.360 --> 12:31.360
then the doctor would have the absolute right to call off to the question of Mr. Licker.

12:31.360 --> 12:45.360
Yes sir, he, General's Wickers, did not want to doctor there, you insisted that he be in the room, that General's Wickers side, and that he interrupts the proceedings at any moment if he felt there was any possibility that the questioning should not continue.

12:45.360 --> 12:52.360
I told the doctor that we would give him the effect of the mental power, I didn't use those words, I don't believe.

12:52.360 --> 13:03.360
So, over ending we were doing the T-South, if he felt that the examination was getting too vigorous, all he had to do was say, we'll call a hall, we'll call a hall, that is right sir.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
There was no doubt about that.

13:04.360 --> 13:20.360
And it is the correct, Mr. Cohn, that after the Zlicker testimony, the press came in as they always said, I told Mr. Zlicker that I wanted him to sit right there in the jury box,

13:20.360 --> 13:36.360
listen to everything I said, and if I misquote of anything, that I wanted him to know that he was no longer under the jurisdiction of the committee, and I wanted him to correct any mist statements that I made, that's right, that is true sir.

13:36.360 --> 13:51.360
And then as it cracked the pictures, which are just that there, when I asked him if any correction to make, he made it until after I had left the building, and then they made a statement, that is true sir.

13:51.360 --> 14:18.360
And we heard this morning about denolution from the records, in the correct, Mr. Cohn, that you contacted the official reporter, and checked with him and found that every word that he had in his notes was transcribed, so that anyone who wants to read Zlicker testimony can get it non-read it.

14:18.360 --> 14:28.360
So that is true, and I believe the official reporter furnished an after-David to that effect of the committee, and if Mr. Stevens or anyone else suggests the contrary, he is very badly mistaken.

14:28.360 --> 14:47.360
Now Mr. Cohn, you and I have a belief of Cohn over the Zlicker testimony, read it over, we're curious to know where we might possibly have scared Mr. General or abused, and having read that testimony over, can you please read it?

14:47.360 --> 14:53.360
Can you say that this general was or was not in any way abused?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.360
I don't think he watched it.

14:55.360 --> 15:03.360
I mentioned that case, you left the only one which there was abuse claim, does I recall.

15:03.360 --> 15:29.360
Mr. Cohn, as far as you know, each witness who saw before the committee, I think a lot of exception, I think, was informed that he had the right to have counsel, the counsel could just be signing.

15:29.360 --> 15:44.360
If any time he wanted to discuss any question with his lawyer, he could do that, if any time he or his lawyer, self-linearly needed a private conference, and we were finally safe rooms for them to have a private conference.

15:44.360 --> 15:56.360
Before our committee, we have gone far beyond what is done in a courtroom for before grand jury, where a lawyer can only object.

15:56.360 --> 16:09.360
Here we allow the lawyer, and I'm not sure the women are going to far, we allow the lawyer to sit beside the witness, quailly coach him, talk to him at any time,

16:10.360 --> 16:17.360
and if there was any question of abuse, the lawyer could bring that question up, is that correct?

16:17.360 --> 16:27.360
That is absolutely correct, sir. I think the right is given to witnesses before the committee, but greater than witnesses would have in a court of law all before a grand jury.

16:27.360 --> 16:47.360
I think, sir, that you did a good number of things, and everything humanly possible to see that the rights of witnesses were completely protected, and I know that the record contains statements, even in the case of lawyers for some Fifth Amendment communists, congratulating the UNB committee, on the fair manner in which the hearing has been conducted.

16:47.360 --> 16:56.360
The Minister of Court with also heard some people talking about a one man investigating committee.

16:56.360 --> 17:15.360
Is it not correct that in all most every instance, the centers on the Republican side had an up interesting list that they had either represented there, or they requested that at night they get a resume to put one on during the day.

17:16.360 --> 17:31.360
Sir, yes, the situation is this, on that. I know that Senator Monson and the Dirkson and Senator Potter were in frequent attendance of both informal, formal, executive sessions and public sessions of the committee.

17:31.360 --> 17:41.360
I know they could not be there on those allways. They had to remember their office presence in order to carry them and immediate and first hand reports of what had transpired.

17:41.360 --> 17:50.360
Yes, I know sir, if I might answer a missed that, in addition to that, we furnished to those senators summaries.

17:50.360 --> 18:08.360
Frequently, what had transpired if a meeting were missed due to other Senate prisoners, and I further know sir, that in addition to the regular committee responsibility, Senator Monson and Senator Dirkson and Senator Potter each, sort of spearheaded and investigated a very important investigation of its up committee.

18:08.360 --> 18:12.360
They sent it a month, they won a appointment of the staff.

18:12.360 --> 18:16.360
And it has inspired the election of Senator Dirkson.

18:16.360 --> 18:22.360
I can see the witness Mr. Dirkson on the first, if you move or not.

18:26.360 --> 18:33.360
Mr. Cohen, yes sir. It takes quite a while to get around to me, I observed this morning.

18:34.360 --> 18:46.360
Mr. Cohen, my male and my telegrams reflect sir that you are held in a gratifyingly high esteem in this country.

18:46.360 --> 18:53.360
There, apparently, are good many people who think that I was unfair to you yesterday.

18:53.360 --> 18:57.360
Would you kind of set them as best if you could by saying I was fair?

18:58.360 --> 19:13.360
Sir, I would say the first part of your statement encourages me very much as far as the second-foughtest concerns to welch, I will certainly say you are a very figureist and a very able lawyer and close examiner with much more experience.

19:13.360 --> 19:20.360
And I'm sure, much more ability than I happen to have, and I'm sure you're doing your job as you see it, right?

19:20.360 --> 19:24.360
Well, would you mind picking up my words there, would you say it would say it?

19:25.360 --> 19:30.360
Well, the only trouble we ever have is when you're at me to pick up your words.

19:30.360 --> 19:34.360
I'm sure sir, you did not mean to be unfair to me, right?

19:34.360 --> 19:51.360
And Mr. Cohen, I say to you now that if in my zeal, and I guess all pilots are always a little jealous, if in my zeal I seem to be unfair, would you just kind of wave at me and say Mr. Well, I think you're getting unfair.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.360
So you do that? Yes sir.

19:53.360 --> 20:02.360
Now on the other side of it, just for your amusement some of some people wali and want to know why I didn't carry you, will lay him from land, see?

20:02.360 --> 20:07.360
Well, would you tell them that I guess you have, that it sounded as if I was fairly big, right?

20:07.360 --> 20:10.360
I will tell them that you tried to carry me when from Lentzert.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.360
Well, I don't think so.

20:15.360 --> 20:20.360
Now I ought to make all my friends go wherever number I've got to you with that as well.

20:20.360 --> 20:34.360
Mr. Cohen, I determined that I was going to come into the room this morning when you and I were both great, and where we wouldn't quarrel with each other at all, and discuss the thing that I think of as is of some importance.

20:34.360 --> 20:43.360
And that is the exchange between you and the infinitive works and yesterday about the loyalty for it and your intentions in respect to them.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.360
Yes sir.

20:44.360 --> 20:52.360
I'm going to read a little from the record, but I want to assure you that I'm not going to say now is that true or false, or anything like that?

20:52.360 --> 20:56.360
I just want to remind you of some things that you said as a basis for what I want to discuss with you.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.360
First we find this a little.

20:58.360 --> 21:07.360
On page 4795, it's from Mr. Gerkson said, speaking about when your committee work may start again,

21:07.360 --> 21:17.360
you as chief counsel would have some estimate of the work that will be undertaken as soon as the regular investigating committee gets underway, answer yes sir.

21:17.360 --> 21:23.360
So what are your judgment would be among the first of the things you would address to which you would address yourself?

21:23.360 --> 21:27.360
You would need more than one thing, but I want to call attention this one.

21:27.360 --> 21:31.360
I would say one of the first things would be this loyalty for it's question.

21:32.360 --> 21:41.360
Mr. Gerkson, in as much as the loyalty's matter is pending of the present time, it can be considered I take it as an unfinished committee business.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.360
Mr. Kohl, no doubt about it there.

21:44.360 --> 21:48.360
Mr. Kohl, on that basis it would be cut work, which strike it out.

21:48.360 --> 21:54.360
On that basis it would require no initiatory action for the action on the part of the committee.

21:54.360 --> 22:00.360
Mr. Kohl, the request of the Army or Mr. Adams to produce those people has been standing for some period of time.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.360
It's still fair. It has never been withdrawn.

22:03.360 --> 22:07.360
That is a matter of pending business for the committee.

22:07.360 --> 22:16.360
So it works for them. The authority to issue subpoenas lodges in the hands of the chairman unless I take it by action and the full committee that should be impaired.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.360
This phone matters right sir.

22:18.360 --> 22:23.360
So the request of the penis were actually issued for members of the loyalty board.

22:23.360 --> 22:32.360
But you anticipate by a way of a difference of opinions between the Army and the committee as to whether or not one, the members must respond as a penis.

22:32.360 --> 22:40.360
Two, whether they can testify on matters involving inferior loyalty boards and the action that was taken.

22:40.360 --> 22:45.360
Mr. Kohl, I am afraid it is a difference to such that there would be another collision.

22:45.360 --> 22:50.360
I would anticipate that that kind of a collision might bring some people back into this committee room.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.360
Mr. Kohl, if it follows the pattern of this there, I suppose it would. Yes sir.

22:55.360 --> 23:04.360
Now Mr. Kohl, I just want to chat with you a moment about that and it's all friend of this because this is a point where lawyers can differ, isn't it?

23:04.360 --> 23:06.360
What is that sir?

23:06.360 --> 23:11.360
The point is that what is correct to speak during respect to calling and examining members of loyalty boards.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.360
No sir. Do you think the opinions of the country is human?

23:15.360 --> 23:18.360
I don't know the opinion of the country as the unanimous serve.

23:18.360 --> 23:26.360
You expect from a legal standpoint, the members of the loyalty board have any immunity from a duty to a peer before a congressional committee.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.360
My answer to you would be I don't think it's even close.

23:29.360 --> 23:38.360
Now the first two things to discuss, the first thing is whether or not if it's a penis served on them, they've got to come up and take off their hat and sit down and say here I am.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.360
That's correct to me isn't it? Yes sir.

23:40.360 --> 23:45.360
Now on that point you say there can be no doubt that they've got to respond and take the witness there.

23:45.360 --> 23:54.360
Yes sir. Mr. Kohl, I don't count myself a great constitutional lawyer and all but all there is a difference I believe a little bit on that point.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.360
May I hope to call and take it on that one? Yes sir.

23:57.360 --> 24:01.360
I think they ought to come up and speak themselves who let us dare.

24:01.360 --> 24:06.360
Now the next point is if I understood your policy with Senator Berkson,

24:06.360 --> 24:14.360
it is your belief there that you may properly then examine them on their conduct as loyalty board members.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.360
Yes sir.

24:15.360 --> 24:29.360
And in instances where they have, as you have put it in this room, cleared Communists, you have counsel for this committee and the committee has the right to inquire about action on their part.

24:29.360 --> 24:46.360
So that if you find that a loyalty board has passed on the question of a possible support for security with and if you put it has cleared it, you may ask the loyalty board their reasons for doing so.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.360
We may ask that sir, yes.

24:48.360 --> 24:55.360
And you put the in the personal loyalty board member on the staff and inquire fully as to that whole case.

24:55.360 --> 24:59.360
Yes sir. What the evidence was before him.

24:59.360 --> 25:04.360
Is that right sir? We certainly can ask that sir, yes. All the evidence that was before him.

25:04.360 --> 25:08.360
Yes sir. All the reasons that moved in the deciding one way or the other.

25:08.360 --> 25:25.360
Yes sir. And saying you all the reasons that moved in deciding one way or the other, we could certainly ask questions about what evidence had been presented and whether or not they had, didn't have certain evidence showing the man was a communist or a metal guy.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.360
Yes sir.

25:26.360 --> 25:38.360
And in the event that you reach the conclusion that the loyalty board member that you have under discussion is decided to case wrongly, you can make that quite a pound, give it an open hearing to the public.

25:38.360 --> 25:52.360
Mr. Welch, I'm trying to go a long way here and give you a yes and no answer to my answer. So this is yes sir, but there are lots of ramifications to the questions which we could ask and the answers which we could obtain.

25:52.360 --> 25:57.360
And there are a lot of fields in which we could clearly enter and there are some about which they might be questioned.

25:57.360 --> 26:13.360
I'm only trying to point out this, Cohn. Yes. They view that you have a lawyer and a chief counsel to this committee and to get before the plans you have about examining members of the wildy board so that we will understand what the problem is.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.360
Yes sir. I'm a fine head by.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.360
How much time do we have to go?

26:19.360 --> 26:21.360
Two minutes.

26:21.360 --> 26:40.360
Now I take it that if after an examination of the wildy board member in respect to any case where there is any communist as we put it or a subversive or a security risk it's been cleared, you would of course strike it out.

26:40.360 --> 26:52.360
In the event that you develop a situation where you disagreed with the decisions of the wildy board member, you would of course feel free then to call the accused or the person that was under suspicion.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.360
No sir, it doesn't quite work that way usually.

26:54.360 --> 26:57.360
I didn't ask you whether it works that way. Would you feel free to call?

26:57.360 --> 27:08.360
Well, I would have felt free to call the accused before we called in the members of the loyalty board. In other words before we would call in the members of the loyalty board, we would examine the people who had been cleared.

27:08.360 --> 27:13.360
Yes, but there's no couple putting us the other way around either is there you can call the wildy board member first.

27:13.360 --> 27:18.360
And then if you wish call the man that he was dealing with after we're in the exam and him.

27:18.360 --> 27:23.360
I would say sir, let's be a... let's be putting the cards before the first.

27:23.360 --> 27:29.360
Well, I'm only talking about legal principles involved. It might be an off-ster way to do it, but there's nothing to prevent it is.

27:29.360 --> 27:30.360
No sir, legally enough.

27:30.360 --> 27:46.360
So, in the event that you first examined the loyalty board member and found yourself in violent disagreements as to what he has done in respect to somebody, it would be perfectly legal as I understand it for you then to call the person with whom he has dealt and he examined him yourself.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.360
It would be legal sir, yes sir, and proper for you to do so.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.360
Yes sir.

27:50.360 --> 28:03.360
Now my next question is, suppose when you have that loyalty board before you, you were to say to him, and by the way my sister snuck's assuming that was his name, and by the way if you got anything pending before you nod.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.360
It would be all right to ask him that too, wouldn't it?

28:06.360 --> 28:09.360
Well, he had anything pending pending, I'm... I'm... I'm decided.

28:09.360 --> 28:13.360
I can think of circumstances under which that would be dropping us, yes.

28:13.360 --> 28:17.360
So that you could pick up his... his stock at a undecided case.

28:17.360 --> 28:21.360
Well, I can think of circumstances under which that would be proper, ordinarily I don't admit.

28:21.360 --> 28:26.360
Well, the circumstances would depend on whether or not his product was proper, isn't that right?

28:26.360 --> 28:38.360
Well, it might have been on this, sir, if you found evidence that the man himself had a Communist front record and that he had been consistently clearing Communists, I think I know that Senator McCarthy well enough to know that the next question would...

28:38.360 --> 28:44.360
My very well-being, how many loyalty cases are you... how many loyalty penalties that none write now?

28:44.360 --> 28:45.360
Right, sir.

28:45.360 --> 28:48.360
And how many cases did you got before you that are partially heard?

28:48.360 --> 28:49.360
He might ask about it, yes, sir, yes.

28:49.360 --> 28:53.360
And you have no difference on me about the propriety of those questions.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.360
I have no difficulty about the propriety of them being asked, sir.

28:56.360 --> 29:02.360
And no difficulty about your ability to force the boy and the board member to answer those questions.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.360
That might be difficult, sir.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.360
That might be a different question.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.360
Senator, this is pretty well.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.360
Well, we're going to continue this this afternoon.

29:11.360 --> 29:16.360
The audit, I think, very properly thinking one question that I'll bring you up to pursue.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.360
Yes, sir.

29:17.360 --> 29:22.360
I'll try to think of all that I said for two senators. If I miss any of them, I observe you will take them up.

29:22.360 --> 29:26.360
Well, I was much rather than you, Mr. McNouth.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.360
Well, you're coming on the way out now, from there.

29:28.360 --> 29:32.360
Yes, well, we've released, of course, to the Quake's judicial calendar.

29:32.360 --> 29:42.360
Well, our members of the law are screening board and whether or not they would come within the jurisdiction of an executive of the board of the presidential law.

29:42.360 --> 29:46.360
And because I think that's right at the heart of his thing.

29:46.360 --> 29:54.360
Well, I think Senator, to you and I and the wetland side discussing, take wave and inform the judicial questions.

29:54.360 --> 30:04.360
I might say that I don't know whether you're going to agree with this co-incuse or not, but if you'd like to know what mine are for whatever they were, I don't have to agree with Mr. Coal.

30:04.360 --> 30:12.360
Yes, the line we have a certain fact and I think should take place right now that's more important than the committee says.

30:12.360 --> 30:18.360
And if I may make an unsolumentary inquiry, we'll want you to accept it.

30:18.360 --> 30:24.360
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.360
We take this.

30:26.360 --> 30:48.360
Everyone agrees on the birthday cake.

30:56.360 --> 31:06.360
Thank you.

31:06.360 --> 31:09.360
We stand in each step until two o'clock.

31:09.360 --> 31:16.360
Now I understand why this is following and going on.

31:16.360 --> 31:30.360
If he drops that cake, it's going to be quite the thing. There's no proof young what's the president of Senator Monthly's cake on this is 54th birthday.

31:30.360 --> 31:36.360
Senator McCarthy, congratulations, shake hands.

31:36.360 --> 31:44.360
Earlier today, Senator McCarthy raised a point of order which the chairman of course is probably.

31:46.360 --> 31:49.360
Thank you.
