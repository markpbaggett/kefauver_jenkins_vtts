WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay, let's go.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is S.C. Fauver.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
You are a junior United States senator in Washington, bringing you another report to listeners

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
over this patient.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
And they state a kind of state.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
A telling needs my administrative assistant who usually interviews me on these programs

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
just spending time in Tennessee during this week.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
And they're happy to have in this video with me Mr. Solomon, Robert.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
One of the most outstanding and capable gentlemen of the state here in Washington.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Robert has got a number of years.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
There's been a star reporter of the Washington Post, which is the first one of the nation's great news pages.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Mr. Robert, though, has been reporting part of Washington's most most of his development

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
is the National Reliance investigation of organized time at the operation in the state

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
commerce.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Very glad to have you in the studio with me, Salmonds.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
I would be delighted to hear you and it's unrefused interview.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
But ask me about some of the matters that have been going on in Washington during the past week.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Thank you very much, Senator.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
I think that one thing that people back home with the interest of in as a extension of the draft

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
is that it has about 1,000 Congress.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
That's not easy about that.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
But, Robert, of course, I have the pleasure of serving on the Armed Services Committee of the Senate,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
which I've considered specifically for the Extension to draft.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
After listening to all of these testimony, that was presented to our committee,

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
I didn't see how we could arrive at any other conclusion, but at the draft that they suspended.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
In the first place, in order to keep up our leadership and international stars,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
and not let the democracy to rest in your doubt,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
though the world has been means that they've prepared for any emergency,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
I felt that we had to extend the draft.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
And then the other thing is that with the draft extended, the services things that they will be able

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
to get enough volunteers to take care of their needs,

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
that is, that things get worse in the immediate future.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
So, the Armed Services Committee of the Senate unanimously recommended the extension of the draft.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
There was a might of controversy over one amendment that was proposed by Senator Russell of Georgia,

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
and that about half the patient of anyone who was inducted to serve in a unit,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
that was proposed by our people of his own color.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
That's the, doesn't apply to the technical services,

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
but in the mass units, that's the way the Army and services have been operating in the past,

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
and they've been able to operate that way, that is successful.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm feeling about the less some amendments like that,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
was adopted, it might be a great deal of confusion.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
The first state is the House of Representatives passed the two-year extension,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
it's been a past three-year extension.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
The chief controversy now, since the bill is in conference,

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
is who is going to be able to follow the operation of the draft into operation,

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
that is, whether it must be done by the resolution of Congress or whether the person can do so.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
The problem there is what's happening in some America,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
it came up on Congress when the session was announced.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
That's the main problem.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
I think the people perhaps would be better satisfied if Congress followed the operation of the draft into operation.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
My personal feeling is that if Congress is in session, that it should be done by action as Congress.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
If Congress is not in session, if some emergency comes up,

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
I think that it should be able to set the draft in operation by the President

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
perhaps with the concerns of the vice president and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
And there are other people like the President's past,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
the fly-as-preach extension of rent control.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, rent control only applies, I think,

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
to two cities in Tennessee, so it's not a particularly vital issue in the home state.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
The act that was passed in the sense of the White House,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
and I think approved by the President,

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
provides for an extension of rent control for six months or until January 1, 1952.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
And then after that time, there will be no federal rent control,

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
unless it is terminally voted on by the governing bodies of the cities or municipalities that are expected.

04:50.000 --> 05:01.000
In other words, they would have to definitely ask for it for a period of time to slide them over until the supply of houses touches up with the demand.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
Personally, it would like very much to see us be able to terminate with rent control,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
but unfortunately we have had a rather emergency measure here,

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
and I think the formula that's been arrived at by Congress is a fair and a very good one.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
It started passing the response, though, in fact, in the state.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
That's right, and it fixes those things,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
the local rent control in relation to the media.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
And since it roughly provides for the situation jobs,

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
it has provision for use to other places in the quarries,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
whenever it becomes necessary.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
So it has provision for the senior military age to reach and to Turkey.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
My feeling is that it is a necessary part of the working arrangements that we have with other democratic people

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
to give them some assistance in this life.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
The states upon the premise that they're going to do is essential amounts of substance cells,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
and they must enter into a context for that purpose.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Also, I think it will be a very cold season of cold season use

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
and holding the democracies of Western Europe together.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Frankly though, I'm at the Roberts, I've always felt that

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
the matter of foreign policy and military aid and economics and

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
extending together and the interest of peace ought to be handled on a overall basis

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
rather than our peace-meal basis.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
And that of course, it should be settled by law and some kind of

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
federation rather than abandoning land or contractual basis.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
But we seem to be going at these things in connection with our foreign policy on a peace-meal basis.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And so I was part of the military aid focus,

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
but I think our administration is getting and rightfully more to a general overall plan

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
rather than just dealing with one thing at a time.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
One of the big, specific developments in your part of the country,

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
and the military field is the Arnold Air Engineering Development Matter,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
what's the latest word on that?

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Well, I think it's a glad you asked that question,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
and I'm glad to see that people in other parts of the country

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
know something about this great development that is a such great importance to the nation and the Tennessee.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
We have been very proud in the volunteer state that I've heard you out.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Our location and our great amount of electric power,

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
which is being developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority,

07:39.000 --> 07:47.000
that we have been able to play a very important part in these developments for the defense of the nation and of the three people of the world.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
The Arnold Engineering Development Center, as you know,

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
is located near fellow home at Old Cap Farts,

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
and it is to be a place for the testing of engines and airplanes and guided missiles

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
that all kinds of conditions and seeds.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
So as to keep our head of anybody else from a scientific and a technical viewpoint,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
I think it will be a great saving in order to test these things

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
and experimentally, rather than having to actually build a jet or the plane and then people.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
Just a few days ago, I found that Colonel Dunn, who is in charge of the project at fellow home within town,

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
that all general know who is immediately in charge of the Arnold Engineering Development Center

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
and made an engagement with him and was Colonel Dunn to go over their plans.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
It was them and they are in a service they were making of what the work schedule,

08:46.000 --> 08:55.000
the program is scheduled and the air core and the services generally are continuing

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
through the algorithms and realizing more and more of the domestic and the specialty for this great project.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
If a certain amount of construction, preliminary work is already started

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
and just as rapidly as possible, other things will be done.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
That's what it sounds like, progress.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
Any words from President Summan on that CVA study on the Kamal and Bale?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
I know you've been interested in that for a long time.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Yes, Kammer.

09:25.000 --> 09:34.000
We, of course, many of us are very much interested in the fully possible development of the Kamal and Rivers

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
in the Statiya, in the state of Tennessee.

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
In order to ensure its full its development and its integration into the work of the Kamati Valley of Party,

09:47.000 --> 09:56.000
I have built pending to have the development of the Kamal and Bale carried on by the Kamati Valley of Party.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Then they become part of the CVA.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Yes, it went under the bills that we have pending.

10:02.000 --> 10:11.000
This is not the regulatory of the four of engineers or any other organizations that have been doing such fine work in the Kamal and Bale.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
But the Rivers started just about 12 miles apart.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
The follow-up thing general of course, and they empty into the old house, I think, just about three miles apart.

10:22.000 --> 10:31.000
And of course, all of this, the Kamal and Bale territory is actually served by the CVA in the farest powers and things anyway.

10:31.000 --> 10:41.000
They are being, that the four of engineers tell the power to the department of the interior and the intern tell it to the Kamati Valley of Party.

10:41.000 --> 10:53.000
And the main thing I think is that in order to meet our impeaching industrial needs and the needs of electricity for the Parnal Air Engineering Development Center,

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
we must get as much electricity out of the Kamal and its possible.

10:59.000 --> 11:13.000
Some time back, all of it in the Kutty and Tennessee delegation asked its persons to have the CVA make a study of what land they would have for the development of the Kumble and Rivers.

11:13.000 --> 11:25.000
And a few days ago I received a letter from President Sillman and what he sent to me and to the other members of the Kutty and Tennessee delegation, the interim report of the CVA.

11:25.000 --> 11:43.000
The President said it seems to me that a re-valuations of plans and methods of development of the resources of the Kumble and Rivers National, but I'm sure you will agree that the Commission of the National Council report and recommendations to the Congress that a waste and treatment of the Tennessee Valley of Party studies.

11:44.000 --> 11:53.000
This is encouraging to those of us who are in the CVA, to show that the President feels that a re-evaluation of the whole matter is necessary.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
And so I think we are making fabric and getting a factual basis for early consideration of the legislation and the next term.

12:01.000 --> 12:11.000
And there are a kind of politics that manages the DNA. The government, which were up there, the Democratic luncheon was a president at the time of the conference.

12:11.000 --> 12:23.000
And I think that there are a number of, there is a great deal of concern in Washington, the Democratic governors, that is all of them except Governor Smith, that's in Atlanta.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
And the Washington have lunch with President Sillman. And they were visiting those senators.

12:30.000 --> 12:42.000
I hope the pleasure of a visit with the English Governor, the Tennessee Governor's founding, I hope so, and a visit with Governor Luffy, who I could give our visible comments.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
So, it was a great honor to have the Democratic governors come to see us in Washington.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
How's that time investigation going? You haven't been giving us much news.

12:51.000 --> 13:01.000
You are there all the time and you reported for the Washington Post. I think we are getting started there well, of course the difficulty is, is there a...

13:01.000 --> 13:11.000
And then this big nation and we are having an awful lot of requests from all over the nation for investigation, here in the orange, in situations of different problems.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
So, with a very small staff and five visit senators on the committee, we are just going to do this.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Very much we can do, develop whatever's best, there may be.

13:21.000 --> 13:31.000
So, everybody thank you very much for appearing on this program with me today. Our time is up until the same time, next week, that's all from Washington.
