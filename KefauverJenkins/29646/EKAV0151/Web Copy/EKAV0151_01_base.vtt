00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
For the purpose, for the purpose of the documentation now in the second day, I will not do

00:08.400 --> 00:14.200
the assignment of the A. I read a copy of the letter days on November 15, 1953.

00:14.200 --> 00:21.840
In the address, if I get the file, if the swervings for having, I can't order or register

00:21.840 --> 00:22.840
the letter inside.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.840
The letter is back.

00:23.840 --> 00:24.840
The letter is back.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.840
The letter is back.

00:25.840 --> 00:26.840
I beg your pardon, Mr. Chairman.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.340
If the problem says you're on the left, I wouldn't see you in the evening, go to the

00:32.340 --> 00:33.340
office.

00:33.340 --> 00:37.340
I think in all fairness there, everybody's this letter should be read.

00:37.340 --> 00:39.340
I don't know the content of it.

00:39.340 --> 00:44.540
And I am now Mr. Chairman of all the standards back on the witness stands for this purpose

00:44.540 --> 00:48.840
only and for no other purpose, I'm sure I'm going to let him in the check.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.840
We don't have that.

00:49.840 --> 00:50.840
That's a bad one.

00:50.840 --> 00:55.840
The problem is brother, that's the point he's got to get to the post and that's the point

00:55.840 --> 00:56.840
of the contract.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.840
That's maybe part of it.

00:57.840 --> 01:05.840
Yes, he's got the fact that this will be entered as the exhibit number 13.

01:05.840 --> 01:12.840
You were still very young, the enemy.

01:12.840 --> 01:23.840
I have to say, you were born in the event of the last war and it's born again.

01:23.840 --> 01:30.840
Yes, I have to say you identify as you stand against the official position to hold with

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840
the army.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840
Yes, sir.

01:32.840 --> 01:39.840
You now have before you a carbon-conviver letter as I recall, they did October 15, 1963.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
Is that correct?

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
I do, sir.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.840
I'm Jack Pizzo.

01:42.840 --> 01:48.840
Honorable Joseph Arma, currently chairman of the Investigating Stuff Committee, United States

01:48.840 --> 01:49.840
Center.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.840
Mr. Heather.

01:50.840 --> 01:57.840
We now read him to the record.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.840
The contents of that letter.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.840
I will share dear Mr. Chairman.

02:02.840 --> 02:08.840
He is understood that a representative of the civilian personnel office has brought

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
armed men to the jerky.

02:09.840 --> 02:15.840
They're available to members of the staff of the organization, the entire personnel file

02:15.840 --> 02:17.840
on Aaron H. Coleman.

02:17.840 --> 02:24.840
Despite the fact that the file in question contained information relating to loyalty and security

02:24.840 --> 02:30.840
investigations and procedures, which the army is prohibited by our presidential directive

02:30.840 --> 02:33.840
from transmitting outside the executive branch.

02:33.840 --> 02:39.320
When this file was photos that the ant-centred department of the army in Washington for Trans

02:39.320 --> 02:44.840
Middle New York Committee, photos that of those documents relating to loyalty and security

02:44.840 --> 02:50.840
matters were withdrawn in accordance with customary procedures established pursuant to the

02:50.840 --> 02:51.840
presidential directive.

02:51.840 --> 02:57.840
Accordingly, the photos that sent to your committee were not as complete as the original file,

02:57.840 --> 03:01.840
which members of your staff had already inspected.

03:01.840 --> 03:07.840
This prohibition against furnishing loyalty and security information outside the executive

03:07.840 --> 03:13.840
branch has already been violated in the Coleman case by action at the field installation.

03:13.840 --> 03:20.840
Secretary Steven Seales, that no useful purpose will be served in this particular case by withholding

03:20.840 --> 03:26.840
from your committee, photos that of documents with your staff have already inspected.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.840
At the express direction of the secretary, therefore, there are forwarded here with photos

03:31.840 --> 03:35.840
that of six documents with accompanying attachments.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.840
Cincerely, yours, John G. Adams, department's counselor.

03:38.840 --> 03:44.840
In the lower left-hand corner, our list is the six documents which were forwarded there

03:44.840 --> 03:53.840
with the enclosures are photos that of Form 52, Form 84, Form 72, and Form 50, each of which

03:53.840 --> 03:55.840
is a loyalty or security form.

03:55.840 --> 03:59.840
I cannot further identify them without having me in front of them in front of me.

03:59.840 --> 04:05.840
A photos that of the letter to the commanding general Fort Monmouth from Colonel JD O'Connell

04:05.840 --> 04:13.840
to October 1946, which I recall as being a document having to do with the reprimand given

04:13.840 --> 04:21.840
to Colvin on one occasion and a reprimand with endorsement dated 21 October 1946.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.840
That is the complete letter.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.840
The original of which was the letter that the United States may have been.

04:27.840 --> 04:33.840
No, sir, that is not correct. I was in New York attending these executive hearings.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.840
My staff in Washington was in contact with the by telephone.

04:37.840 --> 04:43.840
On the occasion, Mr. Stevens was in New York also on the 13th and the 14th of October.

04:43.840 --> 04:49.840
As I recall, my staff advised me by telephone that this was coming up.

04:49.840 --> 04:55.840
They sent it on the secretary's airplane which was coming up to get him.

04:55.840 --> 05:00.840
I went out with the secretary on the evening of the 14th and picked up this letter which was dated

05:00.840 --> 05:03.840
the next day with the day I intended to deliver it.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.840
I picked up this letter, took it downtown and signed it.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.840
That is my recollection.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.840
A recollection of the means by which this was transmitted to the committee.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.840
And was it time to submit it by hand?

05:15.840 --> 05:16.840
Yes, sir.

05:16.840 --> 05:21.840
By any of you to the Democratic District Council and the SCAR to whom I think Mr. Colvin.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.840
My recollection is a matter of.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.840
In New York City, Virginia.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.840
New York at the United States Courthouse in Foley, Squared.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.840
I have everything to do with your work.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.840
My recollection may be wronged by one day.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.840
Maybe the letter is dated one day.

05:34.840 --> 05:39.840
A way within one or two days, I have heard this charge have been made against the Secretary

05:39.840 --> 05:45.840
of the Mr. Colvin and in the executive section of October 5th, 14th, the sector as director.

05:45.840 --> 05:53.840
So you now say that there was furnished to the McCarthy Committee within one or two days

05:54.840 --> 06:01.840
of the executive hearing of October 14th, the entire personnel file on the 11th,

06:01.840 --> 06:05.840
coma, including law of the information.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.840
Is that correct, Mr. Adam?

06:07.840 --> 06:10.840
Mr. Jenkins, the paper speaks for itself.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.840
I do not remember the portfolio that was submitted.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.840
Well, I have no further questions.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.840
Mr. Miller, could you just count by the answer of that problem?

06:18.840 --> 06:20.840
Look it down to you in just a minute.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.840
I was like an hour and a half, just 10 minutes, you just said Adam.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.840
Of course, I'd never go out on a council's trust.

06:26.840 --> 06:27.840
You left.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.840
Mr. Patrick.

06:28.840 --> 06:35.840
No, I asked Mr. Adam, is the chairman appointed after he moved to be Mr. Senator because it's

06:35.840 --> 06:36.840
termed public now.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.840
I don't know.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.840
Senator McCroden, have any questions?

06:38.840 --> 06:39.840
No, of course.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.840
Any senders?

06:40.840 --> 06:41.840
The right.

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
Any senders to the left?

06:42.840 --> 06:43.840
Yes.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.840
I have a question.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.840
I have a question.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.840
I may take my time.

06:46.840 --> 06:52.840
I'd like to address the question respectfully to the council.

06:52.840 --> 06:57.840
Mr. Council, this is the ninth day of this man who has been on the stand.

06:57.840 --> 07:05.840
My impression is that he is getting confused with some of his answers more than he did before.

07:05.840 --> 07:10.840
Now, I've just jotted down here 12 people who, when a specific piece of information was

07:10.840 --> 07:18.840
desired, were sworn in in order to give that information to the committee several times

07:18.840 --> 07:25.840
in his testimony in his testimony today as I remember it.

07:25.840 --> 07:31.840
Mr. Stevens has said that he did not have the information because it was something with

07:31.840 --> 07:36.840
which he had no direct connection of any kind, whatever.

07:36.840 --> 07:42.840
And he said he could furnish our body who would have it and who could give the information.

07:42.840 --> 07:47.840
I would like to respectfully suggest in order to expedite the hearings.

07:47.840 --> 07:54.840
We've had people like Mr. Adams, Mr. Shine, Mr. Juliana, Mr. Anastas, Mrs. Mim, the council

07:54.840 --> 07:58.840
himself swore himself once.

07:58.840 --> 08:04.840
We've had Mr. Wells sworn, we've had Mr. Senclown sworn, we've had Sergeant Manchester.

08:04.840 --> 08:08.840
These are ones that I just happened to jot down here in the last couple of minutes.

08:08.840 --> 08:13.840
And that they can always invite the senator signings who's going to be sworn.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.840
And they're giving him the information.

08:15.840 --> 08:16.840
Don't forget that.

08:16.840 --> 08:17.840
Well, don't forget that.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.840
I don't know.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.840
I need not to discuss Senator Simon to now let us discuss the problem of this committee.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.840
That is Senator Cicius, the senator.

08:25.840 --> 08:31.840
If the council would like to continue any discussion with respect to me being sworn

08:31.840 --> 08:37.840
and glad to accommodate him at this time, I repeat that for steps to the senator

08:37.840 --> 08:38.840
preciciously.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.840
I thank the council.

08:41.840 --> 08:47.840
Now in order to try to get to my point Mr. Council, if you will allow me, sir.

08:47.840 --> 08:52.840
I would like to suggest that when this man has been on the hearing nine days,

08:52.840 --> 08:59.840
on the stand nine days and he's hearing says that he has somebody who can give the information

08:59.840 --> 09:04.840
with the premise which you so well put, but you said we wanted the truth.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.840
Now he'd be allowed to furnish that person and we go to the next question.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.840
That is the point of my recommendation.

09:11.840 --> 09:21.840
May I suggest to the senator that that is the identical procedure we have just followed?

09:21.840 --> 09:28.840
The Secretary of the Vice-desire will call that such a letter had not been found.

09:28.840 --> 09:34.840
The cabinet written by Mr. Adams, the council suggested that he stand beside

09:34.840 --> 09:37.840
and that Mr. Adams take the witness down.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.840
I thank the council.

09:38.840 --> 09:46.840
I agree with him, but somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour ago, the Secretary said he did not have the information.

09:46.840 --> 09:52.840
He had never had anything to do with files for a, as he said, as I remember the testimony,

09:52.840 --> 10:00.840
if we would let somebody that he could get up on the stand, give us the facts that person in this case could give us the facts.

10:00.840 --> 10:07.840
I, I answered that in my statement this morning, Senator Simon-Dum.

10:07.840 --> 10:17.840
It is now my purpose at last time, directed otherwise by this committee to put on every witness, every party in the interest,

10:17.840 --> 10:26.840
every substantiating witness by whom many facts may be proven or disproven during the course of this investigation.

10:26.840 --> 10:31.840
The chairman has made one point I hope I have, and I have no further questions.

10:31.840 --> 10:36.840
Chairman, Chairman, do you have any minutes?

10:36.840 --> 10:38.840
I have a question.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.840
Let me go to the other one.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.840
I'm planning a general conference for you.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.840
I'm not going to ask where inside.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.840
I didn't want to raise a point of order, just if that is inappropriate.

10:48.840 --> 10:54.840
It was just by accident that I was able to find this revealing letter in this courtroom,

10:54.840 --> 10:57.840
except for my ability to find it.

10:57.840 --> 11:08.840
Or more accurately, from the ability of the men behind me to file it, we would have floundered around in accusation to get Steven's respect to a letter that he never wrote,

11:08.840 --> 11:16.840
and that which when produced handed all the bullets and got this hearing back on the wea.

11:16.840 --> 11:27.840
Now I agree with Senator Simon, that there just makes no sense to talk to Secretary Steven about letters when it turns out A is as cold as lava,

11:27.840 --> 11:34.840
and B that when we find the copy, Steven is right.

11:35.840 --> 11:41.840
The chair would like to remind the council that what Secretary Steven stated in the letter just as I mentioned,

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
and that he had it in the form of a stamp.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.840
Why do you say he did write the letter?

11:45.840 --> 11:48.840
You produced the letter? That's the way to make it.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.840
Mr. Cohn or...

11:50.840 --> 11:52.840
Senator McCartney?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.840
We have to do what I'm doing.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.840
Mr. Adams, we have to do this.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.840
President, please complete the record.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.840
Mr. Adams, I ask you to file a letter as an exhibit.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
I'll be talking about it.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
Yes, I'll be talking about it.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
I'm a director.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.840
I'll be asking your president.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.840
You've heard Mr. Wells just referred to this as foolishness.

12:15.840 --> 12:21.840
Would you consider it foolishness to have a final script to not tell the committee of the script?

12:22.840 --> 12:24.840
We've done a physics committee as a complete file.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.840
We've told the committee by the letter that it has been scripted.

12:28.840 --> 12:29.840
Senator?

12:29.840 --> 12:34.840
Well, it's after we've caught your head and then you gave us the material.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.840
What can I say to Mr. Cohn?

12:36.840 --> 12:38.840
Let me give it a true.

12:38.840 --> 12:39.840
It's material.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.840
Last week, we showed you that our notes show the file of the script.

12:43.840 --> 12:47.840
Up until that time, you sat in room with your aunt.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.840
New we had the file.

12:50.840 --> 12:54.840
New we're addressing Mr. Cohn on the list as the left file.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.840
Never raise your voice until that file has been stripped.

12:58.840 --> 13:05.840
Senator, as I recall, there was no time during the fall or winter during my negotiations with you.

13:05.840 --> 13:10.840
And of course, that's when I failed to tell you that we always took from the file.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.840
I'll boil the insecurity information.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.840
I never kept that as it was written from.

13:14.840 --> 13:22.840
And I never imagined that Mr. Cohn would put off the witness stand at this time out of water.

13:22.840 --> 13:30.840
Or one purpose and one purpose only in that was to identify and introduce in the records the less obvious the letter

13:30.840 --> 13:33.840
that the Senate of the North Korea on October 50th.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.840
I don't mind withholding my question, the President's letter.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.840
I don't have to go to the press for some time.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.840
Very well, I think that the point of the council is exactly correct.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.840
He would probably end to identify the letter.

13:46.840 --> 13:56.840
And there is an impression if you have to ask him about his attitude towards the situation you can ask him and do for it, he becomes the witness.

13:56.840 --> 14:04.840
And there is any other person you can ask to introduce about identifying the letter or whether he did identify it or whether he wrote it.

14:04.840 --> 14:09.840
I think I've sophisticated identified Mr. Chairman this appearance really.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.840
A copy of the letter is very sweet.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.840
Got objection, Mr. Adams may step down and be unspoiled against it.

14:16.840 --> 14:21.840
And Mr. Steven will step back.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.840
I believe I was first to witness the statement of the meeting.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.840
Yes, I think you're trying to come. You have ten minutes.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.840
Mr. Steven's have had the forming of the letter, which is written.

14:32.840 --> 14:37.840
Written after Mr. Goen, called your attention to the fact that the personnel file is in stress.

14:37.840 --> 14:43.840
But a client of Mr. Adams, I'd like to ask you whether this statement may have been under its true or not.

14:43.840 --> 14:52.840
It says that at the express direction of the secretary,

14:52.840 --> 14:59.840
therefore there are four words here with full of steps of six documents for the accompanying attention.

15:00.840 --> 15:12.840
Now, did you, Mr. Adams, discuss the stripping of the file that you tell him to forward to us the documents which we told him and to remove from the file?

15:12.840 --> 15:15.840
Well, that letter arrived. I want you to hold it your hand there.

15:15.840 --> 15:23.840
And my coffee would indicate that I did. I have difficulty in recalling the conversation with Mr. Adams.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.840
But I presume that I just just with him and Mr. Breller resolved it.

15:27.840 --> 15:40.840
You don't remember any conversation with Mr. Adams at any time in regard to the stripping or whatever word the written withdrawal of Mr. Adams said, the material from the personnel file.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.840
You don't recall at all as it's made.

15:44.840 --> 15:50.840
Well, we were trying to find the directives that we worked on there at all times on the McCarthy.

15:51.840 --> 15:56.840
And we discussed the application of those presidential directives to our file.

15:56.840 --> 16:02.840
Mr. Secretary, the number of the sons or the raised the questions you're being kept to withstand too long.

16:02.840 --> 16:06.840
If you would try to answer the question, I'd like to hear your heart.

16:06.840 --> 16:11.840
Where the question is this is very simple. Now that your memory is refreshed,

16:12.840 --> 16:20.840
you recall discussing with Mr. Adams the removal of material from the Coleman file.

16:20.840 --> 16:27.840
If you can mind the Coleman was the man the friend of Julius Rosenberg identified as the member of the Uncommoners League.

16:27.840 --> 16:36.840
As I've installed and sequenced the radar laboratory, I assume you consider him rather an important person, perhaps even more important than a private.

16:37.840 --> 16:41.840
And if a senior memory should be fairly fresh on mass, after I refresh it,

16:41.840 --> 16:46.840
I now ask you the simple question, if you don't answer it, what you want from another son.

16:46.840 --> 17:02.840
Let me repeat, do you now remember whether or not you ever discussed with Mr. Adams the removal of material from Coleman's personnel file before it was given to the committee.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.840
I do not recall any such conversations.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.840
Well, thank you for your answer.

17:07.840 --> 17:26.840
Uh, uh, did you recall ever checking the files and regards to Coleman personally, all before our committee started investigation.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.840
Would you restate that, Mr. Adams, but they have the record of it?

17:29.840 --> 17:34.840
He's the recall ever seeing or getting report. Many of your support.

17:34.840 --> 17:42.840
The regards to certain courtman look for a personnel before our committee started its investigation.

17:42.840 --> 17:52.840
Well, it's been worked, it's done by my organization ever since I went into office, not having a car, the affecting all installation, as well as the courtman.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.840
Would you try and answer the question of the secretary?

17:56.840 --> 17:59.840
Would the reporter mean the president of the secretary?

17:59.840 --> 18:01.840
Part of the secretary.

18:09.840 --> 18:21.840
Oh, I was saying, I was at the report, I guess, before it was, in regard to certain courtman personnel before our committee started its investigation.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.840
Yes, I recall that, I'm kind of in the court thing.

18:25.840 --> 18:37.840
Did you either see or get a report from your support notes in regard to FBI, repeated reports on certain personnel?

18:37.840 --> 18:39.840
And the courtman was my secretary.

18:39.840 --> 18:46.840
I know that we were in very close touch with FBI at all times on court, Monica.

18:46.840 --> 18:52.840
Well, that is why I am raising this trust in North and North, and I wasn't bringing the FBI into this with you.

18:52.840 --> 18:57.840
Trying to leave the impression that perhaps it was the FBI strike that.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.840
I shouldn't say it's trying to leave the impression.

18:59.840 --> 19:05.840
I'm afraid you may have left the impression with the secretary that the FBI was derelict misdewty.

19:05.840 --> 19:10.840
Oh, well, I did, I wish to immediately correct any such incendiary.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.840
Good, I'm going right, you do because I think you're both the great saver doing good job.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.840
No, not yesterday.

19:16.840 --> 19:25.840
I would like to, Mr. Secretary, give you a letter, one which was written instantly before you took office,

19:25.840 --> 19:34.840
with which was in the file, I understand you're all in the same year at office, I understand this in the file as of today, from the FBI.

19:34.840 --> 19:52.840
Pointing out the urgency and the action of certain cases, listing the facts, for example, that Coleman had been a direct connection with the Mexican ICE agent, Mr. Chairman, Senator McCarty.

19:52.840 --> 20:02.840
I think it only fair to this, with this that you first, the staff is the fact by him, it's such as the fact that that letter was in his file at the time he came into office,

20:02.840 --> 20:04.840
and he's played here at office.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.840
I think that point is very well taken.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.840
Good point, Mr. Secretary.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.840
What, what, what, what, what, what, what some of the candidates heard this letter?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.840
Mr. Chabbent.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.840
Chabbent, do you have any arguments to vote?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.840
I like that the end of the first Mr. J.

20:18.840 --> 20:22.840
for the end of the rule along with the material.

20:22.840 --> 20:30.840
We have same with the drunkennessy reason Mr. Bing Smith, before you rule, you may want to read it first.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.840
I don't know if you have any arguments to vote.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.840
I don't know if you have any arguments to vote.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.840
I don't know if you have any arguments to vote.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.840
I don't know if you have any arguments to vote.

20:48.840 --> 20:54.840
Well, Committee of the Council of Jenkins reads this letter which has just been introduced in evidence.

20:54.840 --> 21:00.840
Senator McCarty, and his chief councilor Roy M. Cohen, our holding out, which first conference.

21:00.840 --> 21:04.840
This only sequence of evidence.

21:04.840 --> 21:12.840
You are due to New York City's own station WNYC.

21:12.840 --> 21:32.840
This is the long two-page letter.

21:32.840 --> 21:37.840
Committee of the Council of Jenkins is very carefully reading and taking his time about it.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.840
The other is about the committee table.

21:41.840 --> 21:51.840
Meanwhile, our referring to their notes are scribbling memos or FDR-213 conference is going on around the table.

21:51.840 --> 21:55.840
Now, Mr. Jenkins appears to have finished.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.840
The council, may I give a fair, because if they'll ask me glad to hear you, Senator.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.840
Madam McCarty.

22:01.840 --> 22:07.840
We have the reason for pressing Mr. Stevens for this letter and submitting it to him.

22:07.840 --> 22:11.840
It's not because of the written two, he hasn't written before he can offer.

22:11.840 --> 22:23.840
But because it is part of a series of letters from the FBI warning of the tremendous danger of Aaron Coleman, his associates, handling top secret radar material.

22:23.840 --> 22:32.840
But those repeated warnings were at risk of regard to ignore until this committee opened its investigation.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.840
The file letter was not written by Mr. Stevens.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.840
It was ignored by him and his supporters.

22:38.840 --> 22:43.840
No attention to say to this letter until he's here in control.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.840
Mr. Chairman, it shows we came from the investigation.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.840
Now, make a statement that I can remind you of your question.

22:51.840 --> 22:56.840
It reports to be and it will have to be developed whether or not such as the fact.

22:56.840 --> 23:08.840
It reports to be a letter written off to 2619-51 for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and signed by J. Edgar Hoover, the director.

23:08.840 --> 23:17.840
It is addressed to Major General Pauline, assistant chief of staff, G2, Department of the Army Washington DC.

23:17.840 --> 23:29.840
It does the copy of the letter contain pertinent information with respect to Coleman, perhaps others who should be investigated.

23:29.840 --> 23:40.840
The question now is whether or not this letter was in the file of the Department of the Army, but the secretary became Secretary of the Army.

23:40.840 --> 23:48.840
And whether or not it either came to his attention or by the exercise with due diligence he should have known about it.

23:48.840 --> 23:53.840
And the acted in accordance with the yesterday's may in this letter.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.840
Point of order.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.840
Next, Mr. Chair, Council Member, please step further.

23:57.840 --> 24:02.840
I can understand how this would never have come to the secretary's personal attention.

24:02.840 --> 24:11.840
I want to make it clear that in much of the mishandling, I don't blame the secretary personally because he's only there short time.

24:11.840 --> 24:18.840
But someone was there like when he was repeated warnings, we have to be eye-regnored.

24:18.840 --> 24:23.840
And again, I say Mr. Secretary, I don't have anyone realized what have I do.

24:23.840 --> 24:29.840
I've been busy with that and now you couldn't grab everything overnight and take hold of them.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.840
I entirely agree with the secretary.

24:31.840 --> 24:41.840
It does not necessarily have to come to the personal attention of the six days of the Army, but to those underies come and now Senator Jackson, what do you think?

24:41.840 --> 24:42.840
I just asked this question about a jacket.

24:42.840 --> 24:43.840
I'm a little confused here.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.840
This is the copy of a letter that's being introduced.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.840
I'd like to know how it arrived here at the committee.

24:50.840 --> 24:51.840
Where it came from.

24:51.840 --> 24:52.840
How did it get here?

24:52.840 --> 24:57.840
This is a letter from Mr. J. F. Hoover to General Bowling back in 1951.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
How did it get in there after a minute?

24:59.840 --> 25:10.840
It was handed to me just now Senator Jackson by Senator McCarthy, who is making it the basis of a cross examination of the Secretary of the Army.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.840
The purpose of his examination is basically being this.

25:14.840 --> 25:17.840
When they had ought to be on the medication point, I think you're on the line.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.840
I'm getting ready to get ready.

25:19.840 --> 25:20.840
I'm getting ready.

25:20.840 --> 25:21.840
I'm getting ready.

25:21.840 --> 25:43.840
I hold a mile on the basis of the copy of this letter and all the assumption that no party and interest note council would refer to a serious manufactured document that Senator McCarthy's called examination of the Secretary with reference to this letter is wholly competent.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.840
Mr. Jackson, this is a very simple matter.

25:46.840 --> 25:51.840
This committee got this from the Army, was it from the FBI?

25:51.840 --> 25:53.840
It was just a very simple question.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.840
How did it come into our possession?

25:56.840 --> 26:00.840
Do you mean that which committee's the McCarthy committee is investigating?

26:00.840 --> 26:06.840
Well, it was handed to me just now by Senator McCarthy, that's all I know of.

26:06.840 --> 26:12.840
It is a proper, very far-hate cross examination that's very evidence for reaching the list.

26:12.840 --> 26:20.840
I just stand by the committee, readily identified whether this was the matter that was subpoenaed from the Army files or whether the Army fallen fairly deep.

26:20.840 --> 26:28.840
I can have Senator McCarthy with under-oats and examining with respect to that particular boy keeping the senator signing soon.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.840
This is a copy of Mr. Cameron.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.840
I have a question.

26:32.840 --> 26:36.840
I respectfully suggest that that be done.

26:36.840 --> 26:44.840
I am a lawyer and the appearance of what purports to be a copy of the letter from Jay Ester Hoover.

26:44.840 --> 26:48.840
In 1951, addressed to some Colonel, is that right, sir?

26:48.840 --> 26:59.840
Major General, Major General, the mere fact that we have an impressive looking purported copy of such a letter doesn't impress an old-time lawyer.

26:59.840 --> 27:07.840
Law your eyes advised to have Mr. Jay Ester Hoover say as an evoke the letter and feel that we know what we were dealing with.

27:07.840 --> 27:16.840
Senator Chairman, and in McCarthy, we originally went to a question, the secretary's brother and out the original of this, another letter is like it or any file.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.840
I will make it very clear that I have come from this.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.840
Neither this letter nor anything else from the FBI.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.840
Where did it come from, then?

27:24.840 --> 27:26.840
We'll be on the move.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.840
We may ask the witness if he carries the mother's secretary.

27:29.840 --> 27:30.840
None of his there.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.840
I will press the committee to file.

27:32.840 --> 27:35.840
If it has all other investigations, the chair holds.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.840
None of them have been disclosed the sources of the information.

27:38.840 --> 27:46.840
Right, Mr. Chairman, I assure you that this purported copy did not come from the Army files or the senator for a moment's contest.

27:46.840 --> 27:47.840
Just a minute.

27:47.840 --> 27:53.840
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Rolf, we've got to say there's not a copy of this in the Army files.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.840
We should be sworn because that statement is untrue as far as I know.

27:57.840 --> 28:06.840
I did not say that, Senator I said that this purported copy did not come from the Army files and you know I'm quite right, sir.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.840
And I have a strong experience to know how to do this, you got hold of it.

28:10.840 --> 28:11.840
No way to do it.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.840
I have a slight worry.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.840
We're not having Mr. Rolf.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
The chair has a floor.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
We're not having Mr. Rolf.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
The chair has a floor.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.840
The chair has a floor.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.840
I have to advise you again, Mr. Wills.

28:24.840 --> 28:31.840
All investigative agencies in this town operate on the rule that they don't have to disclose the sources of the information.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.840
You're observing curiosity.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.840
We'll have to be satisfied some of the way I'm afraid.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.840
And five minutes to each day, I'd go over.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.840
Can I try it?

28:40.840 --> 28:42.840
I just like to press the button.

28:42.840 --> 28:45.840
Mr. Stevens, we look at that letter.

28:45.840 --> 28:51.840
Until it's number one, whether or not you've ever seen it, ever remember your notify of this town.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.840
I'd like to, if I'm...

28:54.840 --> 28:56.840
I think you should read the letter.

28:56.840 --> 29:05.840
I'd like to have the advice of counseled by May as to whether or not I'm at liberty to discuss the letter to Mr. J. Edgar Boober.

29:05.840 --> 29:06.840
Your liberty to read.

29:06.840 --> 29:12.840
I have a way of reservation about discussing a fall.

29:12.840 --> 29:18.840
Any letter written by Mr. J. Edgar Boober, unless I have his specific approval.

29:18.840 --> 29:23.840
I will therefore ask the chairman to give me the opportunity of securing the approval.

29:23.840 --> 29:35.840
Mr. J. Edgar Boober, before I discuss any letter, reporting to have been written by him, because I think it's a very mass policy to discuss these things without Mr. Boober's known about it.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.840
Would you like to read this first?

29:37.840 --> 29:39.840
May I ask Mr. Chairman?

29:39.840 --> 29:41.840
I have the little thing I have to ask.

29:41.840 --> 29:49.840
When it's first to go down, confident will be over as long as he seems to be, he'd rather severe or worse, of confidential nature.

29:49.840 --> 29:56.840
I think Mr. Stevens is quite right in saying that this is a matter that ought to be released by J. Edgar Boober.

29:56.840 --> 30:04.840
Before we deal with this in this room, chairman agrees that if the letter is marked Christian and the convenation of the convenation of the letter,

30:04.840 --> 30:07.840
it ought to be revealed without the consent of the senator.

30:07.840 --> 30:13.840
May I ask Mr. Edgar whether or not he deserves to go over the meaning of his sentence?

30:14.840 --> 30:41.840
Mr. Chairman, I repeat that the condense of the letter for a make proper basis for a cross examination of the secretary of the army,

30:41.840 --> 30:51.840
I am not inquiring whether or not I am directed or requested to subpoena as a witness Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.

30:51.840 --> 31:00.840
I shall do so if the committee in its discretion directs it.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.840
Chairman, I want to board a report of Mr. Chairman.

31:04.840 --> 31:14.840
Mr. Chairman, there is nobody in this town to inform respect and admiration that I have from Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.840
This letter is not signed.

31:17.840 --> 31:24.840
I would hope that we did not have to ask Mr. J. Edgar Hoover to come down here and be sworn in as a witness.

31:24.840 --> 31:33.840
It seems to me that all that would have to be done to verify whether or not the letter, which is marked personal and confidential so I am informed via the list.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.840
So I would assume the meeting was delivered by him.

31:36.840 --> 31:42.840
Mr. Simpett asks Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, the council can do that or anybody else can do that.

31:42.840 --> 31:48.840
It is news that the chairman, as to whether or not he believes that in the interest of the security of the United States,

31:48.840 --> 31:51.840
the letter placed in anticipation of this hearing.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.840
Mr. Hoover, take that to right.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.840
Mr. Simpett asks the necessary and I have the high-out of his trust and the witness.

31:56.840 --> 32:01.840
And his word is incorrect whether he had ever written such a letter or not.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.840
I have the same agreement with the letter.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.840
I have the same agreement with the letter.

32:06.840 --> 32:07.840
Hello, it's Mother and I.
