WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.300
I would prefer not to even read the letter.

00:02.300 --> 00:06.960
And so I have Mr. Hoover's personal permission to do so.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.920
Oh, let's ridiculous to sure.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.920
He can make me secretary that you read the letter a lot.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.360
Can you please be immediate to see whether he

00:14.360 --> 00:16.800
can read his speech in your mind?

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
He's a high-class.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.760
He's like the personal confidential letter

00:19.760 --> 00:22.040
from Mr. Jay of the Hoover.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.680
It's something that I would like to talk to Mr. Hoover

00:24.680 --> 00:27.280
about before I am forced to read it.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.040
Others, Mr. Hoover gives me the permission.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.920
I'll be glad to read the letter.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.280
I'll be glad to testify a bully with respect to it,

00:36.280 --> 00:37.480
to the limit of my ability.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.880
But I do not think I ought to be asked to read, even read.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.640
This is a moment, a letter, personal and confidential,

00:45.640 --> 00:46.760
written by Jay of the Hoover.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.680
That just doesn't seem like the right thing to do.

00:48.680 --> 00:49.600
I make the term.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.520
Mr. David Vistachar, Mr. Chairman.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.720
If the copy of that letter is authentic,

00:55.720 --> 00:58.560
and I certainly have no basis upon which

00:58.560 --> 01:00.840
the doubt or question is this time,

01:00.840 --> 01:05.120
then the original is in the file of the secretary of the Army.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.520
It would not be in his file.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.080
Had it not been intended to the E, our son's support

01:11.080 --> 01:13.320
and someone under his command,

01:13.320 --> 01:16.760
read it and be familiarize himself with it.

01:16.760 --> 01:17.760
I want to order.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.200
In the file of the Army.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.680
Well, in the file, but you see, at the letter, a dress,

01:21.680 --> 01:23.320
we're just wasting a lot of time here.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.360
I think it'd be something.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.440
Good morning, everybody.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.600
I just want to get a letter.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.200
If I understand correctly, a dress to who?

01:29.200 --> 01:30.320
To General Bowling.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.280
Who was General Bowling?

01:31.280 --> 01:33.800
I assume he was G2 at that time.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.600
Now, I don't know how it automatically

01:36.600 --> 01:39.600
followed, all of it would be in the file

01:39.600 --> 01:40.800
to the secretary of the Army.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.920
I assume it's in G2.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.320
You did say it, I said.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.960
I assume it's in G2 in the file.

01:46.960 --> 01:47.760
That's what it is.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.400
All I want to say is, yes, that matter

01:49.400 --> 01:51.800
be gone over in the meeting.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.560
Come back with a full report in the morning.

01:53.560 --> 01:54.960
We can get on with something now.

01:54.960 --> 01:55.960
Let me ask you.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.160
The secretary of the department of the department

01:58.160 --> 02:00.960
is a secretary of the department of the department

02:00.960 --> 02:02.320
of the G2 file.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.080
We'll see whether or not it has a drop to that letter.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.760
Does that have to do with that?

02:06.760 --> 02:07.800
I'll make a point of order.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.400
I'll just start getting a similar evidence

02:09.400 --> 02:10.760
of the secretary of the department of the department.

02:10.760 --> 02:14.160
I think that you're at half the G2 people check it

02:14.160 --> 02:17.000
and find out whether the original outbreak

02:17.000 --> 02:20.360
of the manner that we have before today

02:20.360 --> 02:21.360
is in their file.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.280
That's point number one.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.440
Point number two.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.440
Check and find out whether that letter was called

02:27.440 --> 02:30.480
to the personal attention of the secretary of the department.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.280
Now, these have no knowledge of it.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.960
I assume all the questions relating

02:33.960 --> 02:35.880
to the secretary of the department.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.080
That's this time or not, the secretary of the department.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.680
It might be correct.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.080
As the committee will move to the next.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.480
I have a German order, please.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.080
That's what I mean.

02:43.080 --> 02:43.680
It has to be fine.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.680
It works.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.000
Mr. Chairman, when I left the National Security

02:47.000 --> 02:50.720
Resource Board, there was a coordinated group

02:50.720 --> 02:53.120
of people which at that time as I remember it,

02:53.120 --> 02:56.480
Mr. Jay Eckahoeber was the chairman.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.960
The secretary of the army, since the summer of 1949,

02:59.960 --> 03:03.840
does not sit on the National Security Council.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.560
Therefore, he has no connection with the Central Intelligence

03:07.560 --> 03:10.680
Agency, or with the advisory submission

03:10.680 --> 03:14.920
on intelligence, at the Central Intelligence Agency,

03:14.920 --> 03:17.800
which reports that the National Security Council is

03:17.800 --> 03:19.800
identified with.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.960
Now, this letter is more personal and confidential,

03:22.960 --> 03:24.800
and it is not signed.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.200
It is very possible that it is the letter.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.840
I do not know because I have not read it.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.720
But based on the structure of the executive department

03:32.720 --> 03:35.920
of the government, it is entirely possible that this letter

03:35.920 --> 03:38.840
was addressed to General Bowling, and is not a letter

03:38.840 --> 03:41.800
which is supposed to be shown to the secretary of the army.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.600
Mr. Chairman.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.200
Mr. Chairman, wait.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.280
I'll just say it's possible.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.560
Mr. Chairman.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
I have not read it.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.160
I have heard many ridiculous things.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.560
So I'll just say we'll talk about it.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.720
But you say that something dealing with the communist

03:57.720 --> 04:01.240
activities, and none of the secretary's demands,

04:01.240 --> 04:04.240
should not be seen by me, and it is the most ridiculous

04:04.240 --> 04:06.000
I have ever heard of.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
And I'll ask the letter.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.240
Here, Mr. Chairman, all I ask is for the secretary to look

04:10.240 --> 04:14.160
at it, so that he can search the file and tell us

04:14.160 --> 04:17.600
whether or not the original of that letter is in the file.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.280
I've heard many suggestions, and although these heard,

04:21.280 --> 04:24.600
it's persuaded most by one made by Senator Jackson.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.360
I'm thinking to make a considerable degree of check

04:26.360 --> 04:29.400
to the chairman, and that the secretary

04:29.400 --> 04:31.800
take enough of a look at the letter

04:31.800 --> 04:34.600
so that he will recognize it when he sees it in the file,

04:34.600 --> 04:36.240
but then every check made of the file

04:36.240 --> 04:38.000
is due to the see what ever it is.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.240
And one back in the morning,

04:39.240 --> 04:40.800
if you have a secretary, it will.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.240
I'm all on, even though it's a tight.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.240
I'm all around, even a tight.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.040
And there's a room over the address.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.800
Mr. Chairman, we've got General Bowling

04:46.800 --> 04:47.960
to proceed on that basis.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.200
We can start expediting a little bit of Mr. Chairman.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.480
Sometimes I do not know the contents of the letter.

04:55.480 --> 05:00.760
I do know that the letter risks to the intelligence.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.760
A part of the confidential by Mr. James Hulver.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.360
And I agree with my colleague, who

05:07.360 --> 05:10.480
says that before the letter is made public property,

05:10.480 --> 05:13.760
I suggest the letter that the approval of the letter

05:13.760 --> 05:15.840
should be requested as far as publication

05:15.840 --> 05:18.360
goes from Mr. J. Hulver.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.400
Chair, does not understand there's any different position

05:20.400 --> 05:22.560
than the file of anyone to make the contents of the letter

05:22.560 --> 05:23.760
public.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.400
Is that correct?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.200
That's correct.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.680
I don't see why we're wasting all this time on a letter

05:29.680 --> 05:30.920
that we don't understand the public.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.480
You're putting the evidence.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.800
Chairman, I wish there's a chairman,

05:34.800 --> 05:37.800
Mr. Chairman, who was this one.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.880
It was presented, allegedly, by General Hulver,

05:40.880 --> 05:44.400
to G2, have represented to the Secretary.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.240
And I believe the Secretary can find that out

05:46.240 --> 05:48.720
and say, you have to know, without disclosing

05:48.720 --> 05:49.960
the contents of the letter.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.200
So he has a chance to make a check to the front.

05:52.200 --> 05:57.320
Mr. Chairman, I wonder if that is how the Secretary just

05:57.320 --> 06:00.320
take a little peek at the letter, so he was recognized.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.040
If you don't want to read it, Mr. Secretary,

06:02.040 --> 06:03.600
I have your advice that you might.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.480
Mr. Chairman, I understand that the Secretary has already

06:06.480 --> 06:07.840
said that he can as ever further

06:07.840 --> 06:10.240
let him be providing the name of the address

06:10.240 --> 06:11.800
and the date on the bed.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.800
And the date so you'll be able to report in the morning.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.800
I think that's why the decision

06:15.800 --> 06:17.640
continues as a discussion of the letter at this time.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.640
And we have to be on that basis in Southern Rick.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.280
MacArthur, Michigan, Virginia, question on some other questions.

06:22.280 --> 06:26.160
We ask the letter, remaining with Mr. Jenkins,

06:26.160 --> 06:27.680
to be only happy I got.

06:27.680 --> 06:31.480
I am full of difficulty of the account.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.160
Mr. Chairman, I desire to pursue this question

06:34.160 --> 06:37.080
a little further without revealing one single thing

06:37.080 --> 06:38.760
of a confidential nature.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.840
I think the committee is entitled to it.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.520
Now, Mr. Secretary, I'm certainly not asking you to reveal

06:46.520 --> 06:48.440
any of the contents of this letter.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.400
I have read it.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.480
And there will be no revelation of the contents of it

06:55.480 --> 06:58.520
as far as I'm concerned.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.640
If it is a letter from J. Edgar Hoover,

07:01.640 --> 07:04.880
address to make your general a bully.

07:04.880 --> 07:10.760
And if it has to do with security risks in the army,

07:10.760 --> 07:14.560
whether or not the original of this letter,

07:14.560 --> 07:18.240
they'd be January 26, 1951, properly

07:18.240 --> 07:24.080
be in the fows of the Pentagon in the intelligence department.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.320
I would think that's why the idea is that,

07:27.320 --> 07:34.000
since you became Secretary of the Army, as I understand it,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.440
you now have no personal knowledge of this letter

07:38.440 --> 07:39.600
without having read it.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.760
You have no recollection of seeing a letter from Mr. Hoover

07:42.760 --> 07:45.640
dated January 26, 1951.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.200
Is that correct?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.480
Sure, please have your read.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.400
Just a couple questions.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.560
I don't know where to ask you.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.880
Well, I haven't read a lot of the very well out.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.720
I'll pass you down a really quick many letters.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.080
And today I will read.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.480
And if you know the technical, the no-one,

07:58.480 --> 07:59.920
he's read one without a notice.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.600
So today, we understand that you personally

08:02.600 --> 08:05.200
cannot see all our respondents.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.160
But would this letter be there in the Pentagon

08:08.160 --> 08:12.520
in the intelligence department of these levels

08:12.520 --> 08:16.280
to the intelligence department that is now operating under you,

08:16.280 --> 08:18.200
and which has been operating under use

08:18.200 --> 08:20.600
in February of 4, 1953?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.440
I would assume so.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.160
You would assume so, Judge.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.360
It would not, Mr. Secretary, be your duty,

08:27.360 --> 08:30.240
and I'm making a statement of facts.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.120
To take this letter and to personally do

08:33.120 --> 08:36.000
care how any instructions contain any details

08:36.000 --> 08:37.680
any there are.

08:37.680 --> 08:42.480
But would or not, it be the duty of your intelligence department

08:42.480 --> 08:46.200
operating under you for the past year or more,

08:46.200 --> 08:49.200
to take cognizance of this letter,

08:49.200 --> 08:52.320
and to do whatever is indicated by the letter

08:52.320 --> 08:54.640
is that correct or not?

08:54.640 --> 08:58.240
Yes, I say that correct, although I feel much better able

08:58.240 --> 09:00.840
to answer your question, that I have read, which I will

09:00.840 --> 09:02.960
prefer not to do as indicated.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.120
But, Mr. Secretary, aren't the letters

09:06.120 --> 09:09.360
in the intelligence department all the facts,

09:09.360 --> 09:13.160
say the documents, information available

09:13.160 --> 09:16.120
to you as Secretary of the Army?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.120
Are they available?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.960
Yes, sure.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.880
I do you are not convinced your duty, your privilege,

09:22.880 --> 09:26.000
not not your duty, but your privilege,

09:26.000 --> 09:30.320
to personally acquaint yourself with any facts contained

09:30.320 --> 09:32.920
in any documents in the intelligence department.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.200
It would be utterly unmovable.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.200
I just made that clear.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.720
If you're utterly unmovable, not your duty,

09:38.720 --> 09:40.680
like two and a half years old as a letter,

09:40.680 --> 09:43.040
and there are probably several million documents there,

09:43.040 --> 09:45.160
and I wouldn't have a part of the order

09:45.160 --> 09:46.160
you're known about them all.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.240
Would there be anything improper in you

09:49.240 --> 09:52.440
as a Secretary going to the intelligence department

09:52.440 --> 09:54.560
and examining not only this document,

09:54.560 --> 09:58.840
but any other documents that's found there?

09:58.840 --> 10:00.600
Well, I think in general, as correct,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.560
you sure I can consider the document

10:02.560 --> 10:04.840
running in there, but that might be personally

10:04.840 --> 10:06.640
a dose for somebody that would not be

10:06.640 --> 10:08.680
possible for me to look at.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.400
Frankly, I think Mr. Secretary and gentlemen

10:11.400 --> 10:13.640
in the committee that there's nothing

10:13.640 --> 10:18.320
wrong in the Secretary reading the letter in its entirety.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.360
Is the Secretary of the Army any part of it

10:21.360 --> 10:25.240
that he sees fit for the purpose of determining tonight,

10:25.240 --> 10:27.840
whether or not the original of it Mr. Welles

10:27.840 --> 10:30.600
and Mr. Secretary, is in the fows

10:30.600 --> 10:33.720
of the intelligence department of the Army,

10:33.720 --> 10:36.840
and for that purpose only, am I correct or not?

10:36.840 --> 10:38.200
Now, that's just happened.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.800
I am a rather simple lawyer.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.160
But when I see something, you're not under oath

10:44.160 --> 10:47.040
and it's all because of the name of J. S. Groover,

10:47.040 --> 10:49.480
and Edited the top personal and confidential

10:49.480 --> 10:53.480
and apparently sent by hand, I am so easily impressed,

10:53.480 --> 10:55.280
sir, that when I read those words,

10:55.280 --> 10:58.040
I dropped the letter believing it was improper for me,

10:58.040 --> 11:00.280
and I believe it was improper for the senator

11:00.280 --> 11:03.600
to have it in his possession or make it his business courtless.

11:03.600 --> 11:07.600
And I understand it if they gracious the law

11:07.600 --> 11:10.680
to disclose any of these confidential matters involving

11:10.680 --> 11:14.600
the M. P. I. Now, we'll find that letter, Mr. Jenkins,

11:14.600 --> 11:19.080
if we have to keep 14 curbs up for 14 nights,

11:19.080 --> 11:20.720
and we'll get it if it's there.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.600
After we've got it, then you'll still have

11:22.600 --> 11:24.240
to question what you're going to do with it.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.680
Mr. Welles, may I have a question

11:25.680 --> 11:28.360
based on the secretary's statement

11:28.360 --> 11:32.600
that he saw nothing improper about his examining any record,

11:32.600 --> 11:35.560
this or any other record in the intelligence department

11:35.560 --> 11:36.240
of the Army?

11:36.240 --> 11:39.000
I think that's right, but that's first fine difference there,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.440
and that he will do tonight as I say,

11:41.440 --> 11:43.800
if it takes all of us all night to find it.

11:43.800 --> 11:48.920
And I think that's the case, the suggestion.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.240
From the senator, the senator said,

11:52.240 --> 11:54.320
I'm so tired of the letter I was about to say

11:54.320 --> 11:57.680
that the senator from the West Coast.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.000
I think you're taking the third correct,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.760
and I would like now to move on because I cannot erase

12:03.760 --> 12:07.400
from my mind just that so impropriate

12:07.400 --> 12:11.440
even dealing with this letter any further on what I have seen.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.240
Then it's not necessary for the secretary

12:13.240 --> 12:15.000
to see it further for the frame about it.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.440
I think not, we've all eaten it.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.520
January 26, 1950, and we've seen that it's

12:19.520 --> 12:22.000
single space that we have a pretty good idea

12:22.000 --> 12:23.080
when it looks like it.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.120
And we'll talk to you in a second question,

12:25.120 --> 12:27.160
which is the letters to see.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.720
You quite confident that if you see the letter

12:29.720 --> 12:31.440
in question with the secretary,

12:31.440 --> 12:32.760
in the fire, you are lucky guys

12:32.760 --> 12:35.600
that this is to be the same as this kind of.

12:35.600 --> 12:40.000
I will certainly not identify any letters from Mr. Hoover

12:40.000 --> 12:42.680
on that day, so any more bring them up too.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.640
Very good.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.160
Then I'm going to ask you if we see that

12:45.160 --> 12:46.160
and some other questions.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.400
Just as I said, you're going to look

12:47.400 --> 12:50.120
to share on your one other statement.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.200
The plan is a condense of this letter

12:52.200 --> 12:56.680
that are so invalid, so important, so sacred,

12:56.680 --> 12:59.920
and carry with them so many implications,

12:59.920 --> 13:03.800
even of the values of all, that I respectfully decline

13:03.800 --> 13:05.760
Senator McCartney's request to that,

13:05.760 --> 13:08.640
personally, be the best-thode unit of his letter.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.760
And now, in the presence of everybody,

13:10.760 --> 13:13.240
I respectfully defend the McCartney.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.760
Here we go.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.760
Here we go.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.520
Now I want to be called a academic artist,

13:21.520 --> 13:24.120
and I may receive inspections or do not deal with the letter.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.920
Mr. Secretary, let's forget about this letter

13:32.920 --> 13:34.680
for the planning, but let me ask you this,

13:34.680 --> 13:41.520
but have you ever been told that there are series of letters

13:41.520 --> 13:45.320
in the files of due to from the FBI pointing

13:45.320 --> 13:49.920
up the dangerous security risk for being kept in,

13:49.920 --> 13:52.160
and the radar laboratory, the Fort Monmouth,

13:52.160 --> 13:54.800
but those letters referred to individuals

13:54.800 --> 13:57.240
who were, when I hit the mood, your head at one time.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.920
Individuals who were in contact with members

14:00.920 --> 14:05.800
of espionage rings, some referring to Coleman,

14:05.800 --> 14:09.680
specifically, a mid-printer, 21 letter, but a series of letters,

14:09.680 --> 14:12.160
are learning the department of the Army

14:12.160 --> 14:16.000
to the dangerous situation exist in that Fort Monmouth.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.760
Others going back over a period of, I don't know, how many years.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.320
I've been through too long, while I'm fine, repressed.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.720
It has too long, you've got it.

14:23.720 --> 14:24.560
Pretty long.

14:24.560 --> 14:29.000
Let me ask you this, Mr. Secretary.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.640
Has it been brought to your attention?

14:32.640 --> 14:40.040
There are a series of warnings from the FBI

14:40.040 --> 14:43.000
in regard to the situation at Fort Monmouth.

14:43.000 --> 14:50.200
And those warnings were disregarded

14:50.200 --> 14:53.440
until the committee started its hearings.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.680
It's investigation.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.080
No, sir, that last part is not right.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.600
And we, if the Army, have been in contact with the FBI

15:00.600 --> 15:04.480
in respect to Fort Monmouth over a long period of time.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.000
Right now, you would like to give you a chapter in verse

15:08.000 --> 15:10.600
on that, but there again, I feel that I should have Mr. Hoover's

15:10.600 --> 15:11.440
permission to do so.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.920
Well, if you would have financed your might,

15:12.920 --> 15:15.200
you say you've been in contact with the FBI.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.440
I have to do the simple questions.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.040
And do you have the fact there are no suspensions

15:19.040 --> 15:21.120
in the We Started Your Investigation?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.760
Were you warning to genuinely encounter

15:23.760 --> 15:28.800
a union pedophile in regards to many of the people

15:28.800 --> 15:32.200
who were suspended after We Started Your Investigation,

15:32.200 --> 15:37.760
including Warren Cole, like Eric Thomas?

15:37.760 --> 15:40.160
There were suspensions before you started

15:40.160 --> 15:43.960
on my car, but as far as I know, I'm the latest.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.160
Well, please, you got the best part of the president,

15:46.160 --> 15:46.860
Eddie.

15:46.860 --> 15:48.520
Chair against the suggestion of this article

15:48.520 --> 15:50.080
to ask well-offession with him time,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.240
and that it should be in the same frame.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.680
It'll be easier for the secretary,

15:53.680 --> 15:55.000
easier for the committee.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.400
It will help to express that together.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.560
Will you reread the question, please?

15:58.560 --> 15:59.840
Well, it's a good term.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.320
But probably, you can read it.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.320
Come.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.720
I have a very different, very different.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.200
Very difficult for the committee or the secretary

16:09.200 --> 16:10.640
to get it to you.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.000
Point to you in the same question.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.160
I think the chairman is good to point

16:14.160 --> 16:16.680
and make the president me up in two months, for the secretary.

16:19.920 --> 16:30.640
Mr. Secretary, are you aware of the fact that the FBI turned

16:30.640 --> 16:36.320
a serious up warning to your party in regard

16:36.320 --> 16:40.440
to the security situation at fourth month?

16:40.440 --> 16:42.160
Yes, sir.

16:42.160 --> 16:47.320
And they named a factual number of individuals

16:47.320 --> 16:54.080
in the warning as dangerous to the security of that threat.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.000
Yeah, but I'm not prepared to go into individual.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.920
I don't want you to.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.160
I don't want you to.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.000
But they did give you a list of names.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.760
They've named, they considered, as dangerous in the second

17:03.760 --> 17:05.800
work of that threat.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.800
That's what FBI communications usually did in the lab.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.680
Well, not individually listed.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.880
Oh, yes, sir.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.360
Yes, now, before our investigation started,

17:16.360 --> 17:18.520
Mr. Wells made the attention of the secretary.

17:18.520 --> 17:22.880
Before our investigation started, how many suspensions

17:22.880 --> 17:25.880
were there?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.400
I think there were six, as I recall, a senator.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.360
Well, now you said there were six prior to October 14,

17:31.360 --> 17:34.440
and that's right.

17:34.440 --> 17:38.400
Now, I think I said that there were six prior to the start

17:38.400 --> 17:41.080
of your official executive hearings,

17:41.080 --> 17:43.200
on I think with the eighth of October.

17:43.200 --> 17:47.440
No, I'm really, how many before the investigation

17:47.440 --> 17:48.360
was started?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.480
But the way before we started calling the witness

17:50.480 --> 17:53.240
of the question, how many suspensions?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.880
It gives you that very little data that you might not

17:55.880 --> 17:56.960
know when that started.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.840
You're giving the vote.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.240
Can you give us a date of the first suspension

18:01.240 --> 18:03.640
on the Eurovision?

18:03.640 --> 18:06.640
I think most of those were in September

18:06.640 --> 18:08.800
the six that I'm referring to.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.840
The first hearing of the single-core, not

18:11.840 --> 18:15.520
for the month specifically, but the single-core,

18:15.520 --> 18:17.920
the first executive session was August 31.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.960
You understand my answer?

18:19.960 --> 18:24.040
Now, do you know when we started to interview witnesses

18:24.040 --> 18:27.160
from the physical area of for the month?

18:27.160 --> 18:28.160
No, I don't.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.360
You know, I'm a fan of the man that inspired.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.640
You know, you're a terrible child.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.640
Do you want to have another attempt to go down?

18:42.640 --> 18:43.640
Do you want to be sentenced?

18:43.640 --> 18:45.640
We've been here.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.640
We've been here to be sentenced.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.640
One of us wishes the committee.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.640
We've been here long because then the question

18:51.640 --> 18:53.640
may be true, other than the harem, because the charges

18:53.640 --> 18:55.640
too, there's some objection I think

18:55.640 --> 18:57.640
to chair would like to suggest if we

18:57.640 --> 18:59.640
be sentenced until 10th of November.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.640
Do you want to call you please?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.640
I'm in a seminary.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.640
I'm in a seminary.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.680
I want to be sentenced to a carcass

19:05.680 --> 19:07.680
where he commented, uh,

19:07.680 --> 19:11.680
are you inserting that FBI letter in the record?

19:11.680 --> 19:13.680
No.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.640
Uh, the message on the dirt

19:15.640 --> 19:18.640
and that'll be entirely up to the chair.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.640
I think first, we should have a Spanish woman

19:20.640 --> 19:22.680
at a facility for the sentry final

19:22.680 --> 19:25.640
of the Department of the Army.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.640
Well, I think the committee then

19:27.640 --> 19:30.640
on to authorize counsel, uh,

19:30.640 --> 19:34.640
to accept these statements in the form of a deposition

19:34.640 --> 19:37.640
without having its foreign from J. Edgar Hoover.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.640
First is to whether the letter was written,

19:39.640 --> 19:43.640
secondly, as to who it was written, third the day.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.640
Generally, do I identify and then, of course,

19:46.640 --> 19:49.640
I think it would be incumbent on J. Edgar Hoover to say,

19:49.640 --> 19:51.640
whether or not he knew of the first one

19:51.640 --> 19:53.640
in confidential nature, but that it,

19:53.640 --> 19:55.640
whether there is any interdiction on it,

19:55.640 --> 19:56.640
or any interdiction on it,

19:56.640 --> 19:57.640
as being a statement.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.640
All right.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.640
The one effect is done before we meet you more and more.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.640
Come and listen to that, thirdly,

20:02.640 --> 20:04.640
using the law of Secretary's message

20:04.640 --> 20:05.640
together with the letters in the box.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.640
How much generally do you like to have a team,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.640
uh, any suggestion about the right sessions

20:10.640 --> 20:13.640
and Saturday sessions in the interest of exposition?

20:13.640 --> 20:15.640
Uh, I'm just curious how to do it.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.640
I have a comment.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.640
The chair is presently in the evening night

20:18.640 --> 20:20.640
and the service is presently concerned

20:20.640 --> 20:23.640
that that will help expedite the area.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.640
As you will, he is the creature of the, uh,

20:26.640 --> 20:29.640
desires of his committee, which he hopes to continue

20:29.640 --> 20:31.640
to be conveyed to him,

20:31.640 --> 20:33.640
as he never missed a challenge or else.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.640
I think that's applied on, which he spoke to Mr. Jacobs,

20:36.640 --> 20:39.640
as well as the five years old of the Mr. Jacobs

20:39.640 --> 20:40.640
would like to be heard.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.640
It's pretty hard going to prepare your facts

20:43.640 --> 20:45.640
as my triumphant day of the day,

20:45.640 --> 20:47.640
and then have an evening session on it.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.640
Sandra Culler was not seen without a sound

20:49.640 --> 20:51.640
in the interest of the fourth trial lawyer,

20:51.640 --> 20:53.640
but certainly has kept all hope tired.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.640
They did not try to tear it apart.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.640
You must have asked whether the interest of exposition

20:58.640 --> 21:01.640
is necessary to spend more hours in the hearings

21:01.640 --> 21:03.640
for the youth to further,

21:03.640 --> 21:05.640
whether Mr. C. will do for a purpose.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.640
He has also been subjected to a lot of the teeth,

21:08.640 --> 21:12.640
whether you would rather have hearing anxiety or in the evening.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.640
He already knows that as the article,

21:14.640 --> 21:16.640
he will be responded because the chair goes by

21:16.640 --> 21:19.640
and probably haven't gotten back to my home.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.640
My all new is that if you put in the number of hours

21:22.640 --> 21:25.640
with one again, you will do it all as much

21:25.640 --> 21:28.640
as if you've grabbed your minds when you're tired

21:28.640 --> 21:30.640
trying to prove something.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.640
You're getting to wangle.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.640
My observation about my session is that my time for a short

21:35.640 --> 21:37.640
and that of other people,

21:37.640 --> 21:41.640
I am just a call to the sessions to my sessions

21:41.640 --> 21:43.640
and equally important to tired sessions.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.640
But I have said before, my session is over.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.640
If I have to do it, I will give just my suspenders

21:50.640 --> 21:54.640
one more not as I'll do it, but I hope I don't have to.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.640
We stand to recess and you'll tend to even

21:57.640 --> 22:00.640
to chair the leaves we may have to have those night sessions

22:00.640 --> 22:01.640
and very busy.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.640
If we don't move more rapidly, we know us.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.640
And so we come to the end of the night.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.640
They have testimony in these hearings

22:11.640 --> 22:14.640
for the end, no wear and sight.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.640
In fact, we do not know whether Secretary

22:16.640 --> 22:20.640
of the Army Robert T. Stevens is nearing the end

22:20.640 --> 22:23.640
of his long-ardial and what this chair and not.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.640
Before the start of today's session,

22:25.640 --> 22:29.640
Senator McCarthy said that he had at least three days

22:29.640 --> 22:33.640
of questioning of the Army Secretary

22:33.640 --> 22:35.640
under a cross examination, which would indicate

22:35.640 --> 22:39.640
that he may have two days more on the stand.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.640
That is Secretary of the Army, Steven.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.640
And of course, if this is great,

22:43.640 --> 22:46.640
the hearings could drag on for weeks.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.640
Most of this morning's session was taken up

22:49.640 --> 22:54.640
with discussion of possible ways and means

22:54.640 --> 22:58.640
of expediting the pace of these hearings,

22:58.640 --> 22:59.640
fitting them up.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.640
And at one point, Senator McCarthy agreed to take

23:02.640 --> 23:05.640
the witness chair immediately after Secretary Stevens,

23:05.640 --> 23:09.640
if the Army on its side would agree to call no other witnesses.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.640
There was considerable discussion on this,

23:11.640 --> 23:14.640
and it appeared that there was rather little basis

23:14.640 --> 23:16.640
for any kind of an agreement.

23:16.640 --> 23:20.640
Finally, the Democratic minority members of the committee,

23:20.640 --> 23:24.640
the three of them, objected to the Republican proposal

23:24.640 --> 23:27.640
to what they called off-tailed the inquiry

23:27.640 --> 23:30.640
and those these speed-up efforts co-op.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.640
The mutual network has been bringing you

23:35.640 --> 23:38.640
this armed assault coverage direct from the caucus room

23:38.640 --> 23:41.640
of the Senate Office Building in Washington

23:41.640 --> 23:44.640
before the Senate's top committee on investigation.
