00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Although taken in a public session, it amounts to a change in rules.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
And we heard objections here to changing rules in the middle of the game.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
And I think the motion should be made in public and when it is made in the government.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
I reserve the rights to offer a substitute motion.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
The chairman of the motion was made in public and the senator from Illinois and his president's public.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
And he is anxious to have a vote in public motion.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
That's all I want.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
We would have been prepared to have a vote.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
I understand now that the rest of the state is a motion presently withdrawn.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
There was no action as a motion that the chairman has.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
I know there was.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
But I am trying to get those records so we will keep the rest of the state safe and share the data.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
He is a member of the motion so it is no longer before.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
The motion is not in withdrawn however.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
The chairman has no decision to respect the re-indulcant.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, there is a difference between the chairman and the motion in public area and the motion in private area.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
It is either before it is in public or it is.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
That is what I want to settle for the record.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
The chairman has no idea in his opinion before it is long enough,

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
but out of seconds the second the second the record is not in the make.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Then there is no motion in the outfim.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
The chairman however the motion has not been withdrawn.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
That is correct.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
That is the part of the author of the motion can withdraw.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
A lot of what I want to do there and I just want to get the motion be read just a moment.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I want the moment to go.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I think that I have a vote in the moment.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Here is that now the motion is in the middle of this debate.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
I know that the chairman has a vote but he is so silent about it.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I want to reflect on my motion now.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
I am pending before this commend the motion loses as made for a lot of a second.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I would say that.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I would say that.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
If the author however says he has not withdrawn,

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I would like to get the record straight.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I think the chairman would like to have the chair.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
If he would wait longer for a second to have the motion.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I would say the chairman is not in the motion.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
That will take it off the record.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
There is no motion before it.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I can't say that.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
There is a lot of this.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
That is correct.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
That is correct.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Let's try to do it.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Just one follow me.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
There will be representatives from the committee and the public.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
That is the chairman's answer.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I understand that.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
The executive section of 130 is we are to discuss these proposed motions.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
But we will not vote on it in the executive section.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
We will not be finalized except by opening it up and discussing it again in public.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I just want to make it clear that nobody has the object in their head.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I will just do it in executive section.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
You have a right to it.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
We can vote in executive section.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
But if we have an understanding right after in public, we now have.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
Any decision made in executive section is candidates and has to be finalized by a vote in public section.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
It says he is in charge of associating himself with that position.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I think that's the fair.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
That is not proper parliamentary procedure.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
The F.A. motion in executive section is voted.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Then that is final action of the committee.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
And you would have nothing before you in public section.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I have a microphone.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Has anybody here?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I have a chair.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Can you do this?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
The very motion should be made in executive section.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
No, sir.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I have no idea what you can do to prevent it.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm simply stating my position.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I thought I would write to do that.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I thought the panel needs that position.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I had gone a long way.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
But if there is any action, the executive section must be reiterated and we can wrap in public section.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, I was talking about a parliament.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
The situation might be vote for judgment.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Do it or you don't.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
That's correct.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
If you make such a motion and make a motion in executive section, then that's the big condition that the motion is reaching.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And it is the way to vote.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And that's action here will be final.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
If that's included in the motion, then that hasn't come before the committee.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
But I don't see how that has come before the public section.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
If it's already voted, then we're going to vote to take up the motion to reconsider it.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Mr. Chairman, I want to introduce the whole of life.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
You see me, we're wasting a lot of time discussing an arrangement,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
which we all seem to have accepted individual achievements.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
I have not accepted any seconditation.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
I have not accepted it, Mr. Chairman.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm processing it now.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm trying to make my position.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I want to offer a substitute motion.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I want to offer that substitute motion in public.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Let it be voted on in public.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
And if you take that final action in executive section, I'd have no opportunity to do that.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
That's the only position I would find.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
We have literally offered it to you.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Motion in which we've not seconded it has.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
We've got a meeting.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Actually, we can work out an executive section in a procedure.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Which will be catastrophic since we all seem to agree that whatever is done finally can be done in public section.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
May the chair make this additional statement.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
We'll meet in room 357 then.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
In executive section at one point.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Mr. Wilson will be invited to attend.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
From the McCarty will be invited to attend.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Mr. Brian will be invited to attend.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
The purpose of the meeting is to discuss again,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
whether a satisfaction formula can be found.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
The problem of trying to shorten each hearing without doing violence is justice and equity.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
The chair understands that Mr. Wilson is seeking for himself and his clients.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Opposes the formula as proposed, although not seconded, but underdirt.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
The chair has held that he thinks that it is very important for his to turn.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
That the hearing proceeds as expeditiously as possible.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
Without it anyway, denying parties to this dispute what they consider a fair and equitable hearing.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
So if they continue to be the position of Mr. Wilson, his client,

06:46.000 --> 06:59.000
he wants the chair to go on and on until we have succeeded in having the numerous witnesses that have to be called, called, which certainly continues to be so asked to decide along with that connection.

06:59.000 --> 07:09.000
But I do think it important enough to justify an executive section to see whether there is still an opportunity for a meeting of minds before we commit ourselves to a procedure

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
which seems certain to take another three or four weeks that the speed we are making in the number of witnesses that have been proposed.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
The council and somebody else must be heard on this general discussion already that I will write it as a ten and a real center of time.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
What is the whole thing that was presented by Senator?

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm sure you were here. You heard the callically. It's not before its knowledge, but not seconded.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
You want to be read out, be happy to have the report if you read it.

07:34.000 --> 07:46.000
Because I heard it for the first time this much time, and I know that I should get the reporters and the request to strike off the motion that it's supposed to be.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I think that's the best way to make that happen.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
I think that's the best way to make that happen to the number of all of them is of the committee.

07:51.000 --> 08:01.000
What I wanted to get Mr. Chairman was what it was that you want to be, or attend a auction once and presume that you want to be looked at.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
One person, I'd like to have a chance to study when the article comes to a very reasonable respect.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, that's what we wanted to do that. He copies enough for all the committee, although if the chairman is visiting the derks and when he went out and he was going to be refined and changed.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
He has a big deal, I think.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
He's good, Mr. Chairman. He's based on the discussion that's followed after the office.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I appreciate an opportunity to sit before the 130 meters.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
I might add that my position at this time is on very strongly opposed to it.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
This was...

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
This was...

08:30.000 --> 08:39.000
It's fairly clear, there is a complete lack of a agreement among the members of the committee and the council for the clinical...

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
The federal...

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
The federal would have to have some agreements about having...

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
Continuous hearings are 12 days we have accomplished only about half as much as we should have accomplished.

08:50.000 --> 09:00.000
And I think we often take some steps to continue the hearings with this fashion expedition so that we can accomplish the original objectives.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
I think the public interest can best be shared, not by continuing indefinitely a public spectacle which distracts us and asserts the numbers.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
And asserts the numbers of the committee and the officials of the department for more important and vital business.

09:16.000 --> 09:26.000
I think that is our major objective to attain the goal of Italy outlined without unnecessarily prolonging this public spectacle.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
Certainly the chair is objective, as he raises the asking, he finds the dispute directly on public.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
Whether he himself and the arrangement would do violence to his position from the standpoint of equity and justice.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
And if a handful said he thought it would be all satisfactory, then Maccasi said it would be satisfactory.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Mr. Welfth seeking for his plan said it would be unfair.

09:46.000 --> 09:57.000
So as a consequence the chair has noticed position that's superimposed on par with the dispute, a solution which seems to be objectionable to one of the parties vitalism check.

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
May the chair say justice much finer. Over the weekend he received a great many phone calls and conferences from very thoughtful Americans.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And he happened to know what he does when he respects.

10:08.000 --> 10:19.000
He suggested an answer to your suggestion Senator Gwysheck that we change the procedure of this committee to conform it completely with that news in the Oppenheimer Investigation.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
They told me that they consider these two investigations very unknowable.

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
And as much as the Oppenheimer Investigation dealt with security matters and connection with making the hydrogen bomb.

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
This one deals with security matters and connection with the radar protection against the security bomb.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
The hydrogen bomb, related chairman to points that they said that our committee might be doing a disservice.

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
By continuing the whole hearing dealing with security matters, involving our protection against the hydrogen bomb.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
Consequently the chair is exceeding the police that we have had this public distress about the procedures and the methods.

11:00.000 --> 11:08.000
Because at least we do not want the country to believe that this continuation, if there is a danger involved to our security, grows out.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
The committees are reluctantly to continue our hearing, which the citizens think to be concluded.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
We have made available to the citizens an open-former express themselves.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
The chair has said repeated.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
He doesn't see how you can change the room without action by these welcome rates.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
To switch over to the Oppenheimer type of investigation, which is the conduct of the investigation in sequence.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
If there is a danger to our security, I think we should do what we can to try to work out a procedure which will protect us.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
If there is none, of course, the analogy will be fine.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
If we have, we have, if we are going to be heard on this, the chairman will be surprised.

11:48.000 --> 11:56.000
I think it will all for all of us to recognize what the objective is in this particular tone of urgency.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
The charges were made by the Army and countered statements were made by his and his and his.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
Now, the purpose of the hearing was to have the same, the two facts.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Now, I'm sure that that's the committee, that that's the committee's sole purpose.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And holding is here.

12:16.000 --> 12:25.000
I've noted that with all of us on over the weekend, I noted a great deal of history about the committee going to White Walk somewhat.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
I like it, I'm sure, and I'm sure that the committee members are committed.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
There's no desire on anyone to fight for us to hear it.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
But we are, of course, bringing the hearings to aid to an end as soon as possible.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
Now, the suggestion made by Senator Dixon, after the interrogation and the Democratic Party,

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
that's going to take the executive positions and that the transcripts come out as they get in the Democratic Party.

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
Certainly, no one is going to accuse the Army Thursday's committee when they conducted the MacArthur hearing,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
a point wash in any of us.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
That makes the crew back, the whole fact came out as we as we've all been.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
And I'm talking, that we will expedite the hearing considerable.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
And I can see no reason, personally, we're not accepting a time of it on executive stage.

13:15.000 --> 13:23.000
And I think everybody's interest will be well protected, and I'm completely hope that we can hear someone misunderstanding.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
And that's why, either an executive station or an open here.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
I want to get the guys again, that there's no effort on anyone's part to hide.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
And in the fact, order White Walk is here.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Mr. Cameron, is this timing?

13:37.000 --> 13:44.000
May I ask Senator Potter, how are you going to shorten the hearing by simply putting them into executive positions?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
May I?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I don't think so.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
Every time, and I don't know why there is the glare of those little red balls from television, that's enough.

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
But there's always a tendency for more questions that are, and more questions that are not relevant to the revolts,

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
and more answers that are long when the little red balls are shining on that television.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Hello, hey, I just suggest that we're going to have a time limit.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
We're going to have a time limit.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
And rejections.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
If that is the premise, then the time limit ought to be in public just as well as an executive station.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
I don't be in all logically, if that's the word logic as an enemy.

14:24.000 --> 14:34.000
I don't be in all, you can place a time limit on an executive station, but you can't place a time limit on a public station.

14:35.000 --> 14:47.000
Well, I think it's not a reason for it, for actually, the sector of Stevens has been here for 30 days, and I think that the other side is in the air.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
But it was apparently a executive station, or the continuation from here, everybody starts on an even feel.

14:54.000 --> 15:05.000
Otherwise, gentlemen, we're going to be here for a two months, and you might as well make up your mind whether you're going to allow a centiphasis that we're all engaged in in the business of running the army,

15:05.000 --> 15:15.000
which the sector is engaged in, go by the wayside while we continue this repetition hearing, or whether we're going to try to get out before the matter,

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
and have to change the practice quickly as possible without doing just injustice to any of the principles involved.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
No, that's the whole discussion here this morning.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
I don't think there's any number of this, but there's even more practice.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
About this situation and I, I have things I need to be doing today.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
To forget the best regard, the seriousness of the charges that we're investigating.

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
I want to get on with investigating commoners, the places back to the government, that's highly important.

16:06.000 --> 16:27.000
But not the chairman, we have charges here, that the secretary of the army has attempted blackmail, intimidation, and coercion to prevent an investigation of commoners in the army.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
I say to you, Mr. Chairman, there could be no more serious charge made.

16:34.000 --> 16:43.000
And every to the House today, a secretary of the army, a man who has been forced to the tactics and the commoners that he's charged with here,

16:43.000 --> 16:53.000
missed the chairman of places to begin to clean out and to clean out commoners, is the cleaners from the top where they're being caught, or if these charges are true.

16:54.000 --> 17:10.000
And if these hearings and the importance of them, if these are reckless and irresponsible charges, then it ought to be ascertained immediately and remove the proud of doubt or suspicion that these charges are fought upon the insignacy of the army under its presence as administrations.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
I didn't make the charges, but they're here.

17:14.000 --> 17:35.000
And if this secretary of the army has been covering commoners, has been trying to intimidate a committee of the United States, then it is to investigate these commoners in subversive activities in government, has been holding a private in the army of hostage, and refusing to give him what he was entitled to simply detract and intimidate this committee.

17:35.000 --> 17:46.000
It's time Mr. Chairman that this, the people of this country found that out, and the place the start would be at the top and not at the bottom, on the other hand, Mr. Chairman.

17:46.000 --> 17:58.000
If the other charges are true, that members of the staff of this committee have made threats to the right of the army, and declared war on the army.

17:59.000 --> 18:09.000
If they couldn't get the assignment they wanted for some print in their private, they're so charged with the truth and Mr. President, the American people are entitled and all.

18:09.000 --> 18:27.000
And if they're reckless charges, if someone is justified to that and others may hate, that's those charges are fought, and they prove to be false, then I say that as a surristically reckless and irresponsible charge, and he even made it ought to be held accountable for it.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
I have no personal interest in it, the these charges go much further, much further.

18:34.000 --> 18:43.000
Somebody is shining his shoes or somebody with the name of shine. They go to the integrity of this government today at this hour.

18:43.000 --> 18:54.000
If we cannot have integrity in high places, you can expect continuous, commoners in the filtration faster than any Congress nor committee, panic souls and eliminators.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Mr. Chairman, and the chairman.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
I would like to associate myself in every way with what Senator McClellan has said.

19:04.000 --> 19:21.000
As a matter of fact, I don't believe anybody in this government has tried harder than I have in the last 13 years to develop strength, which can resist the advancing communist aggression, strength inside and strength outside of our country.

19:21.000 --> 19:34.000
Now I told the people that I represent the 4 million people in the state of Missouri when these hearings started, that I had just two main tenants as they started.

19:34.000 --> 19:43.000
The first was that these hearings were going to be conducted in a goal-fixed bowl, and a goal-fix bowl is never an executive hearing.

19:44.000 --> 19:58.000
And the second was that each witness, jumping to the approval of the chairman's ruling, was going to have exactly the same rights as every other witness, no more and no less.

19:58.000 --> 20:09.000
Now with all due respect to my distinguished colleague from Michigan's sensitivity to the television aspect of linking these hearings, I do not agree.

20:09.000 --> 20:18.000
I believe that executive hearings at this time, as these witnesses, take the same, is in effect putting it under the rug.

20:18.000 --> 20:28.000
I am not quarried under the rug. I completely agree with Senator McClellan with respect to the seriousness of these hearings, and I believe the American people have the right.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
If they want to, and only if they want to, to look and hear and to read about them.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
Mr. Chair, we'll have to do not ignore Senator McClellan's amendments.

20:44.000 --> 21:01.000
Any further senator FOIA, if this time on this topic, because we're going to have an executive session, it's afternoon, which you can all make your point extremely clear, and Senator Berkson has indicated he's going to bring his motion up in public afterwards, which you can be heard again.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.000
But I do think that we'll have to limit the committee discussion. So the committee members are going to be called upon to vote this time.

21:08.000 --> 21:15.000
We have asked each of you to make your position clear. Each of you has done so. We respect your rights to do so.

21:15.000 --> 21:24.000
I would like to say however, so there's no misunderstanding. To those who may have tuned in at a particular time on the radio or on television. That is why I resign.

21:24.000 --> 21:35.000
Nobody on this committee and nobody involved in the dispute. I have said that these charges are to be minimized, that they are not unimportant.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
They certainly must be important to the people who made them, and they must be important to the people who are endeavoring to answer them on the radio.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
I have said repeatedly as far as the chair is concerned, I want these hearings to pursue the truth.

21:49.000 --> 21:57.000
I would like to provide an adjustable conclusion. I'm motivated by that, much more than I am about the particular committee procedure.

21:57.000 --> 22:05.000
I frankly am disturbed with it, when thoughtful friends of mine call up as 80s over the weekends and say that we should give some thought.

22:05.000 --> 22:14.000
To try and handle this question of security with us, as the Oppenheimer question of security with was handed.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
There are people and the press unanimously applaud the Oppenheimer procedure in the Oppenheimer page.

22:21.000 --> 22:28.000
Many segments of the press, some elements of the public, are criticizing our committee for doing this in public.

22:28.000 --> 22:38.000
I think as well that we re-appraise the situation at least. They are going to make sure that security with us are involved in this terribly dangerous world in which we live.

22:38.000 --> 22:48.000
In connection with our best protection against the hydrogen bomb, namely the aspect of radar, at least just merits and executive sessions of each arm and one,

22:48.000 --> 22:57.000
whether we can refine our procedure better to protect the security of all Americans and to just spot each party to the dispute,

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
actually wants to have from the standpoint of procedures.

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
If it is desired by any element, that they get justice, we should continue for two months and keep the Senate and the Army tied up the fist position.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
That party has the right to make his position known publicly and our committee will then vote.

23:14.000 --> 23:23.000
And as far as the chairperson's journey will continue to vote in the direction of providing a forum here which all parties are just as distant as fair and equitable.

23:24.000 --> 23:32.000
Once the parties to the dispute, if they ever care, arrive at a procedure which will give some reasonable possibility of terminating these areas.

23:32.000 --> 23:50.000
In the next two weeks or two months, then the chair will certainly never be in position of voting to say once the parties to the dispute are satisfied to adjudicate the differences, we should crowd them in the back and put them over the risk, urging them to continue to accuse each other in public space.

23:51.000 --> 24:01.000
Unless there are other statements to come from committee members now, we will proceed with the interrogation of Secretary Steve Smith and this time I would like to make a very short observation.

24:01.000 --> 24:10.000
I would be entirely willing to limit to whatever was considered appropriate by the committee, the length of time that any witness was on the stand.

24:10.000 --> 24:19.000
It seems to me such a logical solution of this problem that I'm just made that it hasn't been taken up seriously before.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Any other sentence can be heard before we start in with the interrogation?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
No sir.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Do you want to limit to the scare?

24:25.000 --> 24:34.000
I think the product only wants statement I'd like to make is, Sunday's time has indicated that he was missing anything out of the rug.

24:34.000 --> 24:42.000
I'm a discretionless morning, I go to the whole center that made any statement that they wanted anything foot onto the rug.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
I think it's perfectly clear and I know it's been in a lot of time.

24:46.000 --> 24:55.000
That we're receiving all the facts, but we're not in a statement hearing the same story told about ten times and ten different ways.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Any other sentence before we start with the interrogation of Mr. Steve Smith?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
We're about to start.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
Before the questioning of Mr. Steve Smith's continued, let's return to our studios and cost the country to permit our station to identify themselves.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
This is ABC Television Network.

25:16.000 --> 25:27.000
Date line Detroit, Nash Low Price is Rock America, on ambassadors, Beckman, Metropolitan, the swing now is to Nash, and here's the big pipe bomb cell.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
Our famous Nash Rambler family for them, factory delivered is yours for only $1,500, at your Nash dealers now.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Modern house fatality calls for light refreshment.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Autopepsy by the talking of case and let your guests reflect without filling.

25:43.000 --> 25:51.000
The major event for us, Mr. Chairman, all the kind of exciting was an act of a economist hearing him, Mr. Kohn has been surprised.

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
In the 80s, I could hear it, it's a day of my aim, or the name, or the name, or the name of the relevant promoter, or a house of conature.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Navi, Mr. Chairman, please make a toast.

26:02.000 --> 26:16.000
If I would respectfully direct the attention of Mr. Jenkins to the specification, which we supply in this case, and which we make as an allegation here, the fact that one of the motivations bringing about is proceeding.

26:16.000 --> 26:27.000
The following morning, he was talking to hearings about committing, with a cover-up by Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams of the people responsible for the handling of the press case in the arms.

26:27.000 --> 26:35.000
We were told by Mr. Stevens that this infected General Report would supreme on us, as finally been finished, and that the names are now available.

26:35.000 --> 26:45.000
And I think it's a very important test here to see whether Mr. Stevens, even at this point, says, will give the American people the name of all who gave an honorable gift-godge to this case.

26:46.000 --> 26:57.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Jenkins, the very fact that a specific allegation is made by Senator McCarty, staff says, not necessarily make it relevant.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
The same holds true with respect to Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams.

27:01.000 --> 27:09.000
This corner is now attempting to go into a specific case, and for the reasons I have here to report that, I have any objections.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Mr. Chairman, may I have a heard?

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
Thank you for the briefly, Mr. Chairman. I don't think anyone was too brief here this morning. I would like to be heard, and Mr. Taylor would like to consider necessary.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Okay.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Now listen to the line of the talks to the point of work.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Yes, I will be talking to a point of order.

27:25.000 --> 27:40.000
Mr. Chairman, one of the important allegations here is that the allegations against Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cargons myself were spot out formalized the night after Mr. Cohn was arrested.

27:40.000 --> 27:53.000
The night after Mr. Stevens met with us, that is the night that he agreed to give us the names of those who are responsible for a plus-duty order to the Communist Major.

27:53.000 --> 28:09.000
The report on the Congressman's Winter Vignet against the plus-duty order for the Communist Major, when that's time to go to the Oklahoma, for his change, the promotion of the honorable discharge, as the chairman was Mr. Stevens promised us that information about that time.

28:10.000 --> 28:23.000
He now says that he has that information. I think it's very important to test his good faith to see whether he still wants to cover up those who got plus-duty orders for this Communist Major.

28:23.000 --> 28:32.000
He has not at all had some of this with the chairman to give all of his details about a private who was watching the wrong side of the Jeep, so pay the time to get his shoes down.

28:33.000 --> 28:40.000
I think this is extremely important to find out whether he's going to give us those names now if he's got some reason why he doesn't want to give them in public.

28:40.000 --> 28:58.000
Then I asked the view order to send up to the chair the names of those who responsible. Mr. Chairman, this is a very fresh and soul, this investigation, not the DIGALTY ONE COMMUNITY, but the DIGALT those who have covered, protected and puddled.

28:59.000 --> 29:07.000
And that's been from it, I've been promised, and Mr. Chairman has no reason and God's earth. Why those names should be kept secret of this time?

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
I think it's one of the times I'm in the business.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
Certainly, no reason to reverse the position I've taken, Mr. Chairman, I'm sure it's sound. I'm still in the business.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
It's very, very tender to me. I've been here as a consultant.

29:20.000 --> 29:29.000
I do not think it's advisable necessary and proper to go into the details of each individual case.

29:29.000 --> 29:41.000
But the statements that the senator has just made reiterate the seriousness of this charge against the secretary of the Army and the integrity of the President and the administration of the Army.

29:42.000 --> 29:51.000
I think the senator is entitled to have those names submitted to the committee to heal the secretary's now in position to do it.

29:51.000 --> 30:04.000
I want to expedite these years, but this question and this line of testimony reiterate how seriously charges off.

30:04.000 --> 30:23.000
I think if the secretary is in position to do it, the names of those from the whatever processes occurred and are the routine of this charging for the Army, I think the names and the correct case to speak to the medical committee.

30:23.000 --> 30:45.000
There is a fair deal. He believes that it might be unwise to submit the names and involve publics, but he is a fair deal that certainly involves wealthy individuals, have been charged and complicated about further enough, they were ever going to disclose the names of those responsible for the preface promotion.

30:45.000 --> 30:58.000
And if those facts are now available, he believes that the secretary is in conflict and submission to the council of our committee, without necessary releasing them to the press, unless the secretary feels that he should release them to the press.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
In these ways, your question on that basis is to share with the chairman of the office of the chairman of the office.

31:03.000 --> 31:27.000
I would like to point out to what we want and information bearing on allegations 41, 45 and 46 in the philosophical specifications filed by Senator Carvey in the absence of thousands of cars and miles of, specifically,

31:27.000 --> 31:51.000
allegations 41, the chairman alleges that honor about the 11th of February 16th. Mr. Adams has asked that he had an interrogation that if the investigation continues, he, Mr. Adams, expected to be executed and backed over the press case as no follow-up action has been taken on and filed in Mr. Adams.

31:51.000 --> 32:11.000
And that he, Mr. Adams, might be charged with primary responsibility for allowing an honorable discharge to issue through press on February 16th, 1954, and we would want to know that the chairman of the full defense, the Black and the perceived as the one that Adams 121 and the honorable discharge of the major press.
