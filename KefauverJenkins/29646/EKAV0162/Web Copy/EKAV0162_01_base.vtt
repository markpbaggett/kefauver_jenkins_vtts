00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Committee will please come to order and the chair would like to begin this morning by

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
once more welcoming the guests who have entered the committee room and taking this opportunity

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
of advising them of the standing committee room.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
That in entering the room you come in to comply with the standing rule of the committee,

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
which is to insist that no members of the audience manifest disapproval or approval

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
at any time in any way in an audible niche.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
And the officers, members of the police have instructions from the chair to politely escort

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
from the room without further notice anybody violating the conditions under which you entered the room.

00:48.000 --> 00:57.000
In that connection the chair would like to read a short paragraph which appeared in the New York Times

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
a day or two ago and I call this to the special attention of the officers of the Capitol Police

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
who have been doing such a splendid job in maintaining order and with a splendid job

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
in ushering our guests in and seeing it there treated as comfortably as possible.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
In this rundown it appeared that I think it was in Saturday mornings issue of the New York Times

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
speaking of the committee proceedings as well the room is packed daily with about 600 persons present

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
and all the times and others waiting outside.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
Observer's report that better order and decorum has been maintained and in any similar hearing in members

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
the chair would like to publicly express his appreciation to the Capitol Police for their fine work

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
in heading up that job and I think it's especially appropriately do so

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
because after the unfortunate shooting affair in the House of Representatives it seems to me

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
that Capitol Police came in for an abundance amount of unjustified criticism.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
I think consequently it is only further now be given their full share of justified praise

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
also the audience.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
And also I want to express my appreciation to the audience for their splendid cooperation.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The past 15 years I have attended a great many hearings.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Some of them emotionally charged perhaps almost to the point that this one has been.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
And I want to appreciate, express my appreciation the fact that there has only been one or two deviations

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
throughout the hearings from the audience of this committee rules.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Thank you for that.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
We have the Stevens back on the chair this morning and we will proceed with the committee business.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Chairman.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
And the next.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
The Chairman I have to be remade is to address to the chair this morning.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
The first is that there is a meeting of the Judicial Committee,

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
consisting direct of meeting days and only your gender growth considerations

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
is a veil reported from the subcommittee of which I am the Chair.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
I feel impelled therefore as soon as it is possible to secure a form of the Judicial Committee

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
to attend that session and to present that bill.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
May I also suggest Mr. Chairman that tomorrow afternoon the school of law.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
He's just a meeting on independent offices of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Will Mark's up the independent offices bill?

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
This embezzles money for the Veterans Administration of Tennessee's Allure Authority

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
and the Housing Administration, the atomic energy commission and many others.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
That I feel himself the chairman of the circumstances and the cause of the importance of the bill

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
to be on hand for the market.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
And so I shall probably attend myself in these hearings tomorrow afternoon for that session.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
The FBI would present this one as chairman's motion, which is its process.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
I move as chairman that the testimony of Secretary Stevens will be now concluded.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Or I might modify that to say concluded after the interrogation this morning comes to an end.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
And it's my understanding that probably not over an hour of causing contamination remains

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
and that they are asked to send it to McCarthy, they call the testifying

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
and the submitter direct and cost examination.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
That as the conclusion of Senator McCarthy's testimony examination,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
the public hearings will be released yesterday.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
That whatever a fictional testimony may be required for many departments to get some investigation,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
be taken in executive session.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And I might qualify that as expression that may be a challenge by saying that

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
it's entirely possible to leave alone.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
You might go into executive session for additional testimony.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
You might adopt the technique that was employed in the meeting of the prosecutor's hearing

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
when testimony was made available at the end of every day's session.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Now I submit that to motion chairman because I believe, first of all,

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
that it comes within the special rule that it has been adopted by this committee

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
for the conduct of the hearing.

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
Secondly, I think that I think the testimony of Senator McCarthy will get to the remaining answers

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
and as much as the answer and the counter-carriage that were filed

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
has been to the causing witnesses committee,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
is a joint document that speaks not only for himself,

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
but for Mr. Coleman and Mr. Carles, which I feel also, Mr. Chairman,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
that a fictional testimony beyond these two principles

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
whether it's a momentary highly repetitious and only engaged in love with public.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I think the Army Charges thus far has been reasonably well-ventilated.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
So this is the matter that the committee has determined in the interest of expeditions

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
and in the ascertainment of the truth and falsity of the charges that it has before.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
I feel impelled by Mr. Chairman to make it happen in the whole

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
that we can bring these to an expeditions conclusion that the same are determined

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
of the matters that are pending before the committee.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Chair, Mr. Chairman, is there a second to the motion?

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Mr. Carles, I'm about.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
I'd like to inquire how the principles or how the chair

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
inquires the principles of this controversy and their councils

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
if they have entered into an agreement or constructed

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
to the motion just made that the Parliamentary inquiry not reaches to the chair

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
and the chair does not know, can find out from those.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Chair, there's not no, and you will be happy.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
I think it's only fair that the principles of this debate or their council

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
should have an opportunity to express themselves on any proposed changes of procedure

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
and to avoid them for striking the case.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
The question is, is there a difference from the one we had before last week?

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I think it's a fair share of the entire committee.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
And we will proceed to do so now under the majority of your involvement in this.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
This suggestion is just to chair and defend this properly.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
To dismiss Mr. Susan Peters, primarily now or at the end of the morning question

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
as the latest, a few then come before the committee on the open to protect themselves

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
from as long as the series of questioning as the committee and the council for all sides

07:22.000 --> 07:29.000
and all hands to decide after which the case will be considered before the committee

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
is brought to the committee to come and give it to the committee and other than

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
whether this is any due to follow the follow the expected infection

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
and the public would be given the testimony and the facts are not in the same place

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
when they are adhering, because I will follow some of the words about the hour

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
which you may set out to discuss in the notes that rest of the phrase.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
I think the McCarthy, the curbs, is ready to hear your reaction to that together.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Mr. President, may I have a question for both of you on behalf of anything that will

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
start from the hearing so we can extract all of our important things

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
getting the testimony that is known to the committee to be in defense plan

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
and government of that's what my objective, that's what a rather short and good.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
There's some introductions, the problems that we've all dealt with,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
all other hearings until you finish the exacted instructions

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
or as we can proceed with our investigation of communism on the days

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
as if you were not holding hearings on transit.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Mr. Chairman, may I apologize to the McCarthy here?

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Whether he is referring to the action that was taken by the subcommittee

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
at one of his first hearings at the regular investigation of the permanent subcommittee

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
if he's suspended until this conference he had been exposed.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Is that the matter he was referring to?

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
I just wonder whether or not you embody any emotions on very left.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
During these exacted instructions I don't know how long they last.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
They may have been held two, three days a week, I don't know how many days a week.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
You can do them body in your emotional, that on the days we were not holding hearings.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm not sure if we could proceed with the all important matters that are piling up

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
before the committee when I was properly favored.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
If it merely means to continue this inexecutive session,

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
I don't think I'd be too much in favor of that.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
I may say this, I do think, that when Secretary Steven finishes his testimony,

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
so all the centers at finish cross examining me and counsel

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
that what we get beyond that point will be repetition.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
I know that Mr. Tanksons has interviewed all of the witnesses

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
to get the both by me, the Mr. Cohen, the Chacar and by the military.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
He knows what they were accustomed by too.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
I think beyond Steven's and McCarthy it will be repetition.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
However, we're going to go into executive session.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
The public can't see it and hold one or two sessions a week

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
and do nothing the other day.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
It might hold up our work much longer.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
If Senator Dirkton you would provide the if executive sessions are held,

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
but they'd be held every day until the matter is ended.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I'd deny it was paper.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
For if you provided in your motion, that on the days that this committee was not studying on this matter.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
As we could proceed, in the matter is as I said,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
been piling up the great number of communist and defense plans,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
some of the military, we have disturbing reports about

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
the communist implementation of Army intelligence.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
There are many things we must do into this,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
but if we are not held up, then I would favor your motion.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
The other time is chairman.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
I fully share these solicitors who have sent us to McCarthy about it.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
The assumption of the regular work of the committee.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
However, action on that matter was taken indiscriminately

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
of anything else and I suppose it ought to be handled

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
on the basis of an independent motion.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
If you're a buddy into power at the work of the committee,

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
there's not any relation to anything that is relevant to the country,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
but it occurred to me that at the earliest possible days

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
you sent the committee off the resume, which I can aware.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So there have been no reasons we have suggestions.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
You have the entire committee here.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
There's no reason why you can't incorporate that in your motion.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
It's a simple addition and on the days, 11th Saturday or Sunday.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
That's the committee is not putting that we resume our old work.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
It's awfully important that the question is going proposed.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
If you did that good or for if you would provide in your motion

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
and merely accept the offer made by Mr. Welch,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I accept that. In fact, as you know, I'm going to accept further.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Mr. Welch suggests that we hear Mr. Steven Solay

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
and then hear McCarthy Folay.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I said I was not only accepting that,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
but I was willing to dismiss Steven from the fan,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
because I thought we were not getting to him with information.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
You have the frame consumed.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
You have a new element,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
which could prolong the hearing from hold up our work frankly

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
and definitely unless you provide in the motion.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
But the hearings will be held every day until concluded,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
or that you provide.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
But on the days, we're not telling you the other work.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Frankly, I would have no objection to the inclusion of that item in the motion.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Provided, of course, that the regular work of the committee

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
that they resumed in every field except where some element

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
of the present controversy might come into play.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I think that would be only fair of course.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And is my understanding that there is plenty of work on the agenda

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
to keep the committee busy.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
If you mind, I'll keep Mr. Manus from out.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Next, next.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
By the fact that the relation to the motion,

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
the chair has been advised that we've prolonged the investigation

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
which has been taking place in Alaska for over six months.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
It has been issued by the fact that the suspecting

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
to limitation is running out this month and next on some of the charges.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
We suggest that the chair,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
the end, can take to the Alaska investigation.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
He said no thank you.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
We have worked enough on this at once.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And it's fair that it's the real problem.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And I would like to say,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
primarily interested in the answer to one question.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
That is he wants to be sure that any arrangement that we work on

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
does not only opinion of the parties to the dispute,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
to violence, to justice and equity,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
and to follow the interpart and term.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And I want to ask you that question,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
and you have a direct answer here, if I can.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And I would like to ask that question,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
although other parties to the dispute,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
because we want these hearings,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
when we finally have a dedicated M to be a dedicated fairly

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
and effortfully, you feel that the arrangement suggests it by a center of the direct.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
With two violence, to your position or the position,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
as though the position is working from the standpoint of the principles of equity and gender.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
No, sir. I'm talking to Senator McCatman.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Good to see him. Let me just discuss the question.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
The other three young men who are involved.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Mr. Chairman, Senator McCatman.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
I am not sure if I fully understand some traditional principles,

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
but we hear secretary Stevens and public sessions,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
here are some of the president's public sessions.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
And then we go into executive sessions,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
and hear other witnesses.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
Well, whatever other witnesses they committee may decide to hear,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
you know, they'll be destroyed in the next.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
That, of course, in the medical, the committee is determined.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
May I say this is the first of the suggestions I've been brought to my attention.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
After that moment, I can see nothing to begin by a continuation in the executive session.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I think it's you who work with the executive,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
well, to the original proposal.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I would go along with that.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
I brought two, once we get into executive session,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
we can prolong the fall summer,

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
and never get to the work that we should be doing.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm trying to think the public opinion is going to force the committee

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
to stop these hearings off fairly soon and get back to our work.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
This will executive session public opinion cannot operate too well.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
As the thunder knows, this is the first step of the engagement of the May to me.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I had, I was under the impression for the news,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
or I was going to make an entirely different motion.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
That is the secretary of Stevens and I have been heard and pulled.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
The violence set off, and I think it will be a great mistake.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
It's not that I enjoy going on that stand, you know, this family.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I think it will be a great mistake to conclude the public hearings

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
without giving the thunderous attempts to cause the government to mean as much to say what they want to do.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
But beyond that, if you can come to hearings after Stevens and I have finished,

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
I would go along with that partly because I may say it's my soul in turn now as it gets back

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
to the all-important work we're doing.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
And as some per month has said, we have a very, I shouldn't say a very rather important matter,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
involving alleged fraud, disruption, bribery, and elapsed.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
The fact that limitations is about to run out on some of the alleged criminal violations.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I like to get back to that, I like to get back to the communist and defense point.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
But in conclusion, under certain, I don't know that you're proposing with these things up.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
The party here is there, it has to be a stating call.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Well, if the committee undergoes to get some compensation on a particular party,

16:50.000 --> 16:57.000
give it a hand-todd unless there were a stating call to the effect that certifies testimony,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
please be taken in the executive section.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
You can schedule a time limit on the number of days or weeks and exacts of such,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
if you said I would go along with it.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
Well, I would have no objection to a reasonable kind limit,

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
but I may say that this motion is made entirely on my own responsibility.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
And I think all the principles will agree that I have not exploded any further with them,

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
since the last session we had on money, on last week.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
So I'm doing this entirely on my own responsibility,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
but why do not know the reaction of the other principles will be?

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
So I do believe that it can be worked out,

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
so that the executive section without spending too much time or having too many sessions,

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
whatever clarifying and supplementing material may be necessary could then be a thing.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Well, quite a farce now, I'll turn here to some of the questions,

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
whether it's safe time or does not say it's time to share as to a question

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
which I did not believe you answered.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
I'm assuming the person, amendments to the coups,

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
that you would like to know whether you're speaking for you and your two associates,

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
would feel that this in any way does violence to justice and equity

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
and so far as your position and your interest in this case is concerned.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
And I have just one little term.

18:29.000 --> 18:37.000
Senator McCarthy is now conferring with his two associates in this matter

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
and the left was Roy Cohn and the right was to find cars.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
It's up to the matter amongst themselves,

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
though that this is a must-enhanced majority before the end of the month,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
to the church and the propose.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
And the foreground is with Frederick Bryan, the council,

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
from a state-of-pronged ten-fold, the Assistant Secretary of Defense.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
And he too will be consulted on this matter.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
The Assistant Secretary of Defense, on the left was Fred Jenkins,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
and the Secretary of Defense, Senator M. Wright,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
and the problem, and the timing of the Assistant Secretary of Defense.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
The three Democrats, these three Democratic members,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
have been sent to the state as they do not approve of this move

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
to negotiate the hearings in this action by limiting the testimony

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
in public, simply sent to the Secretary of Defense.

19:19.000 --> 19:29.000
We're going to get it to the Secretary of Defense.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
Senator McCarthy, to answer your questions,

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
as the shareholders were not brought by me,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
they were brought to Mr. Seas with the head of them.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
As the shareholders, they had planned,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
they brought them to call off the hearings,

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
they were successful in doing this.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
I don't want to give Mr. Seas any more statement

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
to along the hearings in death of them.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
At this point, I say I'm ready to prepare for good and expected discussions.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
We may continue in death in a place,

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
because one Secretary Seas has been trying to finish specifying

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
whatever comes after that will be reputitioned.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
We can continue that reputition all somewhere along next summer.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I believe that many of these senators,

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
I hope, are smarting under the pressure of public,

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
pressure to get the focus about sign chooses to hold off.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
I would, I would, as long as I do, have viewing for the chairman

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
I would prefer as they be in public.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
You have not answered my question.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Now that's the one third time, if you will answer,

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
it will be helpful, if you won't answer it, I can't tell you.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
The U.C.U. that working out an arrangement along the line

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
is suggested by Congressman Amman,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
for tracking the hearings.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
And essentially, just continuing them with the testimony of Secretary Seas

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
and Senator McCartney, except for such cooperating differences

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
that he thinks the committee might want to call the Secretary session.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Do you think that would do violence to justice and equity

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
in the foreign investigation is concerned?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Is the chair is primarily interested in having this thing done

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
effortlessly and stuff?

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
And if we can work out with negotiations or arbitration or emotions,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
something for tracking the hearings, it will not be sufficient

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
that goal of the chair with just use the foot.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
To define the other hands and use the foot because it is useless.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
There is no hope that he does, as a fairies,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
as I am concerned, that he is chair at the end time, not for the foot.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
No matter if you have direct question now.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Chairman, if we do no violence,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
do justice and equity insofar as the issues here are concerned.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Unless there are some assurance, however,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
that the executive section should be terminated

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
within a reasonable length of time.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
If we do grave violence,

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
do the justice insofar as holding up the committee's work distance.

21:57.000 --> 22:04.000
I want to get back to the $100, $130, I believe, my staff tells me,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
that if I am coming into the day or in the sense plan,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I will get back to the last and situation.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Now, if you are proposal,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
answering your directly will do no injustice, no violence,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
a justice.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
Insofar as a way to get to the missing state is not concerned.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Thanks.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
But I have one further concern by me for being over and over.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
And that is that there is something in the center of his motion,

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
the center of his motion, which will limit himself.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
So we want to, in executive section,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
one may or least two days of each until next fall,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
and with all the important work that is made finally up.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I think that some direction shifts,

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
but some limiting cause and his motion is going to be much more acceptable to me,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
although I am not going on it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
And I hope to be more acceptable to the center of his career.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Good, Chairman.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
I don't think that the suggestion is on rings to vote.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I think there is point in it,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
and it is a matter that is going to be.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
Mr. Well, in line with the general line of inquiry,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
I would like to thank Mr. Welles for his kind of inquiry.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
He definitely bested him a talent.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
And he referred to my colleague,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
who is a center of my strategy,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
and I do say his speaks to the number of his employees now.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
For I, Christopher, he is the first speaker in justice,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I recognize he is one for vote.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
I will speak first to Chairman if I may.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
And I will direct my first two answers to what I understood

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
in two separate inquiries by Senator McClellum.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
First inquiry, if I understood incorrectly,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
the army of ring of this proposition,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
prior to its speech presented here this morning,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
the answer to Senator McClellum to that question is in the negative.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
The next question is,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
does Senator Dirk some small issue acceptable to the army,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
to Mr. Stevens and to the dread?

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
The answer to that question is in the negative.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And he asked me the same question, Mr. Welles,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
or Mr. Dirk, that I have some of my questions.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
Do you feel that a suggestion as made by Senator Dirk,

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
would do violence to justice and equity in so far as you,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
as your client's like today,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
is the violence of your client in this country that he has been sent?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Yes, that's the only thing I'm proud of,

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
if I think it's what do violence to justice and equity?

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
Does that mean that you feel that any change of deliverance

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
in the direction of shortening the green,

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
would you say it's violence?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
Or if it's simply a gift to the proposal made by Senator Dirk?

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
I do not say that any move to shortly hearing is hopeless,

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
but I do say as I have constantly said last week and now this week,

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
that we must hear the principles in this case.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
First, that collateral witnesses as are obviously necessary,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
either to support or subtract from the testimony given by those principles.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
The names of the principles are familiar to everyone.

24:49.000 --> 24:55.000
They are Adams, Mr. Senator McCarthy, Mr. Colme,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
and Mr. Carth.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Oh, may I say that for that being completely welcome?

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
May I inspire further to further the talk so that the record will be completely clear

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
whether it is suggesting that the hearings continue until at least all those people

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
who knew have named or heard,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
you are representing the position of Mr. Stevens, Mr. Adams,

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
or the Army or whoever you consider to be your client.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
You speak with their approval and the story was talking about

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
continuing the public hearings until we explore completely

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
as a minds of the witnesses here,

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
I did not say what I have said without infirmity,

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
with Mr. Stevens, Secretary Stevens, and Mr. Adams, of course,

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
they authorized to say what I have said.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
I expected that, but I want to have to be in the record for a new move.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
Mr. Brown, could I ask Mr. Brown for a favor?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I ask Mr. Brown for a favor.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
Yes, Mr. Brown, may I state this, Mr. Chairman?

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
This is the 15th day of the hearings.

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
As far as I am concerned, I have heard nothing during these 15 days

26:08.000 --> 26:14.000
that involve the system secretary of the French Council in this situation.

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
I have stated to this committee before that the so-called

26:20.000 --> 26:29.000
Hensel-Matter is entirely collateral to and not a part of this controversy at all.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
As far as Mr. Hensel is concerned, therefore,

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
Mr. Hensel has no objection to any reasonable shortcomings

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
the hearings in the public interest.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
However, if there is at any point,

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
does the morning directed at Mr. Hensel, then I feel very strong

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
that Mr. Hensel should have the right to answer that does the morning

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
in the same sort of form in which it was given, namely,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
the public forum for the Board is submitted.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, please supposing that Mr. Hensel is not

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
brought in to the country of Rati and foreign testimonies

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
by either Mr. Stevens and his concluding testimony

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
or by Senator Matrivy and his testimony should be arranged

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
that the post-resent seduction prevail.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
And you then feel that following the formula

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
which you heard from the seduction described within any way

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
due violence, adjusted in equity and survival is your client.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
I would feel, Mr. Chairman, that under the circumstances

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
you describe, some of the seduction suggestion

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
would do no violence, the justice in equity, in so far as my clients

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
was concerned. Thank you, sir.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Mr. Brown.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Yes. And the panel.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
As a result of the conversation this morning that has evidence

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
that there's a great deal of divergence of views

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
concerning how the hearings shall take place

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
and hear from your own.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I share the views of Senator Stanton,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
and I think all members of the committee,

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
that we should conclude the hearings as soon as possible,

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
recognizing the fact that all members of the committee

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
and I'm sure all members of the board are anxious

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
and desires of having the full past, present.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
Now, I would like to make this a huge suggestion.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
One suggestion would be that,

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
in order to the testimony of Mr. Stanton,

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
that he probably has given the full Army case.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
The Army, the wrong, has just something that he would have to win.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
But it would seem to me that a thorough examination

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
of Mr. Attick would be 90% of the repetition

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
of the testimony of Mr. Stanton.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I would like to make this a suggestion,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
and Mr. Buren, of course, Mr. Stanton's testimony,

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
he's kept the size sometimes time when a, for another witness,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
to testify on a point of testimony,

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
that's the snake, and they're possibly,

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
that during the interrogation of Senator McCart,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
that same particular of the fault.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
And I am, certainly convinced that,

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
possibly with the exception of a few minor points,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
that the conclusion of Senator McCart's testimony

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
that the full story will be told.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Now, I want to reinforce that,

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
that this committee is not considered

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
in the white box of any sort.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
And I'm sure that, as a result of,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
that the hearings will conclude,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
so that no person can accuse the committee

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
of white walking the case.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
But I do want to provide the fact that,

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
as a committee, we have a such responsibility to eliminate all the,

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
as much repetition as possible,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
and to the weekings,

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
to include these hearings, the satisfaction of the public,

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
to get on with our more important work.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that you contact

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
the all the principles and the case,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
and the ranges for an executive meeting of the committee,

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
either at the Illinois or at the conclusion of our hearings tonight,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
so that we can have a destined plan

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
as to our hearings,

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
while we'll carry on from the committee.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
And Chair Stainer, he has gotten followed up.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Mr. Chairman, let me make it to just,

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
just quite a little bit, as far as not only much

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
the committee resolved with this issue,

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
but it's the responsibility of the committee to resolve these.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
It's the current practice with Senate committees to be done,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
how much or how little testimony they're going to take,

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
by way of ventilation of piece of legislation or an issue.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
And so I make a suggestion, Mr. Chairman,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
that we have an executive meeting of this committee

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
at one thirty-day for the purpose of resolving it,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
at which time I'll present the motion,

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
maybe present it in the resign for,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
but at that time we can vote it,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
so that if the motion is made,

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
and there is a text,

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
it then comes on for action.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Mr. Chair, I understand that,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
for the time being,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
you are withdrawing the motion,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
which up to now is not that the second.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
All right, if there is a agreement,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
that's going to be a second.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
We have an executive meeting of one thirty-day.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
do I understand that this is going to do is now withdrawing the motion he made.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
So by the time this is my intention,

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
it's in turn.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
He has asked for an executive session to be held at one thirty-

32:02.000 --> 32:02.920
one thirty-

32:02.920 --> 32:03.920
and the second.

32:03.920 --> 32:08.920
I have no objection to holding an executive session to discuss,

32:08.920 --> 32:11.920
not only this, but both motion and I,

32:11.920 --> 32:13.920
and it's a proposed motion now,

32:13.920 --> 32:15.920
that's just gone,

32:15.920 --> 32:17.920
to discuss it,

32:17.920 --> 32:19.920
and that's it for many,

32:19.920 --> 32:20.920
get each other's views,

32:20.920 --> 32:22.920
and the take to resolve,

32:22.920 --> 32:23.920
if possible,

32:23.920 --> 32:25.920
for the creation that is focused.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.920
Thank you.
