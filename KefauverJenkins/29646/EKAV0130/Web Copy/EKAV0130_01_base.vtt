00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
We see at the moment Army Secretary Robert Stevens is classified under examination by committee members.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
We take you now to look in, Washington, to the office of the military.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
We have a private gun.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm a firefighter. I searched my memory and my conscience.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
I've also talked with Mr. Adams, who's been here recently.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
This is the only evidence in respect to Mr. Carr,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
was the happening of our color second.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
And if I were his judges, as you are, I would have quit.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
But there is more evidence to come.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
And I think his state must await the end of the case,

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
when all of the evidence is in.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
But it's fine, I'm sorry to do.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Mr. Carr, telephone Mr. Adams,

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
to respect the shine on military authority with the panel.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
He will always met the rules of the military,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
but the military is not only the right of the military,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
but the panel of you would like to meet the right of him,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
as well as the principles of the case.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I make the point of order to entirely unprofit Mr. Stevens,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
to testify, what Mr. Adams is going to say.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
All I'm trying to do is to give the committee a call.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I'm going to do a letter.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
And the chair has to consult with the committee on the pilot right of Mr. Carr.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Mr. Stevens is Secretary of the Army.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
He cannot in the very nature of things

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
have personal knowledge of everything about which he testified.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
His way of handling his thoughts, his actions,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
are all under scrutiny.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
They are used in parallel with and must necessarily

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
on major occasions rely on information in human safety.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
And the value of support, I think it is entirely cover for the Secretary of the Army,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
to state and to give information.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
And they see and values to work in the field of society.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, on your hand,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
is there any way?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Mr. Stevens, being questioned about a conversation,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
but Mr. Adams is not present.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
There are testimony of that as in completely counter-decker traits,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
when I make the point of order.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
In order to bolster that counter-decker testimony,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
he cannot call.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Mr. Adams will call him by other conversation.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
The Secretary of the Army, Mr. Chairman,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
the further point of order, is that his answer is not responsible.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
But the part that was asked in the body is specific conversation.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
On October 7th, I think Mr. Jenkins is correct.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
He is one of his subordinates, the A&M,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
and answering that question good.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
But no subordinates with the pleasant, no subordinates,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
no anything about that conversation.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Either Mr. Stevens will sign the truth.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
The other particular is the right out.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I assume he doesn't make any sound, because that's kind of what was responsible.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Or, in the time of the Tuesday of the other day, I asked him if the Jenkins question.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Mr. Chairman, may I ask your body,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Mr. Stevens, is that his question?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I am thinking of Mr. Stevens.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
That is the word I am trying to say.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
He is talking to the men, that is the reason I am talking to him.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Mr. Thomas, the Secretary of the Army,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
is asking me to question any answers,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
so I may determine whether to find the right examples.

03:35.000 --> 03:46.000
Mr. Chairman, I assume you only got the time to keep it up.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
This point of order is the starting point of my time.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Yes, I understand.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Yes.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Yes.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Question line, I ask you to ask the Secretary of the Army,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
whether to find the right examples.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I believe he stated that there are no recollections on him,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
and Mr. Thomas said it doesn't mean it.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And I believe it was the number of questions that he said the right.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
And you are told it doesn't mean it's right.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
The Secretary of the Army is writing an information guide

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
that he's been working on in any positive way,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
that he has been working on in the past few years,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
and that he has been working on in the past few years,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
which was right to include here,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
as one of the participants in the election directors,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
or perhaps the President of the Army has to tell the story of the time,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and as a world-renownedist,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I have a very fond memory of my time here,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
and I have also talked with Mr. Adam in the right group,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
which is where it should be, where it should be.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
And if you only have an incident,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
you strike the Mr. Car,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
or I will be talking to you in October 7th,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
and if I were to judge, and you are,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I would have lived here,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
but for as more of an uncommon, I think that is,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
that is 880, not just in the age,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
but all of the others in the age,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
except if I'm right, are you true?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Let's say a few,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Mr. Lav, roll up all the phones,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
and we'll write them down on many a day,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
and shift from the numbers that go to the polls.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Good chance, Mr. Johnson.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I must, in all,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
get the contents to reverse my theft.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
The answer to that question,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
there is not reflect the question,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
there is not reflect the bomb that comes up

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
to the Secretary of the Army.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
He was being the city-tree question that,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
so whether or not,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
to use the witness now,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
has any knowledge of any statement

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
that may be in the Mr. Car.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
And he says that he has,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
and he goes rather in a sense that

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
there are other witnesses.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I think the Secretary is entirely correct in the statement

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
that this time,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
this committee should not exonerate our end-to-end party

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
to not kill the against Mr. Car.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
He calls the powerful group

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
to not end that miscommunication of Mrs. Stanley.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Judge Gowdy gives her innocence

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
of any party so to speak on the law of the group,

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
as in,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I reiterate,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I do not think you're popular

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
in view of those difficult times

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
and the bounds to which it is combined

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
for the Secretary and Andrew

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
to send it to the party's question

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
to space while other people know

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
of how to make the party call all other people,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
others,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
and other other witnesses.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
We're back to the Council.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
There's a lot of each other,

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I'll pull the final word already,

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
but then the McCaffee.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Let's send it to the party.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
I make this observation for what I consider

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
the benefit of all of the further order

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
of procedures of this year.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
We must bear in mind

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
that the word competency

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
with respect to evidence

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
is not a part of the room

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
with respect to the year,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
only the word materiality

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
and relevancy.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
The word competency

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
was purposely omitted

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
from the room's accuracy

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
and the room's accuracy was discussed

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
by a time who was dominating

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
the room's accuracy.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
The next testimony might be material

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
or evidence,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
and yet it would be

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
a competent unit through the road,

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
so we must bear that in mind

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
as we conduct these proceedings.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
What's part of that?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
What's part of that?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
The discussion from the party.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I'm sure this will say

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
it's quite a word.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Wow!

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
You got what?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
You're right.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
It is my understanding.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
From Washington,

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
the mutual network is bringing you on

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
the spot coverage of the McCarthy Army hearing.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Our coverage will continue

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
after this 10-second pause

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
for station identification.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
This is the mutual broadcasting system.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
7-10-0-W-R-N-Y-R.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Back in Washington,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
the mutual's coverage

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
of the McCarthy Army hearing.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
The wetness is the secretary of the Army

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Robert T. Stevens.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Is it mythical in this proceedings?

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Provided that witnesses will be called

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
later to collaborate or to testify

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
as to the statements made by the first party.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Is that correct?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
What's correct?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And the council has pointed out

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
that in this instance we have a witness

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
who is checking the testify.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
And it's a question I'd rather be directed to him.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Yes, but I don't want to be confused on the rules,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
and that's why I make these lawyers wear that out of state.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
In this case, the justice system.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
The guilty testimony is certainly

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
composed in an inquiry of this measure

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
in an instance where the principal party involved

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
must necessarily rely upon the victims' podium

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
by his departments that he supported.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And in instances where the actual bombat

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
and the phrase is entitled to

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
that has been the room following this rough thought

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
carrying a purpose,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
some of the members are certainly the empowers.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
When he first revealed his time to state

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
what was voting by his sources of members of his best,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
my point is that a purpose, a purpose,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
is particularly in fact concerned.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
It is directed at the secretary of the Army

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
to determine whether or not

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
the ship now seems to be making good use of the French car.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
That does not lie within the public

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
with the secretary of the Army

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
and liars within the public with this committee.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
I really am glad to say,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
when one hundred percent years ago,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
specifically as far as I've heard in here,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I'm aware of the idea that perhaps

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
there should now be a role in hearing this is Mr. Car.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Very likely you're there for asking,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
is there a secretary should be consigned

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
to watch this thing he's saying he heard Mr. Car say,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
and I say Mr. Secretary of State,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
that he did not seem in a cream-bell answer

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
if he used to travel to the port.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm going to put it on a board.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
A hundred percent book is my point of view.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Yesterday there was a great deal of

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
that all I had is the file of the case.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Great many questions were asked as to see

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
with respect to Mr. Car.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
The council for Mr. Steven pointed out

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
that under the verge of this committee of the council

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
he had worked very well his night

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
without him to see when the president of my

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
president was based on the way he said it,

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
and to see himself as made the child.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Now there it was,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
and then he had gotten them up and checked them in

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
and wrapped in the first paragraph

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
that included the name of Mr. Car,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
but that of a car being Mr. Car.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Mr. Steven said that he was not far

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
exactly on what it was said.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Now what I would like that is,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
in his life as Mr. Wells has,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
and as the statement in effect has stated,

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
that finally the reason for Mr. Car being in the charge

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
was because of what Mr. Allen

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
related to Mr. Car against the security relationship,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
then why is this car for Mr. Steven to bring that up

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
as he distracted the matter,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
as the statement works,

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
as I'm not a lawyer,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
although I believe I will be one before the terrible case.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But nevertheless, I like to add,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
what's wrong about that point?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
And some of the findings of it is,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
cover for Mr. Steven's estate,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
that in the cooperation of these charges,

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
and the influence of Mr. Car as a party in the interest,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
is a live-up on what he considered reliable information.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
But I do not think it is proper for him to say,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
what the information must propose,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
witnesses are available,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
just to keep the thing that is not for us,

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
sir.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
When, in order to file a file on the situation,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
where we have a witness in the pool of a witness,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
we need a file file to be situated

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
as Mr. Steven to sign a file file.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
Mr. Carman, do you have any other way to file?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Is that the reason why I can't?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Is that the right answer?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Mr. Carman, is the right answer?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Mr. Carman, is the chairman of the Parliament?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Mr. Carman, is that a self-sufficient term?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Mr. Carman, is the new point of order?

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Yes, the room where I will put your thumb into it,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
when you have the point of order to control

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
if they can do it before the order.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Mr. Carman, is the right answer?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
The right answer is the right answer,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
if you have the right answer, then you can.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
It's clear out.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Well, the point of order is on the territory of the Parliament.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
And the chairman, is the right answer?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Make the point of order.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I would like to make the point of order,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
but, now, for I'm sure,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I would wait on it for the day,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
so I think I'm closing the next one to here,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
as my anticipation.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Mr. Steven, those asked about the guilty innocence of Mr. Carman,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
that's car that is not correct,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
that Mr. Steven has left the simple fact,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
that he's right-by-light, and about a third,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and on October 2nd,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
I don't think it's up to Mr. Steven to pass upon

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
guilty innocence that such is involved in this day.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
I think, therefore, his deviation

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
was highly improper,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
and, as Mr. Steven said,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
the courted murder share,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
please now it's so advised,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
so that he's fit to the answering the questions

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
we can play one of this,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
and I'll have to go ahead and move.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Mr. Chairman,

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
I have an intent that my question would say,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
that's a conference.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
I, and I want to ask the Secretary,

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
as to what conversation took place between Mr. Car and Mr. Radams,

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
because Mr. Radams will be a witness for the committee.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
I would like to ask you this, Mr. Secretary.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Mr. Col, in your bill of particular,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
you stated that Mr. Col,

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
contacted you many times,

14:27.000 --> 14:35.000
regarding private time and effort to secure certain advantages

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
for Mr. John Waldion.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Now, Mr. Col, as an individual,

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
thinking of human or better treatment for his friends,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
would that be an improper action?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
In my opinion, it would,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
as an individual,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
whether it be boy or boy or boy,

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
they'd be a kind of a victim of normal gas.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It was not.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Well, he was too counsel for this committee.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I think, you know,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
I've been seeking this to decorate,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
as an individual,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
or an individual,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
or an individual,

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
asking you for a better treatment for his friends,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
they've done.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Now, that action itself,

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
would that be an improper act,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
if pursued, unreasonable act?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I think it would be.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Now, using the Secretary,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
that gets worked for me by Senator McConnell,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
as an individual,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
not a general committee,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
but as a political person,

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
asking for a better treatment for a safe job,

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
you consider that an improper act.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I think it was the most unusual action,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
and it's a part of the instances

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
that I've testified to here,

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
in which Senator McCarthy was involved.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
But we must also bear in mind,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
that, as I think I've indicated before,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
that a great deal,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
a major portion of this pressure,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
was coming from home,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
was coming from home, as I viewed him,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
as chief counsel of this committee,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
under the chairman,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
just the chairman of McCarthy.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
That is just a great thing to do,

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
and this is a record of eight.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Chairman, for the order.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
For the order of eight,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
for any part of that,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
directly at that time,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
directly at the center of the public's mother.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm sure that some of the parties

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
are going to do it,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
and just as many of the statements,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
any expressiveness,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
which I have been asked,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
and for special privilege for sure.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I believe I've said a lot less.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I believe I've said a lot less.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
No, I know you haven't done a new request,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
and directly at this point,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
the world will lay around,

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
and we'll appear every day,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
as part of the policy in Georgia,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
and then they continue to send the positive.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Good. Very good.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Honest, there's inspector.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Am I correct in stating that a gentleman thinks?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
That's the,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
a length that's activity

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
by sentimentality and sentimentality.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
The sentimentality is difficult.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I know you're right.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
The government is on the island.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
As a man has, as a representative of the,

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
how's the investigating problem of the town?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Whether the man,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
whether the man was an individual,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
or not,

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
is that your convention yesterday?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Now, Mr. Secretary,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
the public target that has been made

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
by Senator Murphy and Mr. Cohn,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
and Mr. Cohn,

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
that you, the Honour,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
use Mr. Cohn as a,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
as a officer,

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
in order to portray only investigation.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
As far as I know,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
now you're that,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
first is that allegation to a law,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
a law.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Now, it will be,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
every country is discussing for several days,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
many times before,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
but the question is all to self-induced.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Is too fast?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
First,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
the allegation made by the Honour,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
that Senator McCarthy,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Roy Cohn, and Mr. Cohn,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
not as individuals,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
but as a weapon of any,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
the weapon of the United States Senate,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
the investigate law of Congress,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
but unusual pressure

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
over on the Army in order to

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
secure their federal statements,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
on behalf of Dave John.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
On the other hand,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
the charge made by Senator McCarthy

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
with the call and the call,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
the fact that the Army,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
members of personnel in the Army,

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
have used Mr. Cohn as a,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
as a tool,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
in order to,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
in order to hold

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
the investigation of the murders

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
that fought them off.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Now, is that,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
as you think,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
the essence that core

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
of this particular area,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
is not the waking marathon.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I think,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
if you have permission to sign a follow-up,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I'd like to have a look at that question,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
because of the,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
if you have,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't know if I can answer,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
even after true words.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
No, sure,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
we're meeting,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
you may make those times,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
but I could say,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
you can't evaluate it yet.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Be quiet,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
we'll meet you.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It wasn't a long time.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I'm sorry.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Charm Leigh, an official

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
not to be taken out

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
of some of the murders times,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
so if you'll stop the

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
assault rifle,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
right?

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
The Lincoln's Life Matter Potter.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Now, in other words,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
here we have been attempting

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
for several days,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
mainly technical points,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
but the question resolved

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
to jump into these two faves.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Bird,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
the allegation made by the Army

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
that Senator McCartney

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Roy Gronin is in the car,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
the county's individuals,

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
but as represented in the

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
United States Senate,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
the investigating arm of fire,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
for the unusual pressure

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
on the Army,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
in order to ensure

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
a professional

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
agreement on the guy's

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
big time.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
On the other hand,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
the charge made by Senator McCartney,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Mr. Caw,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
and Mr. Caw,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
the fact that the Army,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
members of the personnel of the Army,

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
have used many times

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
of the assault,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
in order to hold the investigation

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
of the drill,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
the report's mama.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Now, as I see it,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
that is the evidence

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
before the investigation.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
This particular girl,

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
and it is not

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
we are wasting a lot of time.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Mr. Caw,

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
you can do it before,

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
you can do it before,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
without any suspecting.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Well, I think,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
if I say that,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
it's a very big question,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Senator Potter,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
and I don't know that it's,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
that it's up to me,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
to testify,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
or it seems to me,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
that the committee,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
on my point of history,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
is that,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
if we are waiting,

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
maybe time,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
or the members of this committee,

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
and many members

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
of the Department of the Army,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
do everything,

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
what do I do

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
that do,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
giants,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
or what's the Democratic

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
that deals,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
that is,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
and that's in the court,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
unless,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
unless,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
they,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
it was used,

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
to,

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
see,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
power and the authority

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
will set us,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
and it's used,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
which is a serious thing,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
or what,

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
they go,

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
get through from the Army,

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
and it's used,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
they're public's rough,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
and order to,

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
to keep them

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
having investigate.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Now, as to the,

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
the various,

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
chipcats between various members

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
of this committee,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
the committee staff,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
the members of the Army,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
are,

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
this,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
his own fault,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
his own fault,

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
and this,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
in my face,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
the time,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
this,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
right,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
is individual,

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
follow all of you,

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
or follow,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
members of the Army,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
you will get better

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
between voice friends

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
and a big star,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
I mean,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
as we talk about

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
something�

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
that,

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
this committee can be concerned,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
or we can be concerned

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
with the fact

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
that some of them

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
are present,

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
and many thoughts

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
are present,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
the only thought,

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
the only thought,

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
where I can see that,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
it would be a,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
of important for the committee,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
if the power and the indomit

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
of the committee has been

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
used in power,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
and by the same role,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
yes, the honor,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
and he was there,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
uh,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
front of all,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
in properly ignored,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
from the caucus room,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
as the Senate Office Building

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
in Washington,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
the issue has been bringing

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
you special coverage

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
of the Congressional hearings,

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
and Senator Joseph

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I. McCarty is discused

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
with high official

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
of the Army.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
The hearings are being conducted

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
before the Senate's

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
permanent subcommittee

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
on investigations,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
with Senator Carly

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Martin of South Dakota

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
presiding

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
as the temporary chairman.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
The witness is still

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Secretary of the Army,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Robert T. Steven,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
who is undergoing round

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
after round

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
of sharp-coff examination,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
by the seven members

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
of the committee,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
by the committee council,

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Raid Jenkins,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
of Knoxville,

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Tennessee,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
and by Senator McCarty himself.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
This morning's session,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
has been in a rusted

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
frequent lay on points

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
of order,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
leading times to

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
for-long legal

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
rangering,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
and sometimes the

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
flaming of plurring

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
of temper.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Newspapers, your network

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
for news,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
will be back with more

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
on the stop coverage

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
of these hearings this afternoon,

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
over many of these stations.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
He's going to have to wait.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Or else,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
you're going to have to

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
do it.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
This is Sam,

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
and I thought the

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
inquiry was directed

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
to the question

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
of who will be the name

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
with this,

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
that,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
when I'm wrong,

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
I think the committee

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
will be the nickname

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
with this,

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
if that's with,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
when I'm not the first

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
of my quite significant

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
recordification

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
of this case,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I'll fill up

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
from Plankin,

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I'll recall it,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
file 5A,

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Army,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
and signed by Mr.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Wilkins,

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
the council,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
just the volume of the

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
key to which

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
witnesses will check

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
the file

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
from the Army,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
regarding the allocating,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
internal act,

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
one through

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
29,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
that was not only

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
a point,

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I couldn't tell

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
that we need to be

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
allocating

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
what is the

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
out of the table

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
to my evidence.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Our first

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
piece of allocating

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
for a while

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
was this by the

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
chairman,

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
and I was just trying

24:48.000 --> 24:48.000


24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
of the letters

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
from the assistant.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
So I've made my

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
point,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I hope that this

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
is running in the floor.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I hope that we,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
sometimes,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
are broad-minded

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
with respect to the legal

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
technicalities

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
that's been being

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
provided

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
to have further success

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
in obtaining the truth.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Now,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
yesterday,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
there was some testimony

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
and I would like to read

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
it on my time.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Mr. Jenkins,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Mr. Stevens,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
did you ever have

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
your board of

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
work taken with Mr.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
G. Davis-Chine?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Secretary

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Stevens, well,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
a lot of the

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
drivers are around

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
down there hearing,

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
and it could be.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Mr. Jenkins,

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
did you ever

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
suggest in the meeting

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
anywhere eight times

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
they are

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
once my picture taken

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
with David

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Chine.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Now, I call

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
attention to the next

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
question.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Mr. Jenkins,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
I did not say

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
demand, but what is your

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
picture after David

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Chine was drafted,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
ever taken with you

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
alone at your

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
suggestion anyway,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
and I'm not

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
sure if it's

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
a good idea to

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
say that,

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
but I'm not sure

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
if it's a good idea

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
to say that,

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
but I'm sure

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I've never made a

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
statement just

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
like you made it there.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I'm eating it

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
with a picture being

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
taken and there were

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
people around,

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I might be very

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
slow.

25:59.000 --> 26:19.000
Nothing,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
I set ground

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
provisions.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.860
An

26:26.440 --> 26:27.860
Council

26:27.860 --> 26:45.920
51

26:45.920 --> 27:05.900
a

27:05.900 --> 27:29.900
figures

27:29.900 --> 27:38.900
My impression is that you found that Mr. Carr in effect was before he missed a call because he was with him. Is that correct?

27:38.900 --> 27:39.900
Yes sir.

27:39.900 --> 27:45.900
You do not remember whether he did or did not actually participate in the conversation. Is that correct?

27:45.900 --> 27:47.900
I talked for a call.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.900
I thought you cannot afford a call.

27:49.900 --> 27:57.900
You think that the question of Mr. Carr's participation can be handled by subsequent listeners based on the charges.

27:57.900 --> 27:59.900
Is that correct? Yes sir.

27:59.900 --> 28:01.900
I have no further questions. Mr. Chairman of the chair.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.900
Oh, yes sir.

28:03.900 --> 28:12.900
May I introduce you to Mr. Bayland, Mr. Senator Sainton with respect to the pictures introduced yesterday.

28:12.900 --> 28:18.900
How does the secretary of Mr. Sainton like to say this?

28:18.900 --> 28:31.900
That he featured the original form with him in the lead by an actor's party in interest.

28:31.900 --> 28:41.900
How does the picture is represented to which a program of the secretary of the private shine?

28:41.900 --> 28:46.900
No information, no information was made.

28:46.900 --> 28:54.900
The picture has been utilized and changed sir. All of us are the anyone's picture and the taken out is.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.900
Here's what we need to make sure this paper is this tax.

28:59.900 --> 29:06.900
To a tax, I am prepared now to small one of the experts.

29:06.900 --> 29:10.900
I need to do a tax and I'm going to do a tax.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.900
Mr. Chairman, I think that's the case.

29:12.900 --> 29:21.900
Done without delay as soon as we get to look back to the picture situation because I think this committee has the right to know where the picture came from.

29:22.900 --> 29:30.900
We have agreed that the army must produce and I just then they have offered to produce.

29:30.900 --> 29:37.900
The departure for the original picture, I think the same rule should apply with equal force.

29:37.900 --> 29:42.900
If any attempt to authenticate is met as possible, the picture of yesterday.

29:43.900 --> 29:46.900
If you were the one who registered with the director, you know what the picture is.

29:46.900 --> 29:52.900
I am the one who said it is and it asks that the chairman and all the members of the committee come to that.

29:52.900 --> 29:56.900
That I should have the same desire as this moment.

29:56.900 --> 30:03.900
I think it will take some water and the chairman to say that the president is under which that picture was taken.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.900
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I'm in the party.

30:06.900 --> 30:09.900
Yes, sir. I agree with that. I agree with that.

30:10.900 --> 30:17.900
Mr. Chairman, the chairman and all the members of the committee have been calling forward a light to come to the chair.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.900
Mr. Chairman, please give Mr. World a 10 minutes.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.900
It's kind of a good 10 minutes and then the president is the other.

30:23.900 --> 30:25.900
Mr. World, you can't even fully accept it.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.900
Mr. Chairman, please give it a go.

30:27.900 --> 30:30.900
Mr. Chairman, I have to give my question.

30:30.900 --> 30:32.900
I agree with the committee.

30:32.900 --> 30:34.900
Senator Boyton, 10 minutes.

30:34.900 --> 30:38.900
Secretary, if you would like to get today, that's the activities of the committee.

30:38.900 --> 30:50.900
In that getting started on the committee, I expedited the first of the party to hold the work together to clarity where to share that work with mom.

30:50.900 --> 30:55.900
I would like to know what everybody knows where this committee is.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.900
Thank you very much.
