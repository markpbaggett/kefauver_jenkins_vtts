WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.200
And uh, whatever we learn, one area we apply on another, and uh, I think that we are doing

00:09.200 --> 00:13.460
a constantly better job than the area of, of the burning house, the person.

00:13.460 --> 00:20.140
The youth have already, uh, whether you have exposed the, the many specific instruments

00:20.140 --> 00:23.140
and security risks in other installations.

00:23.140 --> 00:26.140
I don't think that is best, I have information.

00:26.940 --> 00:28.140
Well, I'd have to check that out.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.140
I'm going to push that.

00:29.140 --> 00:30.140
I've got a foil.

00:30.140 --> 00:34.620
You have been created for the kind of your statements that the morale of the army has

00:34.620 --> 00:39.380
been adversely affected by the activities that force the amount of the explosion.

00:39.380 --> 00:45.380
The development of the better of the security risks, I think that there is a situation

00:45.380 --> 00:49.740
may be improved here, but surely it's a part of the, the part of the army has been

00:49.740 --> 00:52.820
concerned by the emphasis with the amount of people that use the gun, uh,

00:52.820 --> 00:58.260
assuring those who are too defective, who show up, they work by your department in

00:58.260 --> 01:01.220
exposing the elements in other installations.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.220
Can you do that?

01:02.220 --> 01:07.620
Well, I think that, uh, we've done an increasingly better job throughout the department of the

01:07.620 --> 01:13.260
army in all of our installations and in all of our units in finding security risks

01:13.260 --> 01:17.260
or subversives and taking the final action with respect to them.

01:17.260 --> 01:21.700
And there's been a lot of, uh, testimony in my guide to that before the armed services

01:21.700 --> 01:22.700
are committed in the Senate.

01:22.700 --> 01:30.100
You can spend a stroll in that very vast, uh, persons, uh, where the units that are

01:30.100 --> 01:33.100
engaged in, uh, have their, uh, boy mama.

01:33.100 --> 01:37.700
I'll have 20 points specifically to any other agencies where, uh,

01:37.700 --> 01:40.700
separation is not been exposed in other installations.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.700
That was a possible, but I'd like to get the actual facts before I attempt to serve.

01:44.700 --> 01:49.580
But you think that clearly, uh, investigation can benefit the fire of a sub-deleteate boy

01:49.580 --> 01:51.580
that was on the side of the party.

01:51.580 --> 01:55.580
Saturday was back upon the activities with the army and other persons.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.580
I think we're doing a better job.

01:57.580 --> 02:04.580
We do recognize, unfortunately, essentially, uh, uh, exposing the strict policies and the

02:04.580 --> 02:09.580
sub-agendas because that's the place to, uh, the popular global management.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.580
The army is ready.

02:11.580 --> 02:17.580
Uh, certainly we have to be assured in every way that the army installations are free

02:17.580 --> 02:20.580
by the means of sub-ersion.

02:20.580 --> 02:25.580
I recognize that it's a completely centered war shack and I started on my very first day

02:25.580 --> 02:29.580
in office to do something about it and I just had a relentlessly ever since and intend

02:29.580 --> 02:30.580
to continue that.

02:30.580 --> 02:33.580
And there's an agreement I've presented for many years.

02:33.580 --> 02:36.580
It's all about taking the liberty of the activity to just the media for it.

02:36.580 --> 02:42.580
My love, you make criticized the prosujo methods, but you do a move highly of any work

02:42.580 --> 02:46.580
which was done by any congressional committee to expose each the person.

02:46.580 --> 02:47.580
And I do.

02:47.580 --> 02:51.580
And you intend to continue to the best of your ability and the maximum capacity of the

02:51.580 --> 02:56.580
person of the army to give assurances to the American people that the army is in free

02:56.580 --> 02:58.580
and support you as it is possible to be.

02:58.580 --> 02:59.580
That's correct.

02:59.580 --> 03:04.580
Mr. Ralph, have you, you have had this?

03:04.580 --> 03:05.580
Thank you, sir.

03:05.580 --> 03:06.580
I don't think I needed it this moment.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.580
I'll pass for this moment.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.580
Sir, I'm happy you're on Mr. Column.

03:40.580 --> 03:41.580
I'm happy, no?

03:41.580 --> 03:42.580
Column is broadly as nice.

03:42.580 --> 03:46.580
You know, Brian, why is Column a photographer, Stanley, who is the leader of the committee

03:46.580 --> 03:50.580
and the television people who are under the energy complaining that all they get is

03:50.580 --> 03:52.580
the facts that the pictures of the truck.

03:52.580 --> 03:57.580
Now, they have a building and will you please take your pictures and give it all?

03:57.580 --> 03:59.580
I'm a nearly no-seated situation.

03:59.580 --> 04:00.580
That's a no-one.

04:00.580 --> 04:04.580
Now, there's a fourth man.

04:04.580 --> 04:07.580
There's one car off.

04:07.580 --> 04:11.580
I notice Mr. Ralph's objective to the third man being cut off.

04:11.580 --> 04:15.580
There's only objection to the army's desire of having cut off the fourth man.

04:15.580 --> 04:20.580
I take it that size of a picture of a car, that size of this picture.

04:20.580 --> 04:25.580
You don't plan the car to be cut off because the fourth man is cut off.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.580
Let me answer this now.

04:28.580 --> 04:35.580
If you take off the third man, does that seem to cut up into a wide u-room?

04:35.580 --> 04:39.580
Yes, sir.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.580
It does.

04:41.580 --> 04:45.580
It does in the Sunsenor of McCarthy that yesterday Mr. Jenkins asked me the question

04:45.580 --> 04:52.580
and it surprised me very much if I had my picture taken with David Shion,

04:52.580 --> 04:54.580
along with him.

04:54.580 --> 04:58.580
But my memory was possibly not too good on that point.

04:58.580 --> 05:02.580
He immediately refreshed my memory with the production of that picture.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.580
Let me answer this.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.580
The man that took this picture was not a trust photographer.

05:06.580 --> 05:08.580
This was taken of McGuire or Dave.

05:08.580 --> 05:14.580
The only photographer who's frozen for the Army and listed the photography structure.

05:14.580 --> 05:18.580
I don't know how imaginable the airport was an airport space.

05:18.580 --> 05:24.580
You know how old the bones were, but why not take the pictures of Donald and the Army

05:24.580 --> 05:26.580
and let's go request it to do so?

05:26.580 --> 05:31.580
But they went around like the men here in the 20s to take pictures of that real, really.

05:31.580 --> 05:36.580
I can't remember having had the top-materials, but to have my picture taken,

05:36.580 --> 05:40.580
so in the other sense, it's been 40 years, I've got my 30,000 times.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.580
But now, I look much more at you actually.

05:43.580 --> 05:48.580
I assume Mr. Shion, my understand that seems to change, or, or, or, or, but,

05:48.580 --> 05:51.580
I assume Mr. Shion got the picture from the Army.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.580
Do you know whether they, when you request a lift,

05:54.580 --> 06:00.580
or they really got a ticket in front and Mr. Adams or whether he also has a third and fourth man on him?

06:00.580 --> 06:04.580
I'm not serious. I don't, I can't ask that question. I don't know what he got.

06:04.580 --> 06:07.580
Otherwise, you know that someone from the Army,

06:07.580 --> 06:11.580
Mr. Shion, the photograph, and I can understand how he would be proud.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.580
If I have a Army having a picture taken with the secretary,

06:14.580 --> 06:18.580
I can understand when he finds that why he would not put on,

06:18.580 --> 06:21.580
I don't know this, but I'll put it out on his over here.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.580
If I'm second, then he might start with a satellite.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.580
You, you're playing, you're playing, lad.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.580
As of now, you don't remember asking the proprietor to take the picture.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.580
I certainly do.

06:33.580 --> 06:36.580
You don't remember asking, I do not remember asking.

06:36.580 --> 06:41.580
As far as I'm taking off, the fourth man who's taken off by the Army Department,

06:41.580 --> 06:45.580
the fourth man who's either taken off by Mr. Shion or someone else,

06:45.580 --> 06:47.580
as far as from where it is this picture,

06:47.580 --> 06:51.580
this picture is actually going to do to you after it was won today.

06:51.580 --> 06:54.580
Well, I don't think I'm going to say anything about the picture,

06:55.580 --> 06:57.580
or the one about the doctor.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.580
Well, I'd like to see them.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.580
Would you examine those two, Mr. Secretary?

07:01.580 --> 07:03.580
Examine the picture of you and Shion.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.580
Tell me whether they've any got things,

07:05.580 --> 07:08.580
except I believe here, little less of your leg on one of them,

07:08.580 --> 07:11.580
the other, little less of Mr. Shion's taken one of the other.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.580
Other than that, is there any change in the picture?

07:14.580 --> 07:16.580
Let me, let me, let me say that,

07:16.580 --> 07:21.580
I don't think there's any improper with your cutting your picture taken with Mr. Shion or anyone else.

07:21.580 --> 07:23.580
The view of the practice matters,

07:23.580 --> 07:27.580
well, it's up this morning, I think the picture is doing a good sum of details.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.580
Let me check, I didn't get the question.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.580
It's a question before me. I like to know a lot of it here.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.580
If it's a question, I will be the question.

07:36.580 --> 07:40.580
The question is Mr. Secretary,

07:40.580 --> 07:43.580
and if you have your age, let's back down so I can speak it.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.580
Okay, okay.

07:46.580 --> 07:48.580
The question is,

07:48.580 --> 07:51.580
if I was cutting off the picture,

07:51.580 --> 07:53.580
then we'd cut off a picture by the end of the program.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.580
I assume it's not bad.

07:55.580 --> 07:58.580
And if I was cutting off the third man,

07:58.580 --> 08:04.580
so did I cut off by Mr. Shion or someone like many would find that I believe,

08:04.580 --> 08:06.580
what they can tell them this man,

08:06.580 --> 08:08.580
if I was to them,

08:08.580 --> 08:11.580
is the picture of you and Mr. Shion's completely accurate,

08:11.580 --> 08:14.580
is there any doubt in any way?

08:14.580 --> 08:16.580
I'd have to examine closely.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.580
I'd say that they're looking at it quickly,

08:18.580 --> 08:20.580
but that's probably true.

08:20.580 --> 08:21.580
It's not a democracy,

08:21.580 --> 08:23.580
so that's the bit that it leads to really accurate.

08:23.580 --> 08:26.580
But I think over looked the measure,

08:26.580 --> 08:28.580
how were the pictures,

08:28.580 --> 08:32.580
which is that it was introduced on the basis that I had for a picture of the senator

08:32.580 --> 08:35.580
with Shion alone.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.580
I have no recollection of the pictures,

08:38.580 --> 08:40.580
but I think it's a picture.

08:40.580 --> 08:42.580
And the picture that the other picture here is money,

08:42.580 --> 08:44.580
for the picture is not the case.

08:44.580 --> 08:45.580
That's what they say,

08:45.580 --> 08:48.580
the value of your picture was trying to roll with another kernel.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.580
Five lines between that and that doesn't concern me.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.580
I think it's been probably all.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.580
I think you're entitled to your picture taken before you want it.

08:56.580 --> 09:01.580
But do you think that having another kernel in the picture,

09:01.580 --> 09:05.580
having another kernel in the other side of the price,

09:05.580 --> 09:07.580
if anyone's by the term on the other,

09:07.580 --> 09:11.580
does that decrease the significance or increase the significance of the company?

09:11.580 --> 09:14.580
I think it increases the significance of what's happening here,

09:14.580 --> 09:16.580
tremendous for it.

09:16.580 --> 09:18.580
Because it shows that somebody has taken it upon themselves

09:18.580 --> 09:21.580
that the information is going to come before this committee.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.580
So how about the other thing you would say about that?

09:23.580 --> 09:26.580
Who does that, you know?

09:26.580 --> 09:28.580
I have no idea who that other one is.

09:28.580 --> 09:30.580
It might be Senator McCarty.

09:30.580 --> 09:32.580
No?

09:32.580 --> 09:34.580
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.580
That's a good idea.

09:38.580 --> 09:41.580
Mr. Smith, the comments that were not the same as the time

09:41.580 --> 09:43.580
and perhaps the chair'll be a girl like this morning

09:43.580 --> 09:46.580
and bearing to repeat the committee rules.

09:46.580 --> 09:49.580
And it's pretty generally understood I'm sure about.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.580
Those who have noticed anything about the committee's station

09:52.580 --> 09:55.580
chair, there ought to be no manifestations of a proposal

09:55.580 --> 09:59.580
or disapproval at any time in any way from the other.

10:00.580 --> 10:02.580
The officers have a standing order

10:02.580 --> 10:06.580
to polite the express from the rule and people violating that rule.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.580
I would not join the enforcement guidelines

10:08.580 --> 10:11.580
and not only accept the officers during the force assessment.

10:11.580 --> 10:15.580
Which I would rate the authorities to have these decisions heard

10:15.580 --> 10:19.580
or they'd be remembered as guests who are all happy to have you here.

10:19.580 --> 10:22.580
But you must comply with the committee rules.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.580
And I'm a guy, about all my time, about all my time.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.580
Mr. Stephen, you said this right away,

10:29.580 --> 10:31.580
but you might run all of them because I was there,

10:31.580 --> 10:34.580
but you followed fire for over a couple of seconds.

10:34.580 --> 10:37.580
I noticed this was not my habit of taking it.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.580
So let me ask you this, you have actually shared man beings

10:40.580 --> 10:42.580
that are all, I can see where you were.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.580
I think that's a little bit of gentleman's deck.

10:44.580 --> 10:46.580
Do you have actually thought man beings that are,

10:46.580 --> 10:48.580
I think we should find out from the photographer first,

10:48.580 --> 10:50.580
or whether or not that is the size of the fill

10:50.580 --> 10:52.580
and the first exactly where it's cut off automatically.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.580
I think that's a good idea.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.580
Mr. Secretary, I guess that you said the other guy that

10:57.580 --> 11:00.580
you wanted to get the hearing from a friend,

11:00.580 --> 11:03.580
you have to succeed in the last, have you not?

11:03.580 --> 11:06.580
You have to succeed in getting the hearing

11:06.580 --> 11:09.580
in a coming of individual questions and the military

11:09.580 --> 11:10.580
and the family.

11:10.580 --> 11:13.580
This is the first to complete out of the day, but not.

11:13.580 --> 11:17.580
I don't know how much you would think that time,

11:17.580 --> 11:18.580
but I probably would.

11:18.580 --> 11:22.580
You testify to the day that you, one of the most family hearing

11:22.580 --> 11:24.580
in a coming in to the official November.

11:24.580 --> 11:27.580
I said that as the day of the test, it's complete.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.580
They're convicted for spending.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.580
Do you think?

11:31.580 --> 11:33.580
I don't know whether they are or not.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.580
But you said you wanted to hear me suspended.

11:35.580 --> 11:38.580
I have filmed that George Comett, he is still active,

11:38.580 --> 11:41.580
you said you made a special point the other day,

11:41.580 --> 11:43.580
so I did not want the investigation suspended.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.580
I wanted to hear you suspended.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.580
You know what I have been on hearing?

11:48.580 --> 11:49.580
Thank you.

11:49.580 --> 11:53.580
Thank you all for this, you should be a fast-referring

11:53.580 --> 11:55.580
with your phone, with your sharing myself.

11:55.580 --> 11:58.580
But if you haven't successful, then I don't regard that.

11:58.580 --> 12:00.580
It's successful at all.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.580
Well, let's see.

12:01.580 --> 12:03.580
You want to hear me suspended, right?

12:03.580 --> 12:06.580
I wanted the type of hearing change.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.580
When I used to be able to do that, you wanted them suspended.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.580
Are you changing that, personally?

12:10.580 --> 12:12.580
I wanted to have this.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.580
I was, I stated it several times yesterday,

12:14.580 --> 12:16.580
and I'll say it again.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.580
But I wanted to have the constant hammering of the army

12:19.580 --> 12:22.580
over the head with respect to Fort Monmouth,

12:22.580 --> 12:26.580
stop because it was creating an impression

12:26.580 --> 12:28.580
in the minds of the American people,

12:28.580 --> 12:33.580
as well as the army that was not a fair or accurate picture.

12:33.580 --> 12:37.580
Mr. Secretary, all the things you said yesterday

12:37.580 --> 12:39.580
are what they can do.

12:39.580 --> 12:41.580
I tried to do it in the right way,

12:41.580 --> 12:45.580
but yesterday you answered Mr. Dengue's question.

12:45.580 --> 12:48.580
You said that you didn't want to stop the hearing,

12:48.580 --> 12:50.580
but you wanted me hearing you suspended.

12:50.580 --> 12:51.580
It's magic.

12:51.580 --> 12:55.580
If you insist, I'll be glad to go through the test room, dig it out.

12:55.580 --> 12:57.580
I said that I thought the state,

12:57.580 --> 13:01.580
Fort Monmouth hearing, it served its purpose and tributes as well.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.580
And that we would carry it on,

13:03.580 --> 13:06.580
we would make progress reports to you,

13:06.580 --> 13:08.580
that there wasn't satisfactory investigation

13:08.580 --> 13:10.580
but they continued anyway on your part,

13:10.580 --> 13:12.580
on part of the story,

13:12.580 --> 13:14.580
and that you come right back into the picture.

13:14.580 --> 13:17.580
The problem has been a very simple question.

13:17.580 --> 13:22.580
Did you yesterday say that you wanted to have the hearing

13:22.580 --> 13:24.580
suspended?

13:24.580 --> 13:26.580
I said that I wanted to have the hearing.

13:26.580 --> 13:28.580
You just know me yesterday, no?

13:28.580 --> 13:30.580
Let's look up the record.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.580
Don't you remember?

13:32.580 --> 13:33.580
I was talking to a client,

13:33.580 --> 13:35.580
and there's a great funny thing with that thing

13:35.580 --> 13:37.580
that I'm trying to remember

13:37.580 --> 13:40.580
as much I can as these questions come along

13:40.580 --> 13:43.580
and get out the facts right here in front of this committee.

13:43.580 --> 13:47.580
And I may not always be able to immediately answer

13:47.580 --> 13:49.580
to recall something as you are now

13:49.580 --> 13:52.580
as the senator has expired.

13:52.580 --> 13:55.580
The primary here is the agreement of the committee

13:55.580 --> 13:59.580
with chairman, when I was secretary of defense,

13:59.580 --> 14:01.580
if you will, the staff at that company

14:01.580 --> 14:03.580
will be accountable as you call it,

14:03.580 --> 14:05.580
but chairman has the best call of this time,

14:05.580 --> 14:07.580
Mr. Roy Cole.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.580
Mr. Cole comes with a campaign.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.580
He's a very good guy.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.580
We're going to found the first person on the atmosphere

14:31.580 --> 14:33.580
to get the truth to hold you down.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.580
Nothing much to do to help you, sir.

14:35.580 --> 14:36.580
I do, sir.

14:36.580 --> 14:37.580
You may be seated.

14:37.580 --> 14:39.580
I have a chance to be out.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.580
I have to ask the record indicate

14:41.580 --> 14:43.580
I am not represented by councilman.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.580
None of the various persons here

14:45.580 --> 14:47.580
is aged representing me in any way.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.580
I am here myself, and I am here to answer any question

14:49.580 --> 14:51.580
which Mr. Jenkins might have to ask of me.

14:51.580 --> 14:54.580
And I welcome an opportunity to state

14:54.580 --> 14:56.580
the circumstance of this picture

14:56.580 --> 14:59.580
and the fact that it was taken after request of Mr. Steven

14:59.580 --> 15:01.580
and as the other witnesses decore,

15:01.580 --> 15:02.580
to establish that fact.

15:02.580 --> 15:04.580
Constituency.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.580
For the purposes of identification

15:06.580 --> 15:08.580
you are Mr. Roy and Cole.

15:08.580 --> 15:09.580
Yes, sir.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.580
Council for this committee.

15:11.580 --> 15:12.580
That's right, Mr. Jenkins.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.580
Mr. Cole, since my apartment

15:14.580 --> 15:18.580
has a special attorney for this committee,

15:18.580 --> 15:21.580
I have sometimes,

15:21.580 --> 15:23.580
and to your office,

15:23.580 --> 15:25.580
it's consultation with you as other witnesses

15:25.580 --> 15:27.580
that you expect to introduce

15:27.580 --> 15:29.580
in an effort to ascertain

15:29.580 --> 15:31.580
your size of this controversy,

15:31.580 --> 15:33.580
is that not correct?

15:33.580 --> 15:35.580
Jenkins, you have ended a spin out of the fire

15:35.580 --> 15:37.580
to give the early facts,

15:37.580 --> 15:38.580
which is what we hope to establish

15:38.580 --> 15:40.580
and think I believe that life

15:40.580 --> 15:43.580
needs me as to the sessions

15:43.580 --> 15:45.580
were concluded about five DMs,

15:45.580 --> 15:48.580
I spent some three or three and a half hours in your office,

15:48.580 --> 15:50.580
as I have done all these things.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.580
Two years to that.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.580
I think once I've left my hand,

15:54.580 --> 15:55.580
I think for a side of so-and-you

15:55.580 --> 15:58.580
that I've prepared to Mr. Steven's

15:58.580 --> 16:01.580
or Mr. Adam's, Mr. Adam's

16:01.580 --> 16:03.580
rather this controversial first,

16:03.580 --> 16:06.580
and I've spent some four five days in consultation

16:06.580 --> 16:09.580
with him and there witnesses at the Pentagon.

16:09.580 --> 16:12.580
That's it, so it has all been as far as you know,

16:12.580 --> 16:14.580
and as far as I know,

16:14.580 --> 16:16.580
opening a board out my class

16:16.580 --> 16:18.580
for the purpose of ascertaining the facts

16:18.580 --> 16:19.580
is out not correct.

16:19.580 --> 16:22.580
Now that's Mr. Cole's

16:22.580 --> 16:24.580
day before yesterday,

16:24.580 --> 16:26.580
perhaps late in the afternoon,

16:26.580 --> 16:27.580
in the evening,

16:27.580 --> 16:30.580
you and I have a considerable conference

16:30.580 --> 16:32.580
that may not affect

16:32.580 --> 16:35.580
with respect to your tributes

16:35.580 --> 16:38.580
against Mr. Steven's and Mr. Adam.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.580
Is that correct?

16:39.580 --> 16:40.580
Yes, sir.

16:40.580 --> 16:43.580
I ask you whether or not in that conference,

16:43.580 --> 16:45.580
a meeting of the time,

16:45.580 --> 16:47.580
or perhaps all the time,

16:47.580 --> 16:48.580
Mr. Frank powder is present

16:48.580 --> 16:50.580
and Mr. James Union,

16:50.580 --> 16:52.580
and myself and you,

16:52.580 --> 16:53.580
I believe that's correct.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.580
I ask you whether or not Mr. Cole

16:56.580 --> 16:57.580
is doing that conference

16:57.580 --> 16:59.580
as a table for yesterday.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.580
You stated to me,

17:01.580 --> 17:02.580
excuse me, Mr. Jenkins,

17:02.580 --> 17:03.580
you say the day before yesterday,

17:03.580 --> 17:05.580
but I am not a conference

17:05.580 --> 17:06.580
as a table for yesterday.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.580
Yes, today is today is Tuesday.

17:07.580 --> 17:08.580
That's correct.

17:08.580 --> 17:09.580
I believe it was the end of last day.

17:09.580 --> 17:11.580
I think you have to ask your right about it

17:11.580 --> 17:13.580
because that's making it a big difference.

17:13.580 --> 17:14.580
Come in here.

17:14.580 --> 17:15.580
Come in here.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.580
Conference with Union

17:17.580 --> 17:19.580
and in my questioning,

17:19.580 --> 17:22.580
you respect to the allegations

17:22.580 --> 17:25.580
of the Democratic Committee against Mr. Steven's

17:25.580 --> 17:27.580
and Mr. Adams.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.580
You stated to me that on November 17th,

17:31.580 --> 17:33.580
and this inquiry is concerned,

17:33.580 --> 17:35.580
Mr. Cole, we understand,

17:35.580 --> 17:38.580
does the one issue now in controversy alone,

17:38.580 --> 17:40.580
and that is with respect to these photographs.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.580
You stated in the organization

17:43.580 --> 17:47.580
that Mr. Steven is the Secretary of the Army.

17:47.580 --> 17:48.580
On that date,

17:48.580 --> 17:49.580
the question is,

17:49.580 --> 17:51.580
David Shine, the before the draft,

17:51.580 --> 17:52.580
we'll meet.

17:52.580 --> 17:53.580
I stated that,

17:53.580 --> 17:54.580
and that's the fact that I will prove it.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.580
And give or not,

17:56.580 --> 17:59.580
you tell or any who will present the Democratic Union.

17:59.580 --> 18:00.580
I know them to say,

18:00.580 --> 18:01.580
Right.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.580
I believe I told you,

18:02.580 --> 18:04.580
some of the people who are present,

18:04.580 --> 18:06.580
I might have told you all of the people who are present.

18:06.580 --> 18:07.580
Is there not,

18:07.580 --> 18:10.580
you tell me that you have this documentary evidence

18:10.580 --> 18:12.580
in the part of my photograph

18:12.580 --> 18:14.580
to substantiate that statement?

18:14.580 --> 18:15.580
Mr. Zankas,

18:15.580 --> 18:16.580
I wonder if we could do it this way.

18:16.580 --> 18:18.580
Could I give you my recollection

18:18.580 --> 18:19.580
at exactly what I just did?

18:19.580 --> 18:20.580
I would love to be fine

18:20.580 --> 18:21.580
and would certainly encourage me

18:21.580 --> 18:22.580
and provide you with a new way

18:22.580 --> 18:23.580
in our opportunity to do so.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.580
Thank you, sir.

18:24.580 --> 18:25.580
As I recall it,

18:25.580 --> 18:27.580
I told you,

18:27.580 --> 18:31.580
with reference to the particular charges about threats

18:31.580 --> 18:34.580
that I have supposedly made to Mr. Steven,

18:34.580 --> 18:37.580
concerning private Shine,

18:37.580 --> 18:41.580
with regard to improper inducements and persuasions

18:41.580 --> 18:43.580
that have been attempted by Shine himself

18:43.580 --> 18:45.580
and other than his behavior.

18:45.580 --> 18:46.580
I told you, sir,

18:46.580 --> 18:49.580
I believe that I saw a very substantial proof

18:49.580 --> 18:51.580
of the bad taste of Mr. Steven,

18:51.580 --> 18:53.580
and making those charges now,

18:53.580 --> 18:55.580
was the fact that long after,

18:55.580 --> 18:57.580
the threat that supposedly been made,

18:57.580 --> 19:00.580
long after these inducements and persuasions

19:00.580 --> 19:02.580
that supposedly been made,

19:02.580 --> 19:04.580
Mr. Steven was not only most solicitous

19:04.580 --> 19:05.580
to private Shine,

19:05.580 --> 19:08.580
but was in his company and not once, but twice,

19:08.580 --> 19:11.580
at ask that he's photographed with private Shine.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.580
That is what I told you, sir,

19:13.580 --> 19:14.580
and that is the fact.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.580
Now, I told you specifically,

19:16.580 --> 19:18.580
that on November 6th,

19:18.580 --> 19:21.580
when Mr. Steven invited all of us,

19:21.580 --> 19:23.580
to his office for lunch,

19:23.580 --> 19:26.580
and when at that lunch he asked us to stop the hearing,

19:26.580 --> 19:27.580
and told me,

19:27.580 --> 19:29.580
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

19:29.580 --> 19:31.580
but you are now addressing yourself

19:31.580 --> 19:33.580
to the events of November 6th,

19:33.580 --> 19:35.580
and Mr. Steven's also to panic on it.

19:35.580 --> 19:37.580
I want to talk about the photographs,

19:37.580 --> 19:38.580
if I may.

19:38.580 --> 19:40.580
With respect to November 6th,

19:40.580 --> 19:43.580
with the reading of the event of November 7th,

19:43.580 --> 19:44.580
that's right.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.580
And will you confine it

19:46.580 --> 19:48.580
to the photographs alone?

19:48.580 --> 19:49.580
I will, sir.

19:49.580 --> 19:50.580
And what was said,

19:50.580 --> 19:52.580
and then you gave them Mr. Steven on a date?

19:52.580 --> 19:54.580
I will have the good-for-the-show.

19:54.580 --> 19:55.580
On November 6th,

19:55.580 --> 19:57.580
Mr. Steven had invited,

19:57.580 --> 19:59.580
then in a car with Mr. Crab,

19:59.580 --> 20:00.580
I felt and Mr. Shine,

20:00.580 --> 20:02.580
who was then in the Army,

20:02.580 --> 20:04.580
for lunch at his office.

20:04.580 --> 20:08.580
Mr. Shine did not come because he did not care to come.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.580
He declined the invitation.

20:10.580 --> 20:11.580
When we arrived there,

20:11.580 --> 20:13.580
there was a plate set for him at the table,

20:13.580 --> 20:15.580
and Mr. Steven expressed great regret

20:15.580 --> 20:17.580
and was surprised to come and get his reference

20:17.580 --> 20:18.580
to the photograph.

20:18.580 --> 20:19.580
When does it come?

20:19.580 --> 20:20.580
I must ode his picture,

20:20.580 --> 20:22.580
when I was fooled in by...

20:22.580 --> 20:24.580
With reference to the photograph,

20:24.580 --> 20:25.580
Mr. Steven said,

20:25.580 --> 20:27.580
one reason I'm particularly sorry,

20:27.580 --> 20:28.580
is not here,

20:28.580 --> 20:31.580
is that a couple of the photographers wanted to say a picture

20:31.580 --> 20:32.580
of him and me,

20:32.580 --> 20:34.580
a day sign in myself,

20:34.580 --> 20:37.580
and I wanted to have that picture taken.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.580
Now, is that all that was said on November 6th,

20:39.580 --> 20:41.580
reference to a photograph?

20:41.580 --> 20:42.580
That is all it said.

20:42.580 --> 20:43.580
I think on November 7th,

20:43.580 --> 20:45.580
very well, I'll ask you whether or not,

20:45.580 --> 20:48.580
you told me that you had documentary evidence

20:48.580 --> 20:50.580
to the form of a photograph.

20:50.580 --> 20:53.580
I'll miss your students and Mr. Shine,

20:53.580 --> 20:55.580
collaborating your statements to me,

20:55.580 --> 20:58.580
that Mr. Steven's request to do photograph

20:58.580 --> 20:59.580
is taken by Shine.

20:59.580 --> 21:00.580
Is that correct?

21:00.580 --> 21:02.580
I told you so that we had,

21:02.580 --> 21:03.580
as far as I know,

21:03.580 --> 21:05.580
there was a picture of Mr. Steven

21:05.580 --> 21:07.580
and private Shine taken.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.580
I know that the other things that was,

21:09.580 --> 21:10.580
and there it is.

21:10.580 --> 21:13.580
That is used to produce that photograph

21:13.580 --> 21:14.580
to me,

21:14.580 --> 21:16.580
prior to my cross examination

21:16.580 --> 21:17.580
of the Secretary of the Army.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.580
I believe before you did that,

21:19.580 --> 21:21.580
Mr. Jenkins, you asked me to explain to you

21:21.580 --> 21:24.580
the circumstances under which that photograph was taken.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.580
And I believe that I then told you.

21:26.580 --> 21:29.580
And if I may not you tell me that it was taken on

21:29.580 --> 21:30.580
medical issues,

21:30.580 --> 21:32.580
I have to request to the Secretary of the Army.

21:32.580 --> 21:33.580
I said that then, sir,

21:33.580 --> 21:34.580
and I say that now,

21:34.580 --> 21:36.580
and feel a little at home.

21:36.580 --> 21:39.580
What is that original photograph introduced yesterday?

21:39.580 --> 21:41.580
Delivered to me by you,

21:41.580 --> 21:43.580
a member of your staff,

21:43.580 --> 21:46.580
prior to my cross examination of the Secretary of the Army.

21:46.580 --> 21:47.580
That's why this was.

21:47.580 --> 21:49.580
This is being overstepped to me.

21:49.580 --> 21:52.580
Up to this time,

21:52.580 --> 21:55.580
about any person

21:55.580 --> 21:58.580
being cut out of that photograph.

21:58.580 --> 22:00.580
No, so I don't think anything was ever said to you

22:00.580 --> 22:02.580
about any person being cut out of that photograph.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.580
And I would like to tell you,

22:04.580 --> 22:06.580
and the interest of accuracy,

22:06.580 --> 22:08.580
exactly what was that,

22:08.580 --> 22:10.580
and exactly what was done.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.580
And you told, all right, fine.

22:12.580 --> 22:14.580
I told you, sir,

22:14.580 --> 22:16.580
actually I described the November 6th incident

22:16.580 --> 22:18.580
in which Mr. Stevens expressed regret to his photograph.

22:18.580 --> 22:20.580
That Mr. Shine does not accept his invitation

22:20.580 --> 22:22.580
because stating his one reason

22:22.580 --> 22:24.580
that he wanted his photograph taken.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.580
That on November 17th,

22:26.580 --> 22:28.580
when Mr. Stevens flew down

22:28.580 --> 22:31.580
with us to Fort Six to see Mr. Shine,

22:31.580 --> 22:33.580
that as we were getting off the plane,

22:33.580 --> 22:35.580
there were a couple of bombing photographers.

22:35.580 --> 22:37.580
Mr. Stevens says there were air force photographers

22:37.580 --> 22:39.580
that they very well might have been there.

22:39.580 --> 22:41.580
But there were a couple of military photographers,

22:41.580 --> 22:44.580
let's say, who are waiting at the plane.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.580
That's why Mr. Shine was waiting there.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.580
So as General Ryan,

22:48.580 --> 22:51.580
I believe I mentioned to you that Colonel Bradley was there,

22:51.580 --> 22:53.580
that Colonel was out was there.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.580
I believe I mentioned to you, sir,

22:54.580 --> 22:55.580
that Colonel Bradley will be one of the people

22:55.580 --> 22:56.580
who will throw into which.

22:56.580 --> 22:57.580
I believe I mentioned to you, sir,

22:57.580 --> 22:59.580
that Colonel Bradley will be one of the people

22:59.580 --> 23:02.580
we will throw into which is for us in this parade.

23:02.580 --> 23:05.580
I say that we will throw into which is for us.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.580
And the photographer Steph Stov,

23:07.580 --> 23:10.580
sent in a majority said that we had a lead for force

23:10.580 --> 23:12.580
in very soon, and as far as he was concerned,

23:12.580 --> 23:15.580
he did not want any pictures taken.

23:15.580 --> 23:17.580
He wanted to get right inside and start working.

23:17.580 --> 23:21.580
That at that point, Mr. Stevens

23:21.580 --> 23:24.580
walked over to Private Shine and said,

23:24.580 --> 23:28.580
this is a picture I would like to have.

23:28.580 --> 23:31.580
It's one I've wanted and let's have a statement now.

23:31.580 --> 23:34.580
I heard that, sending him a car, they heard that,

23:34.580 --> 23:36.580
and Mr. Carr heard that,

23:36.580 --> 23:38.580
that a picture was there upon saying,

23:38.580 --> 23:40.580
I believe you asked me, sir,

23:40.580 --> 23:43.580
whether or not such a picture was in existence.

23:43.580 --> 23:47.580
And I believe I told you I brought that up law,

23:47.580 --> 23:50.580
at which point I contacted Private Shine.

23:50.580 --> 23:54.580
Private Shine said, yes, there has been such a picture in existence,

23:54.580 --> 23:57.580
that he had framed on the law of his office

23:57.580 --> 23:59.580
until recent events at which time,

23:59.580 --> 24:02.580
I believe it was taken down.

24:02.580 --> 24:05.580
I asked to think it gets back,

24:05.580 --> 24:07.580
and said he saw the truth.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.580
He went up to New York, he broke your bad picture,

24:10.580 --> 24:13.580
he brought it down, I did not see it,

24:13.580 --> 24:15.580
and I might say, sir, I did not know

24:15.580 --> 24:19.580
of a Colonel privately with standing in the background or not.

24:19.580 --> 24:22.580
As I think back on it, I think that there was brutal force

24:22.580 --> 24:24.580
that was taken on that day.

24:24.580 --> 24:27.580
I think Mr. Harris was in a couple of the pictures.

24:27.580 --> 24:31.580
Now, Mr. Shine said that picture down here,

24:31.580 --> 24:34.580
it was given to some members of the staff.

24:34.580 --> 24:38.580
They took it down there to have copy of the picture made.

24:38.580 --> 24:41.580
The pictures were copies of the picture were made.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.580
One of the members there asked me what to do with it.

24:44.580 --> 24:47.580
I told him send a copy of the picture of Steven

24:47.580 --> 24:52.580
and Shine up through Mr. James, Sublon of Staten.

24:52.580 --> 24:54.580
That was done.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.580
I now find, I think, a member of the staff

24:56.580 --> 25:00.580
that faced with some third person who was not recognizable

25:00.580 --> 25:03.580
and was not recognized standing through the side.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.580
But Mr. Steven and Mr. Shine were facing each other

25:05.580 --> 25:07.580
and looking at each other.

25:07.580 --> 25:09.580
There was a third person standing through the side

25:09.580 --> 25:11.580
and they thought that that person had no relevancy

25:11.580 --> 25:13.580
or had nothing to do with it.

25:13.580 --> 25:17.580
And that the picture wanted was the picture of Steven and Shine.

25:17.580 --> 25:20.580
But that's what was going on, that's what was sent up to you.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.580
I did not see it before with that staff.

25:22.580 --> 25:25.580
It was sent up and Mr. Steven went to establish the Colonel

25:25.580 --> 25:27.580
and the Colonel's family.

25:27.580 --> 25:29.580
The Colonel's family was standing to the side.

25:29.580 --> 25:32.580
I remember he was the side of the plane as we arrived

25:32.580 --> 25:34.580
and the commanding officer had a field.

25:34.580 --> 25:37.580
And that Mr. Adams was standing next to Colonel Bradley.

25:37.580 --> 25:40.580
I think so that's perfectly correct and proper.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.580
And we're very glad to have that in the record.

25:43.580 --> 25:46.580
And Mr. Gordon's now with me in the record.

25:46.580 --> 25:49.580
We use the points of invariancy,

25:49.580 --> 25:51.580
and specifically use this.

25:51.580 --> 25:55.580
We're about to try to help examine the security of yesterday.

25:55.580 --> 25:58.580
The picture that was delivered to me by yourself.

25:58.580 --> 26:00.580
Yes, sir. It was a blowout.

26:00.580 --> 26:02.580
It was not a blowout, that's right.

26:02.580 --> 26:06.580
Was there not anything ever such to me about that picture

26:06.580 --> 26:10.580
of having him edited R.A.S. first person?

26:10.580 --> 26:13.580
Who might be who referred to a Colonel by me?

26:13.580 --> 26:15.580
Yes, we know maybe it's not the picture.

26:15.580 --> 26:18.580
Mr. Jenkins now thought that it was not set to you by me,

26:18.580 --> 26:21.580
because I did not know it and I did not say it.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.580
But one thing that's special with me,

26:23.580 --> 26:26.580
you told me as I remember Mr. Corn and the correct number,

26:26.580 --> 26:28.580
I ask you the question.

26:28.580 --> 26:32.580
That you did have this picture of China in the secretary.

26:32.580 --> 26:33.580
That's right.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.580
Which would be delivered to me just after the photos.

26:36.580 --> 26:39.580
I'll give you the question as who can be seen.

26:39.580 --> 26:42.580
And I did not tell you that Colonel Bradley was standing

26:42.580 --> 26:44.580
to the side, or I did not know it.

26:44.580 --> 26:47.580
I did not know it's now and I think it may not be fine.

26:47.580 --> 26:49.580
It may not be fine, but it's different for it.

26:49.580 --> 26:51.580
And I would like it very clearly noted on the records.

26:51.580 --> 26:54.580
This is a picture where the Colonel Bradley was standing

26:54.580 --> 26:55.580
to the side or not.

26:55.580 --> 26:58.580
This is a picture of Secretary Stevens and Mr. Shine

26:58.580 --> 27:01.580
looking at each other, taken on an occasion

27:01.580 --> 27:03.580
when Mrs. Stevens flew down the scene of Mrs. Shine.

27:03.580 --> 27:07.580
After he claimed he had been threatened and improperly depleted

27:07.580 --> 27:10.580
and induced and that the picture of Mr. Stevens

27:10.580 --> 27:13.580
and Shine was taken as the request of Mr. Stevens.

27:13.580 --> 27:16.580
You have already stated that Mr. Corn and his ears

27:16.580 --> 27:18.580
have been issued to those who are all deaf side,

27:18.580 --> 27:20.580
I cannot ask you.

27:20.580 --> 27:25.580
I'm all in the subject of this picture of one of November 17th.

27:25.580 --> 27:28.580
The members of this, today we're perhaps now desired to ask you

27:28.580 --> 27:29.580
further questions.

27:29.580 --> 27:30.580
I'll be glad.

27:30.580 --> 27:32.580
Any question that any member of the committee wants.

27:32.580 --> 27:33.580
I have just one question.

27:33.580 --> 27:37.580
I think it is the original picture and which,

27:37.580 --> 27:41.580
but we now have, before we start you call it, a blow.

27:41.580 --> 27:44.580
Yes, it is the original picture in your position.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.580
I can't you condition.

27:46.580 --> 27:49.580
No, but I'm sure we can send it in one eye, got a number of papers

27:49.580 --> 27:50.580
and stuff to attend to.

27:50.580 --> 27:53.580
It's not in my possession, but I would say that if I'm sure I fund

27:53.580 --> 27:56.580
the mic control, for the extent that we can get members of this

27:56.580 --> 28:00.580
band to mustle around some place, and I'm sure we can get that out here.

28:00.580 --> 28:03.580
I'm sure that before the committee, I'd like to do a sit-up

28:03.580 --> 28:04.580
if I may.

28:04.580 --> 28:07.580
I'd like to supply the original picture plus all of the blocks

28:07.580 --> 28:10.580
which were made, from which the one of the sent-ups

28:10.580 --> 28:12.580
and Mr. Jenkins plus, the rest of the other.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.580
And we've got everything we have.

28:14.580 --> 28:16.580
I'm sure everybody will be happy to see,

28:16.580 --> 28:18.580
or they will be able to remove it, but among them

28:18.580 --> 28:20.580
is the license in here, wait, you know, from which this

28:20.580 --> 28:22.580
is the door, that will be supply.

28:22.580 --> 28:23.580
Very well.

28:23.580 --> 28:27.580
Senator Durkson has noticed that the charity had the road

28:27.580 --> 28:31.580
of the Supreme Court to stand up with a particular reason

28:31.580 --> 28:33.580
for having the day so far.

28:33.580 --> 28:37.580
We will go to next year's service, then the law will be

28:37.580 --> 28:39.580
sent to your objection, please.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.580
I'm sorry, Senator.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.580
Why would a kind of duty and time of power

28:43.580 --> 28:45.580
send in time, Mr. Choney?

28:45.580 --> 28:47.580
Yes.

28:47.580 --> 28:49.580
Roy, I just want to ask you,

28:49.580 --> 28:53.580
after time, Council yesterday was questioning

28:53.580 --> 28:58.580
Secretary Stevens, trying to elicit from him

28:58.580 --> 29:02.580
that at his only trust he had had his picture taken

29:02.580 --> 29:06.580
was Mr. Shine, alone.

29:06.580 --> 29:10.580
Did you then know that the picture that was only

29:11.580 --> 29:14.580
exhibition and being made a part of the testimony

29:14.580 --> 29:20.580
was taken out of a group picture and not a picture of

29:20.580 --> 29:23.580
Mr. Stevens and Mr. Shine, alone.

29:23.580 --> 29:26.580
Did you know that yourself yesterday when those questions

29:26.580 --> 29:28.580
were being asked?

29:28.580 --> 29:29.580
No, that is a matter of fact.

29:29.580 --> 29:31.580
I did not even tax the word, a law,

29:31.580 --> 29:33.580
put in the environment today.

29:33.580 --> 29:35.580
I did not hear that word, and I did not tax that,

29:35.580 --> 29:36.580
Senator McCraw.

29:36.580 --> 29:39.580
Well, was not the purpose of the picture

29:39.580 --> 29:42.580
and you're producing it and making it a vehicle

29:42.580 --> 29:44.580
to counsel was a purpose,

29:44.580 --> 29:47.580
also speculating your statement that

29:47.580 --> 29:52.580
Mr. Stevens had requested that he and Shine

29:52.580 --> 29:55.580
have their picture taken, alone, to get.

29:55.580 --> 29:56.580
No, sir.

29:56.580 --> 29:57.580
And I don't believe it.

29:57.580 --> 29:58.580
I hope that the Jacksonville Vanillian

29:58.580 --> 30:00.580
is that I haven't used the word a law.

30:00.580 --> 30:02.580
I might say, I don't think the private

30:02.580 --> 30:04.580
colonel Bradley is standing to the side,

30:04.580 --> 30:07.580
changes the things one I owe to him.

30:07.580 --> 30:10.580
But I don't believe I ever used the word,

30:10.580 --> 30:12.580
along with Mr. Jackson for anyone else.

30:12.580 --> 30:15.580
My recollection was that of McCraw and Andrews,

30:15.580 --> 30:18.580
that Mr. Stevens wanted a picture of himself

30:18.580 --> 30:19.580
and Mr. Shine.

30:19.580 --> 30:22.580
I don't believe that he's excluded from the picture

30:22.580 --> 30:25.580
of perhaps excluded from the picture.

30:25.580 --> 30:28.580
Any of the other people, if it happens to Colonel Bradley,

30:28.580 --> 30:30.580
who is standing next to the plane,

30:30.580 --> 30:32.580
starts to reside as a picture,

30:32.580 --> 30:34.580
but it possibly missed the atoms with next to him,

30:34.580 --> 30:36.580
that might very well be felt there,

30:36.580 --> 30:37.580
and I don't deny it for a minute,

30:37.580 --> 30:39.580
nor do I assign any significance.

30:39.580 --> 30:42.580
So the point here is that the picture was presented yesterday,

30:42.580 --> 30:45.580
and it was to corroborate the allegation

30:45.580 --> 30:47.580
and the questions that has been asked

30:47.580 --> 30:49.580
if there is Stevens.

30:49.580 --> 30:52.580
With respect to him, why is he

30:52.580 --> 30:55.580
a picture taken alone with Mr. Shine?

30:55.580 --> 30:59.580
That's why I have the time the picture was presented.

30:59.580 --> 31:02.580
Now, through interrogated Mr. Stevens,

31:02.580 --> 31:05.580
obviously under that impression.

31:05.580 --> 31:09.580
Now, did you give him that impression that it was a picture

31:09.580 --> 31:11.580
of the two taken alone?

31:11.580 --> 31:14.580
Now, the picture is the impression which I gave to my home,

31:14.580 --> 31:17.580
which is what the fact is I knew the more was,

31:17.580 --> 31:20.580
that there was a picture of Secretary Stevens

31:20.580 --> 31:24.580
and Mr. Shine taken at the request of Secretary Stevens.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.580
I don't believe Mr. Jenkins ever asked me.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.580
I don't know why he should have,

31:29.580 --> 31:34.580
but I believe that he was a picture of Secretary Stevens

31:34.580 --> 31:38.580
and Mr. Shine, a next three-starred looking at each other.

31:38.580 --> 31:40.580
I believe that was as far as I went,

31:40.580 --> 31:43.580
because that is as far as I knew that.

31:43.580 --> 31:46.580
Well, you recognize that as it was these in yesterday,

31:46.580 --> 31:51.580
in testimony, deliciousness from examination by council,

31:51.580 --> 31:56.580
that the testimony as our yesterday did not present.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.580
The fact that as they are, you recognize that.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.580
There are in that tunnel,

32:01.580 --> 32:03.580
Bradley was standing to the side in the fight,

32:03.580 --> 32:05.580
Mr. Adam's might be standing next to them.

32:05.580 --> 32:09.580
Well, that was not a picture of two people alone.

32:09.580 --> 32:12.580
That was a proof picture,

32:12.580 --> 32:15.580
and these, the picture of these two,

32:15.580 --> 32:17.580
was standing side by side.

32:17.580 --> 32:20.580
These two were standing side by side.
