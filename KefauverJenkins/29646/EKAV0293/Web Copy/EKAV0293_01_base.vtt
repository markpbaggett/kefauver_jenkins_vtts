WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:33.500
but if you can't be questioned about it this time.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.000
Hello Charlie and ladies and gentlemen of our listening audience.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
A great deal has happened in the United States Senate

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
and in Washington during this week.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
On Friday, for instance, the thousands of people

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
are the so-called basic point of the world.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
And this week's always going to be sustained by funds.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm very happy that these people are that still,

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
the process you know are a part of against its practice

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
because I think it might put us again back on

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
in the old history, just basically,

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
with what the orderly and national development of the South

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
and other less developed regions of the United States.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
So as things now expand, we're going to be able to go ahead

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
without having to disseminate it again in connection with faithless.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
I have to be glad to answer any questions that may occur to you, Charlie,

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
in addition to that.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
The senator, another anti-stress and anti-matter that I have been involved with here.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
This could be an issue, again, with the rejection by his name,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
and the members proposed by President Truman for the Federal Trade Committee.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm very interested in anti-stress matters, Charlie,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
and therefore in the Federal Trade Committee,

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
which does much to further legal restraint of trade and fault

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
and misleading advertising.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
You will refer with me the subject-tasking of former Congressmen

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
viewing El Davis's presidency some time ago.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
That's Davis had served as distinction to himself,

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
that commission and to the people of his native states for a great many years.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
I do not think I joined the sum of the other members of the Tennessee delegation

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
in recommending that the president appoint John P. Loft also

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
a tenancy to fill this space.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
The P. Loft had been a senior attorney at the Federal Trade Commission

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
for a number of years, and was just Davis's administrative assistant.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I have a person, Truman, who also has to take this upon him away from my state,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
and to appoint the Honorable Martin A. Hutchinson of Virginia.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
It was necessary for the Senate to agree to this point.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
And I'll Thursday of the past week, the Senate Interstate and Foreign Congress

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
made about a five-to-three to reject the apartment.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Three committee members were not reported at full.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
With the adverse recommendation of the committee,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
the matter will now be referred to as full committee for action.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
In the center, if you have any suggestion, if you have some of this matter on the Senate's floor.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Well, the protection of others around here,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
or that Mr. Hutchinson's nominated nomination will not be approved.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I don't know Mr. Hutchinson personally, and I, for voting on the matter,

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
I want to read the record on his position, and on his accomplishment,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
so there's no other action to vote for him enough.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Is this the same Mark Hutchinson to oppose the senior senior senator Harry Fluss for it?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Is this kind of strong diversion of the seat of the election?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Yes, Senator Burd defeated Mr. Hutchinson.

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
Both Senator Burd and Senator Willis Robertson of the January opposed the nomination of Mr. Hutchinson.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Well, let a matter of the time you're mentioning Senator Kim Lee,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
was the election so the seat of the seat of the seat of Washington?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
For a bus to begin with, is this kind of a bus to begin with?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Yes, Senator Harry Kane of the State of Washington.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
In the public in the States, they long one man for the bus to begin with.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
But on Monday, the matter came to a vote.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Senate voting to extend rent and tolls for six months,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
or until January 1, 1951.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
And after which the Suddrenken toll on a local option base.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm satisfied that rent and toll on national bases will go out on January 1, 1951.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
At the Ashton tolls of the vote.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
That was a margin of eight votes for the past 36th favoring and 28th opposed the mythical.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
What are here thinking on the rent and toll issue at this time?

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Well, I've drilled out in my mind, Charlie, that rent and toll is a necessary evil toll to begin.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Many communities have studied particularly in the large and deep.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
The federal control of this nature is not a very close thing,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
and we cannot continue it in dust.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
How does an apartment are very tense with either the power of rent?

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
We can probably have no real relief in this situation until a housing size is sufficient for a defense.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
And still practice the level of some of the states in New York, for example,

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
have adopted rent and toll measures, which appear to be even more stringent than the federal respondent.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Seven states, I believe, have decontrolled in silence.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
The action of the United States should be apple warning to the states of the initiative which meets and tolls.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
To work out a plan on a local basis by the first of the year.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
Let me add, Charlie, that rent and toll is in a many respects, the fiscal story.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
It's not in keeping with our three-unified systems.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
It can only be justified as a war or emergency measure.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
And our measures are to get rid of these and toll districts, and we can't.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
I see now another way, yet to see the five-year-old's new fathers.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I refer to our great action.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
No, there you are.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
The United States is a threat back to the entire democratic world.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
What adjustments are underway now that the cost of the country is increased?

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, the Department of Agriculture has reported from 30 million fewer acres of wheat, farm, cotton, potatoes, and so forth.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Well, these managed this year than in wartime.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
That was put out and pretty much the same acreage production that we had before the war.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
Two-thirds of the American farmers voted in a referendum to accept the agriculture of the cotton plant or less plant.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
This is calculated as a whole-land production.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
This program presents a new problem for our farmers.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
They must decide what to do with a land idle by the decreased acres.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Of course, some of the land being used during the war is marginal land,

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
although they did only because of it.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Great demand to the war.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Many of our Tennessee farmers will diverse this surplus acres of the texture for the raising of more and better lives.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
What if you are used to satisfy our Tennessee farm legislation that you don't think?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
No, I'm not, Charlie.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
In front of them, from a wartime farm upon a Mississippi farm,

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
I think we need to enact a new legislation to bring our farm program up to date and on its foundation.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
The other day, when you were interviewing your office by John McDonald regarding farm-stabbing,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
did you ask something to say about the dining plan?

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
Yes, Mr. McDonald in five, I thought the dining plan would be adopted at this session.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
That was a new question, of course, because it is obvious that no major farm bills must come out of this funding.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
I told Mr. McDonald also that I felt that we are not yet ready for the dining plan,

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
and I didn't think the dining plan had the natural standards to enter to the farm's property.

07:16.000 --> 07:26.000
Although I do think we should carefully consider any and all new proposals to actually feed ourselves from our session situation as regards our agricultural proposals.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
What if you happen to know how farm production now prepares with our agricultural activities?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
50 years ago?

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, it was about five years large in 1949 and it was in 1900.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
That's the illustration that will give you a better picture.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
In 1900, one farm worker produced the Nuts Farm Stealth and seven others.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
In 1945, one farm worker produced the Nuts Farm Stealth and 14 others.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
That certainly a great, poverty thing.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Yes, and if we win the Cold War and are not forced into a shooting war,

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
one of the long-range results would be a larger supply and a better quantity of food for all the work.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
All the farmers are great partners in the matter of American farming techniques.

08:12.000 --> 08:21.000
Turning to another matter factor, didn't your harvest harvested committee holes here in Germany to hold the care of each program under the manufacturing need?

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
Yes, we heard in the conjunction with the farm relations committee of the Senate.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
We heard secondary of state hatchet and other touchifying supports of the military aid programs.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Now, those committees consider the old biblical injunction that is needed.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Take it that the source, the caring status of the source.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, we have Charlie and his top promise to speak to it.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I do ever pick something for it.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
I'll pair it by it with our military aid programs.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Here's the way I view the situation.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
We cannot separate our interest and world peace from those that other nations need to work.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
It is obvious that Russia is a constant and increasing threat to the peace.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
The only defense Russia will understand is strength, moral, economic, political, and military.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
Strength, thought, her, that the Soviet leaders will be fearful of aggressive moves.

09:15.000 --> 09:25.000
From our own experience, we know that no one nation can provide its strength without destroying its own economy and becoming thereby too weak to resist for long.

09:25.000 --> 09:38.000
We can share the economic requirements by doing our part and contrast with other nations' likeness to become strong enough jointly to destroy any Russian aggression against any other.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
How does this military aid program fit into our focus on power?

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, it seems to me that five things are necessary at the moment to complete our power and policy fixation.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
We must continue to cooperate with the United Nations Organization.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
We must institute the 24 children that are in the Marshall clan.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
We must keep our own military force position from them.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
We must join our armed services powers, our intelligence security actions,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
that are of other friendly nations.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
And our friends cannot harm themselves. We must help them, all of these can.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
All of this is looking forward, of course, to the dying time and all of it.

10:19.000 --> 10:26.000
We might have a real unity or integration where they spend the democracy, the non-disclasses, not by contrast.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
But that is an amazing vision and they have landed union resolution without any functioning in front of them.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
All of these practices can make economic decisions, militations, interrelations.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
Yes, exactly. In fact, more so than our international policy recognizes it.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Our prosperity is meaningless unless we can be pure from the past.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
Black lives, we cannot be militarily pure unless our economic condition is stable in the past.

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
There is also evidence that we can achieve neither economic nor military unity by ourselves.

11:01.000 --> 11:08.000
Now this program is sometimes the first to use the armed implementation program under the Atlantic package.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
Yes, the primary object of the Atlantic package is to group ourselves with our friends or to come into space.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
But unless we talk about the re-perlations without a line, we are no better off than we work without.

11:20.000 --> 11:33.000
The alliance is utterly worthless unless we assume the resources that we have and provide the nation unable to our decisions to resist and pack our gifts up and get their own arguments.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
How might this be supposed to be extended to the other group in the banking system once?

11:38.000 --> 11:49.000
Roughly $1 billion in the North Atlantic City area, there is a funny million increase in prices, 27 million in Iran and full of people in Korea.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
75 million in the China region, this is something less than the United States.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
A lot of money. Well, it is a lot of money, Charlie. But we have much to say.

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
The Soviet Union has shut about to destroy the must-be and arch-abival defend upon our defense.

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
There is no way to be useful in modern world to assist other nations to defend and defend our country.

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
The alternative is to abandon our free way of life and money isn't that important for a country.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
I doubt that the American people will contain of this trend.

12:24.000 --> 12:34.000
When they appreciate that this is the price of the existing freedom, I would not go about this problem as our leaders have if the decision were mine alone.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
But under the procedure adopted I see no way out other than to approve this decision.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
I think that the time is going to be out of danger and we are just about to open next week.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Yes, that is a great deal of interest in China's view and the fifth is wildlife.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
Now I have invited Mr. Albert M. Bay, the director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service to be my guest.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
He will be with us next week.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
We will talk about something and fixing him, technically.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
And I think our multitude is fortunate in China to even find its golden informative information.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I am sure many of them will be missing.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Next week is the fifth time and on this week.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
If they have to keep on it, they will need to be actually the next week of wildlife service.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
If you have got it, you can look back and listen to the doctor's box.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
You are now joining us.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Okay, you are good.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
You have a little subject to what you are going to say.

13:28.000 --> 13:38.000
I will tell him over there that this is just a usual letter to say a lie.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I guess they are the same.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
I mean, I wish you would tell him.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
Hey Charlie, you are number one.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
You have started keeping it out of this.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It is a very effective.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
It is all I can do.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
And I think that is the most important thing in the past.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Let's get that part on.
