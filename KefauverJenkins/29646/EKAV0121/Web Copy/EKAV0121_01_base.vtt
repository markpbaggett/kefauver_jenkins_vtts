00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
This is a letter.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.640
Just read, indicate that Senator Carsey did not think

00:07.640 --> 00:10.880
private sign would have been drafted, except for the fact

00:10.880 --> 00:12.480
that he worked for the Senator's committee, which

00:12.480 --> 00:14.800
was investigating the Army.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.800
Let me make clear that the selective service system and the

00:17.800 --> 00:21.720
draft boards are, of course, wholly independent of the Army.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.360
I am told, however, that the draft boards, which at one time

00:24.360 --> 00:27.080
or another had signed case, had considered

00:27.080 --> 00:29.960
eligible for the draft ever since the beginning of the Korean War

00:29.960 --> 00:31.640
in 1950.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.320
This was two and a half years before he

00:33.320 --> 00:35.440
went to work for Senator Carsey.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.840
And three years before the Senator began to investigate

00:37.840 --> 00:39.400
the Army.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.160
The statements of Senator Carsey's letter

00:41.160 --> 00:45.280
of December 22nd are also in striking contrast

00:45.280 --> 00:48.680
with the numerous efforts made both before and after that day

00:48.680 --> 00:51.400
to obtain preferential treatment and special assignments

00:51.400 --> 00:53.960
for private sign, to say nothing of the attempts

00:53.960 --> 00:57.040
to obtain a direct commission for him.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.360
So at the end of December, Mr. Adams

00:59.360 --> 01:02.680
advised me that he had checked with the IJD General's office,

01:02.680 --> 01:04.280
and the sign was headed for the Provost

01:04.280 --> 01:08.320
Marshal General, Senator at Camp Gordon George.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.080
Mr. Adams mentioned that private sign

01:11.080 --> 01:13.920
might possibly qualify for the Criminal Investigation

01:13.920 --> 01:16.240
School, which is located there.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.520
Call non-being so advised as Mr. Adams,

01:18.520 --> 01:19.760
many questions.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.400
With reference to Camp Gordon, such as the length of time,

01:22.400 --> 01:25.600
private sign would be required to undergo training there,

01:25.600 --> 01:27.880
whether we would have to live on the post.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.680
The points of contact to the years in order

01:29.680 --> 01:31.840
to arrange for making sign available for committee

01:31.840 --> 01:33.480
there's no dismissal.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.840
And the likelihood of signs going overseas

01:35.840 --> 01:38.280
at the end of these tours.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.960
Mr. Adams told home that the chances

01:40.960 --> 01:43.920
where the private sign would face overseas duty

01:43.920 --> 01:47.400
after completing his tour at Camp Gordon, just like every other

01:47.400 --> 01:48.560
boy.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.320
Mr. Adams said, home, they're upon stated,

01:51.320 --> 01:54.480
that if this occurred, it would quote directly

01:54.480 --> 01:59.560
armed, unquote, and I would be quote, true, unquote,

01:59.560 --> 02:01.480
as secretary.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.560
On January 14, three days before I departed for the Far East,

02:06.560 --> 02:08.160
I met Senator McCarthy of the Tower

02:08.160 --> 02:09.880
on a post-cal here in Washington

02:09.880 --> 02:12.680
and told him of my forthcoming trip.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.800
After about a half hour's discussion,

02:14.800 --> 02:16.880
a friend of his joined them.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.200
The question of private sign length of service

02:19.200 --> 02:21.240
at Camp Gordon was discussed.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.240
So was the criminal investigation tool.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.840
I said private sign could apply for the tool,

02:26.840 --> 02:30.040
and it would depend upon his record and qualifications,

02:30.040 --> 02:32.400
whether or not he would be accepted.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.880
Four or five times during the conversation,

02:34.880 --> 02:37.200
Senator McCarthy brought up the possibility

02:37.200 --> 02:40.120
of obtaining a New Yorker sign for Sean.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.840
I reminded the senator that he's read on the of December 22.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.400
He had stated that he had an unbreakable rule,

02:46.400 --> 02:47.880
that he would never attempt to interfere

02:47.880 --> 02:50.920
with or influence the army in its refinement.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.160
The senator dropped the subject.

02:53.160 --> 02:57.040
I left for the Far East on January 17, 17.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.840
And when I returned, private sign had been transferred

02:59.840 --> 03:03.560
to Camp Gordon, Georgia, to complete his basic training.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.360
The efforts to obtain special treatment

03:05.360 --> 03:07.680
for private sign from Mr. Adams

03:07.680 --> 03:09.840
continued through the end of the month.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.680
I may say that during my tenure as secretary of the Army,

03:13.680 --> 03:15.840
there is no record that matches this

03:15.840 --> 03:19.520
and persists a pile of effort to obtain special consideration

03:19.520 --> 03:22.680
and privileges for this man.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.560
Now I turn to other events that are related to the Sean story.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.800
President-elect Eisenhower asked me

03:28.800 --> 03:33.440
to become secretary of the Army in the December of 1952.

03:33.440 --> 03:39.320
I was born in at the White House on February 14, 1953.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.440
On my very first day in office, I

03:42.440 --> 03:45.760
sent the following number and the chief of staff.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.160
Whoa.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.440
I would appreciate it if you would arrange for a brief meeting

03:50.440 --> 03:54.600
to give me on Friday 6th, February, 1953,

03:54.600 --> 03:57.200
telling the Army's loyalty and security programs

03:57.200 --> 04:00.160
to both military and civilian personnel.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.240
The presentations to step forward, what steps

04:02.240 --> 04:05.440
are taken to prevent this law of a subversive person

04:05.440 --> 04:07.560
from infiltrating the Army?

04:07.560 --> 04:10.000
And what steps have been taken to discover and remove

04:10.000 --> 04:12.800
any such person who may have found their way

04:12.800 --> 04:16.600
into the Army establishment and the Caucasian?

04:16.600 --> 04:21.000
On February 13, I lunch with Mr. Jay Eger Hoover

04:21.000 --> 04:23.600
in the office of the secretary of defense.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.680
On March 2, I call on Mr. Hoover in his office

04:26.680 --> 04:29.120
to discuss Army security matters.

04:29.120 --> 04:34.160
Army liaison with the FBI has been close and effective.

04:34.160 --> 04:38.000
On September 15, 1953, I issued a letter

04:38.000 --> 04:40.800
to the director throughout the Army stating

04:40.800 --> 04:44.200
that his Army power, it is not consistent

04:44.200 --> 04:46.400
with the interest of national security

04:46.400 --> 04:50.000
to employ or to retain on the job any civilian

04:50.000 --> 04:53.400
who in response to a proper question by proper authority

04:53.400 --> 04:56.360
refuses to say whether he is or has been a member

04:56.360 --> 04:59.560
of the Communist Party or other subversive group

04:59.560 --> 05:01.200
or organization.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.840
In this step, the Army took the initiative

05:03.840 --> 05:06.320
throughout the entire government.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.360
On the 14th and 14th of October,

05:08.360 --> 05:10.640
I spent two days in New York attending

05:10.640 --> 05:14.760
the executive hearing of this committee regarding Fort Monmouth.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.000
I wanted to obtain all of the additional information

05:17.000 --> 05:21.040
I heard about Fort Monmouth and the security situation there.

05:21.040 --> 05:25.160
I invited Senator McCartney and his staff to lunch, both days.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.040
I spiked the four going into them

05:27.040 --> 05:30.520
as evidence of my awareness of the problem of subversive

05:30.520 --> 05:33.360
and my determination to do something about it.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.280
I did not mean to spurt by anyone.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.680
By the same time, I welcomed the system from any sort,

05:39.680 --> 05:41.560
including this committee.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.280
The executive and legislative branch

05:43.280 --> 05:46.080
of the Vice-Divised Government must, in my opinion,

05:46.080 --> 05:49.960
work together as I have previously spent.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.200
My first connection with this committee

05:52.200 --> 05:56.120
and its chairman occurred in September 1953.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.760
I was spending a few days before Labor Day in Montana

05:59.760 --> 06:02.360
and happened to notice a new item in a local paper

06:02.360 --> 06:05.120
of late fall's volume, reporting comments

06:05.120 --> 06:08.880
by Senator McCartney with respect to three Army employees

06:08.880 --> 06:11.160
in the New York area.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.520
I immediately went to the railroad station

06:13.520 --> 06:17.920
in Hollywood, in Montana, and wrote a telegram to Senator,

06:17.920 --> 06:20.240
telling him that I was returning to Washington,

06:20.240 --> 06:22.880
to following truly, and wanted to correct anything

06:22.880 --> 06:24.560
that might be wrong.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.200
My telegram stated in parts, and I quote,

06:28.200 --> 06:30.360
you may be sure, I will oppose

06:30.360 --> 06:32.560
the Army that infiltration of the Army

06:32.560 --> 06:34.360
to the limit of my ability.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.480
Unquote.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.880
That was on September 4.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.400
I got back to Washington.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.640
I'm the evening of September 7.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.560
The next morning, I found Berna Point.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.480
I had lunch with Senator McCartney, and the stesticated,

06:47.480 --> 06:49.320
which the Senator was investigating,

06:49.320 --> 06:51.120
in the first Army area.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.720
I attended an executive hearing of this committee

06:53.720 --> 06:55.280
held that afternoon.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.520
There I met David Shaw for the first time.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.120
I'm up toward the 20th.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.440
I accompanied by Senator McCartney,

07:02.440 --> 07:04.360
Major General George I had back chiefs

07:04.360 --> 07:06.600
and the lawster, Channel County V. Balloon,

07:06.600 --> 07:11.240
my executive officer, Mr. John Adams, two employees

07:11.240 --> 07:12.880
of senators or members of this committee,

07:12.880 --> 07:15.960
and call, I flew to Fort Mauna.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.160
I was again looking for first hand knowledge

07:18.160 --> 07:20.160
in the security situation, which

07:20.160 --> 07:23.560
was then being investigated by Senator McCartney.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.280
I also wanted to get a feel of the morale of the post.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.520
The hearing had resulted in a new paper headline

07:30.520 --> 07:32.480
of an alarming calligraphy.

07:32.480 --> 07:37.320
Upon arrival, we were joined by Senator H. Alexander Smith,

07:37.320 --> 07:41.400
Congressman James C. Aukenclaw, the third New Jersey district,

07:41.400 --> 07:44.360
and General Law, the commanding general.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.760
The following incident occurred during the course

07:46.760 --> 07:48.360
of our inspection of the laboratory

07:48.360 --> 07:50.080
as a Fort Mauna.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.320
Emphans to one of these, the laboratory

07:52.320 --> 07:56.560
engaged in secret work required special security clearance.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.680
I made an honest box decision

07:59.680 --> 08:01.800
that I would take to responsibility

08:01.800 --> 08:04.600
for inviting those who have been elected to public office

08:04.600 --> 08:06.080
to enter with me.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.080
This included Senator McCartney, Senator Smith,

08:09.080 --> 08:10.880
and Representative Aukenclaw,

08:10.880 --> 08:13.920
but it excluded the other members of the group.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.840
Upon leaving the laboratory, I could see

08:15.840 --> 08:18.040
that the column was extremely angry,

08:18.040 --> 08:20.400
and not having been allowed to enter.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.600
Channel DeLogue informed me that column upon being denied

08:23.600 --> 08:25.960
entrance, had in substance sense.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.880
This means war.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.040
Don't they think I'm clear for classified information?

08:31.040 --> 08:34.280
I have access to FBI files when I want them.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.960
They did this on purpose just to embarrass me.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.920
We will rarely investigate the Army.

08:38.920 --> 08:43.120
Now, I stop to when we learn the colonnade of statements,

08:43.120 --> 08:46.840
quote, this is a declaration of war, uncold,

08:46.840 --> 08:49.120
within the hearing of John J. Slatter,

08:49.120 --> 08:51.640
countermeasures director of Fort Mauna,

08:51.640 --> 08:53.320
and Lieutenant Joseph E. Caw,

08:53.320 --> 08:56.800
the president of General Wattenstead.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.040
This outburst by column was the same type of reaction

09:00.040 --> 09:03.600
as one later on Mr. Adams in early January

09:03.600 --> 09:08.280
mentioned the possibility of overseas duty for Shah.

09:08.280 --> 09:12.040
I now turn to the charges made by Senator McCartney.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.520
One, that I urge the Senator to go after the Navy

09:15.520 --> 09:17.240
and the Air Force.

09:17.240 --> 09:20.720
And two, that I am guilty of blackmailing.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.160
I would like first the recall briefly,

09:23.160 --> 09:25.400
at this point, certain events arising

09:25.400 --> 09:28.120
out of the General's liquor incident.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.880
On Thursday evening, February 25, I made a public statement

09:31.880 --> 09:33.920
from the White House.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.400
In that statement, I said that from assurance

09:36.400 --> 09:39.680
which I had received from members of this committee,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.800
I was confident that Army witnesses

09:41.800 --> 09:45.200
would not be abused in the future.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.680
Shortly after my statement of February 25,

09:47.680 --> 09:50.040
the Indian public, Senator McCartney

09:50.040 --> 09:52.540
said that my statement was, quote,

09:52.540 --> 09:55.880
completely false, unquote.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.520
This was widely quoted, such papers as The New York Times,

09:59.520 --> 10:03.040
the Baltimore Times, the Washington evening star.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.600
In contrast to this, the Washington Post

10:05.600 --> 10:08.200
of February 26, the way next day,

10:08.200 --> 10:10.600
had the following comment, quote.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.400
Senator Subcommittee member Carl E. Munn,

10:13.400 --> 10:15.800
the public himself, the court, however, said he agreed.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.320
He agreed entirely with Stephen Safer.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.840
Munn said he felt Stephen was justified in saying

10:20.840 --> 10:24.080
he received assurance from members of the subcommittee,

10:24.080 --> 10:26.040
meeting individual members about the treatment

10:26.040 --> 10:28.440
of weapons, unquote.

10:28.440 --> 10:31.640
A United press despite also dated February 26,

10:31.640 --> 10:33.360
reported his follow.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.960
Senator Chipotle, Senator Charles Lee Potter,

10:35.960 --> 10:39.240
the public of Michigan, also told newsmen,

10:39.240 --> 10:41.480
Stephen was absolutely correct in saying

10:41.480 --> 10:44.360
he had received assurance that Army witnesses would not

10:44.360 --> 10:48.240
be frowny and humiliating end of quotations.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.920
Against this background, a confirmation of my statement

10:51.920 --> 10:54.400
from two members of this committee,

10:54.400 --> 10:57.760
I submit the order termination, the collectance,

10:57.760 --> 10:59.360
of Senator McCarthy's charge,

10:59.360 --> 11:02.760
of both complete falsehood, unquote.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.120
It is well-abared as incident and mine,

11:05.120 --> 11:08.200
as we turn to the new attack, which Senator McCarthy

11:08.200 --> 11:10.640
has made against me.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.960
Now, after the Senator's charges that I heard him

11:12.960 --> 11:15.160
should go after the Navy and the Air Force,

11:15.160 --> 11:17.640
and that I was gilly of Blackmail.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.320
I call your attention to the fact that these charges

11:20.320 --> 11:22.480
have not been whatsoever to do with the issue raised

11:22.480 --> 11:24.160
by Senator Potter's letter.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.480
As the weather undue influence was used by Senator McCarthy

11:27.480 --> 11:32.760
and his staff to obtain preferential treatment for private charge.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.920
The first of these charges relates to my luncheon

11:34.920 --> 11:37.760
with Senator McCarthy, home, car, and Mr. Adams,

11:37.760 --> 11:41.720
in my office on November 6, which I mentioned earlier.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.000
At this luncheon, I commented on the length

11:44.000 --> 11:47.320
to which I have gone and working with the committee.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.200
I said I've thought the inquiry by the committee

11:49.200 --> 11:51.960
of Fort Monmouth has served its purpose.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.120
I thought the Army should itself follow up

11:54.120 --> 11:55.880
the suggestions of the committee

11:55.880 --> 11:58.520
and take whatever further steps were necessary

11:58.520 --> 12:01.640
to eliminate any possible security risks.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.480
I added that I would make progress reports to the committee.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.520
However, I did not welcome the damaging effects upon the armed

12:08.520 --> 12:10.800
of Senator McCarthy's statements to the press,

12:10.800 --> 12:13.000
which gave the impression that there was much contact

12:13.000 --> 12:17.320
to the anage at Fort Monmouth when such was not the case.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.440
The Senator then brought up the plans the committee had

12:19.440 --> 12:22.440
to investigate subversion in certain industrial plants

12:22.440 --> 12:24.360
engaged in Army work.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.480
I told him the question of security and industrial plants

12:27.480 --> 12:30.560
engaged in secret work was a real concern,

12:30.560 --> 12:33.120
not only for the Army but for the entire defense establishment.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.920
The memorandum released March 12th

12:41.920 --> 12:44.480
by Senator McCarthy's statement I had a different one

12:44.480 --> 12:48.560
to suggest that the committee go after the Navy and the Air Force.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.960
At no time, on that day or at any other time,

12:51.960 --> 12:56.760
did I suggest that this committee go after the Navy and the Air Force?

12:56.760 --> 12:59.160
The Senator said the Army would furnish information

12:59.160 --> 13:01.240
about the other services.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.880
I never made any such statement.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.200
I never had any such information.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.680
I never supplied any such information.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.360
General Matthew V. Ridgeware,

13:11.360 --> 13:16.040
Chief of Staff, Major General G. C. Mudge, Chief of Information,

13:16.040 --> 13:19.440
and Major General A. G. Trudeau, Chief of Intelligence.

13:19.440 --> 13:23.400
Represents doing a approximately half of this three hour meeting.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.440
General Trudeau is presently overseas.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.600
The General Ridgeware and General Mudge are available

13:28.600 --> 13:31.320
to answer any questions that may be asked about,

13:31.320 --> 13:35.800
regarding the discussion that took place while they were present.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.520
The second episode in this connection began on November 16th

13:39.520 --> 13:43.120
when Colin and company by Mr. Adam came to my office.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.920
Colin referred to a statement by me at a press conference on November 13th

13:47.920 --> 13:52.080
for the effect that I was not then aware of any current etched

13:52.080 --> 13:54.280
the analogy for what Monday.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.600
Colin said that Senator McCarthy was considerably upset,

13:57.600 --> 14:01.240
as he felt that my statement had told the right after Monday.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.920
I told him about it not in my intention.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.400
I said that I thought I had been more than fair

14:06.400 --> 14:10.200
to Senator McCarthy and his investigation of what Monday.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.000
I flew to New York the next morning,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.800
and again invited Senator McCarthy to Mudge.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.960
He was finally proposed that the comments I had made regarding the lack

14:18.960 --> 14:22.080
of any current etched in ours at what Monday.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.240
We finally agreed on a statement that I would make

14:24.240 --> 14:29.520
at a joint press conference which Senator McCarthy and I held following lunch.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.200
It boiled down to my saying that the Army had no evidence

14:32.200 --> 14:35.080
of current etched in ours and in making that statement.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.720
I made it clear that I was speaking only for the Army and not for the committee.

14:39.720 --> 14:43.640
This was no different in substance from my statement of November 13th

14:43.640 --> 14:46.160
to which Senator McCarthy had objected.

14:46.160 --> 14:52.160
I still have no evidence of current etched at what Monday.

14:52.160 --> 14:56.280
An un-signed memorandum of November 17 also made public March 12th

14:56.280 --> 14:58.080
by Senator McCarthy.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.240
Space was a fifth lunch in New York that I again suggested

15:01.240 --> 15:03.720
the committee go after the Navy and the Air Force.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.520
That is not true.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.360
Colonel Perry and Mr. Adams were present to us.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.760
They heard no such suggestion and are available to supply information

15:12.760 --> 15:16.400
regarding what was said at this lunch.

15:16.400 --> 15:19.440
My old boss requires me to do everything in my power

15:19.440 --> 15:21.800
for the defense of the United States.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.880
That means the most forthright and honorable dealing

15:24.880 --> 15:28.400
with the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marines.

15:28.400 --> 15:32.080
That kind of cooperation I have both given and received

15:32.120 --> 15:37.360
if confirmation is needed, I suggest you check with those services.

15:37.360 --> 15:41.280
It is a singular thing to me that this serious charge

15:41.280 --> 15:44.280
that I tried to persuade the chairman of this committee

15:44.280 --> 15:46.520
to investigate the Navy and the Air Force

15:46.520 --> 15:48.800
would kept secrets so long.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.320
Why should it have come only to life four months later

15:52.320 --> 15:57.400
on the day after the Army chronology event became public?

15:57.400 --> 16:01.600
Now as the Senator charges, Senator McCarthy charges Blackmail.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.400
This charge was included in the Senator's memorandum dated

16:04.400 --> 16:09.040
December 9th and also made public March 12th.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.960
In this case, for more than three months,

16:11.960 --> 16:16.120
this most serious charge that the chairman of this committee

16:16.120 --> 16:18.920
had been Blackmailed by the Secretary of the Army

16:18.920 --> 16:22.120
was kept secret not only from the public,

16:22.120 --> 16:25.640
but from the other members of the committee, as I understand.

16:25.640 --> 16:30.000
I do not know what the Senator had in mind when he made this charge,

16:30.040 --> 16:33.040
but during the 90 days and what he kept it to be open to.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.600
I want to order, Mr. Chairman, the Secretary

16:36.600 --> 16:40.240
and I assumed a honest mistake.

16:40.240 --> 16:45.640
However, if this is a conference referring to my being Blackmailed,

16:45.640 --> 16:47.920
there's never been a charge that I was Blackmailed.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.400
There was a charge that there was an attempt to Blackmail,

16:50.400 --> 16:52.960
a very, very unsuccessful attempt.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.040
And I think the record should be clear in that of this time.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.600
Senator, here we'll have a chance to introduce

16:56.600 --> 16:58.600
the Secretary of the Army.

16:58.600 --> 17:03.600
I do not know what the Senator had in mind when he made this charge,

17:03.600 --> 17:07.600
but during the 90 days in which he kept it secret,

17:07.600 --> 17:11.600
he continues to make flattering remarks about me and public.

17:11.600 --> 17:15.600
On December 16th, Senator McCarthy was quoted by the New York Times

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
of public.

17:16.600 --> 17:20.600
I may say, just so this will not be misinterpreted

17:20.600 --> 17:22.600
as an attack upon Secretary Steven,

17:22.600 --> 17:24.600
and those aren't who are now in charge,

17:24.600 --> 17:27.600
that they have been cooperating fully with.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.600
And I think they are just as concerned as we are

17:29.600 --> 17:32.600
about the very, very unusual picture unfolds.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.600
More and more, they are doing something about.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.600
On February 23rd, the Senator was quoted

17:37.600 --> 17:40.600
in the Washington evening star at Bob Crowley.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.600
I don't think Bob Stevens wants to come in at Jimmy Arming,

17:43.600 --> 17:45.600
any more than this committee does.

17:45.600 --> 17:49.600
On February 26th, the Washington Daily News

17:49.600 --> 17:51.600
quoted the Senator as saying, quote,

17:51.600 --> 17:54.600
I think on the overall key, referring to me,

17:54.600 --> 17:57.600
has done a very good job, unquote.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.600
On March 11th, the day before the Blacksail charge

18:00.600 --> 18:03.600
was made public, Senator McCarthy was quoted

18:03.600 --> 18:05.600
in the Washington Times held a spot.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.600
Oh, Bob Stevens is doing a good job.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.600
We have disagreed and will disagree in the future.

18:11.600 --> 18:17.600
It is impossible to do a job without having some disagreements.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.600
The occasion of the Blacksmail House first on March 12th

18:20.600 --> 18:22.600
was, of course, publication of the Arming

18:22.600 --> 18:25.600
chronological account of the Shines Fair.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.600
Never a last six days later, on March 18th,

18:29.600 --> 18:31.360
Senator McCarthy was quoted in the New York

18:31.360 --> 18:32.600
Alex Schildman in saying that he had no

18:32.600 --> 18:34.600
yield deal feelings against me.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.600
But I was a very fine fellow and honest.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.600
That's the description of a Blackmailer.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.600
The fact remains that this most serious charge

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
is still on the record.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.600
I therefore say that it has absolutely fallen.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.600
By way of summary, may I say again that I am proud

18:53.600 --> 18:56.600
to have had this chance to speak for the Army today.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.600
The Army is a plan for an important to this nation

18:59.600 --> 19:01.600
and to the friends of freedom and justice

19:01.600 --> 19:03.600
and the heat around the world.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.600
It's integrity and morale are tight with commodity in these times.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.600
And I counted a welcome duty,

19:09.600 --> 19:12.600
to testify to their soundmen here today.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.600
The Shines case is only an example of the wrongful

19:16.600 --> 19:19.600
speaking of privilege of the provoking of power.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
It has been a distraction that has kept many men

19:21.600 --> 19:24.600
from the performance of past far more important

19:24.600 --> 19:26.600
in the welfare of this country

19:26.600 --> 19:29.600
and the convenience of a single Army title.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.600
In conclusion, I want to make it clear

19:32.600 --> 19:36.600
that the United States Army does not follow communism.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.600
This committee knows that the American people know that.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.600
I share the views of Senator Leberts-Folk-Solk,

19:43.600 --> 19:46.600
chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services

19:46.600 --> 19:49.600
when he said, I'm not 24, this year.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.600
And I call him as one who has served

19:52.600 --> 19:56.600
and as a past whose children have served.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.600
I share the disbelief and the resentment itself

19:59.600 --> 20:02.600
by millions that there were either significant numbers

20:02.600 --> 20:06.600
of Americans whose loyalty was not in our finest tradition

20:06.600 --> 20:08.600
or that just loyalty was being called

20:08.600 --> 20:13.600
by the very uniform whose derelict sacrifices in Korea

20:13.600 --> 20:15.600
have spoken so eloquently.

20:16.600 --> 20:17.600
Excuse me.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.600
I'd like to announce that we will have two meetings

20:20.600 --> 20:24.600
of the Committee tomorrow morning, both in public here.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
Tomorrow, both in public here is one starting in 10th area

20:26.600 --> 20:27.600
in the morning.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.600
When they're getting a two-dirty and half-denome,

20:29.600 --> 20:32.600
there is now a person that will be our authority

20:32.600 --> 20:35.600
so we will weaken Dean at 10th area with Mr. Stevens

20:35.600 --> 20:36.600
back in the witness.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.600
Sharon, the council of the candidate,

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
please.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.600
The candidate, please.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.600
The candidate, please.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.600
The ABC Radio Network and its affiliated stations

20:46.600 --> 20:50.600
have been bringing you for the last two hours and a half.

20:50.600 --> 20:54.600
On the scene coverage, you from the Christy Army hearings

20:54.600 --> 20:56.600
direct from Lake Poccus Room

20:56.600 --> 20:59.600
in the Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.600
The Committee has just recessed for the day.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.600
Senator Muntz has called for two meetings for tomorrow,

21:04.600 --> 21:07.600
one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.600
ABC Radio again will be prepared to bring you

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
the on-the-scenes coverage of the hearings

21:12.600 --> 21:15.600
or many of these stations when the next station is scheduled.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.600
For a smoke to the testimony this afternoon was devoted

21:18.600 --> 21:21.600
to the reading of a statement by the Secretary of the Army

21:21.600 --> 21:24.600
Robert T. Stevens, also to a brief questioning

21:24.600 --> 21:28.600
of Assistant Secretary of State General Walter Beatles Smith.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.600
This program came to you from the Senate Office Building

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
in Washington.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.600
This is the ABC Radio Network.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.600
Thank you.
