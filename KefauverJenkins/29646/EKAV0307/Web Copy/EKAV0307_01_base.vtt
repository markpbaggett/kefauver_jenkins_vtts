WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
This is your center of his office in Washington.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
During the week, your community United States center did that to Steve Baller,

00:15.000 --> 00:20.300
and the stream of business, as the only one of the United States center did serve as a forward

00:20.300 --> 00:22.000
center for Steve Baller.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
I've been husting around with him the all the glorious fishing geeks.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
The biggest time this 15 minutes time for everybody to bring you this regular week to the floor.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Whenever I've been on the Washington Act, I can be used to the state by a state where the annual baseball needs to be.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
How about those in the dinner party?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Yes, Charlie.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
Baseball these days is strictly a spectator's support with me, but I used to play with these house representatives.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
I think that was one of the best statues they had over there.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
But the Senate and Tennessee were a representative.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Senator Harry Kane was the lone member of the Senate's participation.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
And I believe that he is the native of a national.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
But he moved up to the state of Washington and entered the public and party before his election to the Senate.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
I don't have leave our time run out last week before you had a chance to ask me some of those questions.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
So I'm ready for any of you to have on this list.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
One important Senator was just when I know that you just lost being at the legislature,

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
there seems to be so much energy from the part of our Tennessee friends,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
some of the discussion all around the body.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I feel that you just did the act.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Recently some of these were used by the Bruce and I.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
He said, indicate that you were finished to the surprise presentation on the National National State.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
One night, everything got into the state.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
If you agree not to investigate from Kansas City,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
this game for the second place was in the public.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
And some of the Tennessee newspapers may have a political lineup, including you for this place.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Well, I have time I interrupt at that point, Charlie.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Let me say first that I'm not running for any political office and that should be for re-elections

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
or the United States Senate from Tennessee in 1954.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
The second that I have made no political or any other kind of deal for any position or anything else.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Regarding my actions as chairman of the Senate's time investigating a committee and I will make no such deal.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
I repeat again that our committee will not shy away from Kansas City anymore

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
than we would shy away from Madisonville Tennessee as the facts warranted our attention.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Fourth, at all I know about any Tennessee political combine is what I've read in the newspaper.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
And let me say that we have a good vice president from our neighboring state of Kentucky.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm very, very fond and I'm certainly not a candidate for the nomination in 1962.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I don't want to appear blunt, Charlie, but that's how I feel about it.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Well, that's not blaming up to me.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Yes, recently, as I said, the House action favor will not be over the few original examples

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
and later post-bunch of the Senate, which contains to the few few of many of our Tennessee veterans.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
I think our veterans fans should be in a little background of S-2596.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, I first became interested in that matter when I discovered that the veterans' administration had issued regulations

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
and dangering the right of veterans to fully utilize the benefit of the GI Bill of Rights.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
The purpose of this legislation that you just referred to is to more clearly define the intention of Congress

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
out to the administration of the GI Bill of Rights by the veterans' administration.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
We're just about fallen into the practice of government regulations, rather than government law in this matter.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
And I thought that advisable to spell out the method by which the education and provisions of the GI Bill were to be administered.

03:44.000 --> 03:52.000
The effective mouth and in will be to remove much of the confusion on the part of veterans and to eliminate possible hardships on them.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
But is this Bill making these miracles not enough support in the food change schools?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Well, in a way it does, yes.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
We need a deafness policy for the veterans' administration to follow,

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
which is not subject to change or change of the wind that comes to the VA officials.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
This will enable the schools to see further ahead, which expand their facilities, who offer better courses,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
and in general to operate more efficient.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
We need to get away from this business of having a veteran enter school,

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
and then find it's training interrupted because the school he entered is later found unsatisfactory to the veterans' administration.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
I should thank if this bill becomes law, the VA will be slower to approve schools,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
and I'll be able to move back and correct their homes in the state.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm with this law, but the law is these so-called Japanese schools that are still there to get things done.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, that's not, Charlie.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
I've said all along that fly by night type of schooling, which is something in the nature of a racket,

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
gives the veteran little and nothing useful for the government's money to be eliminated.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And there are two ways this can be accomplished.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
First, by being slow to grant approvals, and secondly, by repeatedly reading out the unsatisfactory courses.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
We certainly don't want any of these, any more of these courses, and a radio,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
or a dancing, baby sitting, similar to ridiculous courses of training.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Under the new failed students will find training possible and new and advanced fields,

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
such as television, rate of radar and the life.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
As the law now stands, no school can accept veterans' training unless it has been operating for at least one year.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
This allows no leeway for progress and for new techniques.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
What is the polymeteries' situation?

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
This broadcast is made, both houses and sponges have passed the field,

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
and it's been sent to a conference to work out the manner differences in the summit and past versions.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
During the past, we've considered three more of the re-organization and strategy,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
negative departments, before it was about to start.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Senator Keefarb, would you tell us the issues involved in the results of the voting on these topics?

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Re-organization plan number seven, which has placed all its ministries,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
a party of the interstate commerce and the end of the chair.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And would it mean to take so much commission?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Yes, that's right, the interstate commerce commission.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
And what have given the president the power to appoint that chair?

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
So is it difficult to prove this plan number seven, maintain that the proposal would have had the effect of giving one man rule of the commission to the chair?

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
And it's intended to hungry by sanctioning the change, but it's given over control of the commission to the president.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Rather than that, I have it remained in the control of funds.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
Those who favor the plan, it's intended that the first basic sensible laid down by the who's the commission,

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
was that all the administrative responsibilities should be vested in the chairman of these commission.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
That's all the sake of order and efficiency, and this responsibility should follow the one person

06:58.000 --> 07:09.000
instead of to a 11-man board, all the words of these commissions that are flying around in no man's space and the government ought to be headed out and put in the administrative change.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
On this final vote, if the proposal, they go with the proposal for the re-organization of the interstate commerce commission,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
was rejected 66-13?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, I find my interruptions, or how did you vote on this, though?

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, I was one of the 13 who voted to put this part of the Hoover Commission report into effect.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
I have stated often that I say, really, is recommendations insensible and expectable for most of them.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I was merely carrying forward my pledge and my respect.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
The reason I intervoked that question was that I had understood that both labor and management,

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
at least my knowledge, the order of railroads, enough use and the things that weren't railroads,

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
had joined in opposition to the plan, especially the fantasy-like and management of real-eninthigment,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
and I thought I listened to the initiative, no matter what.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
In short, your vote disagreed with the position of both, no remanage.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation, Charlie.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
A railroad management and all of the druthers were opposed to this re-organization plan.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
However, it probably should be said that the chairman of the maritime commission,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
the federal communications commission, the federal reserve board,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
the civil aeronautics board and national labor relations board,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
are all appointed by the President.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I have seen no reason why the interstate comers commission should be given different treatment

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
and due of the success of the operation of these other board and commission,

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
with one responsible pair of parties by the President.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
One of the other plans we considered number 11 is somewhat complex.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
The general purpose of it was to formally invest in the chairman of the federal communications commission.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Same powers to administer the affairs of the commission,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
which result to be granted to him the other plan I discussed.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
In this case, however, the question of presidential appointment of the member to be a chairman was not in town.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
The president already had that authority under another law.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
This plan, though, was also defeated by a board of 50s to 23,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
and I was among 23 who favored it to touch.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Were there freshers on the use of both one-way or the other on this plan?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
The only pressure is that the board is down, Charlie,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
and that's been the pressure on all of these reorganization plans.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
That seems to be true of a average social attack.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
The only person to be here from, or those who don't want,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
is who the plan put into effect.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
But sometime these very same persons have previously suggested

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
that I vote for all of the groups that are formed because that meant the economy and the living money.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
But only three exceptions, the 25 reorganization plans coming to Congress and White House,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
followed the Hoover Recommendations.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Those who have a special interest support, any reform of the class presents, the favor of the rest.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
If we're going to achieve more efficiency and economical government,

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
we can't adopt many of these plans that are bringing the rest of those directly affected down on that here.

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
At this point in the effort, we are certainly making little progress in putting into effect these various reorganization plans.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
The year we call, Tennessee, is that coming to a big point that it brings to the states, the US-Payton.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I'll say it all, but it's all the three of us.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
In general, most of the past reaches the voting period,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
since we've done that, we have to complete this.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
The effort is made valid to invoke the coaches who limit the pay down the price and end.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
The effort is completed 50 to 30 to 60 to 40,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
so we didn't know about the six seats.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
So you stay through a position on that matter.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
Well, as I said before, I was just amigant and I was afforded to say against the limits of the states.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
But I don't think the Senate has sufficient pressure information before it is considered as matter in television.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
The Senate has set up on the description as the greatest political body in the world.

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
Once the bill is introduced, it goes to committees where it is carefully and the force is considered from every angle.

11:09.000 --> 11:19.000
Hearing Dr. Dutt did and testimony of experts representing many shades of public self are assimilated and compiled into the committee report.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
Sometimes there is undue delay between these hearings and considerations on the Senate's floor.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
The committee will take a year testimony and make a supplement on the court.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
The matter is clear that we all know it is a small moving process,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
and the United States Senate will disclose the moving of the small moving process.

11:37.000 --> 11:46.000
But for some strange reason, the latest testimony and hearings available on this important bill is more than seven months old.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Certainly, there is new thought on this question.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
Grad into toggle last week, the Honorable Jonathan Daniel, who agreed, had a clear of these,

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
of a news and a preserveer as well in North Carolina, and a great friend of Joseph and Truman, and of the administration.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
He made a speech finding out the new reason for this plan is more bad and good.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
And, under the Holland of Florida, who has been serving in the Senate 14 years, stated that he had never written safe,

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
previous situations where a bill courageously floor particles, without recent hearings and testimonies.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
Certainly, that is an important matter and I urge my colleagues to lay aside this measure until some speed hearings,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
and be completed by the committee.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Hi, Mr. Bennett.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
If you don't use any English, please send me a little bit of good comments on this.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
Well, well, I've put it as jolly and the thick skin covering on that football is wearing off the sand with the people's faces.

12:41.000 --> 12:51.000
And after we have a letter calling attention to the state and made on a previous letter, the effect of post office departments is that the die of the railroads in Halein.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Yes, I do, jolly. It was an unfortunate sentence just due to the cause of slip-up.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
What I should have said was that the government gave these substitutes rather than the post office department.

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
But in regard to railroads, the payment is set by the interstate comers commission on the basis of reasonable returns to the railroads.

13:09.000 --> 13:23.000
The transportation for air mail is set in the state by the double aeronautics authority on the basis of development of commercial airlines, promotion of the national defense, and of course, the same as the carrying the mail.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
At any rate, the United States government is seeing an estimated $120 million annually for the transportation of mail.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
I appreciate that error and interpretation of the sentinel.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And at that time, it's back to you, Senator Scott.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Once again, thank you for your hands.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
We have heard the nuclear report of Senator Scott from your Senator Scott.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
We hope you have done this next week and this year, so next time you're cheese.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
We'll hear next from the other folks.
