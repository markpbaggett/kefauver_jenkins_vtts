00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
This is now the fraudulent, the appropriate ones to interrogate about these new aspects.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
And so he feels that he will take no further time in trying to interrogate Mr. Louis.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
How about the relevance of which he was sent to the trans little belt, requiring him to think

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
of the thumbs of the public and to this case.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm an introduction at the chairman.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Mr. Chairman, may I monitor what it will be for you, or why the personal privilege you have

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
to do me?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
At any time, the chair or any other member of this committee were cared to take the matter

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
of my serving on this committee to the Senate floor.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I would be happy to be on the Senate floor.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
At any time, anybody is surprised about anything that I ever said or do or write.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
I would be happy to take that to the Senate floor also.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Mr. Chairman.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
When I looked forward, if I may just finish my statement.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Now I look forward at that time to the presence of the chairman and the junior senator from Wisconsin.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
So, through our new care, we've learned a lot of the question I've raised and has to respond.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
As far as he could withdraw, he made no statements or information about taking anything to the Senate floor.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
He stated in very honest conviction that these developments today have been accomplished,

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
surprised to him, and have kept some new lights on the whole country, which he knew nothing of until

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
18 months ago.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
The chairman made the chairman say one more thing, because today I want to comment on the surprise.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
The secretary of the Army works for the secretary of defense in the line.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
The secretary of defense works for President Eisenhower in the line.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
The deputy attorney general works for the attorney general in the line.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
The attorney general works for the president of the United States in the line.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
I am a Democrat, but I am also an American.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Both of these people came to me and asked me to give them help with respect to a problem,

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
which they felt might well destroy any Army, and I gave them that help, and I did it with conviction.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
However, as soon as I heard it would be hearing that one of the gainer mine, the chair,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
I have not discussed anything in any way with any of the president.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
The secretary of defense works for the president of the United States in the line.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
I have a saying that he is ready to be ready to be in general, and we will have to proceed.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
The chairman is one of the first to propose.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
You will say it.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Again, I am only afraid of 30 seconds.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I believe the senator's timing can stay with I like to.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Remind the chair that as well I removed myself from this mini-vom fairly, and I did not make the senator do it.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Senator's timing can be the loudest voice.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
I believe that the senator's timing should not serve because I had great judge of the case.

02:44.000 --> 02:53.000
I think in all honesty, should have at that time told us that prior to that he admitted statement to the secretary of the Army and I agreed.

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
If you and I are going to work this together, work this together, I mean to get the staff of my committee and get the chairman and stop the hearing.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
And I get hosted over the weekend.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
The senator Missouri decides to take the same action, I just namely remove himself from this committee.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
The chairman, let's not...

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I think the conclusion is thrown into this record.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
I think Senator McCarthy is aware of the fact that what he is reading related to General's liquor and not to the hearing.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Let's keep the facts straight in this thing.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
This is long before hearing was set up this February 20th.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
And may I say to the chair, that it is always wise not to pass judgment until all evidence is been.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
And the chairman has said a new light has been cast, but I don't know that a new light can be cast until all the light is there.

03:45.000 --> 03:55.000
I have sort of a recollection, Mr. Chairman, that there is some hesitancy on the part of some to put the telephone calls into the record.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Mr. Cohn is a very able lawyer.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
He knows that an executive order has been issued.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
And that the president of the United States has said firmly.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
He said firmly that he will not back down on that order.

04:10.000 --> 04:20.000
The order provides that no calls within the executive branch, memorandum or any kind of information can be turned over to this committee.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
If you don't want your phone calls in all you have to say is that I'm not going to let my calls in on left,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
unless all of the calls within the executive branch goes in.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
That's an easy legal technicality to hang your hat on and get off from under.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
May I cite an American people at this point?

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
No senator on this committee attached a legal technicality to getting his calls in.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
Every senator on this committee agreed to put the calls in whether or not such calls within the executive branch might not come in.

04:57.000 --> 05:07.000
I think it's always right, it's always fair, and it's always just to reserve comment on evidence in a given area.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
In this area it has to be monitored phone calls until you get all the monitored calls in.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
That relate to that area which can be entered into evidence.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And I think that the American people are pretty wise.

05:22.000 --> 05:33.000
They know what the story is here, and that is that's all of the parties that now agree to put them in except Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry to go along with this tonight.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
So I have to make another point of personal privacy in the end.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
I would like to know what the chairman of parliament really is for specifically what the point of personal privacy is.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
The point of making plan of this from now on, I'm not sure if that's the answer to Mr. Jackson's statement,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
but I say I'm completely unfair. If he does not know me, I'm not the same.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
No, I will not give you my life, I'm wish part of my statement some for him.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
May I say yes?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yes sir.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Thank you.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
I stated on the first day that I was in principle all of the role going in.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
And at that time, there was no presidential director.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
I know we, ever for the least, that all of the role could not wait one to come in.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
And I said that kindly on the public record.

06:16.000 --> 06:25.000
I believe I was the first person arrested to sign a written sentence to get any monitor call in which I was involved to Mr. Jackson's statement.

06:26.000 --> 06:35.000
At that time, sir, I requested the saying generally that the army similarly supply other relevant calls to Mr. Jenkins and his state.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Now, there are just a few more to take one point of time.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
But let's take one point of the time. I'm a really part of my time.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
So, you have the current presidential issue, can you go out with that?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
No, I just want to get one point of view.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Where am I?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Where am I?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Where am I?

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
I said, after 20 years, there was no presidential director at all.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
We said, all of the calls could come in.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
And there was no reading this bad time, where they all were not coming.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
The second point is that at a meeting, I was the first person to sign a written sentence and I believe giving the call to Mr. Jenkins.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
At that time, I heard and produced the day of other relevant calls to Mr. Jenkins' insistence.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
There was no presidential director.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
But the army still, one of the things that Mr. Adams still felt,

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
to produce the other calls on the removal of general law on the other,

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
he said, I have for them today and today, I said, where are the other calls to make a global wave?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
There was no presidential director at that time.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
There was a calling for a truly curious, I think I know the truly curious,

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
when all those were not present and when there was no presidential director.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
I was now at the last point of interest, at too many calls,

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
I, by the way, just as I was saying here, there are no one of his calls between Mr. Adams and myself.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
The calls between the citizens of myself have been fully testified to as far as I know.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm this decision on the witness's standing, so there is nothing very big to say.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Some of the things to which he referred, we make the other calls,

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
which he would tell from this committee before the presidential director came about.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Now, there's a very simple political.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
All that has to happen here is that over the weekend, Mr. Davids and Mr. Adams

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
can get permission to have these calls already mentioned, already referred to.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
Go into the record along with the others, and with my original consent given the very first day,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
my call, which are no secret because they've already been testified to,

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
will be the first call to be read into the record here.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Now, that's very plainly the slide position has been all along,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
and I think it's a completely fair position and one that can be worked out.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, Mr. Cohn, let me just answer an early play.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And can I say a session if you're not taking it out of your mind?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Let me just answer that very briefly.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
You're reverting out of the first day when you knew that there was a tremendous number of calls,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
some of them were indicated to be in the defense, probably,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
between Mr. Stevens and the White House,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
and that if you make a motion or agree to put in all calls,

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
then obviously you never get a call between the White House and the Secretary,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
and so by agreeing to all calls and stipulating on all calls, it wouldn't all go in.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
That was the first instance.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
The Melisbee absolutely fair about this.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
The Senators on this committee waived all these technicalities.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
They're not going back to the beginning of these hearings.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
The Senators on this committee forgot about the executive order and said,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
well, if that's it, all right, we'll still agree to our call.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
No, I can't that be accomplished.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
And if it seems to me that it's quite apparent here that if all of the Senators on this committee agree,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
we'll put our calls in whether or not all of the other calls go in or not.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
Now, I think it's very apparent and very obvious that when you attach a condition,

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
which you know makes it impossible for the call to go in,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
then it's obvious that the call will not go in.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And I think that's pretty apparent.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
I think it'll be the way to get the floor.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I've been trying here for two days to try to get these calls all this little brown paper

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
and put them in the public records.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Now, if I had a personal privilege, I'd say it's personal to get to me.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
No, no, it's just I'm the person.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
If you're planning to get the pay, you wouldn't use my phone.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
It's after five o'clock now, this is the end of the year.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
And I think that the anonymous consent that the council may read my...

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
the monitor's telephone conversation and we get that all the way anyway.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I agree.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
You know, you're an anonymous consent to your 50 boys.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
The caravan stated that you had the infection or any counsel now reached the monitoring conversation

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
between Senator Potter and the Railways and all.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
I heard no objection. The council was able to deliver some of your exchange seats to Mr. Rose.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Mr. Cameron, I knew it was as loud as it was possible.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
And Mr. Rose, I'm a last-key to think.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Please have a seat.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
This year transcript of the monitor telephone call, calls Mr. Rose,

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
has received the exchange between Senator Potter and the six-day of the Army and following closely in.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And I will ask you whether or not I have those calls directly.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
This is State of February 20th, 9.59.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
Second day of the Army, both Senator Charles Potter, second day of the Army.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I was trying to find out, obviously, where Senator McKenzie was,

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
but I thought it was only saying appropriate to tell him I was calling on members of these committee on the...

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
of these committee on the hill, but I did not...

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
I didn't find out until this morning.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
So, you are, which was the 10-Eightful Cell in Albany.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
So, I called on the phone and told him I called on those members of the committee I could sign

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
because I was terribly distressed about this thing, particularly in connection with General D'Aikor,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
and he said, quote,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
you mean the saying he's not going to appear, quote, quote, and I said quote.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm just not willing to produce that sort of a suspicious time, quote, quote.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Of course, you're going to like the things you have completely needed in your face to be erring over.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm not a governor, too.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
And he was showing me before the Americans, he'd do what kind of a guy I am.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
And finally, he said quote, we accept his adenance.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Hope the press gets my pronunciation of that R.S.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
and editorialize nice to respect him on this pronunciation.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
quote, we accept his adenance, the ten of problems and one of the sides, much.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
He said quote, are you refusing, quote, quote, I said quote, time not refusing?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I'm taking it under advisement, quote, quote.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Where is that?

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
You're subpoenaed for ten o'clock Tuesday morning, quote, quote, quote, any hunt up the phone.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
I got off the talk to the members of the committee and I've already talked to everybody.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
That call came to soon first and I want to talk with Carl soon,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
but I thought I would bring you all up to date on this thing.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
That's where it is now, Senator Butter.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Where were you supposed to appear?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Secretary of the Army, you didn't say.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I would assume and I suppose I would get a subpoena.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I presume it would be a meeting of the Third Committee here in Washington.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
You didn't say anything about New York and I am certainly not going to New York

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
and if I were to say anything to the Secretary of the First Minister,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Senator Butter, what would they ever have to say about it?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Secretary of the Army, every setting is going to get into the things

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
and gotta get a hold of you and see what to do about this business.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
And I can't do anything more than 14 facts.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I want to give you please, thought Mr. Weatherman,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
it is wise to meet in case this time.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I'll find out if they could probably be.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
A mail hand may be issued for not appearing at this particular time.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I'll give you all the thing you know, Senator Butter.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
I've been contacted by everything Carl and we'll see what can be done.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Mr. Rote, have I heard not correctly read the...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
The matter is that you left telephone call?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
You have to.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And you say that you took that telephone call?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Yes, sir.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
Does that Mr. Rote, in your opinion, substantially the context of that call?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yes, sir.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
And does it in your opinion, Charlie and I can really represent the substance of the conversation

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
between the two gentlemen to that conversation?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Yes, sir.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I read you...

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
No, no.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Thank you, Mark.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I'll ask you and I'll change it to...

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Before you do so, Mr. Rote, is or not, but the only telephone call

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
is exchanged between Senator Butter and the sick of the Army.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Monitored by you?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Yes, sir.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I'll ask you to that same thing with Mr. Lucas.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
So look as do you have before you the transcript of a monitor telephone call

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
between the sick day of the Army and Senator Butter, 81 March 1954, 9.45 A.M.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Yes, sir.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Did you take it?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yes, sir.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Is it not his correct or substantially so?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes, sir.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Not verbatim, sir.

14:38.000 --> 14:45.000
Not in your opinion, sir, Charlie and actually represent the substance of the conversation

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
fighting between those gentlemen at that time.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yes, sir.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Do you follow me as I read that transcript, Mr. Lutson?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Yes, sir.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
One March 1954, 9.45 A.M. Senator Butter, phone, sick day of the Army.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Check day, see them.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
See them.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Before you say anything, I want to say I am most grateful for what you have done.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
You really responded when the chips were down, and as long as I live I will never forget it.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
And if it would have been possible for you to attend that lunch in meetings,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
things would not have come out as it is.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.000
Butter, paper's over and I found out there, that it was over and I found out there,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
in fact, in the city.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Yes, they re-each.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
We react well, letters are all together.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
We react into it.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I've been ticking myself ever since we're not making some other arrangements.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
See them.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
Give them wonderful, Charlie, but it has been a terribly rough thing to go through the butter.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
What is it this morning?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Have you any idea of Steven?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yes.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
And hearing this morning is, I think, a 1G-I who I believe is a communist.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
We know all about him, and Charlie is this one of these things.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
It was not a question of discovering it.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
We know it.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Butter, you need all the higher Siemens.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
I would have had a chance to check it yet this morning, so far it is in town.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
He was up and big.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
He is here now, and he has got his own councillor.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
As a matter of fact, he has got his councilor.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
And he said we don't supply councillor the communist assembly to space.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
I'm pretty certain that if he was like to know who the five doctors,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
is that right Mr. Wilkins?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Yes, Mr. Spirits.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Butter, is my understanding of the policy has been in it?

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
And I think quite properly so that as far as the communists,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
he is not exempt from the services.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Steven, no one can not do that.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
We cannot do it.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Butter, as long as you know who he is, then you can march into the same room.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Steven, that is exactly what we did.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
We cannot take the position as he befell us as he is a communist,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
he is exempt from military service.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Butter, how does the government move for a period as we came?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
And I thought maybe after the letter part of the week's time,

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
when things jail a little more, maybe just the two of us.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I have a couple of suggestions I would like to make.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
But it's not close to having to be treated as a suggestion here.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
Because I, by the way, exactly how to operate and I need to suggest you.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Just butter, maybe we can have lunch together.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm going to New York tonight and there are some things I would not like to talk with me about along this line.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
And I will meet you with mine, the two patients.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
If you would offer a bar,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
who would you go up with me?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I would go up about four and be back in the morning.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Steven, certainly I will be leaving right now, the powder.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
And I didn't come back to our office about when we will be going.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Steven, as long as I live, I will never forget it.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
When I issued my first statement, you came out with the board of debt.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
And when the crisis came out and said I was a liar, you came to bed right off,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and came to my besties.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Butter, you're the terrible thing that is happening.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
I was welcome to the receiving of the gifts.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
I'd also like to take advantage of the situation to think in on what has happened

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
because in the effort to cooperate with the debt administration, I was pretty surprised.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
And I know I didn't reflect any credit on this administration.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
And I would like to find out some of the suggestions how we can recover some of this world's gap.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
When easy to say is to say...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Well...

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Looking really bad, looking really naughty.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
Let's say to the devil with it, how's that?

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Is that the... is that the thing I can make an even easier?

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
If you've made it to us, this is a care...

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I don't want to come anyway.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Of course, but I don't think that is right for this administration.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I've taken a lot of reviews, and I suppose I will think a lot more.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
There's one exception, Mary, which I have substituted today.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
A mild word for one, perhaps, slightly harder.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Have I heard not correctly written?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
The monitoring of that columnist is moving.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
I believe that about the...

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
No.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
The fixable fitter, fixed lines from the end.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I wasn't sure I heard you.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
From the... in the beam, yes sir.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
The figure means that there's fixed lines.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And I know it doesn't bring like any credit.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I wasn't sure what it means that's better than that.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
All I read is again.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
I'd like to welcome the opportunity to receive your suggestions.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
I'd like to take advantage of the situation that came to me in on what has happened.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
It's a cause in an effort to cooperate with this administration.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I was crucified.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
And I know it's written, reflect any credit on this administration.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Is that the question you lay up to?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I think I read it correctly.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
How about I not tolerate this statement correctly in this entirety with the exception of one word?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
You know what I mean?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
My order is some suggestions.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Yes sir.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Which in no wise change the meaning of it?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yes sir.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Mr. Lucas, I was at two calls.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
What I have read.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
One being monitored by Mr. Rhodes and the lights and the same monitor,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
but you only call,

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
I think, between the senator from Michigan's Sengapotter and the Secretary of the Army,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
with her monitor as far as you know.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Yes sir.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't know whether the question is Mr. Chairman.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I'm not a bother.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
The order still that the conversation might make a little more sense.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
I think I should make a short statement.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
The weapons to Davis at first,

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
the second to the conversation, the one that Mr. Lucas monitored,

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
was following the so-called chicken luncheon on the all famous memorandum

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
of understanding the vision,

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
so that the weapons were to the reaction

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
to what the statement was understanding.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
And, quite some later on,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
quite some later,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Davis first,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
or a luncheon together with Mr. Steven,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
was never a trail.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
But,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
the terrible thing is that he had a meeting with,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
from the time he was in,

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
and the contract,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
that's when the contract has a lead to catch a claim,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
that we would reach,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
yes, that we would reach as close to five o'clock as we could.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And, I think there are other senators,

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
or principals,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
who want to ask unanimous consent to have their hearings read

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
into the record of this time,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
a senator poverty,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
by the chair believes that we should reach it,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
so he just wants to make that statement now.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
And,

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
come on, Mr. Chairman,

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
thank you very much.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
So,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I think here a little bit,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
number one, I just got a message from,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
thank you, I think,

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
to be expected,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
he will send to have a telephone call,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
which Mr. Steven made,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
and, again,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
all of us, the statements tonight,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
he's in the meeting.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Dave, I told the 21st,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
incident to the record,

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
with no conditions,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
it's a touch for whatsoever.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I'm trying to reach Mr. Caragel and give minutes,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
I would suggest this, sir.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
We can see over the weekend whether or not,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Mr. Steven and Mr. Adam

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
can get an agreement,

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
that's a call,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I have listed by state,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
which would testify for one before the presidential director,

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
but not say,

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
it's,

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
it's not say,

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
it's an inevitable.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
I think, by Monday,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
whether they can go in for one,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I will have a consent from Mr. Caragel,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
so let's roll on all the whole down material,

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
can be right into the right,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and even though there is going to be a withholding,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
a call by Mr. Steven in the thoracic,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
we want everything run out,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
by in no matter what,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
we think it would be much better

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
if everything went,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
if everything doesn't go away,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
and I can hold the way,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
the same is going,

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
everything from outside,

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
so,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and if we continue that way,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
that'll be all right,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
if I,

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
we would like a lay of effort,

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
to get these other balls put in the record,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
at the same time.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Mr. Chairman,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I just want to ask Paul,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and I'm the acting department of calls.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Chairman Chairman, I have,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
call 1-2-3-4-5-6,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
page of the call here.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
There are some relations,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
but I will not fulfill them.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
I have no for special requests,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
they go in tonight.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I've got to leave for Wisconsin very shortly,

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
we're celebrating the 100th anniversary of the,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
creation of the Republican Party tomorrow.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
I would like to,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
as well as my friends,

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
I would like to thank you for the great pleasure,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
and I'm on the team.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
That's right, it's something that's there.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I would like to thank you.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm going to like knock the top of the food,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
like you have a number two.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Can I say that, Mr. Chairman,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
before we adjourn?

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I want to declare that the,

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
first of the Mr. Coles may have,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
uh, my, uh,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
will not disagree with you.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Have been made against my advice.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I feel that, uh,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
I can play with a stacked deck.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
I advise my staff not to,

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
I advise the staff not to put in any monetary calls

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
but in anything,

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
that's what gets the calls from,

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
uh, low Rogers,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
who is the deputy attorney general,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
who must pass upon the sevens,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
pass upon the questions of contempt,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
what have you,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
about, uh, after talking to everyone,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
was, uh, Roy Cohen,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
he feels that, uh,

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
he is also willing to play with the stacked deck,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
if he wants to, uh, I feel like him,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I think if he wants to,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
it's up to him so apparently,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
all of the calls that we have will go in,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
even though we never get,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
they call within Mr. Rogers

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
and Mr. Simington,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
even though Mr. Simington insists

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
upon sitting as a judge,

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
after,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm listening to one of that matter now,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
because it's just about that kind of thing.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I will, I say to the sheriff,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
or to the staff,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
and I'll be ready money morning,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Mr. Chairman,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
please stand in the recess,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
to the 10th of October,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Monday morning.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
You have just heard Chairman Montenaw,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
will be at 10 a.m. Monday.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
