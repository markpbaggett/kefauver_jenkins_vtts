WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I wonder if it would be possible for me to see something.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.400
I have heard about it, and if somebody has been leaking about it, but I would like to

00:12.400 --> 00:17.400
see the report on shine sometime, if the army is willing to release it.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.600
Secretary Stevens, Stuart, I doubt very much what they are.

00:22.600 --> 00:27.840
Whatever they have got on that would have to be pulled together and so forth and so on.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.840
Senator Simington, I understand it.

00:29.840 --> 00:35.080
It has been pulled together, and I don't want to see it pulled apart before we get a chance

00:35.080 --> 00:36.560
to look at it.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.560
Naturally, it is a great interest to us.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.360
Secretary Stevens, close me.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.320
I doubt very much whether it would be available, Stuart.

00:45.320 --> 00:50.560
Senator Simington, you see we have a right to, under the rules of the committee, as they

00:50.560 --> 00:53.880
now stand, to approve all staff members.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.680
I don't imagine we could ask for it.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.800
Secretary Stevens, I am sure you have plenty of rights.

00:59.800 --> 01:06.600
But actually, I don't know where it is, what shape it is in, or if it is available, Stuart.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.040
Senator Simington, I know it has been made.

01:10.040 --> 01:14.160
Secretary Stevens, I don't have anything at all myself.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.200
Senator Simington, have you seen the report by Secretary Stevens?

01:18.200 --> 01:23.120
Because Adams has been handling the contract with the committee, and most of the contract

01:23.120 --> 01:25.880
has been with him.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.880
Senator Simington, have you seen it?

01:28.880 --> 01:34.000
Secretary Stevens, I would know of certain things that Adams has transported to me, but

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
have transpired.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.600
Senator Simington, is it a higher authority than that I would have to go to to get a look

01:41.600 --> 01:43.800
at it, Secretary Stevens?

01:43.800 --> 01:47.400
First of all, I would have to look and see what is there.

01:47.400 --> 01:52.600
And then, when I did see what is there, it would certainly be a matter that would be

01:52.600 --> 01:55.200
of interest to the Department of Defense.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.440
Secretary Simington, I will not let you down.

01:58.440 --> 02:02.840
I don't want to push you on it, but we have got a problem.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.200
The whole staff picture is a problem for everybody.

02:06.200 --> 02:11.360
Secretary Stevens, I personally think that anything in that line would prove to be very

02:11.360 --> 02:12.360
much exaggerated.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
That would be my opinion.

02:13.360 --> 02:21.800
In other words, I think there has been some talk around, but it has been, I just can't

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
do your thing with him.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.800
Would you read that last minute?

02:23.800 --> 02:33.800
Secretary Stevens, I personally think that anything in that line, would you comment on

02:33.800 --> 02:34.800
that?

02:34.800 --> 02:39.800
When you went on from yesterday, Senator Simington, I don't want to push you on it, but we

02:39.800 --> 02:40.800
have got a problem.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.280
The whole staff picture is a problem for everybody.

02:44.280 --> 02:50.160
Secretary Stevens, I personally think that anything in that line would prove to be very

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
much exaggerated.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.160
That would be my opinion.

02:53.160 --> 02:59.120
In other words, I think there has been some talk around that has been very much exaggerated

02:59.120 --> 03:01.640
over anything that is there.

03:01.640 --> 03:06.720
I am the Secretary, and I have had some talks with the committee and the chairmen and

03:06.720 --> 03:07.720
so on.

03:07.720 --> 03:12.920
And by and large, as far as the treatment of me is concerned, I have no personal complaint.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.560
In other words, when he got after swickers, of course, then I hired.

03:18.560 --> 03:24.440
But as far as I personally am concerned, I don't have a lot of stuff so far as my contact

03:24.440 --> 03:27.440
with Joe or the committee is concerned.

03:27.440 --> 03:33.160
Senator Simington, I have no personal problem either, but you see that situation operates

03:33.160 --> 03:38.560
as a TV, and you and John told me some of the things that have been said by the fellows

03:38.560 --> 03:40.560
that are still active.

03:40.560 --> 03:45.160
I am not looking for trouble, but apparently I can't run from it.

03:45.160 --> 03:52.160
Incidentally, I would appreciate this being clouded between you and me.

03:52.160 --> 03:59.960
I have heard that the Army now is pulling back at this one of the reports because it is

03:59.960 --> 04:00.960
not just for the Army.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.960
So, Terry Steven, Mr. Chairman, I am not here.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.200
By the end, that is the point that I wanted to be five in between him and me.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.280
And otherwise, not me, you can quite contact, but that is the point.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.760
I ask him to consider five in the fact that I heard that the Army was pulling back on

04:15.760 --> 04:16.760
the shine reports.

04:16.760 --> 04:21.760
So, Terry Steven, I don't know about that.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.760
I don't know anything here that is not good for the Army.

04:24.760 --> 04:29.200
Mr. Chairman, there is one of the minutes that it is a clear assignment that is going to

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
be explained.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.200
We are looking at some very, very important cross-examination of him and his family.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.000
What I have to do is reveal you serious about him as well.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I think you are 10 minutes all around.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I think it is a good time to give him a big round of applause.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
You have a good answer to the air, Bill.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
We will come here from around Missouri.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Think of Sam, this one.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
This is an extremely important day to that.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
Chairman, there should be no other option this time than the reaching of the offensive.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I see so exciting things.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I know how about this.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
It is a bloody trip.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
If there is any way we could get the facts without mentioning talking to you.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I will speak to the chairman.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I have seen him.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
He is down south somewhere.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I was suggest that we get the report.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I would like to see it.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
But if we can't have it, I would urge that the way it was in the beginning to be the way

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
it is now.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I must look at the calamity and the rough she gets.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
I desire to read the next paragraph being a conversation with the Secretary of the Army

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
and the Stevens.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I ask you to follow me closely.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It is a lot of stuff.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
It is not a question of bothered, but I have more important things to do in my opinion than that particular thing.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I don't see any particular knowledge of it.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I don't think there is too much to leave.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
I think it has been a lot of talk.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't think there is too much more.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
That would be my guess.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
However, I can talk to Adam and find out what I can see.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Mr. Lucas, did I read that paragraph correctly with the exception of the submission of two

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
educations?

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
There are one sentence ended and I don't think there is too much there.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
There is too much more.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We have a line from the end of the paragraph.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I don't think there is too much to leave.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Too much there.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I don't think there is too much to leave.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
The company that the chair has said too much there.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
I think there is too much there.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I think there is too much there.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
As you can see, I have been identified that Mr. Lucas tweeted with the adjective deleted.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
When you read it as you have it, there is a short paragraph.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
The two educations which I believe in.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
That's very simple.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
It is a lot of stuff.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
It is not a question of bothered, but I have more important things to do in my opinion than that particular thing.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I don't see if I have any particular knowledge of it.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I don't think there is too much to it.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I think it has been a lot of talk.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I don't think there is too much there.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
That would be my guess.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
However, I can talk to Adam and find out what I can say.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
The full proceeding of Mr. Lucas, you agree with me that the issue of those two educations has been changed.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
In no wise change is the meaning of that paragraph.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yes, sir.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yes, sir.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Can we proceed?

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
Senator Simonton, I will be glad to talk to him myself.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Secretary Steven, let me talk to him myself.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Senator Simonton, we now have a council on the committee.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And the rules have been materially changed.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
And everybody takes responsibility for the establishment of the staff.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And that interest may.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
Secretary Steven, I don't know any reason why you can't take an interest in the staff quite a few years.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
But I have quite a part from what we are talking about.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Is that the full context of that conversation, Mr. Luther?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
No sir, thanks.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Mr. Luther, please go to court.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Senator Simonton, this time, into it and you and your in-gen talks to me.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Secretary Steven, I will talk to your in-gen.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Senator Simonton, if you will do that as your discretion, I would appreciate it.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Secretary Steven, and I will call back to you.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Is that it?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Yes, sir.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Is that all?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Do you have no other monitor telephone call?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
No sir.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
As far as you know, either one is left on Mr. Rhodes and the one just left on you.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
All of the monitor telephone calls are the past between the sectors.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And Senator Simonton?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
No sir, I have no further questions.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Thanks, the witnesses.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay, madam.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, I'll proceed with the, I can make sure I say this.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Correct.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
The chair has not been saying that we are now proceed with the tenors go round.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
The chair has been in some assignment and premises, like in the case of statement.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Following the meeting of the country after the statement by Senator Simonton,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
and the chair will be the first one to ask questions to move around table.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Senator Norman, Mr. Chairman, I would say, please.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Senator, the chair has been in some assignment.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
There's one other, no one has agreed.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
There's one of the first more programs.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
There's one of the first more programs.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
There's one of the first more programs, Mr. Chairman.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Very important, when I think.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
And I think Mr. Simonton should have in mind when he makes his statement.

09:10.000 --> 09:18.000
We know, find the man with the academic advice that Mr. Steven was, Mr. Clark Clifford.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
You don't find that.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I told you that.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
You came up in that.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I know, too.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
And I asked you, you told me.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Mr. Chairman, the only one was the matter of personal privilege.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I may take you by personal privilege.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Mr. Clark Clifford, the top stage to present a human.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
I'm not prepared to let Mr. Simonton make a statement to Mr. Steven,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
the two and I, and work together, I met.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
And then letter to statement, I want to keep this quiet.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Mr. Simonton, I just qualified myself for something that's good.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Mr. Chairman.

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
Mr. Simonton has never told the estimate that he had a working arrangement with Mr. Steven,

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
that he was getting one of the top eights of personal privilege around the show.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
And I may say, Mr. Chairman, that is the document show very clearly.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Mr. Simonton came back on the committee to try on a way.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
Our attempts to expose communist, good and forthrightism administration in common,

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
deep in statement, Mr. Chairman.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
In common on the place.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
He should have given these facts to this committee.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
He can't consistently sit here as a fair judge.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
After he has said to Mr. Steven, I will get you a top-democratic lawyer number one.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And number two, he says you and I must work together.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And Mr. Chairman, I think, said they come here to Missouri.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
Without any motion on the pilot committee, should have this time promptly disqualified himself

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
because he has rarely disqualified.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
And I can now understand why he objected so strongly to having these matters in the record.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
And also, Mr. Chairman, we find here the statement that Mr. Rogers is on our side.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
We have been in touch with him.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Mr. Rogers is a man, Mr. Chairman.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Who must pass upon questions of evidence?

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Who must pass upon questions of his past, of his appropriates?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Mr. Chairman, I ask now.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
And I formally request that Mr. Rogers needs the penis to take this stand.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
And if he wants to take some privilege, but having do it, number two, Mr. Chairman.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
I ask that Mr. Sannington be requested to do what the Republican members of this committee have done.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Mainly in all these things, the in honesty of taking this stand right there,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
and subject themselves to crossing regulations.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
What the first thing he should do is disqualify himself.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Here's Mr. Sannington.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Well, Mr. Chairman, I've listened carefully to this dry drive

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
because his son is doing it with confidence.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
And my opinion is just another diversion.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
Before he tries to get me to take a position with respect for this committee,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
I would suggest that he goes through with what he said today about putting any gunballs

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
and see to it that the calls of his two staff members are also put in.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Now, because...

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
... some assignment has a farce.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Now, I've been calling, he brings up the name of Mr. Clark for the five of his current.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
I think it's in the order for me to say how much the clerk got into my conversation.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Not also, like I say, and I have been in the government for a long time.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I'm not having an assignment.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
You have to wait for me, but you've got to get a job.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And I cannot proceed without interruption.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
I would always go and go for anything I say because I always tell it's true.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And I think we're wrapping it again into a point.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
The Federal Senate gets a size, some of the paracters that the Senate brings up.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
And I was saying before, interruption is a very strong voice.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Mr. Clark, flipper, is my friend.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
The Secretary of the Army came to me.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
He was a fast-paced diplomat.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
The way the Union's down there from Wisconsin, the panel, General Quicker,

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
has seriously impaired the morale of the United States Army.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And he asked me for help.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
Why he came to me, particularly instead of some of his brothers, some American colleagues,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I don't know, but in telecom, I keep visiting his father.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
And I find him to get a good lawyer.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And he asked me if I knew a good lawyer.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I said, yes, I did.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I didn't.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
The lawyer is not recommended to him, Mr. Clifford.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
That is the way that he got into this case.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
All I would like you to do before going abroad was send up ready on a trip

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
that we have just reported on, was not to see anybody else's panels.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
In the way that Secretary Stevens told me that General Quicker had been handled.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
I might add, based on my trip abroad, putting it mildly,

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
the reaction was detrimental to the morale of the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Now, I was anxious to see, as I say, that none of these hearings,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
as much as I was back, what a committee at this time, for help,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
and I was very sure I stripped the Europe.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
I must have told him, and if I may proceed with my statement,

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
which I was also interrupted on, since that I'm a coffee agree,

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
to put his telephone calls in the record.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
I would also move that the committee now has met a call and call,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
whether it's individuals and employees of this committee,

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
they will consent to the introduction of their phone calls in the public record.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
I know that these phone calls are for me as employees of the committee,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
and they claim for sure it's a committee business,

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
and they obviously contain relevant and necessary information for this investigation

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
if we are going to get it the truth.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
If message call and call or accuse, to permit their phone calls to be made a part of the public record,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
I know the committee consider whether they should be subject to dismissal

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
as employees of the committee, just as any other federal employee,

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
with old relevant and vital information to congressional hearing is subject to dismissal.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
And I know the committee consider whether they should be dismissed

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
or subject to disciplinary action in the event they refuse.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
These men are not seven of my coffee employees, they are employees of the committee.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
They cannot take seven of my coffee's directions,

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
is against the directions of the committee, in matters of committee that I met the chairman of the committee.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
My statement, my call or the render record, I call on those who are flexible in this case,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
and not judges to put theirs in the record.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Nice thank you.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Mr. Mr. Chairman, I'll proceed with the ten minutes.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Go around.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Mr. Chairman, you'll fight a water?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Mr. Chairman.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I would like to ask Mr. Chairman whether or not the center of Missouri

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
is willing to accept going or holds another cross example of him,

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
who for example is driving his statement, and the deal with a clever judgment.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Mr. Chairman, it's not a plain water.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
You might take up in your ten minutes, please.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Mr. Chairman, it's a question of the chair.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
It's not a plain water.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
It's a question of the chair, like the minute.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
You make it at your own ten minute time, our rule.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Say they have to be a plain water or a plain water for a small public.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I reckon you would.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Mr. Chairman, I believe you.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Because I thought you would.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I don't want to let you in now saying it's not a plain water.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Chairman, I believe that's the matter of personal privilege.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Mr. Chairman, I think that's the matter of personal privilege.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
So the seven centers here are setting as judges of my staff and of me.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
The third is an image which is found true, who will resolve them ruining their reputation.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Two young men who had my staff.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
We now find Mr. Chairman.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I think this is a matter of personal privilege.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
That's one of the judges who refuses to take the oath, refuse to disqualify himself.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
And apparently they may come kind of a deal to get them fantastically, Mr. Chairman.

16:42.000 --> 16:53.000
And there's a direct this, who is one of the top advertisers of President Truman and the chair knows the primary guide that President Truman and I hold each other in.

16:54.000 --> 17:02.000
And I think that's the, I think Mr. Chairman, that as a parent, I should know so I can govern my actions accordingly.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
Number one of other center signings is willing to take the oath as I take it.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
That has a three Republican second.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
Number two, but I need to yield the consent as an impartial judge on this committee.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
And as a point of personal privilege, Mr. Chairman, I ask that he be asked those two questions.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
This is the most unusual situation I thought you was doing.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
This is the most unusual situation, Mr. Chairman.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
And then I run into.

17:29.000 --> 17:37.000
I can understand by the center of Missouri doesn't want these documents read, but it first ought to be in a fantastic situation.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
I've got two young men who I've got to protect. I've asked them to come on my committee.

17:41.000 --> 17:49.000
I find now that the one that just is was working with the deputy attorney general before the charges were made.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
And I think Mr. Srammingham should be put under hope.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
He should be willing to do that. I know we can't force him to so we can get all of these details.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
There should be no more secrecy.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
He's going to be conclusion with the chairman.

18:01.000 --> 18:09.000
Mr. Srammingham was a man who for days and days was telling how he wanted all of the facts laid on the table.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
He wanted nothing but the truth in this whole case.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm running to try and get my idea of this.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
And I don't want to continue this discussion with the junior senator from Wisconsin.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
As far as all the facts being laid on the table, I have laid every fact on the table that I know of.

18:27.000 --> 18:35.000
I have laid facts on the table which might bring criticism of friends because in the beginning I said that I wanted to do just that.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
All these conversations will apply to any decision with respect to any hearing.

18:42.000 --> 18:53.000
And since there was a decision for hearings in this matter, I have not discussed anything with any principle in any way.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
I believe that is a statement of fact except in this courtroom passing a march made here or there.

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
Now I say to the junior senator with for Wisconsin, why doesn't he now practice what he preaches?

19:06.000 --> 19:18.000
Here he has the opportunity to put all of his calls and the records and those of his two staff members who based on the new rules were working for this committee just as much as they were working for him.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
Let's get on with the hearings and not on with the diversion chair has the next 10 minutes and I think this is probably me.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Are you the point of order?

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
I feel that this is not a mean to just start to think about me and that I should be entitled to answer to this in the fine measure and I'll try to do that very briefly.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
First of all, Senator Marching.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I think I made a very big mistake.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
The White House is one of the most important expenditures.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
And I hope I can speak to Mr. Carr as well.

19:46.000 --> 19:57.000
At the very beginning, we can send it that all the money to the polls between us and the other people go in on condition that the American people be given full level for this country.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I have a record of page 3.4.7.

19:59.000 --> 20:12.000
The second day of these years is waiting for you to sign up for that expenditure and if this bill will be made available or will be made available, I will sign up and I don't have to call out any documents which will get them all on the record.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I have to make that very clear.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
The second to make this is the kind of my client.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
I can't do anything about the hearings and the decision here.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
I've served this committee and I've had complete confidence in this matter and I hope they have had that as me.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
But I heard that here is a thank you file and I'm just signing up and I'm going to speak before they hear the begining.

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
Well, if you and I are going to work this thing together, I hope it puts me in a very bright, bright, physical position.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I know it puts Mr. Carr on that.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm not sure if the Senate will come up with that.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
We have one about a gender, a senator who will be calling here in the begining.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
The one of the principles who has made the charge of a guest bill that they are going to work for.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
Together, I'm dealing with this so I wonder if this is not going to be because I know he is sick of it.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
But the honorable person will not have that.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.000
Well, Mr. Carr, I would add to that in this morning that when I was trying to do desperately with Mr. Speeber,

21:08.000 --> 21:18.000
the director for Joe, was to try and find and get back here before there were any further hearings with respect to the hammer.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
When I got back here, I want to be there for no serious mistakes.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
When I got back here, there had already been leakage into the press about the so-called China force,

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
which later I received in a letter that it was being sent to me and sent to the other center.

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
As long as Mr. Cohn has brought himself into this connoct we can, I would like to add Kim.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
Here, he got up with his calls in the record for Indy.

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
You see, Mr. Commander, I think I was going to the first one to say that a full full in these hearings is submitted.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Mr. Johnson, sir, Mayor Hannon.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I didn't say anything. You must have heard somebody else.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
Mr. Cohn, I think I was going to the first one to say that a full full full went into the hearings,

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
might have go in and they could see the first one could go in by now, might go in.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
Other than that, I can't, I can't on that statement, just a time of thinking you say you want to be fair about this.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
If you feel like you will know, the first thing is that a full full full and if there is an agreement made which can take two seconds,

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
that a full full full full is, I don't know if that might be the first to be registered or not.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Now, Mr. Cohn, all of a sudden, as if it were written, what are I going to do?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I'm just going to be just a security officer.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Well, I thank you, I thank you.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
I thank you.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I'd like to ask you a question again.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
I have put my call to the staff in the morning.

22:40.000 --> 22:46.000
I said I would put him in, if you and Senator McCaw be in a Mr. Cohn, but you are there.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
Without any catch, without any mental reservation and hesitation of any time.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Now, I have put mine in.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
The only reason I ever run for them in the press break is because the names of friends were mentioned.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Nothing to do with me.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Now, I have put mine in.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
I ask, are you going to put your call to the records this afternoon?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I have to tell me this.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
It's quite clear.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
I hope I have.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
The call of the Tri-Aff relates to other calls, but names in the state of which Tri-Aff gives the council for this committee.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
Sometimes, I go and ask that Mr. Ceepe and Mr. Adams produce that they know all of them at the time of the concert.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
They follow along together.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
As soon as the call is arranged, they go in.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And I know that they will go in.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
So we have a call picture.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
I will ask them, might be ready for the other's arrest.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
As long as I know that they will go in.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
And I recite against their call, our call for second.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
November 24th.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
November 25th.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
I believe that the 7th and 28th one has been supplied.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
And the other, which I will listen to, Mr. Jackson.

23:42.000 --> 23:50.000
I may know that those who will go in, I will be glad to have any form of mine go right into the records there.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Yes, sir.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Mr. Chairman.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
It is now very clear that the zone used to continue to list the call.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
Some of the calls that were asked for are based on the statement of the witness and the White House calls that never be put in.

24:02.000 --> 24:11.000
It is now clear that Mr. Cone, who has been accused of infrocal pressure against the Army for private chines, does not intend to put his name in the court.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
The police called in the records.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I have a good, not exceedingly.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Good.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Good morning.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
You by the way.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
One, one.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
You have a record to say this.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That he is gunnagized by Senator Potter.

24:22.000 --> 24:30.000
That he may or may like to have his, not have been called, but in the record on the same basis of those of Senator's month and funds in today.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
They are running out of time and the chair and the 50% of them is constantly also one of the head of his calls.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
They are going to be arrested on the same basis.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
They simply point up the facts.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It is time.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
You are moving pretty fast.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
You are controlling the time.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
We have agreed to get the company by the box.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Just one minute on Mr. Chairman or less.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Can I both keep it down to less than one minute?

24:50.000 --> 25:03.000
Oh, I want to find out Mr. Chairman that has been viewed as new development of the price of Mr. Cone, Mr. Stavins the Great, to say a total run there is on their side.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
They definitely really general run.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
We must get the phone calls, and Roger, Simon, and Stavins for the public with that.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
The complete conflict here.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
Mr. Chairman, I say that the new, the interlocking nature of the call, we might staff on the Pentagon.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
I hope they share over the weekend purchase the price of it.

25:22.000 --> 25:30.000
To make all those calls available so that we can in all fairness put in these interlocking calls and part of my staff apart.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
My calls are concerning the lay world in the middle of the most wide time.

25:34.000 --> 25:42.000
As the Senate with Cunson knows, the members of this committee have been trying long and hard to find a way to get all of these calls in.

25:42.000 --> 25:50.000
And we are going to continue to try to get all the calls we can insofar with the interpretation of the presidential executive directive.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
Mr. Welch has agreed to do some nothing.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
The chair will do nothing he can.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
We'll try if we can. I think it would be very much in the public interest personally.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
They have all of these calls with the Britain, in corporate interests.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
The chair has these 10 minutes now.

26:09.000 --> 26:16.000
He must say in all countries that he has transpired with this committee today.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Thank you.
