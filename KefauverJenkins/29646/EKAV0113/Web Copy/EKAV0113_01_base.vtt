WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tunisie, we have a very distinguished guest with us today

00:08.400 --> 00:14.120
about whom you have heard much, and I know that all of you admire him as I do.

00:14.120 --> 00:18.320
During the time that I served on the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and on the Senate

00:18.320 --> 00:25.120
Defense Appropriations Committee, I've gotten to know and hear a great deal.

00:25.120 --> 00:31.800
I know this man well, and here is I.V.O. is about space and research and the air command

00:31.800 --> 00:33.640
of our great nation.

00:33.640 --> 00:39.440
Our guest today is General Bernard A. Sriever, who is head of the Air Force Systems Command.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.140
We'd like to have you with us, Danny B.

00:42.140 --> 00:47.200
Let me say, by way of the introduction of General Sriever was born in Brim and Germany

00:47.200 --> 00:53.820
that he immigrated to the United States in 1917, grew up in Texas where I graduated from

00:53.820 --> 00:54.820
Texas A&M.

00:54.820 --> 01:00.820
He served seven campaigns with the 19th bomber group in the Southwest Pacific in World War

01:00.820 --> 01:08.900
II, and through a series of top advancements and assignments, he is now the commander of

01:08.900 --> 01:14.060
the Vital Research and Development Program of our Air Force.

01:14.060 --> 01:19.300
General Sriever, tell us just what is the Air Force Systems Command and what does it

01:19.300 --> 01:20.300
do?

01:20.300 --> 01:22.980
Well, let's say, very large organization.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.300
We have some 75,000 people.

01:25.300 --> 01:31.100
We're responsible for all of the research and development in the Air Force and specifically

01:31.100 --> 01:37.420
the development of weapons systems such as the Atlas, the Titan, the Minotman, the RS-70,

01:37.420 --> 01:40.340
all the space work that the Air Force does.

01:40.340 --> 01:45.260
And our total budget runs in the neighborhood of seven and a half billion dollars a year,

01:45.260 --> 01:48.020
so you can see we have a very large job to do.

01:48.020 --> 01:53.100
Yes, and it will be even more than at this time goes on, but seven and a half billion

01:53.100 --> 01:55.700
dollars a year is a lot of money.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.540
Other words, you have some missiles and rockets here.

01:59.540 --> 02:02.260
These are things developments that are under your command.

02:02.260 --> 02:03.260
Yes, sir.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.580
I might just…

02:04.580 --> 02:11.780
This is the X-15, which of course is an experimental aircraft that you've seen so much about in

02:11.780 --> 02:13.260
the press in the last year.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.260
How many miles an hour?

02:15.260 --> 02:24.300
Well, that has gone at speeds of about 4,000 miles an hour and at altitudes of 250,000

02:24.300 --> 02:26.300
feet.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.580
We work, actually NASA works with us on this program.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.260
This is the…

02:31.260 --> 02:36.020
Our latest long range ICBM called the Titan II.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.020
This is also used as the booster.

02:38.020 --> 02:42.260
We'll be used as the booster for our dinosaur program in the Air Force.

02:42.260 --> 02:47.820
Also, the booster for the NASA Germany program is that it is the latest man in space program.

02:47.820 --> 02:51.820
It will be the booster for our Sunday Command of the Moon.

02:51.820 --> 02:52.820
No, sir.

02:52.820 --> 02:58.300
It will not be the booster for the man in the Moon program, but it will provide NASA with

02:58.300 --> 03:03.260
the great deal of information that they need in their lunar program, so it ties in directly

03:03.260 --> 03:04.980
with the lunar program.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.260
The block of us here is, of course, the Atlas.

03:07.260 --> 03:10.700
This is our first ICBM, which is operational now.

03:10.700 --> 03:15.460
What do you mean by, you know what you mean by an ICBM, but just to have orders in ICBM

03:15.460 --> 03:16.460
go?

03:16.460 --> 03:22.900
Well, actually, we consider 5,500 miles as the ICBM range, but the Atlas has capabilities

03:22.900 --> 03:25.020
considerably in excess of that.

03:25.020 --> 03:28.660
We fired them ranges up to 9,000 miles.

03:28.660 --> 03:31.260
And your accuracy and hitting response has been very phenomenal.

03:31.260 --> 03:32.260
I understand.

03:32.260 --> 03:36.580
Much better than we had hoped for back in 1954.

03:36.580 --> 03:41.820
I can't give the exact accuracy for security reasons, but it's been very, very good.

03:41.820 --> 03:47.060
And then when we start sending of space communications satellites, which many of us were interested

03:47.060 --> 03:55.660
into, to get news, to voice, to television, and communications to all parts of the world,

03:55.660 --> 03:59.580
one of these may be used to put the communication satellite into orbit.

03:59.580 --> 04:03.860
As a matter of fact, the boosters that were developed by the Air Force are being used

04:03.860 --> 04:05.420
for that purpose, the Thor.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.340
I don't have a model here will be used.

04:07.340 --> 04:11.820
The Atlas has been one of our leading space boosters that's been in the booster use for

04:11.820 --> 04:16.740
the Mercury, for example, but also is planned to be used for these communication satellites.

04:16.740 --> 04:25.660
So I'm going to strive for sometimes back representatives from the Telehoma, Aero, Arnold Engineering

04:25.660 --> 04:34.020
Development Center, and Congressman Evans, Senator Gore, representatives of the state of

04:34.020 --> 04:40.340
Tennessee and the University of Tennessee, out of meeting with you and other people from

04:40.340 --> 04:45.100
the Air Force that are here in Washington about a very important project, and connection

04:45.100 --> 04:51.060
with the Arnold Engineering Development Center at Telehoma.

04:51.060 --> 04:56.660
I want to ask you about that in a minute, but first tell us the importance of this very

04:56.660 --> 04:58.820
important installation of Telehoma.

04:59.620 --> 05:05.700
Well, I'd be glad to because it's been one of my favorite facilities after the war,

05:05.700 --> 05:10.100
actually, planning wise that came under my office in the Pentagon.

05:10.100 --> 05:20.140
And it has really grown up to be what we consider in the Air Force.

05:20.140 --> 05:28.180
The major facility that we have that we can provide tests on the ground for space vehicles.

05:28.180 --> 05:32.900
Every major program that we've had in the Air Force, every ballistic missile program,

05:32.900 --> 05:38.740
every rocket program, every space program, we have run very important tests in the tunnels

05:38.740 --> 05:42.780
that Telehoma, the Arnold Engineering Center.

05:42.780 --> 05:48.220
This same thing holds true for many of the NASA programs as well as the Navy's Polaris,

05:48.220 --> 05:49.220
for example.

05:49.220 --> 05:56.820
So the contribution that the Arnold Center has made to our missile and space programs has

05:57.820 --> 06:00.500
been very, very great indeed.

06:00.500 --> 06:05.660
Well, we are quite proud of the, you know, the arrow as we call it in Tennessee.

06:05.660 --> 06:11.860
As I got it, these tests of all of the missiles and rockets and everything that has to do

06:11.860 --> 06:18.620
about space at the Arnold Engineering Development Center gives you factual information about

06:18.620 --> 06:22.380
what their activity will be when they are actually employed.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.380
Is that correct?

06:23.380 --> 06:25.980
I'm giving you one quick example.

06:25.980 --> 06:30.980
We were having a great deal of difficulty in our discoverer program in the recovery of

06:30.980 --> 06:32.660
the capsule from outer space.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.660
I think you remember that.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.060
I've got a lot of publicity in the paper.

06:37.060 --> 06:42.420
We actually, by conducting wind tunnel tests, that Telehoma discovered what was wrong with

06:42.420 --> 06:47.060
the parachute coming out in its reentry.

06:47.060 --> 06:52.140
And we corrected that and we've had no more difficulty with that part of the program

06:52.140 --> 06:53.140
ever since.

06:53.140 --> 06:58.140
There's just one example of the payoffs that we have gotten and testing that.

06:58.140 --> 07:04.840
Well, we know that time has been going on, that the importance of Telehoma to our air

07:04.840 --> 07:10.700
force, to our space effort has been growing and growing and expanding.

07:10.700 --> 07:17.660
What is the future of our engineering development center will continue to be an even more important

07:17.660 --> 07:19.140
part of our space effort?

07:19.540 --> 07:22.060
Well, I don't think there's any question about that.

07:22.060 --> 07:23.940
It will be.

07:23.940 --> 07:27.620
We are just really scratching the surface in space.

07:27.620 --> 07:33.860
We have tremendous plans for the center.

07:33.860 --> 07:39.980
We are not putting in a, what we call a test configuration of an environmental test facility

07:39.980 --> 07:40.980
at Telehoma.

07:40.980 --> 07:46.420
We hope to move on to a very large-scale space environmental test facility.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.620
We have the power there.

07:48.620 --> 07:52.340
We have the resources in the way of trained people.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.820
It's an ideal place for it.

07:53.820 --> 07:55.700
It's in the planning phases now.

07:55.700 --> 08:02.460
In addition, we are planning with your good people in Tennessee, the University of Tennessee.

08:02.460 --> 08:05.860
Yes, that's what I wanted to ask you to talk about something.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.540
It's a great importance to all of Tennessee.

08:09.540 --> 08:14.540
You're talking now about the Tennessee Space Institute.

08:14.540 --> 08:15.540
That's right.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.540
And I'll tell us about it.

08:17.900 --> 08:25.300
Well, we, of course, in the Air Force field that the technological explosion that the

08:25.300 --> 08:31.020
world has experienced in the past 10 or 15 years and which will continue.

08:31.020 --> 08:38.820
That education will perhaps be the crucial factor in our technological struggle and struggle

08:38.820 --> 08:42.300
as a whole with communism.

08:42.300 --> 08:49.820
We need to particularly develop greater capabilities in this country for advanced,

08:49.820 --> 08:51.420
graduate work.

08:51.420 --> 08:57.900
The institute is, in the planning stages now, I have several documents here that indicate

08:57.900 --> 09:03.460
that we've been very active in this planning and it's to be, the plan is to locate it at

09:03.460 --> 09:10.020
Jason II facilities at the Arnold Center and it would be operated under the University

09:10.020 --> 09:12.460
of Tennessee as a graduate institute.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.260
I think it's a wonderful idea.

09:14.260 --> 09:19.620
We've got tremendous enthusiasm and support from the people in Tennessee so far.

09:19.620 --> 09:24.700
I believe that the present time there is a request for the acquisition of some 400 acres

09:24.700 --> 09:29.460
of land or the buildings and laboratories and whatnot.

09:29.460 --> 09:34.820
That is true and this will be located to write adjacent to the lake there.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.300
It's a beautiful location.

09:37.300 --> 09:43.780
I was at the center just about a month ago and it's a wonderful spot for a school and

09:43.780 --> 09:48.740
with the facilities of the center being available to the school it can really be one of our leading

09:48.740 --> 09:50.700
research centers in the country.

09:50.700 --> 09:57.980
In addition to what the students for masters or doctors degrees with a learning in the

09:57.980 --> 10:03.180
classroom they have practical application and can have practical experience in the center

10:03.180 --> 10:04.180
itself.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.180
That's right.

10:05.180 --> 10:11.420
That's what makes it unique and I think that we can well lead the way here.

10:11.420 --> 10:15.820
As Arnold Sriever as I understand it then we have had several discussions about it.

10:15.820 --> 10:22.380
This is to be a joint effort on the part of the state of Tennessee, the University of

10:22.380 --> 10:27.620
Tennessee and as we all know Dr. Holden, the president of the University and his people

10:27.620 --> 10:31.940
are very interested in cooperative design.

10:31.940 --> 10:41.380
As we all know the Air Force and NASA and Navy and other federal agencies.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.380
That's right.

10:42.380 --> 10:46.900
The center is whereas it's operated by the Air Force.

10:46.900 --> 10:56.220
We not only welcome but we look for work that we can do in support of the Navy, NASA and

10:56.220 --> 11:00.820
the Army and we do support them at great deal now and we will certainly continue to do

11:00.820 --> 11:04.180
so because we look at it as a national resource.

11:04.180 --> 11:11.660
And you need men educated in the field that would receive their instruction there at this

11:11.660 --> 11:17.300
Arnold Engineering Development Center or Tennessee Space Institute as we are going to call

11:17.300 --> 11:18.300
it.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.300
That's right.

11:19.300 --> 11:24.540
We've had several different names but the latest is the Colorado Library at Tennessee Space

11:24.540 --> 11:25.540
Institute.

11:25.540 --> 11:30.660
General Sriever, how soon do you envision with everybody cooperating fully that this

11:30.660 --> 11:37.180
can become a reality because it's a great and unique development as I understand it?

11:37.180 --> 11:46.860
Well I think that we could certainly get started in go beyond the planning and start implementing

11:46.860 --> 11:54.940
doing in other words within the next 12 months and I would say that if everything is pushed

11:54.940 --> 12:00.900
the way it should in my opinion we could certainly get students there within a matter of

12:00.900 --> 12:09.220
a year or two even before we have all the facilities in final form because the attitude

12:09.220 --> 12:13.740
and the desire is there so we can get started I think real soon.

12:13.740 --> 12:21.140
I understand that the Arnold Engineering Development Center has been allocating some of its

12:21.140 --> 12:28.100
funds already out of its own pocket for the purpose of getting at least planning.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.100
Yes, in the next meeting.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.300
In the planning, yes sir.

12:31.300 --> 12:36.900
Our people are very enthusiastic about this and both on the military side and arrow have

12:36.900 --> 12:37.900
been working on this.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.860
Is there any institute of this kind in the United States of the present time or is this

12:41.860 --> 12:43.740
unique or will this be unique?

12:43.740 --> 12:49.500
This would be the first institute of this kind that I know anything about and I'm sure

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
I'm correct.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.540
So it would be unique but I'm sure there more would follow.

12:54.540 --> 13:00.980
And you would give masters and doctors degrees to the students there and they could not

13:00.980 --> 13:02.460
study for them.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.460
That's right.

13:03.460 --> 13:07.420
Well I want you to know our General's River I'm sure you do already that we in Tennessee

13:07.420 --> 13:14.020
are very interested in this project and everybody is anxious to cooperate with you and with

13:14.020 --> 13:18.220
NASA and we hope it becomes a reality in the near future.

13:19.020 --> 13:23.380
And on behalf of the listeners over this station I want to thank you very much for being

13:23.380 --> 13:24.380
with us today.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.260
That's all until next time.
