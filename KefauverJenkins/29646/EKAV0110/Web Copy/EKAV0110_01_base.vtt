WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.420
ah

00:24.260 --> 00:27.560
Yes.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.500
What do you see here?

00:36.640 --> 00:39.860
Oh, the

00:44.460 --> 00:47.420
ig

00:49.740 --> 00:50.620
in the

00:50.620 --> 00:54.860
the United States and the European businessmen have

00:54.860 --> 00:55.380
and

00:55.380 --> 00:57.580
public officials have been very

00:57.580 --> 00:59.780
important clients

01:01.280 --> 01:02.960
that they seem glad to

01:02.960 --> 01:06.960
see us and give the kind of honest part picture which is

01:06.960 --> 01:10.460
necessary for full understanding of

01:10.460 --> 01:13.180
what we are interested in.

01:14.780 --> 01:16.300
I have to take the one to

01:16.300 --> 01:18.020
just appreciate and do our

01:18.020 --> 01:20.020
for ambassadors

01:20.020 --> 01:24.020
Douglas McArthur and John Tuthill

01:24.020 --> 01:26.020
and do their aids for

01:27.020 --> 01:30.020
the things they have given us and for the

01:30.020 --> 01:33.020
opportunities they have given us to make

01:33.020 --> 01:34.020
to

01:34.020 --> 01:36.020
visit where they

01:36.020 --> 01:38.020
a number of

01:38.020 --> 01:40.020
American, French

01:40.020 --> 01:42.020
and Belgian lawyers

01:42.020 --> 01:44.020
sisters

01:44.020 --> 01:46.020
a businessman

01:46.020 --> 01:48.020
and also

01:48.020 --> 01:50.020
we are most grateful to

01:50.020 --> 01:52.020
Mr. Hans Runder

01:52.020 --> 01:54.020
Ruben

01:54.020 --> 01:54.020


01:54.020 --> 01:56.020
the

01:56.020 --> 01:58.020
Lauren Ben-Thema

01:58.020 --> 02:00.020
and the members of their staff are very

02:00.020 --> 02:02.020
close to briefing on what they

02:02.020 --> 02:04.020
are doing and what

02:04.020 --> 02:06.020
their plans are.

02:06.020 --> 02:08.020
I think they

02:08.020 --> 02:10.020
are

02:10.020 --> 02:12.020
sections of 85 and 86 of the

02:12.020 --> 02:14.020
Treaty of Rome are

02:14.020 --> 02:16.020
very good

02:16.020 --> 02:18.020
and

02:18.020 --> 02:20.020
pro-compensation

02:20.020 --> 02:22.020
provisions

02:22.020 --> 02:24.020
and some respects are better than

02:24.020 --> 02:26.020
how

02:26.020 --> 02:28.020
to press laws in the United

02:28.020 --> 02:30.020
States.

02:30.020 --> 02:32.020
We in the

02:32.020 --> 02:34.020
states are much

02:34.020 --> 02:36.020
alone from the

02:36.020 --> 02:38.020
experience that is

02:38.020 --> 02:40.020
spring on here and

02:40.020 --> 02:42.020
perhaps

02:42.020 --> 02:44.020
some benefits

02:44.020 --> 02:44.020


02:44.020 --> 02:46.020
longer experience that we have had

02:46.020 --> 02:48.020
and any trust in the

02:48.020 --> 02:50.020
United States.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.020
The people we have talked with

02:52.020 --> 02:54.020
are recognized that they are

02:54.020 --> 02:56.020
many difficulties

02:56.020 --> 02:58.020
and a different

02:58.020 --> 03:00.020
national attitudes

03:00.020 --> 03:02.020
traditional patterns

03:02.020 --> 03:02.020


03:02.020 --> 03:02.020


03:02.020 --> 03:04.020
most encouraging

03:04.020 --> 03:06.020
that they are very

03:06.020 --> 03:06.020


03:06.020 --> 03:08.020
very

03:08.020 --> 03:10.020
very strong

03:10.020 --> 03:12.020
and most encouraging that

03:12.020 --> 03:14.020
a very strong start has been

03:14.020 --> 03:16.020
made and the common

03:16.020 --> 03:18.020
market people

03:18.020 --> 03:20.020
soon

03:20.020 --> 03:22.020
to mean business and

03:22.020 --> 03:24.020
determine that they are going

03:24.020 --> 03:26.020
to operate on the basis of

03:26.020 --> 03:28.020
competition

03:28.020 --> 03:30.020
rather than

03:30.020 --> 03:32.020
cultural

03:32.020 --> 03:34.020
such as

03:34.020 --> 03:36.020
has been prevalent

03:36.020 --> 03:38.020
and

03:38.020 --> 03:40.020
more pointed out

03:40.020 --> 03:40.020


03:40.020 --> 03:42.020
are changed already.

03:42.020 --> 03:44.020
Competition is now

03:44.020 --> 03:46.020
generally accepted

03:46.020 --> 03:48.020
as fundamental

03:48.020 --> 03:50.020
to the Roman

03:50.020 --> 03:52.020
Treaty.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.020
I think that this is

03:54.020 --> 03:56.020
most encouraging and

03:56.020 --> 03:58.020
is a good thing

03:58.020 --> 04:00.020
for European

04:00.020 --> 04:02.020
businessmen

04:02.020 --> 04:04.020
to clean up the trade

04:04.020 --> 04:06.020
business

04:06.020 --> 04:08.020
doing a lot of business

04:08.020 --> 04:10.020
between the common market

04:10.020 --> 04:12.020
and our country and

04:12.020 --> 04:14.020
other countries in the world.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.020
It is also a good thing

04:16.020 --> 04:18.020
for the United States

04:18.020 --> 04:20.020
businessmen

04:20.020 --> 04:22.020
we are

04:22.020 --> 04:24.020
in

04:24.020 --> 04:26.020
open market

04:26.020 --> 04:28.020
and our companies

04:28.020 --> 04:30.020
are

04:30.020 --> 04:32.020
used to operating

04:32.020 --> 04:34.020
in the

04:34.020 --> 04:36.020
world.

04:36.020 --> 04:38.020
We have been here

04:38.020 --> 04:40.020
at

04:40.020 --> 04:42.020
Parkway and this

04:42.020 --> 04:44.020
could go

04:44.020 --> 04:46.020
some

04:46.020 --> 04:48.020
50 people

04:48.020 --> 04:50.020
some from Germany

04:50.020 --> 04:52.020
thousands

04:52.020 --> 04:54.020
Poland

04:54.020 --> 04:56.020
we are

04:56.020 --> 04:58.020
very talk

04:58.020 --> 05:00.020
with some other

05:00.020 --> 05:00.020


05:00.020 --> 05:02.020
people

05:02.020 --> 05:04.020
and we are

05:04.020 --> 05:06.020
making a report

05:06.020 --> 05:08.020
to the United States

05:08.020 --> 05:10.020
Senate.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.020
There are some other

05:12.020 --> 05:14.020
hearings in

05:14.020 --> 05:16.020
Washington on this subject

05:16.020 --> 05:18.020
as chairman of this committee

05:18.020 --> 05:20.020
has been

05:20.020 --> 05:22.020
ready to

05:22.020 --> 05:24.020
write the city

05:24.020 --> 05:26.020
the coming start has been

05:26.020 --> 05:28.020
made

05:28.020 --> 05:30.020
and I think it is going to be

05:30.020 --> 05:32.020
much good

05:32.020 --> 05:34.020
in the

05:34.020 --> 05:36.020
two world and for

05:36.020 --> 05:38.020
business on this

05:38.020 --> 05:40.020
side of the

05:40.020 --> 05:42.020
country. Mr. Dixon

05:42.020 --> 05:44.020
you have

05:44.020 --> 05:46.020
given me what to have.

05:46.020 --> 05:48.020
Senator Mary too

05:48.020 --> 05:50.020
we had a way

05:50.020 --> 05:52.020
some of the things that you said

05:52.020 --> 05:54.020
because I am delighted to have

05:54.020 --> 05:56.020
been invited

05:56.020 --> 05:58.020
to the United States

05:58.020 --> 05:58.020


05:58.020 --> 06:00.020
more

06:00.020 --> 06:02.020
good

06:02.020 --> 06:04.020
and

06:04.020 --> 06:06.020
more

06:06.020 --> 06:08.020
good

06:08.020 --> 06:10.020
and more

06:10.020 --> 06:10.020


06:10.020 --> 06:12.020
and more

06:12.020 --> 06:14.020
good

06:14.020 --> 06:16.020
and more

06:16.020 --> 06:18.020
good

06:18.020 --> 06:20.020
and more

06:20.020 --> 06:22.020
good

06:22.020 --> 06:24.020
and more

06:24.020 --> 06:24.020


06:24.020 --> 06:26.020
good

06:26.020 --> 06:28.020
and more

06:28.020 --> 06:30.020
good

06:30.020 --> 06:32.020
and more

06:32.020 --> 06:34.020
good

06:34.020 --> 06:36.020
because I understand

06:36.020 --> 06:38.020
that

06:38.020 --> 06:40.020
we are

06:40.020 --> 06:40.020


06:40.020 --> 06:43.060
is the

06:43.060 --> 06:45.460
disturbing

06:45.460 --> 06:47.540
there

06:47.540 --> 06:50.020
means

06:50.020 --> 06:52.820
is the

06:52.820 --> 06:54.820
and

06:54.820 --> 06:55.820
it's

06:55.820 --> 06:55.820


06:55.820 --> 06:57.320
implementing

06:57.320 --> 06:59.320
really

06:59.320 --> 06:59.800
at least

06:59.800 --> 07:00.820
these

07:00.820 --> 07:02.020
spell

07:02.020 --> 07:03.520
honor

07:03.520 --> 07:04.320
nichts

07:04.320 --> 07:07.740
Sinatra

07:07.740 --> 07:11.900
to be

07:11.900 --> 07:12.800
still

07:12.800 --> 07:15.800
known

07:15.800 --> 07:16.800
as the

07:16.800 --> 07:20.500
experiencing

07:20.500 --> 07:27.500
of

07:27.500 --> 07:27.500


07:27.500 --> 07:27.500


07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
and

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
concentration

07:29.500 --> 07:30.500
problems in the

07:30.500 --> 07:31.500
United States

07:31.500 --> 07:33.500
and

07:33.500 --> 07:34.500
with

07:34.500 --> 07:34.500


07:34.500 --> 07:35.500
lot of time

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
and

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
I never

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
have been

07:38.500 --> 07:39.500
fully satisfied

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
with the

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
enforcement

07:41.500 --> 07:41.500


07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
one-trust laws in our own

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
country

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
and I

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
realize

07:45.500 --> 07:46.500
that they need

07:46.500 --> 07:47.500
improvement

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
and

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
strengthening

07:49.500 --> 07:51.500
and

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
also

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
two points I

07:55.500 --> 07:56.500
should have

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
mentioned

07:57.500 --> 08:00.500
I've been impressed

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
with the fact that

08:01.500 --> 08:02.500
there have been

08:02.500 --> 08:03.500
consumer groups

08:03.500 --> 08:04.500
that have grown

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
up in the

08:05.500 --> 08:07.500
common market countries

08:07.500 --> 08:08.500
that are

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
interested in

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
competition

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
and

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
removing it will bring

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
them

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
little prices

08:16.500 --> 08:18.500
and

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
the

08:20.500 --> 08:20.500


08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
is going to be a success

08:22.500 --> 08:24.500
and that's the

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
antitrust

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
section of the

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
city of

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
Rome will be implemented

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
and will be enforced

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
if there are any

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
questions

08:38.500 --> 08:38.500


08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
glad to

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
further

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
continue to

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
continue to

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
continue to

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
continue to

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
continue to

08:49.500 --> 08:51.500
continue to

08:51.500 --> 08:51.500


08:51.500 --> 08:55.500
and

08:55.500 --> 08:59.500
move

08:59.500 --> 09:02.500
to

09:02.500 --> 09:06.500
stop

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
again

09:08.500 --> 09:11.500
by

09:11.500 --> 09:13.500
hearings

09:13.500 --> 09:15.500
and

09:15.500 --> 09:16.500
yesterday

09:16.500 --> 09:18.500
we have

09:18.500 --> 09:20.500
a

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
few

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
months

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
have

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
started

09:28.500 --> 09:30.500
sessions

09:30.500 --> 09:32.500
that we have

09:32.500 --> 09:34.500
been

09:34.500 --> 09:34.500


09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
our previous

09:36.500 --> 09:38.500
occasions

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
we have

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
talked about the same

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
problem

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
and

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
we

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
did not see any of the

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
thousands of

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
fishers

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
we saw a couple of

09:56.500 --> 09:58.500
thousands of

09:58.500 --> 10:00.500
businessmen

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
and lawyers

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
that

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
is

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
quite clear in my mind

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
whether

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
we have

10:12.500 --> 10:14.500
been

10:14.500 --> 10:16.500
working

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
the

10:26.500 --> 10:28.500
process

10:28.500 --> 10:30.500
should

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
say that we have been

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
encouraged

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
to

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500

10:40.500 --> 10:42.500

者

12:56.360 --> 13:08.360
I found out I think it's a part of our official position in the United States and I got

13:08.360 --> 13:15.360
the same impression from the officials here that the more interchange of distance that

13:15.360 --> 13:24.360
we can have, the more clear the stronger the rest will be that are off for the virus.

Wolcer

prices

13:51.880 --> 13:53.880
uh...

13:53.880 --> 13:56.880
very bad prices because

13:56.880 --> 14:03.880
we've already lost a great deal of our market overseas and in the United States

14:03.880 --> 14:05.880
because of our

14:05.880 --> 14:07.880
past-year prices

14:07.880 --> 14:10.880
I think the

14:10.880 --> 14:12.880
further increased

14:12.880 --> 14:13.880
will

14:13.880 --> 14:14.880
mean that

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
most of the

14:15.880 --> 14:19.880
countries in the United States

14:19.880 --> 14:24.880
gold-drain will likely be enhanced

14:24.880 --> 14:27.880
I think they were done better to have a

14:27.880 --> 14:31.880
deficit prices where they were or even lower them and

14:31.880 --> 14:35.880
have operated fuller capacity

14:35.880 --> 14:37.880
they've been

14:37.880 --> 14:41.880
companies that have been operating only about

14:41.880 --> 14:45.880
55 to 60 percent of the capacity

14:45.880 --> 14:49.880
making money or low enough to satisfy their profits

14:49.880 --> 14:53.880
at this low capacity

14:53.880 --> 14:57.880
seems to me that

14:57.880 --> 15:01.880
it made better sense to have

15:01.880 --> 15:05.880
rather in large operations and not

15:05.880 --> 15:07.880
increased prices
