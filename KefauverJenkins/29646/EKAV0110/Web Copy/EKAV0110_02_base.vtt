00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm not officially the new steel company.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Are you sending the company into any agreement with the anti-cashmiles as they exist now in the coming market?

00:16.000 --> 00:26.000
Well, it's not that it's not the military. The laws are only different from what different places from our loans.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
As I say in my thumb respects, they are strong.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
They approach this problem in a different way.

00:39.000 --> 00:54.000
Ironic law, the Spiten Act attempts to prohibit the creation of a monopoly in the first place.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
Although we don't do very good in enforcement.

01:01.000 --> 01:13.000
Rome treaty deals with the abusive nationalist or dominant position.

01:13.000 --> 01:26.000
Also when the Rome treaty law there is the requirement for registration of special arrangements.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
Some changes have been made in time by so already.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
I think that pluses and minuses and let's just question through the touchy of the registration.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
So they have been feared by the market.

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
They will suffer from the application of the out of the 85 out of the 86, which you are receiving about that.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't think so.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
I think that's the reason why the United States is doing this.

02:39.000 --> 02:54.000
In the United States, the exclusive dealings and territorial division are violation of the law.

02:54.000 --> 03:11.000
Under the law here they are required to register and determine whether they will be in damage composition.

03:11.000 --> 03:20.000
They can be required to change their mind to action to do that.

03:20.000 --> 03:34.000
We have not had this since 1940, 49 years of experience in the exclusive meeting law.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
This is in the late 1990s, the first is.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
My agency, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have concurred responsibility for this.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
We do not have registrations.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
We find out about them because people complain about them in a matter of time.

04:01.000 --> 04:11.000
The other side of the coin is that when you are starting out as you are hearing requiring registration,

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
it is a rather easy way of bringing the restrictive agreements to the account of the public official.

04:21.000 --> 04:30.000
We will find out about them and learn about where it might not otherwise through the future.

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
We are all very concerned with the trade extension.

04:40.000 --> 04:54.000
One gets the impression here that the United States administration is not as clean as the common market to include even the humanitarian negotiation.

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
The question of non-tastic-multiple trade, especially the fact that it is in business,

05:04.000 --> 05:13.000
would you say that the American administration was in favor of including these questions in the Iranian administration form?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I think so.

05:15.000 --> 05:27.000
I think that in our aid programs and in other efforts that we have made, such as even in the market,

05:27.000 --> 05:42.000
the market plan, for them, there are always efforts to further write in and it does not have any trust provisions.

05:42.000 --> 05:52.000
I would think that our administration would be extremely anxious to have these limitations as they come in our defense.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
I would not do that in the current situation.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
They will have to have a substantial larger number to really enforce the act.

06:44.000 --> 06:54.000
I think the city makes it clear that other Mr. Zipsn has about how many you have been for sure in the world.

06:55.000 --> 07:05.000
The total of 1150, this is the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice probably has 4 to 600,

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
plus the US District Attorney's Office is plus the FBI and plus a lot of others.

07:11.000 --> 07:19.000
But I think one thing that should make clear is that it's been made clear to us that these registrations are confidential.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
There are confidential registrations and they are not to be shown to anybody as well.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
It's said that you are not the US at all.

07:28.000 --> 07:45.000
I think next with the number of people, so the EEC has an antitrust enforcement that should be pointed out that the national government are working with the authority.

07:45.000 --> 07:59.000
They have substantial number and certainly hope that the Bally EEC authorities that they will cooperate even more fully.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
That will supplement the number that they have enforcement in the North.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
I think that's the key to making sure that the Bally EEC authorities are not to be seen.

08:23.000 --> 08:42.000
Yes, I say that the study that we make and experience that comes about here may require some changes in the American EEC.

08:46.000 --> 08:55.000
The same act as the act of which some companies have to do business.

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
More or less in concert abroad.

09:04.000 --> 09:15.000
Some changes might conceal but it may have to be made in here.

09:15.000 --> 09:30.000
It might have to be some stiffening of American antitrust law and connection with their overseas operations.

09:30.000 --> 09:42.000
Of course, to a thorough intelligence test, but it might be a good one.

09:42.000 --> 09:51.000
Senator, will there be further contact with you and the common market on this subject?

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
Mr. Kander, the governor is coming to Washington next week.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
I think you say of yesterday, though.

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
We will have further contacts both in Washington and here.

10:12.000 --> 10:20.000
Almost weekly someone with the connected with the common market comes to our offices.

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
We have had pre-change of information inside our best to be as helpful as we can knowing full well.

10:28.000 --> 10:38.000
The three way at least is our way and we believe that this way and that is we can do anything help we try to be.

10:38.000 --> 10:50.000
They have been very precipitated very freely and I think these exchanges are to the credit of the control of countries.

11:08.000 --> 11:18.000
Thank you.
