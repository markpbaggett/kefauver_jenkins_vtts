WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.200
pimish power and

00:11.200 --> 00:17.920
again they said he

00:18.760 --> 00:24.240
calling their attention to the standing committee rule

00:24.240 --> 00:28.320
to the effect that there have been no audible manifestations of approval or

00:28.320 --> 00:35.600
disapproval of any kind any time from the audience.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.720
The uniformed officers in the room and the plain

00:40.720 --> 00:46.400
close people scattered to the audience have instructions from the committee

00:46.400 --> 00:49.920
to remove firmly committee room immediately

00:49.920 --> 00:55.760
politely but firmly any of you who for reasons best known to yourself

00:55.760 --> 00:59.840
elect to violate the conditions under which you enter the room

00:59.840 --> 01:04.800
which included to refrain entirely from any audible manifestations of approval or

01:04.800 --> 01:09.120
disapproval certainly no committee can expect better cooperation

01:09.120 --> 01:15.920
from audiences that we have had and we hope that that cooperation will continue

01:16.000 --> 01:18.960
at the conclusion of the afternoon session yesterday

01:18.960 --> 01:22.720
you were interrupted about 15 minutes before

01:22.720 --> 01:29.440
a normal recess time by a roll call vote on the senate floor.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.920
Senator Jackson had a short tour you left of his

01:33.920 --> 01:37.280
time and go round and advise me that he will yield at

01:37.280 --> 01:40.160
four minutes this morning to Senator Simonton and we will start with

01:40.160 --> 01:44.000
Sunday Simonton this morning and that will take us to Senator

01:44.080 --> 01:46.400
Bush act if he is here then the Senator McCarty's

01:46.400 --> 01:48.240
and the Mr. Welch's then we'll start to go round

01:48.240 --> 01:51.760
up Senator Simonton thank you Mr. Chairman I

01:51.760 --> 01:56.880
was yielded in the interest of expediting the hearings and giving the

01:56.880 --> 02:00.880
how the people of chance to examine the witness especially the army

02:00.880 --> 02:06.640
I have no questions at this time but I would like to make a motion to

02:06.640 --> 02:08.880
submit to the committee if I may.

02:08.880 --> 02:13.200
I'm looking over the transfer of these hearings for the last two days

02:13.200 --> 02:16.480
I found that when Mr. Cohn was first asked about turning the name

02:16.480 --> 02:20.720
to 130 or 135 subverses in defense plans

02:20.720 --> 02:24.960
over to the defense department both Mr. Cohn and Senator McCarty

02:24.960 --> 02:29.520
felt that the defense department already knew these names.

02:29.520 --> 02:33.120
Now yesterday it appeared that the defense department did not know these names

02:33.120 --> 02:36.320
or at least that Senator McCarty and Mr. Cohn did not know whether the

02:36.320 --> 02:39.440
defense department had them or not.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.840
I share the feeling which was expressed here so vividly on the day

02:43.840 --> 02:48.320
that it is a serious and dangerous thing to permit any subversives to continue

02:48.320 --> 02:52.960
working in defense plans on defense contracts for one minute longer than we can

02:52.960 --> 02:57.120
help. I myself do not propose to stand by

02:57.120 --> 03:02.160
oddly one day or one hour while the name of any of these subversives which may

03:02.160 --> 03:06.000
not be known to the government investigating agencies

03:06.000 --> 03:11.360
dressed in our file. I do not believe that any member of this committee

03:11.360 --> 03:14.960
would want any one of these names to remain in our files

03:14.960 --> 03:18.080
when they are not known to the defense department

03:18.080 --> 03:23.360
to the Department of Justice and the FBI. It is our duty in my opinion

03:23.360 --> 03:27.440
whenever we have the name of a person whom we have reason to suspect

03:27.440 --> 03:32.880
as a security risk and who may be working in any defense installation

03:32.880 --> 03:40.000
to say that this name is immediately communicated to the proper enforcement agency.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.720
For these reasons Mr. Chalman, I now move that the staff of this committee

03:44.720 --> 03:49.280
and each member of the committee be instructed by this committee to immediately

03:49.280 --> 03:54.560
turn over the name of any suspected communist or security risk

03:54.560 --> 03:59.760
to the Department of Justice and the FBI. Whether such communist or

03:59.760 --> 04:04.720
security risk is working in the defense department

04:04.720 --> 04:09.760
in any defense plan or anywhere in the federal government.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.960
I so move Mr. Chalman.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.960
Chairman of our question. Motion is an amazing second. Mr. Chalman,

04:18.960 --> 04:21.920
I would say I have a tremendous time and dual of these

04:21.920 --> 04:25.280
and credit to our colleagues who told me this morning

04:25.280 --> 04:28.960
that two of them are on the appropriations committee with the Dean marked up

04:29.040 --> 04:33.120
asking the FBI. He wishes, he has any notice that anybody was going to make any motion

04:33.120 --> 04:36.480
that said that had not been so I'm sure that from the time it has been

04:36.480 --> 04:40.000
effective on the V-Wish point. So I have to leave Mr. Chalman to do.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.200
So I had to leave a notice that now we're not doing that.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.880
That's a very rare request. I'm sure he will keep it up in the table when they come

04:46.880 --> 04:50.640
with a gaction on. So I ask the chair that he will bring you down when he thinks

04:50.640 --> 04:54.320
it's proper. Chalman, Mr. Chalman. We'll do that.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.000
We got all from the time incident.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.160
I, at this time, have a battle pass and send the party. You can head your 10 minutes.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.120
Head you now. Send the joint practice senator to the very

05:03.120 --> 05:05.600
scenario of marketing up the appropriation bill.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.680
So I don't think I'm a party here. It's like, Mr. Wilk, you've gotten to

05:09.680 --> 05:12.720
your right smart test this morning. You have some minutes.

05:17.920 --> 05:18.720
Cold.

05:19.600 --> 05:26.400
I first want to take up a preliminary matter with you in a truly preliminary way.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.400
You know what you call it? So we fall. Start a fall into the customer of asking people

05:32.400 --> 05:34.880
about their military records when they take the stand.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.240
And then it'll get some at least open up that subject with you.

05:43.200 --> 05:49.360
Listen, and I understand you're now an officer in the National Guard.

05:49.360 --> 05:56.720
Listen, Mr. Corn, there have I think been some articles published about

05:57.600 --> 06:01.360
you and your vast standards of the Q&A have become aware of their not.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.760
So I would say that articles have published about me and just about everything.

06:05.760 --> 06:11.600
Right. Now, I do not wish to end it to you, sir, that I associate myself with

06:11.600 --> 06:16.400
in you. I know you're a colleague from a human right to have this opportunity.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.840
Yes sir. I have an opportunity during these hearings simply and quietly to say for

06:23.840 --> 06:28.560
the records what your status has been and is. Yes sir.

06:28.560 --> 06:33.680
I know you can say that and I assume you would probably like to have a file available

06:33.680 --> 06:38.640
when you do so. Would you not? A file for us yet that is to say a file of your

06:38.640 --> 06:42.640
relations with your draft board and with wet point about what's the

06:42.640 --> 06:44.480
number of records I have. Well, I don't think I need a file sorry.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.400
Another fact. Do you sir?

06:46.400 --> 06:47.920
Yes. So that's that.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.040
I think I feel happier about it, Mr. Corn.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.680
If we first told it until you forget your file,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.920
we're looking at it from this week, Mrs. Chrysler.

06:58.720 --> 07:04.080
I would feel very much happier if I could just pass a button and have you

07:04.080 --> 07:07.520
now restore it without any prompting ready questions from me.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.880
You can see how I might feel that way one lawyer through another cancer sir.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.400
Of course sir, I don't want to answer any question when they understand that.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.080
And I hope I don't ask any. I hope you will see a little before we leave the

07:18.080 --> 07:21.440
little end of it. That you will consult your file or bring it to the

07:21.440 --> 07:23.440
space band with you if you need to move.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.040
Read a letter off to let's put your whole story at the end of what everyone

07:27.040 --> 07:29.280
will show. I just get back with you my answer.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.480
Sure. I need to.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.720
And that will be the perhaps the staff's new or Monday if your

07:34.720 --> 07:37.840
file is elsewhere than washed and the vice is think was likely.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.080
Sure.

07:39.040 --> 07:44.000
May I deal just very shortly with one other matter so that you will understand

07:45.040 --> 07:45.760
that matter.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.760
You are asked about being a partner in a law firm in New York.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.280
That's right.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.880
May I make it clear to you sir that I am in Northon

07:56.880 --> 07:59.040
critical of you on that story?

07:59.040 --> 07:59.760
Is that clear?

07:59.760 --> 08:00.720
Well thank you sir.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.320
And may I add I am perhaps the real Indians in the sense that I would have

08:04.320 --> 08:07.600
liked to achieve that as young as you are the teeth that for the

08:07.600 --> 08:08.720
two weeks of the now.

08:09.680 --> 08:15.120
I did want to ask you that when did you first join that firm?

08:15.840 --> 08:17.360
I take it strike that out.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.200
I take it that when you first joined that firm or associated yourself with it.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.160
The name was different than it's now the case is that right?

08:28.480 --> 08:29.120
Yes it was.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.120
That is the same as your phone.

08:31.120 --> 08:35.760
I understood that you went there first day as employee or junior or something

08:35.760 --> 08:36.560
of that sort.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.200
That's right.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.520
And what was the firm name name?

08:40.480 --> 08:41.520
Kern and Cephan.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.480
Kern see you are.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.680
And when did you join us?

08:47.680 --> 08:49.360
Or when did you go there to talk to you?

08:53.440 --> 08:57.120
I think it was 1949 or 1950.

08:57.840 --> 09:03.680
Then what was the next name that that firm had to?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.520
It's President Wonder what does it mean to me here?

09:05.520 --> 09:06.560
No sir.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.680
I think the next name wasn't present.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.120
I don't think there are any other names.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.080
And that you stated once before and I'm sure it is the

09:14.080 --> 09:16.960
no this courtesy to you to ask you this stated again.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.760
The time comes from a honing.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.200
Time comes from a state and then.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.000
Yes.

09:24.160 --> 09:28.480
And I happen to know this kind of fund that they have to say

09:28.480 --> 09:30.080
in downtown Broadway.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.400
Yeah downtown New York 29 Broadway.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.400
On Broadway at number 29.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
When did you become a partner in this firm?

09:42.960 --> 09:45.680
So I have to check that to get you to say it important.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.040
I got an ink and an acrylic with my ink.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.240
I can get that for you.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.400
So father, do I mean just the summer's near?

09:52.400 --> 09:53.360
What would you say now?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.640
I would say a couple years ago.

09:54.640 --> 09:55.520
A couple years ago.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.760
So the time you are coming on to this

10:05.440 --> 10:08.960
committee of council you were able to and did you of that firm

10:08.960 --> 10:09.520
full time.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.440
By Mr.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.320
How have you are coming to this committee of council?

10:14.320 --> 10:17.040
Did you give that firm full time or you were where you

10:17.040 --> 10:19.600
dealt with or you were in government service anyway?

10:19.600 --> 10:20.720
Oh, I'm not sorry.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.000
I don't know if you've heard the answers.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.280
Like if you sent an ejection.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.680
I heard them sir but I didn't remember them.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.480
I should surely.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.520
No, I have been associated with that firm since about 1950.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.880
At that time I was with the department of justice before I was

10:34.880 --> 10:36.000
associated with that firm.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.600
I was associated with another firm.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.640
In other words, ever since I've been admitted to the far

10:40.640 --> 10:44.400
I have been associated with one or another law firm.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.080
There have been a total of two.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.920
I have given those law firms a very small portion of my time.

10:52.960 --> 10:56.160
I've given the great majority of my time to govern.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.520
Sir, I've tried to understand that.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.480
I was letting Mr.

10:58.480 --> 11:03.040
Cohen if there was any period during the time since you have

11:03.040 --> 11:05.200
been a partner in that firm that you were in a position to

11:05.200 --> 11:06.400
get the firm full time.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.200
No.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.120
Now on the other hand, I have not I think fully understood

11:13.120 --> 11:16.960
until I reach this courtroom that you are supposed to and do

11:16.960 --> 11:20.240
give at least full time and perhaps more than full time

11:20.320 --> 11:21.120
to this committee.

11:23.680 --> 11:28.000
Sir, well, maybe that was a question you didn't understand.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.120
When I reached this courtroom, I didn't actually

11:31.120 --> 11:34.640
understand that you were either required to or did

11:34.640 --> 11:37.280
you all in good time to this committee.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.200
That is a requirement, is that right?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.480
Well, I don't know that it's a requirement.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.600
Or I do know what I do.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.960
Right, and I was going to say you not only give,

11:44.960 --> 11:48.080
let's say seven hours a day up after warriors day or eight hours,

11:48.080 --> 11:50.880
but I gather from your testimony even more than that.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.360
Yes, sir.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.640
I think there are times, not I am not in the clearest by myself on this.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.840
I think every staff member works nice and Saturday

11:57.840 --> 11:58.960
for Sundays very frequently.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.000
Very frequently.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.720
Do you go to your New York office now and then?

12:02.720 --> 12:04.000
Very frequently, sir.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.160
Meaning not once a month or a while, I say I haven't been there

12:08.160 --> 12:09.520
two or three months now.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.320
When I was there before that I might go and maybe once a month

12:14.880 --> 12:15.600
I think it's you.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.200
What about you?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.400
Yes, I think that.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.040
I don't know if there's no question about your rank.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.680
What's the most common number one to defend

12:24.720 --> 12:26.960
much more than the average day of working with this committee.

12:26.960 --> 12:31.040
Number two, he has a great show allow us to

12:32.960 --> 12:36.960
unify views as New York office for the touching of phone calls.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.200
What have you had no cost to the committee?

12:39.680 --> 12:42.960
Senator, I was not the destiny that he didn't give completely

12:43.920 --> 12:47.040
full union hours and more to this committee.

12:47.040 --> 12:51.360
You do ask him to have a secretary in New York first.

12:51.360 --> 12:54.000
No, sir, I don't have a personal check.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.840
Well, there's at least a staff office.

12:55.840 --> 13:00.240
No, there are three very capable girls.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.040
One man to switch forward and another one.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.800
The other two take dictations.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.960
For one last time, would you use that?

13:06.960 --> 13:09.440
Not the last time, but I will.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.040
I thought we had a

13:14.080 --> 13:17.440
front of a mutual agreement with the China stick to the issues

13:17.440 --> 13:19.280
and I don't want to interrupt.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.080
I think we're taking more time than allowing you to pursue the

13:22.080 --> 13:23.040
irrelevant material.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.880
But for what Mr.

13:27.280 --> 13:32.560
Cohen's law does, I can see if the relevant team

13:32.560 --> 13:34.400
supply the Army charges are concerned.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.320
If you want to pursue that, it's all right with the need.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.360
The rule is, it's only in my thought, we're going to get

13:39.360 --> 13:40.000
good results.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.480
I'm dealing with it very lightly, Senator.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.040
There, there.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.480
Now, turning it to you, for a moment, Mr. Shion,

13:50.480 --> 13:52.560
here in New York office, our pilot, Shion,

13:52.560 --> 13:54.240
is the now-known living out.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.200
Yes, sir.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.080
And where is that?

13:58.080 --> 14:00.640
Park Avenue and 57th Street.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.600
And that's it.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.000
What is the name on the door of that all?

14:04.000 --> 14:04.880
The name on the door?

14:05.280 --> 14:08.240
Yes, it's called the Office of the Hotel.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.520
But I say he has an office.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.560
I think he and his father have an office, whoever is there,

14:12.560 --> 14:13.280
he's the best.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.600
And I'm suggesting no slightest in the class.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.680
The I assume you were, but he has been significantly

14:17.680 --> 14:18.400
done the saddle.

14:18.400 --> 14:18.800
They are.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.520
And they just are.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.080
And there is some kind of a staff there.

14:23.200 --> 14:23.920
Yes, sir.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.600
And I think it appears there never is

14:25.600 --> 14:27.040
from the letter of the supply of the world

14:27.040 --> 14:28.960
that he has a secretary at that age.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.400
Well, as a secretary, I don't know.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
He's exclusively his servant.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.520
There is a secretary there.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.000
I know that.

14:35.280 --> 14:39.760
Now, I want to turn the clock back, so to speak,

14:41.360 --> 14:45.280
to the time when you joined this committee,

14:46.080 --> 14:48.560
and when Mr. Shireen joined.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.640
As to actual dates of arrival,

14:55.440 --> 14:58.960
when did you arrive and hang up your hat and go to work?

14:58.960 --> 14:59.840
Yes.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.640
I thought only if that they served.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.560
It occurs to me it was, I'd say about the second week in January

15:08.560 --> 15:11.520
in 1950, first or second week of January,

15:11.520 --> 15:13.600
6-07 something like that.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.040
1953, of course.

15:15.040 --> 15:15.520
Yes.

15:15.520 --> 15:19.760
And I have been saying this to Cohn that, in length, I tell you

15:19.760 --> 15:22.320
otherwise that a date seems to me or some important

15:22.320 --> 15:23.680
to fix it critically.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.000
Then we'll give a talk to whether it's the first week of the

15:26.000 --> 15:27.600
second I'll just go to the whole.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.720
On this one's like this, generally, one's that half.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.200
Yes sir.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.760
So that will be either, I need a little note,

15:33.760 --> 15:35.360
probably second week in January,

15:35.360 --> 15:37.040
something like that, and that, right?

15:37.040 --> 15:37.920
Yes, that's right.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.280
Five to 6-07 something like that.

15:39.280 --> 15:43.680
And you came to the committee, I just keep counsel.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.080
Yes sir.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.680
Did you come from, um,

15:48.640 --> 15:53.200
had all the two of the legal facts in the other law,

15:53.200 --> 15:54.240
our lawyer?

15:54.240 --> 15:55.120
Yes sir.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.440
And when was the very first one at it?

15:57.440 --> 15:59.040
I don't know, so I'd have to check the record.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.360
I want to get on that paper well with you.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.600
Time to inspire our witnesses on after the question

16:03.600 --> 16:04.080
with you.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.320
Have any of you may ask it out?

16:07.280 --> 16:08.480
Did you have to be the last question?

16:08.480 --> 16:10.080
No, that is no longer an off to get up.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.280
It's a very long time.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.480
Uh, Chancellor Jenkins, have you ever any questions?

16:15.520 --> 16:17.680
Chairman, I have only one or two questions.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.520
There's Cohn at this time.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.080
The school next to the morning,

16:22.080 --> 16:24.640
I asked these two bring to the conference room

16:24.640 --> 16:26.640
at the earliest possible moment.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.240
And fire was a committee.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.440
The documents, the data, the memorandum,

16:34.320 --> 16:36.960
prepared by Mr. Chains,

16:37.920 --> 16:40.000
had three different periods.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.120
You will recall that today, like Mr. Johnson.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.760
I'll ask you whether or not you now have that information

16:45.760 --> 16:46.320
available.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.240
Also, we make some progress on that private

16:48.240 --> 16:49.920
Chains work on that during yesterday.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.840
We looked at it again last night.

16:51.840 --> 16:55.600
And I think that, uh, we have to show it to Senator McCawsey again.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.840
We now have it in three tentative stacks.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.880
And I hope we will have it for you, sir, by Monday morning.

17:00.880 --> 17:01.920
By Monday morning, yes, sir.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.920
And you recall that to be furnished in three different types of

17:05.920 --> 17:06.480
three checks.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.840
That's the way we're trying to do it.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.000
I had understood that there's a Cohn and

17:10.000 --> 17:12.320
that perhaps the only source though that you have that

17:12.320 --> 17:14.240
prepared and ready to fire this morning.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.200
And let it be ready to leave.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.320
I'm going to tell you the I.S.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.560
Plane information that he's been saying.

17:19.520 --> 17:25.200
Yesterday morning, I asked Mr. Cohn to continue his work in the

17:25.200 --> 17:29.200
preparation of all the data to talk to him,

17:29.200 --> 17:33.520
the memorandum, the papers prepared by Mr.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.760
Shine during three distinct days of this,

17:37.760 --> 17:40.960
the days from the time that he came to the committees

17:40.960 --> 17:42.160
for the first to be left.

17:42.880 --> 17:46.640
The days from the early prior July to November 3rd

17:46.640 --> 17:48.240
of the eighties and the days in the afternoon.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.440
The days just go up to the date of his

17:51.440 --> 17:53.040
induction on November 3rd.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.840
And the future is the latter

17:57.040 --> 17:58.000
quite for the patient.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.720
The purpose of the questions,

18:00.720 --> 18:03.040
Senator Simon, convenes to the

18:03.040 --> 18:06.640
maybe his committee to determine Tom that's made of him.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.400
The amount of work done by Mr.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.360
Shine during the new day and weekend

18:11.440 --> 18:15.120
is in the far as the work is reflected

18:15.120 --> 18:16.560
by the data call.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.680
I thank the Capitol.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.880
Yes.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.680
Sure.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.000
I have no other questions with Chairman.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.160
The chair will pass his time

18:26.160 --> 18:28.480
as far as expecting the colonist concern,

18:28.480 --> 18:31.680
because he would like to expedite the

18:31.680 --> 18:32.160
machine.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.000
He would enable Mr. Welsh to get out with his

18:34.000 --> 18:35.520
questioning in the graph of his possible.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.280
But he has a question,

18:37.280 --> 18:40.240
which he would like to ask either Mr. Welsh or

18:41.360 --> 18:42.960
Mr. Jenkins.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.320
He called yesterday when a manor

18:46.320 --> 18:48.800
had phone call conversation with red by

18:48.800 --> 18:49.520
Senator Jackson.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.880
There was a follow-up of an Emma Carl

18:52.880 --> 18:54.400
mentioned there a couple of times,

18:54.400 --> 18:55.280
which he

18:55.280 --> 18:57.120
includes must have done the

18:57.120 --> 18:58.640
president chairman of this committee.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.160
And so he would like to have his

19:02.160 --> 19:05.040
monitored conversations, whatever they are,

19:05.040 --> 19:06.240
incorporated in the record.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.480
And I would like to ask council

19:08.480 --> 19:10.800
Jenkins the question first, whether

19:10.800 --> 19:13.200
he or Mr. Maynard or any of the staff

19:13.200 --> 19:15.840
held my monitor's conversations here,

19:15.840 --> 19:18.160
and if they'll they can be made available to me.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.080
Chairman, we are ready and now

19:20.080 --> 19:21.360
have them to the chair.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.720
The question number two is

19:22.720 --> 19:24.160
another letter asked, and Mr. Welsh,

19:26.240 --> 19:31.920
I have one, two, three, four pages

19:31.920 --> 19:34.080
of monitor's conversations here

19:34.080 --> 19:35.280
are the all the Mr. Stevens.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.560
That's all the Mr. Stevens.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.840
There's also well-thinking for Mr. Stevens

19:43.840 --> 19:46.880
have any objection if I now need

19:46.880 --> 19:49.520
my monitor's conversations in a letter.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.760
The answer is no, but I would like to add

19:56.720 --> 19:58.720
something that I say, who I do that

19:58.720 --> 20:00.800
as you know Mr. Chairman.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.640
We have two levels of

20:04.800 --> 20:06.320
monitor telephone calls.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.560
There is the telephone calls

20:10.720 --> 20:12.800
between the secretary of office

20:12.800 --> 20:14.960
and members of this committee.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.640
It is these two secretary Stevens

20:18.640 --> 20:20.400
and to me that is the only

20:20.400 --> 20:22.800
great thing to do in respect of those

20:22.800 --> 20:24.480
quantifiers from what happens

20:24.480 --> 20:26.560
to any other monitor's calls.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.480
It's to say as a same echo in

20:28.480 --> 20:30.480
the absence of any senator.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.200
Senator Jackson has exercised his

20:33.200 --> 20:34.640
option as obviously as now that he

20:34.640 --> 20:36.480
wishes to exercise yours.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.640
And beyond that area,

20:38.640 --> 20:41.680
we are in a situation where

20:43.520 --> 20:45.600
then a democracy and I have

20:46.480 --> 20:48.240
apparently a doable

20:48.240 --> 20:48.960
different kind.

20:50.080 --> 20:50.800
I want

20:51.840 --> 20:54.400
either down in this room by starting

20:54.400 --> 20:56.320
to put in in chronological order

20:56.320 --> 20:58.160
the telephone call, the monitor's

20:58.160 --> 21:00.080
telephone call, the limited needs.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.720
And we ended up by a formula

21:03.440 --> 21:05.520
signed by Mr. Stevens and Adams

21:05.520 --> 21:08.160
under which they agree that all

21:08.160 --> 21:10.400
telephone calls between the parties

21:11.360 --> 21:12.320
may go inevitable.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.200
In just a certain amount of

21:15.200 --> 21:17.600
I think his position and I ought not

21:17.600 --> 21:18.800
to try to say this for him,

21:18.800 --> 21:20.400
but I think his position is that

21:20.400 --> 21:23.120
unless we have all the telephone calls

21:23.120 --> 21:24.880
at every level between members

21:24.880 --> 21:26.720
of the executive department,

21:26.720 --> 21:28.880
that for example, as I've heard

21:28.880 --> 21:30.720
mentioned off on this between

21:30.720 --> 21:33.040
secretary Stevens and law.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.000
No, not to go with.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.720
We know what Mr.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.480
Jenkins and I know, I think we know what

21:38.480 --> 21:40.000
the effects of very specific

21:40.000 --> 21:41.840
or directed is in that area.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.880
So I have in this situation

21:44.880 --> 21:46.320
where I want in evidence

21:46.320 --> 21:47.680
all telephone calls

21:48.640 --> 21:50.000
that can go in evidence.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.800
Or if we can't have all of those,

21:54.800 --> 21:57.280
I don't think that I want part of them

21:57.280 --> 21:58.720
just as I understand

21:58.720 --> 22:00.480
Senator Maccassi just saying that if he

22:00.480 --> 22:01.520
can't have all

22:01.520 --> 22:03.920
telephone conversations in every area,

22:04.640 --> 22:05.680
he doesn't want any.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.560
So the statement to out in position again

22:08.560 --> 22:10.240
with his easy freedom as a chairman.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.880
It is that any senator is

22:12.880 --> 22:14.560
including that jury and formal

22:14.560 --> 22:16.480
as yourself has the option to put any

22:16.480 --> 22:18.560
telephone calls with the secretary's office

22:18.560 --> 22:20.640
or with Mr. Adams as well.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.400
Outside that area,

22:23.840 --> 22:28.560
I do not want a sort of a sliding option

22:28.560 --> 22:31.120
by which a monitor call

22:31.120 --> 22:32.720
keeps going in without

22:32.720 --> 22:34.080
stomach standing between the

22:34.080 --> 22:37.120
senator and me as to whether

22:37.120 --> 22:38.720
or go in or not.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.360
Is that fair?

22:39.360 --> 22:40.880
I am aware that the judges are making

22:40.880 --> 22:42.480
for you Mr. Wilkinson, that's an action

22:42.480 --> 22:42.960
which

22:44.080 --> 22:45.840
occurred to him this morning while shaving,

22:45.840 --> 22:47.280
which may be helpful, I don't know.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.360
Puzzling as I have frequently about what we can do

22:51.360 --> 22:53.840
to make this deadlocked about telephone calls,

22:54.960 --> 22:58.240
believing that the main difficulty of

22:58.240 --> 23:00.000
the part of it to call the Mr.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.160
and send him a crappy theme to be that they

23:03.120 --> 23:04.960
want to be called that they know

23:04.960 --> 23:07.200
or made in no amount of it between

23:07.200 --> 23:09.360
Steven's and Adams and Steven's

23:09.360 --> 23:10.960
dealing with the

23:10.960 --> 23:12.800
rotten situations.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.640
And perhaps a call which may

23:14.640 --> 23:15.840
remain out of the monarchy

23:15.840 --> 23:17.120
between rotten and

23:17.120 --> 23:19.360
Steven's or rotten and

23:20.880 --> 23:22.880
Adam, it appears to be

23:22.880 --> 23:24.640
shared that if you were to ask

23:24.640 --> 23:25.920
your client, Mr.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.040
Steven's and Mr. Adam,

23:27.840 --> 23:29.200
in turn, you request

23:29.200 --> 23:30.880
to attorney general Brownel,

23:31.840 --> 23:34.880
that he sort of be classified or

23:34.880 --> 23:37.680
include out from the executive order,

23:37.680 --> 23:39.760
so particularly at all,

23:39.760 --> 23:42.480
we would then be able to ask Senator McCarthy

23:42.480 --> 23:44.560
and Mr. Cohn the direct question

23:44.560 --> 23:47.120
now that these calls are available.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.200
To have specifically requested,

23:49.200 --> 23:51.520
do you approve of putting in

23:51.520 --> 23:53.520
all the solid and chronological order

23:53.520 --> 23:55.760
in conformity with the McClellan

23:55.760 --> 23:57.920
emotion, that's the suggestion I'm my part

23:57.920 --> 23:58.960
on, that's kind of

23:58.960 --> 24:00.320
with you on this spot, we're all

24:00.320 --> 24:01.200
thinking out loud,

24:01.200 --> 24:02.960
trying to find a formula,

24:02.960 --> 24:04.240
and it would seem to me that

24:04.240 --> 24:06.720
both Mr. Steven's and Mr. Adam

24:06.720 --> 24:08.320
should be represent us about trying

24:08.320 --> 24:09.600
to get those calls in,

24:09.600 --> 24:11.360
because they want the other calls in.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.200
And I think if he would make that effort,

24:13.200 --> 24:14.400
it might be helpful.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.560
Mr. Cohn,

24:16.560 --> 24:18.000
I do really trust him directly

24:18.000 --> 24:19.600
that, but to me, I'm sure, well,

24:20.560 --> 24:22.080
Mr. Cohn, may I say that

24:22.080 --> 24:24.880
as far as any calls with

24:26.320 --> 24:27.280
the New York concern,

24:27.280 --> 24:28.480
I can see no objections

24:28.480 --> 24:29.920
that I can put them in record.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.880
I think it might be,

24:30.880 --> 24:32.080
I tell you the thing,

24:32.080 --> 24:33.680
if all of these conifers now

24:33.680 --> 24:34.720
with a green tab there,

24:35.920 --> 24:37.760
monitors calls put in the record,

24:39.200 --> 24:41.440
I have them likely to serve

24:41.440 --> 24:43.120
here by the fact that

24:43.120 --> 24:44.640
quite a while, my Republican colleague

24:44.640 --> 24:46.080
has testified on the rules

24:46.080 --> 24:48.800
in regards to the conversations

24:48.800 --> 24:50.560
with Mr. Adam and Mr. Steven's

24:50.560 --> 24:52.560
by democrat colleagues

24:52.560 --> 24:54.080
and not yet gotten to that point.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.640
I think in monitors calls,

24:56.640 --> 24:57.840
it might be well-mouthing

24:57.840 --> 24:59.120
of all the center's calls

24:59.120 --> 25:00.160
to the unincluding mine.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.200
Now, as far as Mr. Adam and Mr. Cohn

25:03.200 --> 25:04.000
have concerned,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.400
as I recall, I mean Mr. Cohn,

25:06.400 --> 25:07.120
Mr. Carerson,

25:07.120 --> 25:09.040
I understand with that,

25:09.040 --> 25:11.280
he had no monetary calls

25:11.280 --> 25:12.240
with Mr. Cohn.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.080
I find, and

25:14.640 --> 25:15.840
suspecting the matter with,

25:17.120 --> 25:18.560
counseled my staff

25:18.560 --> 25:20.160
that there are no monetary calls

25:20.160 --> 25:21.120
of Mr. Car

25:22.080 --> 25:25.520
until the day after I refuse

25:26.480 --> 25:28.240
to exceed Mr. Adam's demand

25:28.240 --> 25:29.360
to call off the hearing.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.120
That's any comments to call Mr. Car

25:34.880 --> 25:36.080
constantly?

25:36.080 --> 25:38.480
Mr. Cohn of that time had already refused

25:38.480 --> 25:40.720
to have any conversations with Mr.

25:40.720 --> 25:41.200
Adam.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.520
He now agrees that he shuddered

25:43.520 --> 25:44.160
and viewed the Mr.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.280
representation being made

25:45.280 --> 25:46.320
about his conversations.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.520
So before I would advise Mr. Car,

25:49.520 --> 25:50.560
may I have the chair's attention

25:50.560 --> 25:52.960
that before I would advise Mr. Car

25:53.760 --> 25:54.640
on this matter,

25:54.640 --> 25:55.520
and view the fact

25:55.520 --> 25:57.440
the phone conversation started

25:59.600 --> 26:00.240
Senator McCollum,

26:00.240 --> 26:01.760
I wonder if I could have the chair's attention

26:01.760 --> 26:01.920
on this.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.600
Before I would advise Mr. Car,

26:08.560 --> 26:10.560
on what he should do about those phone calls,

26:11.360 --> 26:12.800
view the fact that it doesn't start

26:12.800 --> 26:15.280
until after the day the blackmail failed,

26:16.160 --> 26:18.480
I would want to see how self-serving they are.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.880
There's obviously a purpose

26:20.880 --> 26:23.440
in his starting to call Mr. Car,

26:24.240 --> 26:26.640
monitoring the calls of day after the blackmail

26:26.640 --> 26:29.040
attempt failed not before that.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.360
However, as far as my phone calls are concerned,

26:32.800 --> 26:34.480
I have no objection having him put in.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.840
I think it was the last day of the day.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.960
I hope they think of all of the

26:36.960 --> 26:38.480
centers right now this morning.

26:39.840 --> 26:40.640
Would say that Mr.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.480
Jenkins go ahead and put into the record

26:42.480 --> 26:44.320
all of the phone calls with senators.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.280
But, Car, is that kind of you?

26:47.280 --> 26:48.640
Is there any of these other

26:48.640 --> 26:50.640
senators in position of really one thing

26:50.640 --> 26:52.000
or another, but he feels that

26:52.000 --> 26:53.520
since his name was mentioned in the

26:53.520 --> 26:55.200
monitor's call that was read,

26:55.200 --> 26:57.520
since the chair has said from the very beginning,

26:58.320 --> 27:00.720
he expected to find the way if he possibly could

27:00.720 --> 27:02.240
they have his own personal monitor

27:02.240 --> 27:04.400
calls put in because he was quite surprised

27:04.400 --> 27:05.280
if they had been monitored.

27:06.000 --> 27:06.800
He's never done the

27:07.680 --> 27:09.920
been honored by having a telephone call

27:09.920 --> 27:12.160
with his monitor before by anybody.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.320
And he'd been kind of curious to know how it looks

27:14.320 --> 27:15.360
and how it sounds.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.760
He thinks other people have the same curiosity.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.760
So he expects to read his into the record.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.560
Each senator will have to discover himself

27:22.560 --> 27:24.720
according to his own desire to know

27:24.720 --> 27:27.040
intention is suggesting other senators what they do.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.320
The chair would say one other thing

27:28.320 --> 27:30.800
from him at the LSE is incorrect in his memory.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.720
He believes Mr. Adams justifying

27:32.720 --> 27:33.520
you under oath says,

27:34.400 --> 27:36.000
that his calls were not monitored.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.160
He'd be talking about calls made from Mr. Adams.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.240
I doubt whether it calls between

27:40.240 --> 27:42.560
Adams and any of the other three we pose for a monitor.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.400
We find we find the were monitored

27:44.400 --> 27:45.040
and then the federal

27:45.040 --> 27:46.080
semester Adams may ask me.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.440
I was under the same impression.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.440
I thought that he had sworn under

27:49.600 --> 27:51.600
oath that none of his calls were monitored.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.960
I was very surprised to find monitored calls

27:54.960 --> 27:57.600
in Mr. Adams, Mr. Caragel over and checking the record.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.680
I find that apparently he was referring only to

28:02.560 --> 28:04.480
monitored calls Mr. Cohen,

28:04.480 --> 28:06.640
that he said none was Mr. Cohen or monitored.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.440
I see.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.400
But very well,

28:08.400 --> 28:10.320
Sheryl has seen any of the mannered calls

28:10.320 --> 28:10.960
that he doesn't know.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.240
He doesn't call the records.

28:12.240 --> 28:12.960
Yes, sir.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.440
Tell him.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.200
Okay.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.160
Okay.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.000
Chad, I'm sending the call.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.200
Mr. Chairman, I remind you,

28:21.200 --> 28:22.800
and the other members of the committee,

28:22.800 --> 28:24.000
they guessed the morning,

28:25.200 --> 28:29.440
monitor calls came up and we were discussing it

28:30.400 --> 28:32.560
before Senator Gargison

28:32.560 --> 28:34.240
faced his calls in the record.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.000
I announced that my calls were going

28:38.000 --> 28:40.080
in before the hearing concluded.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.400
I did not place my calls in the record yet to do

28:44.400 --> 28:48.080
because that was no proper or legal way

28:48.080 --> 28:49.440
to do that that time.

28:49.440 --> 28:52.720
I now call your attention to the fact that

28:54.880 --> 28:58.640
the proceedings here in our proposing are irregular.

28:59.680 --> 29:03.760
In that few placing, these monitor calls in the record

29:04.480 --> 29:07.920
without them being unloaded, without them being shown

29:08.240 --> 29:10.800
to any signs of conflict of testimony.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.720
Most part of the record would not be unloaded,

29:14.720 --> 29:18.000
then back when we could not prosecute anyone

29:18.000 --> 29:18.960
for a period.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.080
And at the end so far,

29:22.080 --> 29:25.520
as these monitor calls have been in the record in this practice,

29:26.400 --> 29:29.200
the order to make the proceedings proper,

29:29.920 --> 29:30.640
illegal,

29:30.640 --> 29:32.400
firm-ever-spamble,

29:32.400 --> 29:33.760
technical and otherwise,

29:34.560 --> 29:37.680
I think it advisable to immediately call

29:37.920 --> 29:39.920
a gentleman who's got the name Lucas,

29:39.920 --> 29:41.920
who looks at Lucas,

29:41.920 --> 29:43.600
who monitored the calls,

29:43.600 --> 29:47.120
who made these notes and placed him on the stand

29:47.120 --> 29:49.920
and placed these monitors record with calls.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.920
I know so that they will be legal testimony

29:53.920 --> 29:55.680
before the submitting.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.920
That will must do so in order to make the proceedings legal.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.880
In order to make some proper,

30:02.880 --> 30:05.360
I am moved that we immediately

30:05.920 --> 30:09.360
call for the proceedings of Mr. Lucas

30:09.360 --> 30:13.360
and that this witness be temporarily removed

30:13.360 --> 30:16.360
from the stand and Mr. Lucas be placed there

30:16.360 --> 30:18.360
to testify and move

30:19.360 --> 30:21.360
through these monitor calls and we're using that.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.360
If you'll do that,

30:23.360 --> 30:25.360
I'll be the first one, the last of mine.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.360
I'm going to place him in the record.

30:27.360 --> 30:31.360
Our water place is in the record legally,

30:31.360 --> 30:33.360
and with all the force and effect of sworn testimony.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.360
I do not want the place in the record

30:37.360 --> 30:41.360
unless I have to end the fascism that's now being proposed.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.360
So I'm moved to gentlemen.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.360
That immediately.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.360
We call Mr. Lucas

30:47.360 --> 30:49.360
the first to file a role with respect

30:49.360 --> 30:51.360
for these records of monitor calls.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.360
But you are before you pass on the motion,

30:53.360 --> 30:55.360
I want to make one other observation.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.360
There is this statement here

30:59.360 --> 31:01.360
and I assume it's active.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.360
That there are monitor calls between Mr. Adams

31:05.360 --> 31:07.360
and Mr. Steven

31:07.360 --> 31:09.360
part is to this conversation.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.360
Mr. Chairman, there is no further

31:11.360 --> 31:13.360
than should erected.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.360
That prevents those calls from going in this record

31:15.360 --> 31:17.360
so far as I know.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.360
Unless the Lucas should be called here

31:19.360 --> 31:21.360
and required to produce those monitor calls

31:21.360 --> 31:25.360
because I understand the Army can't see them.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.360
If you not consider, is that monitor?

31:27.360 --> 31:29.360
I think Mr. Wittler is not here.

31:29.360 --> 31:31.360
That monitor in the heat of the existing world

31:31.360 --> 31:33.360
who was yesterday, he confused the executive right

31:33.360 --> 31:35.360
to include those specifically.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.360
There are Mr. Chairman, I don't care what

31:37.360 --> 31:39.360
the construction place on that order has

31:39.360 --> 31:41.360
but between the principle books of this counter-versus

31:41.360 --> 31:43.360
there is no executive order what to find.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.360
This committee accepted his thought.

31:45.360 --> 31:49.360
It is a conversation as to extraneous matter.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.360
You've got them set here in Sustafide

31:51.360 --> 31:53.360
there to say Adams and Steven's

31:53.360 --> 31:55.360
what each told the other.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.360
And certainly you can get it in a monitor

31:57.360 --> 32:01.360
called, I shall see a slip-row fit.

32:01.360 --> 32:05.360
In a decision of this committee or in a party,

32:05.360 --> 32:07.360
for these proceedings I would undertake to keep the monitor

32:07.360 --> 32:09.360
involved between Adams and Steven's out of this record.
