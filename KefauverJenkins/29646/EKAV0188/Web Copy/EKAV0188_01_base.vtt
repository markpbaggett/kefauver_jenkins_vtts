WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.840
Yes, that's your pass for the Navy and the other force.

00:07.840 --> 00:08.840
That's right.

00:08.840 --> 00:09.840
I'm not by that.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.840
Not really.

00:10.840 --> 00:11.840
No, so I'm talking about the charge that you made again, touch.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.360
The second part of that paragraph, where you said, the issue raised by Senator Potter's

00:16.360 --> 00:21.760
letter as the letter undue informed with you by Senator McCarthy in his face was saying

00:21.760 --> 00:23.760
something that's a statement before I was telling you.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.760
You said that to him.

00:24.760 --> 00:25.760
Yes.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.640
The issue was raised by Senator Potter's letter.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.600
That was one of the letters that was raised in.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.640
That happened to bring the thing pretty much to a head because this thing had been going

00:34.640 --> 00:39.640
on for many weeks and when Senator Potter's letter was directed, the secretary of defense

00:39.640 --> 00:43.640
came in and it's that he reached that error point when the thing just got to reach

00:43.640 --> 00:44.640
behind him.

00:44.640 --> 00:56.640
Mr. Secretary, when I included my last thing in the period around this particular source

00:56.640 --> 01:01.640
and I wondered if you were talking to him when you said it was a matter of a set it

01:01.640 --> 01:03.640
up by some of the Potter's stirring all true.

01:03.640 --> 01:08.640
That's what I think we all agree to to ramp up the rising of the fraction of his Potter's

01:08.640 --> 01:09.640
letter of a star's relief.

01:09.640 --> 01:17.640
Now, at the time you were discussing that on the road, did you then know that a member

01:17.640 --> 01:25.640
of the executive others in front of him had come back to Senator Potter and suggested to

01:25.640 --> 01:27.640
him that he write that letter?

01:27.640 --> 01:28.640
Did not know that, then?

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
And don't know it now.

01:29.640 --> 01:37.640
Have you ever heard of that someone from the executive who knew about the meeting with

01:37.640 --> 01:38.640
21st of January?

01:38.640 --> 01:47.640
knew that the suggestion of mayor there of the charges, the formalized and writing, then

01:47.640 --> 01:51.640
gotten press of Senator Potter and said, what's your right to?

01:52.640 --> 01:56.640
The Pentagon asked if the charges were at least, did you know that?

01:56.640 --> 01:58.640
First time I ever heard of that was this morning.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.640
But you know what now, don't you?

02:00.640 --> 02:01.640
I do not know.

02:01.640 --> 02:05.640
You heard Senator Potter said to your first time in the year on the language that Senator Potter

02:05.640 --> 02:06.640
used.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.640
If you have a little reflect my memory on us, that was the first indication that I had of.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.640
Well, you know the Senator Potter said he did get a cross from someone from the executive?

02:13.640 --> 02:16.640
I say I didn't hear all of what Senator Potter said.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.640
And did you hear it mature well?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.640
I want you to refresh the Secretary's recollection.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
This is rather important.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.640
We have a sequence of the events you are right to trust you about.

02:25.640 --> 02:30.640
But what's the important thing Senator that I never heard of it until it's mine?

02:30.640 --> 02:31.640
No.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.640
Do you have anything you've heard that didn't hear of it, Mr. Secretary?

02:35.640 --> 02:40.640
We are concerned here with who is together.

02:41.640 --> 02:49.640
They charge us which resulted in the complete wrecking of the committee's normal function,

02:49.640 --> 02:52.640
and tied us up on this work for a week.

02:52.640 --> 02:59.640
We have here a statement to the press to the effect that the other decisions were made solely by the Army.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.640
The decisions are in act.

03:01.640 --> 03:09.640
We have Mr. Adams, the testimony of the effect of the decision to make the charge of formal,

03:09.640 --> 03:14.640
and come and see the subject of the right of that of a justice department meeting,

03:14.640 --> 03:17.640
to quite a tough personnel letter.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.640
I don't agree now.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.640
What's the next?

03:19.640 --> 03:21.640
We now know that the letter.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.640
So she said, head it up to the matter.

03:24.640 --> 03:33.640
In effect, for us to finally put out the charge for the instigated by someone from the executive,

03:34.640 --> 03:41.640
we thought information you still want to send by your statements that were recorded.

03:41.640 --> 03:46.640
We used to make it perfectly perfect between the decisions on the act,

03:46.640 --> 03:48.640
and the part of the Army concerning the controversy,

03:48.640 --> 03:53.640
presently being heard by the Senate front committee, where the decisions and the act

03:53.640 --> 03:57.640
so that the Department of the Army alone, I do, I stand squarely on that.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.640
And you want to say that no one else can anything to do with it?

04:00.640 --> 04:03.640
I have explained to you the discussions and the comments.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.640
Well, just to let me make a chemical announcement.

04:05.640 --> 04:13.640
You said that no one except the Department of the Army had anything to do with the making of these decisions for the act.

04:15.640 --> 04:20.640
I explained to you, Senator McCarty, just how the decision which is made,

04:20.640 --> 04:26.640
and a lot of decisions are made in the executive branch of the government or in the operation of a business.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.640
I would work, doesn't people have got to gather and discuss matters?

04:30.640 --> 04:33.640
Mr. President, there is no written order issue.

04:33.640 --> 04:38.640
Mr. Featham, I am getting awfully weary of this attempt to get a few simple facts from you

04:38.640 --> 04:40.640
that are fulfilling teeth.

04:40.640 --> 04:47.640
We've sent just a vast amount of time here trying to get answers from simple questions.

04:47.640 --> 04:51.640
I have frankly given up trying to get you to tell us whether or not you wish you the order,

04:51.640 --> 04:55.640
because your testimony is so trying to dictate, I can't reconcile.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.640
I'm now on another question.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.640
Question is this.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.640
You made a statement this morning under rules.

05:00.640 --> 05:06.640
You said I wish to make it perfectly planned, but the decisions and the acts on the part of the Army concerning the controversy

05:06.640 --> 05:13.640
are closely being heard by the Senate subcommittee where the decisions and the acts of the Department of the Army are wrong.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.640
Now, do you still stand by that paper?

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
I do.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.640
Do you, do you say that John Adams was not telling you truth?

05:24.640 --> 05:35.640
When he said that the decision, out of 40 testimony of meeting finally concluded, with the decision that I should call on our Republican members in investigating subcommittee,

05:35.640 --> 05:42.640
the Democrats members were not members with committee and point out to them that two problems which I had discussed in the attorney general's office,

05:42.640 --> 05:48.640
and before you answer that, Mr. Secretary, you understand here is your chief legal counsel saying the decision.

05:49.640 --> 06:07.640
The decision to bring the training to the members of the committee, the main decision in connection with the attempt to get us to call off the hearing on the loyalty board that had been clearing comments.

06:07.640 --> 06:15.640
He said that the decision was made in the Justice Department with White House Aid's presence, with the attorney general presence,

06:15.640 --> 06:19.640
and after the viewing presence.

06:19.640 --> 06:28.640
I'm sure that any man who can add two and two Mr. Secretary will agree that that completely contradicts your statement that all decisions or the decisions of the Department of the Army are wrong.

06:28.640 --> 06:34.640
I wonder if you want your sworn testimony this morning to stand up until they're not.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.640
I want it to stand.

06:36.640 --> 06:44.640
You say that I, and I say in the four other kind of a card, in another very, very long, I won't call it a question, I thought it's a speech.

06:44.640 --> 06:54.640
I just made sure that you move and I can't remember all of it, but I do remember part of it, which I've covered before and I've just witnessed respect to the use of the word by Mr. Adam.

06:54.640 --> 07:03.640
Something was concluded, and I say again that when you said honest, checklist, witness chair, say it today, to the first to kind of answer questions.

07:03.640 --> 07:11.640
You may have easily used the wrong word, and my guess is that Mr. Adam probably used the wrong word, because I'm satisfied that his action was an independent one.

07:12.640 --> 07:17.640
Mr. Steven, you complain about being on a stand day after day. We gave you a long vacation.

07:17.640 --> 07:23.640
You should take a trip out to Montana and make speeches. You should be refreshed now so you business to be.

07:23.640 --> 07:31.640
I'll resent that remark. I tell the truth. And I don't think the chairman ought to allow that kind of excitement to be made.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.640
Well? Well?

07:33.640 --> 07:38.640
Well, let's see if he can make it.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.640
Let's see what it's going to be up on now.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.640
The truth is, the falsity, the truth. Let's see what it's going to be up on now.

07:44.640 --> 07:50.640
He covered him and told him to do some both days. If he had a mental lapse, then he can tell us that.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.640
So, let's wait. They tell someone in the two days, all right?

07:53.640 --> 07:59.640
I don't enjoy seeing the secretary from up here and trying to take himself on a roll.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.640
What kind of dictum therapy is that?

08:01.640 --> 08:02.640
How far?

08:02.640 --> 08:03.640
How far?

08:03.640 --> 08:08.640
How dictum therapy has, and we'll point out the contradiction. See whether, but are you set up and telling the truth, but your secretary in both days?

08:08.640 --> 08:11.640
Are you listening to Carefully?

08:11.640 --> 08:15.640
I believe that's the money of Steven, the first test of money.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.640
One I have marked.

08:18.640 --> 08:25.640
You both think we're not supposed to talk about the rest of the money marked, you're the first one to be in the president.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.640
The carbon copy of Steven's by Mark Johnson.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.640
If you look up, I read just to you, Mr. Secretary.

08:31.640 --> 08:36.640
I wouldn't go over this again except you reasonable facts, and I told you that you couldn't be doing the truth.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.640
Both times.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.640
All right, let's see what the result is justified.

08:41.640 --> 08:47.640
In the case of a bad memory, you can tell us if you were too tired of the time, you can tell us that.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.640
Um...

08:48.640 --> 08:56.640
Senator McCarthy, do you know whether you did or not?

08:56.640 --> 09:02.640
Did a father important Mr. Secretary to know, and I'm reading from page 1458 to 61?

09:02.640 --> 09:06.640
Did a father important Mr. Secretary to know how come on this particular night?

09:06.640 --> 09:14.640
Well, apparently, we can see the idea for this American pan against my staff, and I'd like to know who originated and who talked to whom?

09:15.640 --> 09:23.640
Secretary Steven, the April's originated from him or any other time which I very much dealt with, I have no knowledge of it, and I had nothing to do with it.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.640
Senator McCarthy, you say...

09:25.640 --> 09:29.640
I said, come, that was just you were really talking about, and I have no part of it.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.640
First of all, you were absolutely right, so you had nothing to do with it.

09:35.640 --> 09:40.640
First of all, if you say you had nothing to do with it, absolutely nothing to do with it.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.640
If a dear friend had thrown him out of smear, and I had nothing to do with it, smear.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.640
In other words, you were throwing you in absolutely nothing to do with it because I used the word smear.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.640
That's the word you use, right?

09:49.640 --> 09:50.640
It's a powerful word.

09:50.640 --> 09:51.640
Let's go on a trip to the room.

09:51.640 --> 09:55.640
The image is right, we'll have to run around the table, Mr. Dinkins.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.640
Chair pastor, send us on my left.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.640
Wow.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.640
Send us on my right.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.640
So, well, Mr. McCarthy, you may continue.

10:02.640 --> 10:09.640
Now, the chair suggests that we have just about this 10 minutes left between now and the reset time

10:09.640 --> 10:14.640
and hopes that the questions can be asked and the answer is contained in that 10 minutes.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.640
And this is Sam and Mr. Dinkins.

10:16.640 --> 10:22.640
This is somewhat out of character for this to well, but I would like to suggest that we continue.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.640
I know we do conclude with a lecture called Not Share of the 10.

10:24.640 --> 10:29.640
We will have to put up the 10 minutes to go to Senator's appointment after that 7 minutes.

10:29.640 --> 10:37.640
Mr. Dinkins, look to chairman because we asked the chair to order the official order to type up all of the stuff that we've taken this morning

10:37.640 --> 10:46.640
and get that to the earliest moment so we can put in the records the specific contradictions on the part of Mr. Stavon's contradictions and the stuff that we've taken today.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.640
And I have available the answer to that.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.640
We always can see the transcripts of the morning session before the afternoon session begins.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.640
Very good. Thank you.

10:54.640 --> 11:20.640
Mr. Clecifer, did you discuss with Mr. Adams the first that he had consulted with four newsmen on these charges before they were made available to any funders?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.640
I think that was outside this.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.640
Mr. Dinkins, please be a little bit better.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.640
Mr. Welch is entirely correct.

11:27.640 --> 11:34.640
You remember Senator's decision, Craig, is confined to the state of the secretary of May 19th.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.640
And that is outside of the scope of his inquiry.

11:38.640 --> 11:48.640
Now, for another matter, I would have liked to know if you further said that Mr. Steven would appear later as they generally said that we found this question made me properly asked.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.640
I assume Mr. Dinkins did not get the import of the question.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.640
My point is that I was headed on fire, but I'm not.

11:54.640 --> 12:06.640
Those four newsmen who are jointly responsible for advice and thought, if you can testify on her oath that they have been associated with an enemy of mine, the other paper has been made.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.640
The pharmacolum was that question would be offered.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
Well, that's the plan when you put this thing.

12:12.640 --> 12:24.640
Mr. Dinkins, I'd like to ask you now, whether or not you discussed with Mr. Adams.

12:24.640 --> 12:33.640
In the fact that before he made these charges for their written up, while they were being written up, he just testimony it was for newsmen.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.640
He just discussed that with me.

12:35.640 --> 12:40.640
You asked me the other day for a better now, or this is repetitious again, but let's go into it.

12:40.640 --> 12:45.640
You asked me all about this the other day, and I talked to Fright at Paul and the record, and if I may, I'd like to stand on those answers.

12:45.640 --> 12:50.640
Well, you're testimony the other day, Mr. Steven's words, that he had only talked to an hour before, probably.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.640
Since then, Mr. Adams has testified, and so did he.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.640
He just does some matter with Mr. Hoover Bigger.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.640
The New York paper?

12:58.640 --> 13:00.640
He did. I didn't finish.

13:01.640 --> 13:14.640
With Mr. Murray Murder, Mr. Phil Potter, and he just self-rightoffly took a trip with Mr. Al Fundley as a local daily work.

13:14.640 --> 13:20.640
Now, my question is, did you discuss with him?

13:21.640 --> 13:31.640
Why he had these conferences with individuals, all of whom's papers have consistently opposed any exposure of communism,

13:31.640 --> 13:37.640
consistently opposed any investigating committees, and have consistently attacked the chairman of this committee?

13:37.640 --> 13:40.640
Well, you're curious, no, why he felt there at length.

13:40.640 --> 13:45.640
I don't believe he felt there, but we only do discuss them under witness.

13:45.640 --> 13:50.640
I didn't know anything about it, so a long time afterwards, and we covered that in my testimony the other day, Senator.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.640
Did you discuss the matter with Mr. Secretary?

13:53.640 --> 13:59.640
And I know, but Mr. Adams would have told me if he had thought any advice.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.640
I'm confident he did not.

14:01.640 --> 14:05.640
Did you discuss the matter with Mr. Adams?

14:05.640 --> 14:11.640
No, I didn't discuss the matter with Mr. Adams until a long time afterwards, which I covered with my testimony with you the other day.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.640
But then you did discuss going along from afterwards?

14:13.640 --> 14:19.640
I mean, he's following me a long time afterwards about Mr. Al Fundley.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.640
I just testified on that, it's all in here somewhere, Senator.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.640
Did he tell you about the other three?

14:24.640 --> 14:28.640
I don't recall what he did, no. One name is the only thing I remember.

14:28.640 --> 14:35.640
Would you say that he was violating his position here at Legal Counsel?

14:35.640 --> 14:46.640
Yes, he discussed with foreign newsman, who is sworn, like that, to me, as testified he knew where enemies of mine, and consistently writing against me,

14:46.640 --> 14:49.640
would you say he violated his trust to go to them and get advice?

14:49.640 --> 14:51.640
And how does the press charge?

14:51.640 --> 14:53.640
I don't believe he did go for him to go for it by his.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.640
Did you ask him?

14:55.640 --> 14:57.640
I have a misunderstanding, but they did not.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.640
Did you ask him whether he got advice?

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
No, I didn't.

15:00.640 --> 15:06.640
Did you ask him what Mr. Al Fundley was doing in his office, examining the files?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.640
No, I didn't.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.640
Have you seen Mr. Al Fundley's testimony?

15:10.640 --> 15:11.640
No, I have not.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.640
Don't you think that you should see it, Mr. Secretary?

15:13.640 --> 15:15.640
That's right.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.640
Is it available for me?

15:16.640 --> 15:17.640
I have seen it.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
I have seen it.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.640
Mr. Al Fundley has it.

15:21.640 --> 15:28.640
Now, I understand your testimony, but you did not discuss with him his conversation with a bigger 20-body-on.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.640
That's right.

15:30.640 --> 15:36.640
Now, you said that you made suggestions for the preparation of the charges.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.640
That's right.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.640
Who did you make the suggestion to?

15:40.640 --> 15:48.640
I made them to Mr. Baum and Mr. Adams mentioned to.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.640
No, I asked you this, Mr. Secretary.

15:51.640 --> 15:58.640
If the suggestion came to Mr. Adams from a conference of White House aid in the Attorney General,

15:58.640 --> 16:01.640
would you consider them in a nature of an order?

16:01.640 --> 16:02.640
I would not.

16:02.640 --> 16:08.640
Would you consider a suggestion by Sherman Adams in a nature of an order?

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
I would not.

16:09.640 --> 16:16.640
You know that Mr. Adams acted upon those suggestions?

16:16.640 --> 16:19.640
I would, Mr. Adams, be talking about Senator.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.640
Mr. John Adams.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.640
Will you repeat the question?

16:22.640 --> 16:26.640
You know that Mr. John Adams acted upon these suggestions of Mr. Sherman Adams.

16:26.640 --> 16:30.640
Apparently, that's the charges we put in writing.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.640
They go and buzz up the conference.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.640
I don't know whether he did or not.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.640
I know if I specified here this morning that he has a good lawyer.

16:37.640 --> 16:42.640
He's put down some number and then got his phone together in the form of a file.

16:42.640 --> 16:43.640
No.

16:43.640 --> 16:49.640
You know what he did not do that as a good lawyer in the last three of the White House conference?

16:49.640 --> 16:50.640
I didn't hear.

16:50.640 --> 16:55.640
I said you know that as a good lawyer, as you say, he did not do that for the last of the White House conference.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.640
There was no White House conference, but I know anything about it.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.640
I mean the justice department, I'm sorry.

17:01.640 --> 17:06.640
It's key about two or three days after that as I understand it, but it's down.

17:06.640 --> 17:12.640
You know that as I was an independent action on his part as a result of a suggestion, probably.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.640
An independent action as a result of a suggestion?

17:14.640 --> 17:16.640
That's right.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.640
Did you know that Mr. Rogers saw the human suggestion?

17:19.640 --> 17:21.640
Did you see Senator McCollum?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.640
I learned that later.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.640
I came home from the fire.

17:25.640 --> 17:29.640
Do you think that he went to see Mr. McCollum as an independent action immediately?

17:29.640 --> 17:31.640
I do.

17:31.640 --> 17:35.640
In other words, there was no connection between the two.

17:35.640 --> 17:42.640
I'm sure Mr. Rogers would be the first to say that he wouldn't order Mr. Adams or Mayor or anyone else over there to do anything.

17:42.640 --> 17:48.640
Mr. Secretary, you know that your legal counsel followed all the suggestions made about meeting.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.640
You know that Mr. Rogers told him up and said, I'll make an appointment.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.640
There was Senator McCollum.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.640
The appointment was made.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.640
Adams won the $1,600 McCollum.

17:59.640 --> 18:03.640
Did you think that some millions of American people listening to you,

18:03.640 --> 18:07.640
you want to know that as the Secretary of the Army say there was no connection?

18:07.640 --> 18:11.640
But he just had that meeting over there and then made all the decisions himself.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.640
It was a miracle incident.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.640
But he started to prepare the charges.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.640
Did the result of me hearing after the meeting?

18:18.640 --> 18:21.640
Do you expect anyone to announce the brand to believe that?

18:21.640 --> 18:25.640
Senator McCollum, I've been over and over and over on this subject with you.

18:25.640 --> 18:30.640
And my attention is that Mr. Adams received certain suggestions.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.640
They were not ordered.

18:32.640 --> 18:38.640
And I'm sure that nobody that attended those meetings will say that they were ordered.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.640
How many operated independentists?

18:41.640 --> 18:45.640
How many suggestions I missed are Sherman Adams and any did you ever ignore?

18:45.640 --> 18:47.640
What's that?

18:47.640 --> 18:50.640
Did you ever ignore any suggestions from Sherman Adams?

18:50.640 --> 18:52.640
I imagine I have.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.640
Did you name one?

18:54.640 --> 18:56.640
I think that's the only thing I can do.

18:56.640 --> 19:01.640
I deal with the issue at hand if he had other suggestions than other matters and ignore it to my judgment.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.640
It goes to the credibility of the witness.

19:03.640 --> 19:10.640
He says that after this conference with Adams says that the decisions were made.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.640
For some reason, other specifists says no decisions were made.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.640
There's nothing to do with the substance and act.

19:16.640 --> 19:21.640
In effect, though, the suggestions from the Justice Department were not considered in order.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.640
I think it has these credibility.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.640
I'd like to know of one thing in order.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.640
The suggestions from Adams is...

19:28.640 --> 19:30.640
Just forget it.

19:30.640 --> 19:35.640
If John Adams had decided that he did not want to build a senator McCollum,

19:35.640 --> 19:39.640
he would not have gone and nothing would have happened.

19:39.640 --> 19:44.640
Did you ever ignore a suggestion made by Mr. Sherman Adams?

19:44.640 --> 19:46.640
I thought I'd take a problem.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.640
Did you think of one?

19:47.640 --> 19:48.640
No.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.640
Can't think of it.

19:49.640 --> 19:50.640
Not.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.640
It wouldn't be a positive point.

19:52.640 --> 19:53.640
Bring it out.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.640
It's a dangerous case.

20:01.640 --> 20:06.640
Now, Mr. Secretary, are you familiar with the trial of your testimony?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.640
I might withdraw that and say this.

20:09.640 --> 20:14.640
You know that Mr. Adams thought with Mr. Joseph Alsofe,

20:14.640 --> 20:19.640
a columnist who was consistently written articles on favor of also spending a McCarthy

20:19.640 --> 20:21.640
and everybody else investigating communist.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.640
You know that Mr. Adam Schrodinger out of his files and it's not a joke, don't you?

20:25.640 --> 20:27.640
He told us about the other day.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.640
I know that he told Mr. Alsofe, talk to him about it, just what he's...

20:31.640 --> 20:32.640
Well, he's a bulletinist.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.640
I don't know exactly what transpired.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.640
I wasn't there.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.640
You know what? You're taking Mr. Adams' work, don't you, sir?

20:37.640 --> 20:38.640
I work.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.640
What?

20:39.640 --> 20:40.640
Well, Mr. Adams is dead.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.640
That he showed Mr. Alsofe, I believe, his entire portfolio in the math.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.640
Without a proper act?

20:45.640 --> 20:47.640
If he's such a program, he undoubtedly did.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.640
Was that a proper act, sir?

20:48.640 --> 20:49.640
Was it a proper act?

20:49.640 --> 20:58.640
Yes. To take Army Memoranda and Army files and hand them over to a newsman who is possible to

20:58.640 --> 21:02.640
a Army Memoranda about a congressional committee and turn them over to a newsman

21:02.640 --> 21:04.640
writing article possible throughout the committee.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.640
We got it. In your opinion, the Secretary of the Army is proper act.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.640
Well, first, first, I wouldn't do anything like that myself.

21:11.640 --> 21:12.640
You was not.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.640
That was expiring.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.640
All time was expiring.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.640
For the morning, we reached us until 2 p.m.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.640
You have job personnel.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.640
Where are your chiefs, underwaters?

21:34.640 --> 21:40.640
Chair will start by advising our guests that we're happy to have you here.

21:40.640 --> 21:44.640
As I get, attending the conduct of public business.

21:44.640 --> 21:49.640
The Chair feels he should advise you as he has advised your predecessors,

21:49.640 --> 21:56.640
who have listed the chambers, that you come here in conformity with a standing rule of this committee,

21:56.640 --> 22:02.640
which is that there ought to be no manifestations of approval or disapproval of any kind at any time

22:02.640 --> 22:05.640
on the part of any of the members of the audience.

22:05.640 --> 22:10.640
The officers and the trained clothesmen in the audience have standing instructions from the committee

22:10.640 --> 22:17.640
to immediately and politely remove from the room anybody at any time who violated those instructions,

22:17.640 --> 22:22.640
because you will then have cancelled the agreement by which you came here as our guest.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.640
The audience is a voneignificent.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.640
We trust they will continue to be so.

22:26.640 --> 22:31.640
The committee continues to appreciate the very splendid service rendered in that connection

22:31.640 --> 22:38.640
by the officers who are in control of the decorum in the rear of the room.

22:38.640 --> 22:44.640
I believe that F.D. Conclusion of the morning meetings,

22:44.640 --> 22:49.640
Senator McCarthy and Mr. Cohn had just concluded a ten-minute period.

22:49.640 --> 22:54.640
And with that conviction, I began by asking Council Jenkins whether he has any questions at this time.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.640
Chairman, I have no further questions.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.640
The Chair has none to any of my colleagues at my left have any questions at this time.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.640
Chairman, I have received a copy of the White House,

23:03.640 --> 23:07.640
specially for December 14, which probably should be included in the record.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.640
The Marshal has been appropriated.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.640
Give a number and include it in the record.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.640
Any questions?

23:12.640 --> 23:15.640
Well, questions at my left and any questions at my right?

23:15.640 --> 23:16.640
If you vote, any questions?

23:16.640 --> 23:17.640
No.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.640
Senator McCarthy, I'm Mr. Cohn.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.640
There's also a meeting with the record.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.640
I'd like to see it in person on the news.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.640
Copy of the White House release.

23:25.640 --> 23:29.640
If there is another copy of the Jackson, you can send it down to the table.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.640
I have one more copy.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.640
Mr. Mani will bring you a copy.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.640
Which one is it?

23:38.640 --> 23:39.640
No.

23:39.640 --> 23:40.640
That's the other release.

23:40.640 --> 23:44.640
I mean, he wants the one that Mr. Jackson has just applied for the record.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.640
Mr....

23:46.640 --> 23:49.640
When it comes to the wealth and the community is coming in,

23:49.640 --> 23:53.640
I wish he would pass it back to the table and we can pass it around with the committee members.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.640
And the other comes.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.640
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman?

23:57.640 --> 23:58.640
Yes, Mr. Vice.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.640
Mr. Chairman.

23:59.640 --> 24:00.640
Yes, Mr. Vice.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.640
Mr. Vice Chairman.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.640
I'd like to welcome you to the record press.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.640
I'd be definitely going to be going to the media.

24:06.640 --> 24:14.640
This is a response to the request that I made this morning of Mr. Welp,

24:14.640 --> 24:17.640
or whoever was produced.

24:17.640 --> 24:21.640
Final immediate release, dated December 14, 1953,

24:21.640 --> 24:24.640
C. Hager, the press secretary of the press, and the White House.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.640
During the press conference, the General Assembly of the United Nations,

24:28.640 --> 24:37.640
Ambassador Henry Cavillard in June here will serve here at the White House as special adviser to the President on the United Nations and other matters.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.640
Ambassador Lodge will have an office in the executive office of the President.

24:41.640 --> 24:49.640
He will, of course, continue his United Nations duty and will attend meetings of the security confl and any other sessions that might be held.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.640
Very good.

24:52.640 --> 24:57.640
Get your hands for you now, Mr. Cohn, and I'll send them a pass.

24:57.640 --> 25:03.640
Mr. Chairman, I have just a very few questions to ask.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.640
I frankly don't know until their answer, but they're not the...

25:06.640 --> 25:14.640
will be pertinent to the circumscribed areas we're covering today.

25:14.640 --> 25:20.640
For the Council of Chairman, may I say that I propose the announcement to Steven's about...

25:21.640 --> 25:28.640
the conversations he's had with certain sunkers in regard to putting out the charges.

25:28.640 --> 25:36.640
Until the answer comes, I won't know whether or not those conversations had to do with putting out the charges or whether they had to do something else.

25:36.640 --> 25:43.640
Specifically, I propose to ask you about the two conversations that you had with sunker signings.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.640
Now, lastly, I don't know any idea what it was discussed.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.640
I don't know whether anything's useful in the charges or not.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.640
I'm just like asking a few questions on that.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.640
Okay, I'm going to have a minute of order.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.640
I want to invite a vote.

25:57.640 --> 26:12.640
I would like to say that the reason that the questions, the conversations that I had with Secretary Steven are known is because I told this committee that I had had several conversations.

26:13.640 --> 26:19.640
The Secretary Steven, the adult from, as I remember, it's too busy with me.

26:19.640 --> 26:25.640
One, when he came to CME, but with General Richway, he seemed the staff of the Army.
