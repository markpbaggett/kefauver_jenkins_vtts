WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
And also a member of the Armed Services Committee,

00:03.500 --> 00:08.000
and the morale of the United States Army in this world today,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
as a matter of vitality.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
And also a member of the Armed Services Committee,

00:16.000 --> 00:20.500
and the morale of the United States Army in this world today,

00:20.500 --> 00:23.500
as a matter of vitality concerned to me,

00:23.500 --> 00:27.000
I thought it only proper that I should tell this committee,

00:27.500 --> 00:32.500
and also a member of the party that I had had these conversations

00:32.500 --> 00:36.000
with the Secretary of the Army.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.500
The chair is helpless to remark just made by his colleagues

00:39.500 --> 00:42.000
and come under the heading of a point of personal purpose,

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
rather than a point of order.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.500
I think it's your not-affecting the question.

00:46.500 --> 00:51.500
I will take any point that the chairman will let me take,

00:51.500 --> 00:54.500
which will get the facts on the table.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.000
Yes, I hope you will entitled to be heard

00:57.000 --> 00:59.500
under the final personal privilege your name has been mentioned,

00:59.500 --> 01:03.500
and I take it you are not lodging your protest against the asking of the question.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.000
Any questions which will bring out any truth,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
which will protect the distant mile procedures,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
and these issues,

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
is exactly what I have been trying to get,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
and hopefully we will get in these areas.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
From the car if you will proceed then,

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
and direct your questions to these conversations.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.000
We will provide to the point of issue,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.500
whether or not they had anything to do,

01:28.500 --> 01:30.500
with the investigation of the charges,

01:30.500 --> 01:34.000
which you are the thing that we should protect the great justice I just want.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.500
Mr. Chairman, it's a well-striped piece of the summative description

01:38.500 --> 01:42.500
of the conversation having to do with the drifter incident,

01:42.500 --> 01:47.500
clearly told them outside the spoke of the limited inquiry that were now engaged on.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.500
We can determine that I presume as the secretary of the proceed

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
with the answering to the questions that they have not yet announced.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I would like to go ahead and talk to them.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
I final mean, to want to infer that these conversations only had to do with General Twicker.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
These conversations had to do with Secretary Steven's opinions

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
to what was happening to the United States Army.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
As a member of the armed services committee, I was a grad,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.500
I was glad to receive any comments that he had,

02:18.500 --> 02:20.500
and I was glad to talk to him about it.

02:20.500 --> 02:25.000
I just didn't want the council for the secretary to think that in any way

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
these conversations were limited to General Twicker.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Thank you for that time, Mr. Chairman.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.500
Still remains true, I think, to the outside of the scope of inquiry

02:33.500 --> 02:37.000
about the first release of the Secretary of State last week.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
If I'm wrong, of course, we want to hear.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
At no time since it was decided to have these hearings,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.500
have I been in touch directly or indirectly

02:47.500 --> 02:52.000
in any way, shape or form with Secretary Steven

02:52.000 --> 02:58.500
over any other principle in these hearings except Senator McCarthy,

02:58.500 --> 03:03.500
and Mr. Cohn, and you and the others when they came before this committee

03:03.500 --> 03:06.500
in executive hearings or open hearings.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.500
Just to just send him a taxi proceed with his questions,

03:09.500 --> 03:12.500
and Mr. Roach was on the signing dinner or anybody else

03:12.500 --> 03:15.000
who had the table ready to the point of order,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and we'll discuss the particular point of order with its relationship

03:18.000 --> 03:19.500
to this specific question.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.500
Man, I've said before I ask the question.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.000
And if there's any objections from the part of any senator,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
who were I asking Mr. Steven's about conversation

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
we had with Sub-Sunders, I will do this.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.500
I think that I should not have this time with a conversation

03:39.500 --> 03:43.000
with the sub-Sunders in question objects by a gallery

03:43.000 --> 03:45.500
of under-affirmative and other objects.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.500
So...

03:48.500 --> 03:50.500
You wrote for a key to this question?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.500
Find out whether I have questions or not,

03:52.500 --> 03:53.500
what direction do I have?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.500
But Senator, a key to this question I would be addressing me.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.500
Yes, my pleasure, that is.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.000
If you or any senator have objects tomorrow

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
requesting the Secretary about some of the things

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
that he's had with you, I shall do this.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I think so, over it's important for me to ask him questions.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
That's all there not the conversation with you.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.500
Had anything to do with the issues of the charges.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.500
I'd like to get that simple answer from the Secretary.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.000
And I understood you did not object to this.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, D.V., in his might to you detail his senator,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.500
I would like to say that I, myself, ask the Secretary of the Army

04:32.500 --> 04:38.000
to give me the charges that it has made with respect to Mr. G. David's advice.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.500
Can I go on now as much as you can?

04:39.500 --> 04:42.500
Just a minute. You've pointed out that I want to tell you the fact.

04:42.500 --> 04:47.500
And on the telephone, I discussed that with it.

04:47.500 --> 04:54.500
And later, I received a letter from somebody in the Army.

04:54.500 --> 04:59.000
I do not believe it was the Secretary stating that in accordance

04:59.000 --> 05:01.500
with the request of Senator Potter,

05:01.500 --> 05:07.500
they were furnishing me the report with respect to Mr. G. David Chines.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.500
So I believe that covers that point.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.000
However, I want to bring out another point.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.500
And that is, if I had any conversations with the Secretary of the Army,

05:18.500 --> 05:26.500
they, for his testimony, those conversations would be monitored along with your words,

05:26.500 --> 05:29.500
your principles and the other members of this committee.

05:29.500 --> 05:35.000
And for some days, I have been trying to get those monitored conversations

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
before the public. That's the chips full of where they may.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.500
And therefore, it seems to me, a little incongruous,

05:42.500 --> 05:46.500
to be discussing one or two of the monitor conversations,

05:46.500 --> 05:50.500
and not all of them, all of them in the chronological order

05:50.500 --> 05:54.500
that you requested, they be in, in the beginning.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.500
So, there are no doubt for me.

05:57.500 --> 06:02.500
Mr. Duff left the mind of anyone else to be request to the monitor,

06:02.500 --> 06:07.000
so it's all happened before Republican members of this committee

06:07.000 --> 06:11.500
that have requested that their monitor conversations be made available

06:11.500 --> 06:15.500
to the Chief Council with the Jenkins,

06:15.500 --> 06:19.500
the cost and the roles, that's all enough they could be put in evidence,

06:19.500 --> 06:23.000
Mr. Walts, your someone with the questions of security,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.500
I understand that with the Jenkins of mid-arrangement,

06:25.500 --> 06:30.000
we've not over the monitor conversations with the Delta department,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.500
as far as what to be deleted.

06:32.500 --> 06:38.500
And what's in place with the, to reduce the interfering with any security regulations,

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000
I know all of the Senator from Missouri,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
from the signing to realize this.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
So, unless until he does the plain thing that the Republican senators have done,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.500
Mr. Jenkins, you not to miss those with just the department,

06:52.500 --> 06:55.500
you not even miss a security matter.

06:55.500 --> 07:01.500
And the entire process of getting one of her telephone calls into signing,

07:01.500 --> 07:09.500
I sincerely hope that any Democrat members who have had phone calls,

07:09.500 --> 07:12.500
both the Defense Department,

07:12.500 --> 07:17.500
length of time, type of request that we did,

07:17.500 --> 07:21.500
so Mr. Jenkins can have the phone call.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.500
In the meantime, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Chairman,

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
Mr. Chairman, you plan to vote it?

07:28.500 --> 07:31.500
I have a point of whatever you would like to have at these.

07:31.500 --> 07:36.500
I would like to make some comments with respect to those comments.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.500
Chair, believe we should proceed with the question well then.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.500
The comments are on the table, we're not going to make one.

07:42.500 --> 07:47.500
Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of personal privilege.

07:47.500 --> 07:55.500
So, Mr. Chairman, when we first signed a paper,

07:55.500 --> 07:59.500
according to Senator Potter, and according to him,

07:59.500 --> 08:02.500
who told me, according to my understanding,

08:02.500 --> 08:09.500
we were signing a paper which took these calls into the public record we thought.

08:09.500 --> 08:14.500
It developed that what we signed simply gave the right

08:14.500 --> 08:19.500
to the Jenkins and his councils, Senator McCarthy and his councils,

08:19.500 --> 08:25.500
and the Army, Senator Secretary Stevens and his councils to look at the call.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.500
I understand at all three have looked at some of the calls.

08:29.500 --> 08:38.500
Now, there was a general feeling around that because they had signed that paper

08:38.500 --> 08:43.500
to the public expenditures which did not in any way prophesied,

08:43.500 --> 08:47.500
predict or stipulate that the calls would be made public.

08:47.500 --> 08:51.500
Nevertheless, there was a general feeling that because they had signed it,

08:51.500 --> 08:55.500
the calls would be made public, and because they hadn't signed it,

08:55.500 --> 08:58.500
the calls wouldn't be made public.

08:58.500 --> 09:03.500
Now, I do not want to discuss what happened in executive sessions with respect

09:04.500 --> 09:08.500
to the telephone conversations unless it becomes necessary.

09:08.500 --> 09:14.500
Therefore, I say first, I am very glad now to have Senator McCarthy

09:14.500 --> 09:19.500
ask any question of any kind that he would like to ask

09:19.500 --> 09:24.500
of the Secretary of the Army with respect to any discussions of any kind

09:24.500 --> 09:29.500
that I've ever had with him at any time in the last 50s been on the job.

09:30.500 --> 09:36.500
I have had no discussions with him of any kind since it was decided to hold his hearing

09:36.500 --> 09:41.500
when I want to remind the chair and April Council that we are now going in

09:41.500 --> 09:45.500
to the discussion of monitor telephone conversations in unilaterally,

09:45.500 --> 09:49.500
despite the fact that the only people to the best of my knowledge

09:49.500 --> 09:53.500
who's dying anything with respect to publishing those telephone calls

09:53.500 --> 09:57.500
are the senators on the Democratic side of this committee.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.500
That's the direct direct at that point, the chair would like to say.

10:02.500 --> 10:06.500
He has written a letter to Council Wilk,

10:06.500 --> 10:11.500
a special delivery to him at his office,

10:11.500 --> 10:14.500
in closing the statements signed by the Democrats,

10:14.500 --> 10:19.500
and calling a text into the statements which we signed as his suggestion by the Republicans.

10:19.500 --> 10:24.500
And instead, Mr. Wilk, we hope that you can interpret this to be adequate

10:24.500 --> 10:30.500
to deliver these monitored telephone calls and response to us to be neat to Council thinks.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.500
Mr. Wilk told me this morning he had been in Boston,

10:33.500 --> 10:37.500
while he arrived last night, he did not go to his office until this morning.

10:37.500 --> 10:43.500
He has not had a time to read my letter and to make a reply to it.

10:43.500 --> 10:48.500
Just as soon as he does, the chair will act in conformity with that letter.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.500
If he says as I hope he can, this is enough,

10:51.500 --> 10:54.500
we can deliver them to Council Jenkins, so be it.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.500
If he doesn't say that, the chair hopes he will be in writing,

10:58.500 --> 11:02.500
so what have it in the record, say exactly what he does want to have that.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.500
I'm Mr. McCrack.

11:05.500 --> 11:09.500
Just before I ask the press to Mr. Secretary,

11:09.500 --> 11:12.500
could I have this cleared up in the work of I understand that

11:12.500 --> 11:18.500
Council Jenkins already has all of the monitored telephone calls of any Republican members,

11:19.500 --> 11:24.500
Mr. Coling, Mr. Carb, Mr. Nunn, with the Democratic members,

11:24.500 --> 11:29.500
Mr. Wittler, I don't think that's correct, but you can ask the Council.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.500
I think that's an error.

11:31.500 --> 11:35.500
So that's right, Mr. Wittler.

11:35.500 --> 11:45.500
Mr. Chairman, we have only the monitored telephone calls between the Army and the McCarthy staff.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
Those are been examined by Mr. Wittler,

11:49.500 --> 11:53.500
which is passed by the Committee staff and by the committee.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.500
And also the conversation with the committee.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.500
So, the government is very correct.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.500
I think you only got that said enough.

12:01.500 --> 12:06.500
The monitoring team is not doing it for the committee.

12:06.500 --> 12:12.500
You may say that it's the California committee.

12:13.500 --> 12:18.500
Those monitor telephone calls that you have in your discussion

12:18.500 --> 12:23.500
are now available for the inspection of other members of this committee.

12:23.500 --> 12:29.500
Under the orders of two analysts, under the conservative agreement,

12:29.500 --> 12:33.500
Mr. Chairman, I'm trained in Senator McCrack.

12:33.500 --> 12:41.500
We have specific concerns on the part of Mr. Wittler and on the part of the Army.

12:42.500 --> 12:52.500
To disclose those monitors and records to myself, to Senator McCrack's committee,

12:52.500 --> 12:59.500
and to Chancellor Farley Army, that is the limit of the permission given us

12:59.500 --> 13:05.500
by the Army and by the McCarthy staff.

13:06.500 --> 13:10.500
There was no consent given to those monitored records.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.500
What we've shown to the committee is the whole.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.500
I want to make it perfectly clear Senator McCrack,

13:15.500 --> 13:18.500
that as far as I am perfectly, personally concerned,

13:18.500 --> 13:26.500
I would be happy for each member of this committee to see those calls and those records.

13:26.500 --> 13:32.500
But to say, I have only this consent to see those myself

13:32.500 --> 13:35.500
in the presence of Mr. Colman and Mr. Wittler.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.500
Is that right, Mr. Wittler, as you understand me?

13:38.500 --> 13:42.500
Well, I don't know as a moment what the typewriter says, Mr. Jenkins.

13:42.500 --> 13:46.500
I'm sure that you know and that every member of this committee knows

13:46.500 --> 13:53.500
that it is the desire of the Army and the Mr. Adams to have every monitor telephone call

13:53.500 --> 13:56.500
between the Secretary's office.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.500
The Senator McCrack is staffed,

13:59.500 --> 14:03.500
and if you gentlemen, waste a call between the office and you senators,

14:03.500 --> 14:06.500
admit it in evidence in this hearing,

14:06.500 --> 14:11.500
and we will find any sensible piece of paper that accomplishes that result.

14:11.500 --> 14:16.500
I am under the impression we have already found such a paper,

14:16.500 --> 14:21.500
but in any event we stated repeatedly in this room that that is the result we desire.

14:21.500 --> 14:26.500
Mr. Wittler, I don't believe you answer my question.

14:26.500 --> 14:31.500
You state that it is your desire to chose to put in the record.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.500
How we understand that perfectly,

14:33.500 --> 14:36.500
but I am asked to Senator McCrack,

14:36.500 --> 14:39.500
why the members of the committee,

14:39.500 --> 14:45.500
these seven members have not seen those monitors calls and the record office.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.500
My answer to him was,

14:47.500 --> 14:53.500
that I had your consent in the consent of the McCarthy side of this controversy.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.500
For me as General Counsel for the committee,

14:56.500 --> 14:58.500
for you representing the Army,

14:58.500 --> 15:02.500
and for Mr. Cohn representing Senator McCrack is a seat of those calls,

15:02.500 --> 15:08.500
and that there was no sense that they'd be shown that the members of the committee is that correct.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.500
I will let Mr. St. Claire answer that,

15:11.500 --> 15:16.500
he's got the government that they have to see if the members are incorrect and you answer the questions.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.500
I hope that I...

15:19.500 --> 15:22.500
I'm going to hear his number.

15:22.500 --> 15:26.500
My memory is that the tankers that we produced those calls,

15:26.500 --> 15:34.500
the question arose as to whether or not the adverse party would be willing that they go in evidence before they had a chance to look at them,

15:34.500 --> 15:39.500
and the answer that I recall was that they would not be willing.

15:39.500 --> 15:44.500
We then agreed that at least we should agree that you could see them.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.500
It was no effort on the part of the Army to limit their distribution.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.500
If there was any such effort, it came from the other side of the table.

15:52.500 --> 15:59.500
There was no agreement on the part of the Army that they carried out the members of this committee to see them.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.500
We're perfectly having an hour and a word there.

16:02.500 --> 16:06.500
In that case, you're willing to do it now, and what is that?

16:06.500 --> 16:09.500
And you were there, and what did you say, go there? Absolutely.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.500
And you will recall the other side of the table through the morning.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.500
Very well.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.500
Very well. Now, Senator McCrack says that, thanks for your questions.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.500
I do not have the permission according to Mr. St. Pag.

16:20.500 --> 16:25.500
I'll just be calling and send them a card to the show you those monitors are available now.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.500
But I repeat that personally, I was not today.

16:28.500 --> 16:37.500
I cannot wait to face with an agreement that I have made with what I want to ask with what another question now.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.500
All of the other monitor telephone calls,

16:40.500 --> 16:44.500
was members of what's committed to the show,

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
were the parties who were started with it?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.500
I have not seen them. They have not out.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.500
They have not been delivered.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.500
Now, as we can say, well, all the time,

16:52.500 --> 16:57.500
Mr. Welfke has time to answer the other I can see him last week,

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
because he was in love.

16:59.500 --> 17:03.500
I'm sure that by tomorrow morning, Mr. Welfke will have a reply to that letter.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.500
I'm perfectly willing to say this to Sarah when I have a full meeting.

17:07.500 --> 17:11.500
I have a lot of details about the message you sent to me this morning.

17:11.500 --> 17:15.500
And it does not give this committee the right to see any of them.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.500
For that reason, when I did not agree to it,

17:17.500 --> 17:21.500
I'm willing to be committed to have all of them and for every one of them,

17:21.500 --> 17:26.500
irrespective of who they are to go in the right to not find the message about effect this morning.

17:26.500 --> 17:33.500
Mr. Sharon, I would like to share it to myself to say that when Senator St. Pagnes introduced the paper this morning,

17:33.500 --> 17:36.500
I thought it unlocked all doors.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.500
But I spoke to Councillor Favreau, the minority member,

17:39.500 --> 17:45.500
before we started after lunch, and pointed out to him that I thought the phasing of it was not quite happy

17:45.500 --> 17:50.500
to receive the message to resolve that this table would like to be achieved.

17:50.500 --> 17:54.500
Sharon would like to say very much that I would just continue waiting for the conversation,

17:54.500 --> 17:56.500
which is very time consuming.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.500
Mr. Welfke, I'm sure that I wrote you last week,

17:59.500 --> 18:03.500
but he assured me, he would answer the morning as per season's request.

18:03.500 --> 18:08.500
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, before we just look at this telephone call,

18:08.500 --> 18:13.500
now we've treated this as a mayor's project.

18:13.500 --> 18:18.500
It seems to me that every one of these is individual in charge of it.

18:18.500 --> 18:24.500
And Mr. Welfke, if you get us some good Boston language that will follow the junior senator's

18:24.500 --> 18:29.500
ability to divide and bequeath all the calls that I may have made,

18:29.500 --> 18:33.500
get them out of the table you can put them in the record right now.

18:33.500 --> 18:38.500
Now I see no virtue in signing a mass document with everybody's name on it.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.500
You are free to release any telephone call that I have made,

18:42.500 --> 18:46.500
and your free to read in this room is the farest I'm concerned.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.500
And if everybody else wants to do likewise, that's all I can say.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.500
And if nobody wants to do it, it's too all right with me.

18:54.500 --> 18:59.500
So you can bring them on and put them in the record because as a general conversation,

18:59.500 --> 19:02.500
telephone calls are not very revealing enough.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.500
I don't think there's much paper.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.500
And if there are any questions please.

19:08.500 --> 19:12.500
I'll see what we're talking about now.

19:12.500 --> 19:17.500
Anything but telephone calls.

19:17.500 --> 19:24.500
Mr. Stavins, I understand you had several telephone conversations with Mr. Stavings

19:24.500 --> 19:29.500
and before these charges were made public.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.500
Is that correct or given to the senator?

19:32.500 --> 19:37.500
Yes, I talk with Senator Stavings, but not a number of subjects.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
Mr. Stavings.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
Senator Stavings.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
You're playing a word?

19:41.500 --> 19:46.500
I have a point of something.

19:46.500 --> 19:59.500
I want to point out to the chair and to Edmund and Council that now disliked the fact that some of us have signed a general lease of all mon of the telephone calls

19:59.500 --> 20:02.500
without a lot of legal double talk around them.

20:02.500 --> 20:15.500
And some happen that the chair is now permitting senator from Wisconsin to interrogate the witness with respect to some of the telephone calls and not all of them.

20:16.500 --> 20:33.500
If the chair and the council think that proper, it's all right with me because I certainly have never said anything with respect to the army, to the secretary of the army that I won't stand behind.

20:34.500 --> 20:44.500
Now, desire to make this statement to a reference to the statement just made by the senator from Missouri.

20:44.500 --> 20:57.500
The senator from Missouri is under the impression that the calls to his conversation with the secretary of the army was public that monitors all his conversations with the board monitors.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.500
The secretary should not be, you know, be quick in the mouth, then.

21:01.500 --> 21:13.500
That is the point that, besides the point, the very fact that they were monitors does not preclude the secretary of the army from testifying the reference to those conversations.

21:13.500 --> 21:23.500
The man who did the monitoring should not come into court and testify before this committee without, of course, the consent of senator signings.

21:23.500 --> 21:47.500
The fact that they are monitors does not in any way, as the secretary is from the voting, the content of those conversations with the committee, that they are relevant to the person's issue and that is whether or not senator signings and made any suggestions or had any influence with the secretary in the preparation to release the means of service.

21:48.500 --> 22:07.500
The inquiry being contained with the government, Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that the best evidence of what is going to be asked of the memory of the secretary of the army will be in the monitor's conversations themselves.

22:07.500 --> 22:18.500
I also don't like to say that at no time and no way did I ever suggest that any charge is where to be made against anybody.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.500
Mr. Secretary.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.500
I'm in the department.

22:21.500 --> 22:32.500
If you have been questioned, of course, in detail, if there is any conversation you might have had with me, I'm now questioning you about some conversations with some resigning them.

22:32.500 --> 22:40.500
I can put it up completely proper. I don't think that one senator has any special problems in other senator's about now.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.500
The person is this.

22:42.500 --> 22:55.500
No more ones did you have conversations with some resigning them prior to the issuance of the charges against phone car and repair.

22:55.500 --> 23:00.500
I've been talking to the senator signings for many times. I've tried to take office.

23:00.500 --> 23:04.500
And that's what's prior to the issuance of the charges.

23:04.500 --> 23:17.500
How many of those conversations do you have to do with the charges against Mr. Cone's or car against me?

23:17.500 --> 23:20.500
I personally recall it coming up only one time.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.500
I want to be telephone conversation.

23:25.500 --> 23:30.500
The telephone conversation that I remember were on a slightly different subject.

23:30.500 --> 23:35.500
In other words, you had no telephone conversation with some resigning them.

23:35.500 --> 23:41.500
So had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Cone, I can't say that senator.

23:41.500 --> 23:46.500
I just don't remember right at the moment. Could have been mentioned.

23:47.500 --> 23:57.500
Would you have any ideas for how many times in telephone conversations you could have mentioned Mr. Cone's and the charges against Mr. Cone's?

23:57.500 --> 24:02.500
I referred the times before the charges were made public.

24:02.500 --> 24:06.500
Well, I would think it would be very, very limited.

24:06.500 --> 24:11.500
I don't want to pin you down if your memory is bad. Would you say one time, two times, five times?

24:11.500 --> 24:14.500
I'm sure it wasn't five times.

24:14.500 --> 24:19.500
I don't remember any of it on the telephone, but it could have been mentioned.

24:19.500 --> 24:29.500
Now, when you came up to see Mr. Cone's and did you discuss the last time the charges against Mr. Cone or just me?

24:29.500 --> 24:32.500
I think I'm one occasion that was mentioned.

24:32.500 --> 24:37.500
I came up to see senator Cone's and then in regard to the general's work or case.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.500
When you discuss the...

24:39.500 --> 24:44.500
My recollection is that before I left the office, the subject of Cone and Cone came up.

24:44.500 --> 24:48.500
Was Mr. Cone's and only a million that famous?

24:50.500 --> 24:53.500
Well, that was on...

24:53.500 --> 24:58.500
My memory is correct, but then I'm about the 19th of February.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.500
So, that was...

25:00.500 --> 25:03.500
He was on the committee, wasn't he at that point?

25:03.500 --> 25:06.500
I'm in the comments, I was in charge of the...

25:06.500 --> 25:09.500
I'm in charge of the committee on the 26th of January.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.500
So, you're out of your mind?

25:11.500 --> 25:17.500
And did you discuss with Mr. Cone and the President of the other night you were going to make public charges against your own?

25:17.500 --> 25:20.500
I don't recall having to step back.

25:20.500 --> 25:30.500
In other words, you don't recall ever having to discuss with Mr. Cone and the President of the other night you'll make public decisions.

25:30.500 --> 25:38.500
I don't recall that. I certainly know that the Senator Cone and the President had nothing to do whatever with what finally transpired.

25:38.500 --> 25:42.500
I wouldn't even remotely excuse him if he hadn't used it.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
Did you tell him that I was in charge of the committee?

25:44.500 --> 25:46.500
No, I don't think so.

25:46.500 --> 25:50.500
Did you tell any of the charges of the committee that were being prepared?

25:50.500 --> 25:52.500
I don't think so.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.500
Do you know...

25:54.500 --> 25:56.500
Do I know?

25:56.500 --> 26:01.500
I'd say, and I remembered one case I'm talking with Senator Simon, it doesn't matter.

26:01.500 --> 26:05.500
Cone and Sean, I don't remember anything about any charges.

26:05.500 --> 26:18.500
Mr. Chairman, this morning, I call the Secretary of the Attention of the Facts that his talk to money under oath on two different occasions was directly opposite.

26:18.500 --> 26:27.500
I pointed out that unless he had a bad memory, this would mean that Treasury was convicted.

26:27.500 --> 26:32.500
That Treasury in one case or the other, he resented that very much.

26:32.500 --> 26:41.500
Now, if the death was improper and it was untrue, of course it would be improper, but true it's not improper for us to be in touch with the testimony.

26:41.500 --> 26:48.500
All the Secretary is on the stand and see if he agrees with me that it's completely contradictory.

26:48.500 --> 26:53.500
But one time, either was in error, and I assume that's what it is.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.500
I assume he was in error, I conceded memories in great bad.

26:56.500 --> 27:01.500
Mr. Chairman, or that there was a Treasury, it helped me one of the others.

27:01.500 --> 27:07.500
I shall now read the testimony and ask the Secretary to carry the comment on it.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.500
I have a point of order, the record is the record.

27:11.500 --> 27:18.500
If this distinguished witness has committed surgery, the record goes to the department.

27:18.500 --> 27:29.500
You know, just to the Attorney General's office for a corporate action, there is no point in contrasting what it says on one page now, what it says on another, that's to the Attorney General.

27:29.500 --> 27:39.500
The Chair is unable to anticipate the question about to be asked by the Secretary of the Attorney General's Council and will have to wait until the question is asked before he can do on the point of order.

27:39.500 --> 27:43.500
I'm going to ask the Secretary when to read to your testimony.

27:43.500 --> 27:56.500
From page 14 and in 1949, on page 6, 1964, the Secretary of the Attorney General's Office, did you order them for that?

27:56.500 --> 28:04.500
We're referring to charges against other times. Answered? No, sir. I did not order them for that.

28:04.500 --> 28:20.500
Then, May 24, 1954, page 32, 14, Secretary Steven, the responsibility for these charges being put out is mine complete plate. From the Secretary.

28:20.500 --> 28:30.500
You just told me you ordered them put out for Secretary. Now, did you or did you not? Secretary Steven, just the idea.

28:30.500 --> 28:38.500
The Secretary, when did you order them put out? Are you 50 corrects? Secretary Steven, Mr. Welles, when was the last time you said 50 corrects?

28:38.500 --> 28:48.500
Good, you can have a big deal back and get out of the office. I paid Mr. Welles, was it just 32? No, it's not.

28:48.500 --> 28:58.500
The Secretary, page 32, 14. Let me get the complete transcript. The time out of the work.

28:58.500 --> 29:06.500
The wireless time is out. Let's return to our studios across the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.500
This is ABC Television Network.

29:09.500 --> 29:21.500
The Miami was national headquarters for the month until the police drove out the beehive.

29:21.500 --> 29:29.500
Smash the horseroom. Fire back at the murder man and chop the big shots into the sea.

29:29.500 --> 29:37.500
See the Miami story in out the paramount theater times where?

29:37.500 --> 29:45.500
All they heard me drove back to you. The heavyweight man of that embossing from Eastern Parkway to the night of camp. Now, I'll just look at all his seven.

29:45.500 --> 30:00.500
Secretary Steven, yes sir I did. The question, when did you order them put out? Secretary Steven, well we put them out. We sent them up to the committee here. I think it was on the 10th of March.

30:00.500 --> 30:08.500
I want to say to Mr. Welles, so when he said I skipped the question, he is an error. If I skipped the question, having read it to me.

30:08.500 --> 30:13.500
The last one, Senator, that I thought you skipped, I may have been an error sir.

30:13.500 --> 30:18.500
Well, there's now a meeting just that there's no skipping of questions and let's proceed.

30:18.500 --> 30:23.500
Will the reporter read back my original question? I don't like to be accused of skipping your question.

30:23.500 --> 30:33.500
Mr. Welles, we track should I understand the obligation to skip the question? Am I right Mr. Welles? I do. I don't know whether you did or not. I was under the impression that I would not wish to do you at all.

30:33.500 --> 30:37.500
Thank you very much. Well, the record stands no question was skipped. Christy, please.

30:37.500 --> 30:44.500
Last month was this morning, later this morning, and said 34. 34.

30:44.500 --> 30:47.500
Did you got that transcript of the phone? Were they 32 to 34?

30:47.500 --> 31:03.500
Mr. Welles, are you getting a little? I'm sure of it. Mr. Welles, I'm sure of that sir and I'm very sorry if this has taken so long.

31:03.500 --> 31:15.500
The question is, who did give the order? You were deaf when I was here the last time Mr. Welles, I went to a place where you were going to ask questions.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.500
I heard them put out. That was a question by Senator McCarty.

31:19.500 --> 31:25.500
Then I heard that the answer was 38. And the morning, the officer, I just know I was going to put out first and then Mr. Corm.

31:25.500 --> 31:28.500
And I'll explain that at least 25 times.

31:28.500 --> 31:36.500
It is not of the money, 6. And Mr. Corm, Mr. Steven says now, for 50 to 50, the testimony of May 6.

31:36.500 --> 31:43.500
Mr. Steven says no further than put out. Because the morning, when he says yes sir, I heard.

31:43.500 --> 31:52.500
We did not put the money. One hour later, I can see. I must throw up my hand and see nothing to be gained.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.500
Curious.

31:54.500 --> 31:57.500
Mr. Chair, I understand you've included your committee in the council.

31:57.500 --> 32:04.500
Your dismiss. Mr. Steven, the thing that you were applying to about the public report.

32:04.500 --> 32:08.500
If you will do that, it's possible that we can dismiss you from.

32:08.500 --> 32:14.500
Mr. Chairman, when we call Mr. Steve Corm.

32:14.500 --> 32:21.500
You were dismissed because of the spending. I was not on the point.

32:21.500 --> 32:26.500
So you continue to testify and go to the council.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.500
I'm going to make up.

32:28.500 --> 32:38.500
That's the question that the adam, that the conclusion of your testimony, they are asked you specifically.

32:38.500 --> 32:47.500
The responsibility shifted from the actions regarding this controversy.
