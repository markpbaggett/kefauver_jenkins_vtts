WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
I don't want to get too as strong as I want it to be difficult.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
The phone calls are other than to the commanding general.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
If you'll just consult your charge, I think we will contain the commanding general of the

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
service staff.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Yes.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Or other individuals having nothing to do with force.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Phone calls and with what's up we refer you for example to January 16th.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm a reporter at January 9th.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
I say the call you referring to.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It's called from Card to Adam.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
That was also put on, yes.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
So as far as the average trainee, it doesn't do any monitoring of his phone calls.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
You don't have any phone calls in mind.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
All right.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
These are not calls from the trainees.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
They're called into the trainees.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
To the trainees.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
They just call to the...

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't think there are any calls that was in the out here coming too far to shine.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
So I don't think there would be any need to indicate to call to a typical trainee.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
You mean the private train?

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Is the only prep at Fort Victor, about whom phone calls have been made?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
About whom phone calls have been made to the commanding general?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Oh no.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
No sir, I don't.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I mean, do you think there is any?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I don't know that.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
If I...

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
When it was just got a default of my phone from extras here, I just put the phone sort of hit her myth.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
For the phone calls of the contacts, we just say that the number of extra was gone on.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
This was represented fairly.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
The phone calls will be charged in training at the time.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Now sir, I don't know what the extra would represent.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Uh...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Little...

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
You don't know how many phone calls there was training with you.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Now how did I down?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And this is left completely...

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Quickly ask this.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Reflecting job on Cardiff is left completely blank.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
It's the farthest any phone calls to the average training is concerned.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
But the left out in detail, the phone calls of private trains had now...

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
But the other stuff was there some rule, or there's some regulations,

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
that some would decide, or some kind.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
That there would be a monitoring, or the checking of the phone calls of this one private, and no other private.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Most of it, I won't believe it was in your gut.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Well do you have record panels of the phone calls of all the other private, the other four tickets?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
No, sir, I don't believe we did.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
And only after the session, if I may, I'm going to have to send him a phone,

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
before our two December 19 units, there should have beenotti'llifandoon,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.500
October 14th, until December 19th,

03:29.500 --> 03:30.320
November 14th,

03:30.320 --> 03:31.840
for mr. Thomas.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.840
And reported in New York,

03:34.840 --> 03:36.840
what fans fired, reported,

03:36.840 --> 03:39.840
a frame during subsequent counter.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.840
Now any other, any other graph page,

03:45.840 --> 03:48.840
who's drafted also after reporting their New York,

03:48.840 --> 03:50.840
San Francisco,

03:50.840 --> 03:52.840
you're working with San Francisco's cargo,

03:52.840 --> 03:54.840
over half of the B-4,

03:54.840 --> 03:56.840
times part of the six-travels of B,

03:56.840 --> 03:59.840
so that's a black mark against change.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.840
And I believe the fact that he reported forotti

04:02.840 --> 04:04.840
is to black this up,

04:04.840 --> 04:05.840
and this circle in the north,

04:05.840 --> 04:07.840
seems more serious.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.840
So, anyways, now so I don't think so.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.840
I think that, on the third, when Shine came in,

04:14.840 --> 04:16.840
he was inducted,

04:16.840 --> 04:19.840
and he immediately loved the induction station.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.840
On the tenth, when the residents of his men

04:21.840 --> 04:22.840
were inducted the same day,

04:22.840 --> 04:25.840
he was getting up to 545 for revelry,

04:25.840 --> 04:28.840
he didn't report into the induction station

04:28.840 --> 04:30.840
and New York until 1145.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.840
No, turn, you know all this.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.840
That's a time to expire.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.840
Before the next round of festivities, again,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.840
let's return to our studios across the country

04:37.840 --> 04:38.840
to permit our sales.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.840
Let's identify themself.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.840
This is ABC Television Network.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.840
Go to Grand Union for best meat values.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.840
US Choice and Packers Top Lam,

04:49.840 --> 04:52.840
so in stake, only 69 cents a pound.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.840
What a house, just 79 cents a pound.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.840
That's correct.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.840
These are calls, as I understand them,

04:57.840 --> 04:59.840
that you've listed here.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.840
These are calls by someone

05:01.840 --> 05:04.840
who, to the commanding general,

05:04.840 --> 05:06.840
are members of this staff,

05:06.840 --> 05:08.840
with respect,

05:08.840 --> 05:10.840
with the part by the shine.

05:10.840 --> 05:11.840
Is that correct?

05:11.840 --> 05:12.840
Yes.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
That's all.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.840
Do you understand this, Amanda?

05:15.840 --> 05:16.840
Thank you.

05:16.840 --> 05:17.840
Thank you.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.840
Now, I'm like, well, I understand this is okay.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.840
We were talking a lot about charts,

05:21.840 --> 05:23.840
and the fire out here,

05:23.840 --> 05:25.840
and the fire out here,

05:25.840 --> 05:27.840
is not going to work,

05:27.840 --> 05:29.840
and you can call it fire.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.840
Fire out here,

05:31.840 --> 05:33.840
and you have a lot to do with the

05:33.840 --> 05:35.840
part of each area.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.840
For human beings,

05:37.840 --> 05:39.840
you have a lot of possession of these materials,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.840
and the most weight chart that we have.

05:41.840 --> 05:42.840
That's correct.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.840
Here, we do.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.840
So you call it for a part,

05:46.840 --> 05:48.840
not many individual classes,

05:48.840 --> 05:50.840
the typical training,

05:50.840 --> 05:52.840
with received training,

05:52.840 --> 05:54.840
for each of the Chinese,

05:54.840 --> 05:56.840
for all the years,

05:56.840 --> 05:58.840
23, and then how many,

05:58.840 --> 06:01.840
specific individual classes,

06:01.840 --> 06:03.840
the fire out here,

06:03.840 --> 06:05.840
and the time for the time.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.840
And then, let's see if we can get some

06:07.840 --> 06:09.840
virtual information on the record,

06:09.840 --> 06:11.840
instead of talking about,

06:11.840 --> 06:14.840
frankly, about charts.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.840
The typical training,

06:16.840 --> 06:18.840
would have had three classes

06:18.840 --> 06:20.840
during the eight weeks of training,

06:20.840 --> 06:24.840
as indicated on what is called chart two.

06:24.840 --> 06:28.840
Now, may I ask the second half of the question again,

06:28.840 --> 06:30.840
so call on any specific

06:30.840 --> 06:32.840
individual classes,

06:32.840 --> 06:34.840
on account of the places

06:34.840 --> 06:38.840
that the pilot's trying to receive during the training third?

06:38.840 --> 06:40.840
Let me hear a total of the answers.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.840
How do you answer?

06:47.840 --> 06:48.840
Yes, Minister.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.840
I think Chair knows the thing is,

06:50.840 --> 06:52.840
you know, right?

06:52.840 --> 06:56.840
It's 16, and three or four.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.840
That is the record,

07:02.840 --> 07:04.840
not just finding what the chart

07:04.840 --> 07:05.840
may show,

07:05.840 --> 07:07.840
just the lectures,

07:07.840 --> 07:08.840
as to the lesson.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.840
Chair, I want to ask the table this morning.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.840
Secretary.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.840
Mr. Chairman, just to clarify,

07:15.840 --> 07:17.840
this telephone call matter on the chart,

07:17.840 --> 07:23.840
may I just read it from page three, four, nine, three?

07:23.840 --> 07:27.840
Are you hearing this morning, my questions to General Ryan,

07:27.840 --> 07:29.840
which are very brief.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.840
Under Jackson, how many calls do you get

07:31.840 --> 07:33.840
for the average pilot to use?

07:33.840 --> 07:34.840
General Ryan,

07:34.840 --> 07:36.840
I don't get any.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.840
This is the only case that I have ever had a request

07:39.840 --> 07:40.840
to relay a call.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.840
Some of the Jackson,

07:41.840 --> 07:42.840
as far as these phone calls

07:42.840 --> 07:44.840
are a charter concern,

07:44.840 --> 07:45.840
they relate specifically

07:45.840 --> 07:47.840
to the unusual nature of the call

07:47.840 --> 07:49.840
to you or to your aid.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.840
It's General Ryan,

07:50.840 --> 07:51.840
yes, sir, from the Jacks,

07:51.840 --> 07:52.840
no matter what.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.840
Is that all, Secretary?

07:55.840 --> 07:56.840
Any time in the evening,

07:56.840 --> 07:57.840
you take another question.

07:57.840 --> 07:58.840
I want to question.

07:58.840 --> 07:59.840
General Murray,

07:59.840 --> 08:02.840
somebody mentioned taking a rap.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.840
Are you taking a rap for anybody here?

08:04.840 --> 08:06.840
I don't believe so, sir.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.840
Are you taking full responsibility for each chart?

08:09.840 --> 08:12.840
I take responsibility for my part in it, yes sir,

08:12.840 --> 08:14.840
as far as it can be.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.840
I have told the story the way it happens.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.840
No further questions.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.840
If you're else,

08:20.840 --> 08:21.840
make it in court,

08:21.840 --> 08:24.840
I'm going to make our statement to come.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.840
And,

08:27.840 --> 08:28.840
Colonel,

08:28.840 --> 08:30.840
and I,

08:30.840 --> 08:32.840
I'm very much sure,

08:32.840 --> 08:34.840
this life's a job of fussing

08:34.840 --> 08:35.840
and so much to say,

08:35.840 --> 08:38.840
I think I think that you are,

08:38.840 --> 08:40.840
being a good officer

08:40.840 --> 08:42.840
obeying someone's orders.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.840
I don't think that you're responsible for any of these.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.840
I don't think you're responsible for these 40 charts.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.840
You made the statement that

08:51.840 --> 08:54.840
all pilots accept shame,

08:54.840 --> 08:56.840
were typical pilots.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.840
That's all we can do.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.840
Soon, you do only on typical pilots.

09:02.840 --> 09:06.840
I have a new story here in regard to

09:06.840 --> 09:09.840
baseball players.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.840
And again, I like that game very much.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.840
I will put the name of the individual,

09:16.840 --> 09:17.840
perhaps you're recognizing,

09:17.840 --> 09:21.840
it's from Fort Dick.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.840
The one page

09:24.840 --> 09:27.840
card pop will be heard first.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.840
This picture is still in the table,

09:29.840 --> 09:31.840
so it's fine to put Dick

09:31.840 --> 09:33.840
and classified as a light vehicle driver,

09:33.840 --> 09:35.840
and you told him,

09:35.840 --> 09:37.840
and let's get it said.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.840
The reporter here,

09:38.840 --> 09:40.840
been a rare friend of Judy at noon,

09:40.840 --> 09:42.840
an excuse from Katie

09:42.840 --> 09:45.840
and guard duty to play on a post-baseball team.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.840
I've got nothing against baseball,

09:47.840 --> 09:50.840
but I've been coming out from

09:50.840 --> 09:52.840
the justice and force.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.840
I'm sure we just have an important to you.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.840
It's certainly up to me.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.840
So when you said that,

09:58.840 --> 10:00.840
if you're just a number of columns,

10:00.840 --> 10:01.840
fast and some of the fussing,

10:01.840 --> 10:04.840
that's all typical exceptions.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.840
You certainly wasn't considered the best ball player

10:08.840 --> 10:10.840
to release a duty at noon.

10:10.840 --> 10:14.840
We need to roll a key duty of typical widget.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.840
So may I add a little to what I said on that?

10:17.840 --> 10:19.840
I think I tried to convey the impression

10:19.840 --> 10:21.840
that I couldn't state for a fact

10:21.840 --> 10:23.840
that the No Other Private

10:23.840 --> 10:26.840
at Fort Dick's during that period got a long fall.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.840
The No Other Private was that

10:28.840 --> 10:29.840
crawled up to the commanding general,

10:29.840 --> 10:31.840
but No Other Private had an extra pass.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.840
We could say a typical average trainee,

10:33.840 --> 10:35.840
and I think that the baseball player

10:35.840 --> 10:37.840
to whom you referred is probably not

10:37.840 --> 10:39.840
a typical average trainee.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.840
Now who will be tuned to the center at Fort Dick's turn?

10:42.840 --> 10:44.840
How many tunes do you have?

10:44.840 --> 10:47.840
I've only been at Fort Dick's twice,

10:47.840 --> 10:48.840
or three times, or,

10:48.840 --> 10:52.840
and I don't know the geography of the post very well.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.840
So you have any idea of how many tunes were down at the

10:55.840 --> 10:56.840
food center?

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
No, so I wouldn't.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.840
Would you pass over a hundred?

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
I could only guess so I don't know.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.840
Well, you've been a very opposed.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.840
I'm curious, you know, how you can keep an accurate count

11:08.840 --> 11:10.840
of the time calls,

11:10.840 --> 11:11.840
my understanding of the proposal

11:11.840 --> 11:13.840
to bring in all of these songs.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.840
So all these people here have songs.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.840
I just wonder how that's the monitoring of his songs.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.840
I'm sure people have asked you out for a while.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
You all met the weekend,

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
and we would save a lot of time.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.840
So the record of the telephone that made itself

11:28.840 --> 11:30.840
would be produced.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.840
And they are not records that were made up.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.840
So the authorities would take

11:35.840 --> 11:38.840
a record of the telephone company.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.840
And they are not monitors.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.840
Do I understand, we have to share the questions.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.840
This is very, very interesting.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.840
Do I understand that the tone's all,

11:50.840 --> 11:53.840
but it's probably one that's in the call.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.840
You know, I want to start with a personal family

11:57.840 --> 12:03.840
to young lady extra, say, or why.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.840
I'm going to be brought in here and made public.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.840
So that part of the case,

12:09.840 --> 12:12.840
under I was merely enlightening you on the subject

12:12.840 --> 12:16.840
of how we ascertain the number of long-distance calls

12:16.840 --> 12:19.840
that Kyiv Chaiin made out of 46,

12:19.840 --> 12:21.840
and I've made a new choice.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.840
That those records were obtained

12:24.840 --> 12:26.840
from the news.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.840
One of the news that I found was made to introduce those records

12:29.840 --> 12:31.840
Mr. Chairman, and of course, the senator

12:31.840 --> 12:34.840
has a perfect guide to make an objection.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.840
So I'm, uh, me and I have to close the poll in our information.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.840
You know, the council stated the call

12:40.840 --> 12:42.840
for not money.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.840
I'm telling you what the number is.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.840
Me and I have to listen to my.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.840
So is this the code now by the chair?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.840
To put it to the record.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
I'm going to call all of them.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
They're private and they're having minutes

12:54.840 --> 12:57.840
to follow these lines.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.840
Those guys have anything to do,

12:59.840 --> 13:03.840
it tends to get the charge you're building to get special proper.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.840
I would like to know that because if that is,

13:05.840 --> 13:07.840
if that is to be done,

13:07.840 --> 13:09.840
there's certain actions now that it's taking.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.840
I'm not going to share any of the lawyers

13:11.840 --> 13:14.840
in service committees over about a year.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.840
And if there's going to attempt to get told call,

13:17.840 --> 13:20.840
but he made two various young ladies

13:20.840 --> 13:25.840
who are very of people who are giving him information.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.840
And I'm sure he was talking to individuals

13:29.840 --> 13:31.840
who are giving him information.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.840
Then I must, I must, uh, know that.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.840
So, especially ahead of time,

13:36.840 --> 13:38.840
so I can take the proper action with the chairman.

13:38.840 --> 13:39.840
The chairman?

13:39.840 --> 13:41.840
Yes, the head of the chairman.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.840
Father and all the senators and life and sons are my class.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.840
So, thank you, President Grinnell.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.840
The head of the president is so talented.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.840
He is the president of the chairman.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.580
And we are committed to thislit

13:51.580 --> 14:11.420
congress of compassion to the indecent

14:11.420 --> 14:18.840
communitiesNmable HERE is telecommunicate definitives.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.840
We are a socialist.

14:50.840 --> 14:54.840
And we have got new people to

14:54.840 --> 14:58.840
follow the right of the names of the people who look to

14:58.840 --> 15:01.840
shine so far as far as this makes a long distance.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.840
I assume we need a great number.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.840
Some of our clients are proposed to

15:05.840 --> 15:07.840
introduce those records that will fit

15:07.840 --> 15:10.840
a matter of one or two minutes.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.840
Present those records to the

15:12.840 --> 15:14.840
community for each inspection of the hearing

15:14.840 --> 15:16.840
inspection.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.840
And then you may be desired to bring out

15:20.840 --> 15:22.840
the names of the parties that are

15:22.840 --> 15:24.840
proposed today.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.840
In other words, I assume I put the

15:27.840 --> 15:28.840
your position.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.840
I think you have been

15:31.840 --> 15:34.840
imminently saying all this thing

15:34.840 --> 15:38.840
is something that if you have been

15:38.840 --> 15:40.840
a volunteer, you have been intonation

15:40.840 --> 15:41.840
to the both sides.

15:41.840 --> 15:42.840
That's all right.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.840
I think you have been imminently

15:44.840 --> 15:45.840
there.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.840
Then I understand that you do not propose.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.840
You do not propose.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.840
So identify the people tall by the

15:52.840 --> 15:54.840
frivolous amount.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.840
Other than identifying the members of the

15:56.840 --> 15:58.840
community call for the firm records.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.840
I assume the senator might say,

16:00.840 --> 16:05.840
you identify the parties tall but I do not propose.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.840
Explore that.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.840
Take the time.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.840
I am not necessarily

16:10.840 --> 16:12.840
a long time to do so.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.840
It will be a public record.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.840
I do not think it shows any particular

16:16.840 --> 16:18.840
light of only issue.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.840
As I say, the big eight number of those

16:20.840 --> 16:22.840
calls are to the members of your committee.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.840
So, may I say some of our

16:24.840 --> 16:26.840
dearly socialist parents, just chairman

16:26.840 --> 16:27.840
of the government.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.840
I think you should listen to my

16:28.840 --> 16:29.840
family members.

16:29.840 --> 16:30.840
I think you should listen to my

16:30.840 --> 16:31.840
concerns.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.840
I'm sorry, Jason Yachtler.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.840
But chairman, I say this.

16:35.840 --> 16:35.840


16:35.840 --> 16:37.840
I think you should listen to my

16:37.840 --> 16:38.840
staff which is firm.

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
I have no objection to learning.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
I would like to talk to the chair and

16:40.840 --> 16:42.840
the council and the rankings.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.840
And all of a sudden, before they

16:44.840 --> 16:46.840
pick up the all the phone calls of the

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
president and put them in an

16:48.840 --> 16:50.840
evidence, I consider it might get

16:50.840 --> 16:51.840
him in a lot of different

16:51.840 --> 16:52.840
ways.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.840
So, I think that's it.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.840
I think that's it.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.840
I think that's it.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.840
You can find it right.

17:00.840 --> 17:01.840
I think that's it.

17:01.840 --> 17:02.840
I have more than about

17:02.840 --> 17:03.840
an hour and a quarter.

17:03.840 --> 17:04.840
I mean, I haven't discussed

17:04.840 --> 17:05.840
it yet.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.840
I want to make this up to date.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.840
I didn't know the telephone calls

17:10.840 --> 17:12.840
were really going to go into

17:12.840 --> 17:14.840
the talk to the president.

17:14.840 --> 17:16.840
But if this file is very much

17:16.840 --> 17:18.840
important to us, so the committee

17:18.840 --> 17:20.840
has got a number of calls that

17:20.840 --> 17:21.840
it is reflected.

17:21.840 --> 17:22.840
He is serving this committee and

17:22.840 --> 17:24.840
is trying to wind up his own

17:24.840 --> 17:26.840
Phoenix business out on G1.

17:26.840 --> 17:27.840
That should be an

17:27.840 --> 17:29.840
inspection on the file of the

17:29.840 --> 17:30.840
council.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.840
I guess that is it.

17:33.840 --> 17:34.840
Is anything good?

17:34.840 --> 17:36.840
It probably helps you instead of

17:36.840 --> 17:37.840
working.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.840
Sometimes I think it looks like

17:40.840 --> 17:41.840
no long.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.840
It's just different

17:44.840 --> 17:47.840
from the information calls.

17:47.840 --> 17:48.840
The names of the

17:48.840 --> 17:50.840
public will be number two.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.840
Any call from members of

17:52.840 --> 17:53.840
the committee?

17:53.840 --> 17:54.840
Good.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.840
I think that's it.

17:55.840 --> 17:56.840
Where did he call us together?

17:56.840 --> 17:57.840
The names of the public?

17:57.840 --> 17:58.840
There are a couple of

17:59.340 --> 18:03.840
people and I still have a

18:03.840 --> 18:04.840
past.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.840
The voorall I

18:07.840 --> 18:10.640
don't have past.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.840
But I'm time when

18:14.840 --> 18:15.840
the title reads

18:15.840 --> 18:18.840
the information

18:18.840 --> 18:21.840
expression.

18:24.840 --> 18:24.840


18:24.840 --> 18:28.840
I'm going to ask you a

18:28.840 --> 18:30.840
few questions and I'm going to

18:30.840 --> 18:32.840
get it up and I'm going to have

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
my

18:33.840 --> 18:34.840
mind.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.840
Just one or two

18:37.840 --> 18:38.840
other questions.

18:38.840 --> 18:44.840
I'm going to use this

18:44.840 --> 18:49.840
to get between

18:49.840 --> 18:49.840


18:49.840 --> 18:51.840
the

18:51.840 --> 18:52.840
point.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.840
Which we find that

18:54.840 --> 18:59.840
on here we have a

18:59.840 --> 19:02.840
long black, long white,

19:02.840 --> 19:04.840
long and a third of the

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
day.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.840
The third of the

19:07.840 --> 19:10.840
tenth indicating something

19:10.840 --> 19:12.840
involved on the part of

19:12.840 --> 19:13.840
Mr. Sainz.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.840
The boss will now

19:14.840 --> 19:16.840
don't think that he was not

19:16.840 --> 19:17.840
a thing that was

19:17.840 --> 19:19.840
in the

19:19.840 --> 19:21.840
court.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.840
According to the

19:23.840 --> 19:25.840
testimony, the title

19:25.840 --> 19:27.840
title, according to the

19:27.840 --> 19:29.840
testimony of the

19:29.840 --> 19:31.840
secretary of the army, he was

19:31.840 --> 19:33.840
assigned on

19:33.840 --> 19:35.840
temporary duty in New York

19:35.840 --> 19:37.840
to the committee.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.840
I wish you were

19:40.840 --> 19:42.840
assigned the court

19:42.840 --> 19:44.840
six then

19:44.840 --> 19:46.840
and it's not intentional

19:46.840 --> 19:49.840
on your

19:49.840 --> 19:51.840
life.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.840
But can we now agree that

19:53.840 --> 19:55.840
there's nothing at all in

19:55.840 --> 19:56.840
football.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.840
On the part of it, Mr.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.840
Sainz and the

19:59.840 --> 20:01.100
former

20:01.100 --> 20:02.840
seat of black

20:02.840 --> 20:04.840
white and this would be a

20:04.840 --> 20:05.840
race.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.840
If you want to have an

20:07.840 --> 20:08.840
action to

20:08.840 --> 20:09.840
take it?

20:09.840 --> 20:10.840
I don't think

20:10.840 --> 20:12.840
that's not a

20:12.840 --> 20:13.840
good idea.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.840
I'm

20:15.840 --> 20:17.840
surprised that

20:17.840 --> 20:18.840
the sign is concerned.

20:18.840 --> 20:19.840
день has a

20:19.840 --> 20:20.840
military meaning.

20:20.840 --> 20:21.840
rés

20:21.840 --> 20:22.840
I am assigned here in the

20:22.840 --> 20:24.840
office of the

20:24.840 --> 20:25.840
Georgia advocate

20:25.840 --> 20:26.840
general.

20:26.840 --> 20:27.840
If I am sent on duty

20:27.840 --> 20:29.840
to Atlanta, I would go there

20:29.840 --> 20:30.840
on TV live, temporary duty.

20:30.840 --> 20:31.840
I believe that the entry is on

20:31.840 --> 20:33.840
those dates that you pointed

20:33.840 --> 20:34.840
out.

20:34.840 --> 20:35.840
Sure that

20:35.840 --> 20:36.840
Sainz was on temporary duty

20:36.840 --> 20:37.840
in New York.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.840
And I believe that the

20:39.840 --> 20:41.840
succeeds here in the

20:41.840 --> 20:42.280
office

20:42.280 --> 20:42.840
and they sign it to my

20:42.840 --> 20:44.280
left.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.040
Asws you can see my right.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.340
You still else,

20:46.340 --> 20:46.840
still goes.

20:46.840 --> 20:47.840
gleichzeitig.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.540
So not the kind you have

20:51.340 --> 20:54.140
that time would be

20:54.140 --> 20:54.140


20:54.140 --> 20:55.500
Coming back to this

20:55.500 --> 20:58.340
seat.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.280
The

20:59.280 --> 21:00.340
guard confused.

21:00.340 --> 21:00.840
For the

21:00.840 --> 21:02.340
party time while a

21:02.340 --> 21:04.340
fine.

21:05.340 --> 21:08.340
Now anyone

21:08.340 --> 21:09.440
get down to the small

21:09.440 --> 21:10.440
print.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.240
You know he was

21:12.240 --> 21:15.240
prepared for the

21:15.240 --> 21:16.240
protesters for

21:16.240 --> 21:18.240
television.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.240
When you say work in

21:19.240 --> 21:21.040
absences, then you draw

21:21.040 --> 21:22.340
the bloody black line

21:22.340 --> 21:24.240
showing you.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.240
You and I know he could

21:25.240 --> 21:27.040
not be asked.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.040
When he was attending

21:28.040 --> 21:29.040
contemporary, do you

21:29.040 --> 21:29.440
know you are

21:29.440 --> 21:31.240
definitely.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.240
He wouldn't be

21:32.240 --> 21:33.140
absent without

21:33.140 --> 21:34.040
leaves, but he would

21:34.040 --> 21:35.040
be absent.

21:35.040 --> 21:35.840
There's no

21:35.840 --> 21:37.040
attempt to say other

21:37.040 --> 21:38.040
than he is.

21:38.040 --> 21:38.940
He's not absent from

21:38.940 --> 21:40.940
for just.

21:40.940 --> 21:42.740
The expression

21:42.740 --> 21:43.740
absent without leave

21:43.740 --> 21:45.740
is a word in itself

21:45.740 --> 21:47.240
to a military man.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.740
For many of the

21:49.740 --> 21:51.240
average cleanies also

21:51.240 --> 21:52.740
have temporary duty.

21:52.740 --> 21:53.740
I do.

21:53.740 --> 21:55.240
I wouldn't assume that

21:55.240 --> 21:56.240
so because that's a very

21:56.240 --> 21:57.440
intensive period of

21:57.440 --> 21:58.440
basic training.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.440
Do you know of anyone

21:59.440 --> 22:00.440
there?

22:00.440 --> 22:01.440
I do not know.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.440
So now,

22:03.440 --> 22:05.940
I just see

22:05.940 --> 22:06.740
completely on the

22:06.740 --> 22:07.740
top of the table.

22:07.740 --> 22:08.940
You're man to man.

22:08.940 --> 22:10.240
When you prepare

22:10.240 --> 22:11.640
a chart and

22:11.640 --> 22:12.640
put on television,

22:12.640 --> 22:13.640
say record of

22:13.640 --> 22:14.640
absences.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.140
I'll find a

22:16.140 --> 22:17.640
four six.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.640
Then you draw a

22:18.640 --> 22:20.640
heavy black line here.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.140
And you make the

22:21.140 --> 22:22.140
sentence so small

22:22.140 --> 22:23.640
and obviously

22:23.640 --> 22:24.640
known to the television

22:24.640 --> 22:25.640
audience to see

22:25.640 --> 22:26.640
it never do it here.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.140
But this is the

22:28.140 --> 22:29.140
fastest.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.140
It shows one,

22:30.140 --> 22:30.140


22:30.140 --> 22:30.640
three,

22:30.640 --> 22:31.140
four,

22:31.140 --> 22:31.640
five,

22:31.640 --> 22:32.140
six,

22:32.140 --> 22:33.140
seven,

22:33.140 --> 22:34.140
eight.

22:34.140 --> 22:35.140
It's

22:35.140 --> 22:36.140
blacked out.

22:36.140 --> 22:36.640
Record of absences.

22:37.540 --> 22:38.540
Don't be afraid.

22:38.540 --> 22:39.540
That's the case.

22:39.540 --> 22:40.540
It can be

22:40.540 --> 22:41.540
full of some questions.

22:41.540 --> 22:42.540
And with someone,

22:42.540 --> 22:43.540
and someone was

22:43.540 --> 22:45.540
deliberately doing this.

22:45.540 --> 22:48.040
Isn't that obvious?

22:48.040 --> 22:50.040
Not for the day of blacked

22:50.040 --> 22:51.540
out because he was not

22:51.540 --> 22:52.240
at four six,

22:52.240 --> 22:53.240
getting up early,

22:53.240 --> 22:53.740
like the other

22:53.740 --> 22:54.740
private and doing the

22:54.740 --> 22:56.240
other work that General Ryan

22:56.240 --> 22:57.240
has testified.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.040
He was there and he

22:58.040 --> 22:59.040
wasn't getting up early.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.040
He was saying,

23:00.040 --> 23:01.040
up late.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.040
Well, he wasn't

23:02.040 --> 23:03.040
doing it at four six.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.040
But he wasn't

23:04.040 --> 23:05.040
trying to for six.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.040
Would we

23:06.040 --> 23:07.040
have to

23:07.040 --> 23:08.040
testify,

23:08.040 --> 23:09.040
out of the ring,

23:09.040 --> 23:10.040
going to the right.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.040
Do you think

23:11.040 --> 23:13.040
General Robert Dizzis,

23:13.040 --> 23:14.040
the civilian person

23:14.040 --> 23:15.040
as a young man,

23:15.040 --> 23:18.040
was absent from doing

23:18.040 --> 23:19.040
his work

23:19.040 --> 23:21.040
completely on it?

23:21.040 --> 23:22.040
Yes, I do.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.040
Completely on it.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.040
All right,

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
come back to that.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.040
When they declared this

23:26.040 --> 23:27.040
start,

23:27.040 --> 23:28.040
and I thought it

23:28.040 --> 23:29.040
didn't really

23:29.040 --> 23:30.040
work,

23:30.040 --> 23:31.040
let's make the small

23:31.040 --> 23:32.040
and it's

23:32.040 --> 23:33.040
a complete here.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.040
Completely white.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.040
When they

23:35.040 --> 23:36.040
saw

23:36.040 --> 23:37.040
Mr. Shines,

23:37.040 --> 23:38.040
they were going

23:38.040 --> 23:39.040
to pass

23:39.040 --> 23:40.040
to the first.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.040
And

23:41.040 --> 23:42.040
10

23:42.040 --> 23:43.040
six.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.040
And they

23:44.040 --> 23:45.040
heard it

23:45.040 --> 23:46.040
January.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.040
And they

23:47.040 --> 23:48.040
made a huge black mark.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.040
And they

23:49.040 --> 23:50.040
saw the average

23:50.040 --> 23:51.040
private.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.040
It was on a

23:52.040 --> 23:53.040
path.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.040
Until

23:54.040 --> 23:55.040
12 choir

23:55.040 --> 23:56.040
tonight, they

23:56.040 --> 23:57.040
gave him

23:57.040 --> 23:58.040
a black mark.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.040
They prepared these things

23:59.040 --> 24:00.040
step

24:00.040 --> 24:01.040
here in the

24:01.040 --> 24:02.040
machine, but

24:02.040 --> 24:04.040
to the

24:04.040 --> 24:05.040
first.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.040
And

24:06.040 --> 24:07.040
they were

24:07.040 --> 24:08.040
trying to

24:08.040 --> 24:09.040
work

24:09.040 --> 24:10.040
three.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.040
We took

24:11.040 --> 24:12.040
a picture of the

24:12.040 --> 24:13.040
quads.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.040
Do you think they

24:14.040 --> 24:15.040
are being on it?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.040
Yes, sir.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.040
I think

24:17.040 --> 24:18.040
the legend clearly

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
states that.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.040
The record on

24:20.040 --> 24:21.040
Shines is a

24:21.040 --> 24:22.040
factual record,

24:22.040 --> 24:23.040
because we had

24:23.040 --> 24:24.040
gone right

24:24.040 --> 24:25.040
to sign out

24:25.040 --> 24:26.040
books and all the

24:26.040 --> 24:27.040
other records.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.040
The record on the

24:28.040 --> 24:29.040
other

24:29.040 --> 24:30.040
typical

24:30.040 --> 24:31.040
training, always

24:31.040 --> 24:32.040
to state

24:32.040 --> 24:33.040
as what he was

24:33.040 --> 24:34.040
thinking.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.040
You

24:35.040 --> 24:36.040
don't

24:36.040 --> 24:36.040


24:36.040 --> 24:37.040
Robinson,

24:37.040 --> 24:38.040
sino

24:38.040 --> 24:48.040
sold

24:48.040 --> 24:49.040
forever.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.040
on

24:50.040 --> 24:50.040


24:50.040 --> 24:51.040
outfit.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.040
It

24:52.040 --> 24:53.040
was

24:53.040 --> 24:55.040
estoy

24:55.040 --> 24:59.040
ty pre

24:59.040 --> 25:00.040
dot

25:00.040 --> 25:02.040
removing

25:02.040 --> 25:09.040
sisters

25:09.040 --> 25:12.260
st

25:12.260 --> 25:14.260
their

25:14.260 --> 25:24.520
c�

25:24.520 --> 25:45.980
for

26:45.980 --> 26:51.060
something wrong on the 16th of January I believe it's private shine like

26:51.060 --> 26:53.660
no no it's like self-taught you can only not put your

26:53.660 --> 26:56.480
members but only what you can see if they can live without

26:56.480 --> 26:58.540
their turn as far as I'm ready for this

26:58.540 --> 27:01.980
hey the governor away and I just would like to be able to see it

27:01.980 --> 27:04.980
before you go for a chance to see if you can really

27:04.980 --> 27:07.060
see the one on the black line on the sign starts

27:07.060 --> 27:10.980
you can see it on the 16th of January I can see a black line

27:10.980 --> 27:13.380
yes it's on the sign starts

27:13.380 --> 27:16.020
I think the other two of us will need to go to the other

27:16.020 --> 27:20.020
and this I think that we'll get an intelligence

27:20.020 --> 27:25.180
military watching these proceedings so they don't

27:25.180 --> 27:29.220
make any decisions on this unless I don't like I don't

27:29.220 --> 27:33.620
like to say you taking a rock for this I think all of our

27:33.620 --> 27:36.340
trouble has been with the civilians over in the Pentagon

27:36.340 --> 27:39.140
our uniform men have given us no trouble

27:39.140 --> 27:42.140
you know a few questions

27:42.140 --> 27:45.380
good one for the questions why

27:45.380 --> 27:49.300
French and general why I have this to say I'm saying

27:49.300 --> 27:54.740
34.72 of the record you know

27:54.740 --> 27:58.860
I miss a thing I miss a thing

27:58.860 --> 28:04.380
clar question in general for six you don't have your

28:04.380 --> 28:08.340
schedule for a rain for these men are idle after five

28:08.340 --> 28:11.700
a pocket night there are things to do do they not

28:11.700 --> 28:16.260
you're suffering the mining of this about trans

28:16.260 --> 28:20.580
assets general line answer if as many of them go to

28:20.580 --> 28:24.460
movies they watch television they're through the radio

28:24.460 --> 28:28.660
they write letters home we have five service

28:28.660 --> 28:32.780
clubs that are going every night with dancers on the other

28:32.780 --> 28:34.940
hand many times we do have a special duty

28:34.940 --> 28:38.220
to perform and preparing the equipment themselves

28:38.220 --> 28:40.540
to do these in the following day but a good

28:40.540 --> 28:43.660
show there after the wild to get themselves ready for

28:43.660 --> 28:46.420
the following day and a rather fast-fifling it

28:46.420 --> 28:49.420
doesn't take him long to clean his rifle get his

28:49.420 --> 28:53.180
get his equipment laid out get himself cleaned up and

28:53.180 --> 28:57.100
be and use it off to the service space you know he's

28:57.100 --> 29:00.540
off to the movies some way now taking general

29:00.540 --> 29:05.420
and simple but the average time he normally

29:05.420 --> 29:10.460
films the evening after his training going to movies

29:10.460 --> 29:13.580
going to the defense of the five service clubs

29:13.580 --> 29:16.940
with the dancers you can tell that these

29:16.940 --> 29:21.980
boxed out there is for private time for you

29:21.980 --> 29:25.900
in fact the general has determined that

29:25.900 --> 29:28.940
they're in the investigation that he was doing

29:28.940 --> 29:31.580
they were of the committee and taking out

29:31.580 --> 29:36.300
the documents do you think that that is any special

29:36.300 --> 29:40.780
phrase that him to be able to get out and work in the evening

29:40.780 --> 29:43.980
instead of going to a dancer the movie so there's

29:43.980 --> 29:47.260
so many promises in that question with which I don't

29:47.260 --> 29:49.820
agree senator that I can hardly answer yet

29:49.820 --> 29:54.300
now let's take it one by one let's take it one by one

29:54.300 --> 29:58.860
general Ryan said look the only time trying to get off

29:58.860 --> 30:02.300
well it's not about an inner field he's training

30:02.300 --> 30:06.700
but if he starts the morning my advice and who I have a date

30:06.700 --> 30:10.060
they five days five so I hope so come on day

30:10.060 --> 30:14.380
days and all that's an interesting date

30:14.380 --> 30:18.060
how a man just doesn't expect whether he thinks he can

30:18.060 --> 30:20.620
do it in a few minutes so he could just

30:20.620 --> 30:23.500
dismiss him and I have a new edition of my plan about a

30:23.500 --> 30:25.500
minute to half right this is

30:25.500 --> 30:27.340
I can get some information you can do it in the

30:27.340 --> 30:28.060
time

30:28.060 --> 30:33.260
uh tell us just one thought series of questions

30:33.260 --> 30:38.220
general Ryan testified that part of time

30:38.220 --> 30:42.860
was only a off on pass and when the part he knew he was

30:42.860 --> 30:45.180
doing work at the committee general Ryan

30:45.180 --> 30:48.060
testified that some New York payter

30:48.060 --> 30:50.060
complained

30:50.060 --> 30:58.860
letting the gentleman work at the committee to view
