00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I found nothing wrong with trying to ask him for a day.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
And here I did a test.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
And do that testimony on the part of General Ryan.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Would you say that these blacked-out things within the cake that

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
trained instead of as Brian first joined to the dance pool,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
joined the movie, instead of that he was doing the work

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
with him from Gage and Wimley helping out to explore

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
the time he was in for a day.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
Would you say that instead of being blacked-out?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
They're perhaps a bit white.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
According to what you're trying to make black and white stand for

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
as if you might have something there.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
So that I actually feel that my I know nothing about what the

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
expected general found.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I have not read and speak a recording detail.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
And as I recall General Ryan sent to the money I don't think he

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
did just close with what the expected general found.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I feel that if this is not a choice to try to be the

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
be all and end all of the army's case, all it shows is a record of

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
absence is a shine.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
This is can be proven that he was working on committee business

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
throughout all that space.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
This is not the case.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
It was.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
If it were not, this is just only a link in the chain.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
I think I've been in the hands.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I think I've been in the hands of one person.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And be of the fact that there's no testimony here.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Even after the expected general's investigation.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
But what you're saying is not doing committee work.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
You have not taken upon yourself.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
You're not doing committee work.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Most of all, I wouldn't take it upon myself.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Now, on view of the fact that you have the expected general

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
investigation, you have the fact you have the

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
promised testimony that you're doing committee work.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Can you tell me the role of any special consideration,

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
any special privilege to sign the law to give up information

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
about coming up.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Information can be picked up over here in here instead of going

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
for that.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I see nothing wrong in sign working when he says these

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
claims.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Senator Concord?

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Senator MacArthur, you can go in.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Here I have an announcement to make.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
He wants to give the attention to Mr. Walsh and to some

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
of the traffic.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
At 9.30 tomorrow morning, come for you at 9.30 tomorrow morning

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
in 357.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm calling an executive committee meeting.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
At which time I want to confer with the committee members Mr.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Walsh and Mr. MacArthur about the problem of monitoring

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
phone calls, if we can't get a settle once and for all of that

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
time to get it.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I want to apologize and say I could be there at 9.30.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I cannot be there at 9.30 tomorrow.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
We've got 30 personally and I appreciate you making it

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
between 4.30.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
We've got the definite judgment.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I guess you have a member of the committee.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Mr. Chairman, might I inquire?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
You've found a letter to Mr. Walsh.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Correct.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Is that again hint of the call available?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Mr. Walsh.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I think it is.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
He did not get delivered to my office before 5.30.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
He never did the Mr. Chairman.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
We have a meeting following Bob.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Our agenda.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
The other member has problems.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Let me tell you, Mr. Walsh,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
who is the leader of the committee.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
About 1.30.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
1.30.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
1.30.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
John, be alert.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
You and the people of the 1.30 tomorrow have to know.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
1.30.
