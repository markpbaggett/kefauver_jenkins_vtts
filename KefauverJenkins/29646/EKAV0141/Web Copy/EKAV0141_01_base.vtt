00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
As a big picture, as a big picture, does it not show a space between the ground and the

00:06.360 --> 00:09.360
Colonel's coat?

00:09.360 --> 00:21.240
Well, you hold up so I can see I may have my question reversed because that's correct.

00:21.240 --> 00:25.440
Can you see the bottom of the Colonel's coat in that picture?

00:25.440 --> 00:26.440
Top coat?

00:27.440 --> 00:31.440
I don't believe the Colonel has the top coat out there.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.440
Turn around and I'm all wrong if that's correct.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.440
It's your coat I'm talking about.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.440
That's the Colonel.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.440
Is it possible to see the bottom of your coat?

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
In the big picture.

00:45.440 --> 00:49.440
Yes sir, the big picture is possible to see the bottom of my coat.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.440
You look at the small picture and see whether the...

00:52.440 --> 00:54.440
It's possible to see the bottom of the coat.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.440
It is not possible to see the bottom of the Colonel's small picture sir.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.440
Well, you look at the picture of Secretary Stevens and the big picture.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
Yes sir.

01:05.440 --> 01:13.440
In the big picture is it possible to see the bottom of the top coat that Secretary Stevens has in his arm, showing a considerable...

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
It is sir.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.440
Look at the small picture.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.440
Is it possible there to see the bottom of Secretary Stevens?

01:19.440 --> 01:21.440
There is not a possible sir.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.440
Which was certainly indicated that either one of two things must have taken place.

01:26.440 --> 01:30.440
Either there are two different prints involved.

01:30.440 --> 01:43.440
Or else, in some kind of photographic maneuvering with which this chairman is not familiar, it apparently was possible to contract the bottom of the picture without contracting the top of the picture.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.440
Because at the top of the picture then pull down for it.

01:46.440 --> 01:51.440
Fundingly, you would pretty well have decapitated the witness as you showed up on the picture.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
Yes sir.

01:52.440 --> 01:57.440
I just wanted to have that in a record and I wanted Mr. Wilson to have that.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.440
Because nobody had called attention to those who just got the picture.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.440
That time I have the pretty questions.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.440
Turn to the top.

02:04.440 --> 02:14.440
Left the chairman and bureau of the statement that the witnesses made that he'd like to seek the advice of council as to whether he should have council.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.440
Go ahead, gentlemen.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.440
More than four of Mr. Chairman.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.440
More than four of them.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
All right.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.440
Well there, but it is.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.440
I go for rule.

02:33.440 --> 02:37.440
I didn't wonder how the photographer is going to get out of this one.

02:37.440 --> 02:42.440
And not only have been standing up front without his stand up to push the water on the chair.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.440
Yes sir.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.440
That's why the occupational hazards go ahead and start them.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
Yes sir.

02:53.440 --> 03:02.440
The shy man is saying, make the shy man is saying to you, this accident occurred and the drunken accident.

03:07.440 --> 03:16.440
I was saying to you that I would know that you would just say that you had made that you would like to himself with council today.

03:17.440 --> 03:24.440
And I would like to say that you would like to have the chance to claim whether you need or shall want council with you.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.440
And deal with that and an effort to further expedite these hearings.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.440
I shall not ask any further questions at this time.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.440
So I prepared to answer any questions about this photograph.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.440
I'm thinking of the prior report.

03:37.440 --> 03:42.440
Well I am interested in the questions I asked you first.

03:43.440 --> 03:51.440
I thought your industry may photograph it whether it was this photograph but not on another occasion.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.440
And that's a question by some of the other different photographs.

03:54.440 --> 04:03.440
I understand you have, but I do not want to interrogate you further if you feel that you would like to consult with council before you proceed.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.440
Mr. Chair.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.440
To what extent?

04:07.440 --> 04:11.440
I am in a familiar role as I look at the file.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.440
We are one hour overtime and this witness is a young private of the army.

04:16.440 --> 04:23.440
I am old enough to know that it would be wise for him to himself with council as he suggested.

04:23.440 --> 04:28.440
Surely on the preliminary question of do I need council?

04:28.440 --> 04:31.440
I do not like to see a young private of the army.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.440
I try to decide questions about importance on its own behalf.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.440
I think fairly should it do.

04:37.440 --> 04:44.440
Mr. Chairman, I never thought I was not going to ask the private any further questions.

04:44.440 --> 04:51.440
If he feels at all that he should consult with council or with friends as to whether he should have council.

04:51.440 --> 04:55.440
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to do a question with Mr. Chairman.

04:55.440 --> 05:03.440
Mr. Chairman, I think the record should disclose that at the outset,

05:03.440 --> 05:08.440
the private of the army was advised to write a council and I quite agree.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.440
He was good enough to say that he thought he could go ahead without.

05:11.440 --> 05:24.440
I think that in a light of all the circumstances, there should not be any further questions until he is at the right to give this matter further consideration as to whether he would like to have council.

05:24.440 --> 05:31.440
I may say that I was the one who suggested to the chairman that that question he may prove to be all that.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.440
I think I am confident in it, how?

05:33.440 --> 05:41.440
I am not certain that this picture has been made and exhibited to the witnesses.

05:41.440 --> 05:47.440
ABC Radio has been being you on the scene coverage of the McCarthy Army rings direct from the Senate office building in Washington.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.440
At this time, the committee is ready to recess for the day.

05:51.440 --> 05:56.440
It will resume at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow morning for the seventh day.
