WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I'm wrapping now for attention.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Before he gets the session underway,

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
and while we have the opportunity,

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
while Santa Fe was Monday's making his little sense.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Chair, I'd like to begin by welcoming our guests

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
who have come into the committee room.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
I have you, the committee, happy to have you.

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
Watching one of your congressional committees in operation.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Chair, I'd like to have the audience listen very carefully

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
to what he's going to say next.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Because we observed that before the meeting began,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
there were some applause as various principles

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
and committee members entered the room.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Perhaps you have not been fouling your hearings

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
and do not realize that it's strictly forbidden.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
And Chair, rather than trying to have anybody removed

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
from the room, the Vilege and that committee rule,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
has instructed the officers to begin today.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
It would be particularly alerted

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
and to remove from the room immediately.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Without any prisoners,

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
unlikely but firmly,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
with the authorities that they have vested in them

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
by the Congress of the United States,

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
anyone, a party,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
or anyone engaging in any other audible manifestations

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
of approval or disapproval.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
That is a firm rule,

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
that is a continuing rule,

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
that is a rule that committee expects our officers

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
to enforce completely.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Without any further instruction from the Chair

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
and those instructions are from the committee and provide

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
that they should be carried out both by the uniform members

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
of the Capitol Police Force that you see before you

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
and the plain clothesmen scattered through the arms.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Now you have all been warned as you have been warned.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
If you decide the Vilege determines

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
under which you enter the room and are removed,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
you have removed yourself,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
because you have failed to comply

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
with the regulations of this committee and of these hearings.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I feel with that explanation

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
we will not have any further interruption by people

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
who seek to disrupt a hearing

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
which they have come to observe.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
As we concluded that the hearing yesterday,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Senator Simonton had a few minutes left,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
a few ten minutes,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
but tells me that he had concluded his questions,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
so we will switch to next to Senator Bushach,

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
who has not yet come from the committee room.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
He not being here that you already recognize

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
you, Mr. Corners, Senator McCartney,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
attend next.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Mr. Corners, I have no question.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Senator, you have no question.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Mr. Welfare, Mr. Sinclair, for ten minutes.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I will just start with the question.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Sorry, I wanted to ask the question.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Senator McCartney, believe your mic before I think

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
it has not turned on or else your voice has gotten worse.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
We can't hear you.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I am just getting the hang of it.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Mr. Carr, I think yesterday you mentioned that

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
we received FBI reports occasionally

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
from the answer I gathered,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
but they might have been the feeling

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
that you had received the FBI reports.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Any FBI reports from directives me as a guy?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Yes sir.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Any clearance, secrets of secret confidential

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
would come to me and you would only learn about that

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
by hearing about it from me, is it right?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Yes sir, that's practice.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Nothing further, Mr. Chairman.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Thank you very much, Mr. Welfare.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Mr. Sinclair, attend next.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Mr. Carr, yesterday you may recall,

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
we were discussing the meeting that you and Mr. Corn

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
had with the Secretary on October 2nd.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
You recall, sir?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yes sir.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And I believe you had testified in substance

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
that the Secretary in the course of that meeting

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
brought up the question of shine by stating in substance

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
that shine was not going to get a commission.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
You recall that?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Yes sir.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
And I guess I barely outlined your testimony, have I not?

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Yes sir, I didn't say that he had...

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I didn't specifically say,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
he brought it up as I recall,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I think I said that it was my recollection

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
that the Secretary had brought this matter up,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
or started the conversation.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, do you now wish to suggest that perhaps you could be wrong, Mr. Carr?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
No, I don't think I'm wrong.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
That's your best recollection.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
The Secretary brought it up in the manner that you and I have discussed.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Right.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Now we were discussing that fact in connection with what work

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
you had outlined for private shine.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Do you recall?

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Not specifically not, sir.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Well, in any event, that news was the first you heard of,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
it was not Mr. Carr.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, not, as I said yesterday,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I thought that was the first time that I had learned

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
that Mr. Shine would not receive a commission.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
That's right.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
That's right.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Did you know that Mr. Shine had received formal notification

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
that he was not going to get a commission on July 31, 1953?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
No, I did not.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Did you know that General Weber testified that he told Mr. Cone

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
about that time that Shine was not qualified?

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I think I heard General Weber's testimony.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
All right.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
But in so far as you were concerned,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
the first you heard of it was on October 2nd.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Yes, that's the best of my recollection.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
So that up to that time,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
apparently we agreed yesterday,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
but if not say so,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
you thought that Shine was likely to get a commission,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
isn't that correct?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I didn't know whether he was.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
He was.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
And I thought that he would.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
I thought that.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Well, you heard that General Weber is supposed to have said he would.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm not sure whether I heard that at that time,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
or whether I heard General Weber say these things.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I heard the testimony,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
but I'm not sure that it will happen.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm not sure that it will happen.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
General Weber testified that he promised the commission.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
I'm just suggesting that your associates have so testified,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
and apparently must have told you that fact too.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, I don't recall that they ever told me that at that time.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, in any event you must have been counting on Mr. Shine

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
as a member of your committee up until the date of October 2nd,

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
until that time I hadn't given it too much consideration.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I thought he was getting a reserve commission.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
You thought he was going to get a commission?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
That's right.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Well, then you must have been counting on his not being available to you

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
then in the reasonably near future.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
After that time I was pretty sure I'd known him yet.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Well, up to that time,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
you thought that he was going to get a commission and get it soon.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Did you know?

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
Quite frankly, I didn't give it as much thought as far as the commission was concerned.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I knew he had applied for reserve commission.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
That's about the size of it.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Well, in any event when you learned the fact he was not going to get it,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
it meant that there had to be some change in your plans

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
and it was an important event for you or not.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
It wasn't an important event, but I did give it consideration.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
This man was important to the staff of this committee, was he not?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Yes, he was.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
And a change in his military status to you as a director must have been an important event.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Is that right?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
It was worth considering and I did consider it.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, I don't want to push you too far, but it was worth a considerable amount of consideration.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
I gave it a considerable amount of consideration.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
You did?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
That's right.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Don't you consider it a rather singular event, Mr. Cod,

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
that you did not mention that fact in your memorandum of October 2nd?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
What fact is that, sir?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
That shine was not going to get a commission?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
No.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Well, it was an important thing, you said.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I don't think it was that important.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
Well, you mentioned a lot of things in that memorandum, but you did not mention this fact, did you?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
That's correct. I might have looked it out. I might have put it in.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, as a matter of fact, your memorandum of October 2nd is slightly inconsistent with that fact.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
It is not, Mr. Cod.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I don't think so. I didn't.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
Well, I call your attention, sir, to the 2nd paragraph of it in the 4th line.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
Let me read to that sentence to begin on the 3rd line of the 2nd paragraph.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
During the course of the conversation, Dave shines pending induction.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
And I emphasize the words, pending induction into the army came up.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Have I read that sentence correctly?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
That's correct.

08:44.000 --> 08:52.000
Now, if his induction was pending on October 2nd, that is inconsistent with the fact that you testified to,

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
that you thought he was going to get a commission until the secretary told you otherwise.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
Yes, but I didn't write this memorandum until I talked to the secretary.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
Yes, but you're referring to a conversation concerning a pending induction.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Now you testified that the conversation was not concerning a pending induction,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
but was concerning the fact he was not going to get a commission.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
No, no, I haven't testified.

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
You say, as if I testified only to that fact, I testified also to the fact that the secretary said,

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
as I said, my memorandum, that he intended to use Mr. Shine to the advantage of the army

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
by sending him to intelligent schools.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
That is certainly true, but let's get back to the fact that you testified, sir,

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
that the secretary told you on October 2nd.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
That Shine was not signed to get a commission.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
That's my recollection.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
In the first place, you make no mention of that fact in this memorandum, do you?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
No.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Even though you considered it some important.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I considered it some important.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
I don't consider it so much important that I had to put it in the memorandum.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
I'll go think to the left out of the memorandum, too.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
And also, in view of the fact that you stayed in the memorandum,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
the conversation was concerning a pending induction.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Now if I refresh your recollection to some extent, Mr. Chai,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
that perhaps you're mistaken about the conversation of the secretary and the commission?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
No, I'm not mistaken.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
You're not mistaken.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
No.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
So that you stayed now that the secretary brought it up by informing you

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
that Shine was not going to get a commission?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
No, he didn't bring it up by informing me.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
He brought up the subject of Shine, and he was the first one that,

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
that in my recollection of during this conversation,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
said that Shine wasn't going to get a commission.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Well, now you say he did not bring it up by stating that Shine wasn't going to get a commission?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
No, sir.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
No, sir.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
No, sir.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, let me ask you this.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
There was some discussion beyond that point, right?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Beyond the point of the commission?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yes.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yes, sir.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
And you said, I, in substance, I believe, that Mr. Column indicated his ascent

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
to what you claim the secretary had outlined for this private.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
This intelligent school arrangement and that sort of thing?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Yes, I think Mr. Column said, let's find something more.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Did Mr. Column put it any stronger than just agreement,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
or did he try to urge it on the secretary?

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
So as I recall, I was the secretary's statement.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
The secretary is the one that mentioned the school, not Mr. Column.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
But Mr. Column indicated his ascent, is that correct?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
He indicated that was fine.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yes.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Was it fine with you, Mr. Car?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
It didn't make any difference to me.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
It made no difference to you.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
No, sir.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
But it made some difference to Mr. Column.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't think you're great deal of difference, but he said that's fine.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
All right.

11:58.000 --> 12:08.000
Now, I think it testified yesterday that as early as October the 8th or October the 9th,

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
John Adams indicated to you that he thought maybe the committee ought to call off their hearings

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
on the Fort Monmouth investigation.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Is that correct?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Well, at that point, excuse me.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
At that point, Mr. Adams indicated he thought there should be no hearings on the Fort Monmouth situation.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, I didn't know.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
He had it a little stronger than I made it then.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Well, I had it made it to you, you ought to not have any.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, we had not started having hearings at that time.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Well, when was your first hearing?

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I think the first executive hearing was on the 12th of October.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Was by significant date the last over without refresher recollections?

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
Now, the 8th of October as I testified, Mr. Adams was, and I think I'm correct on this.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
Mr. Adams was in attendance at interviews of persons who worked at Fort Monmouth staff interviews.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
The executive sessions did not start until Senator McCarthy arrived in New York,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
so that witnesses could be sworn.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
So, it's your testimony that John Adams wanted to call the executive sessions off,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
even before they started, is that right?

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Well, I don't say he wanted to call the executive sessions off.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
I say that John Adams, on the 8th or about the 8th during the period of these staff interviews,

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
suggested that there was no need for having any hearings at all.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, that was before they had even started, was it not?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
That's correct.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
So, the Summon Substance of it is that Duke testified that on Adams wanted to call him off

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
before they had even started.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
If you want to post that, why that's that would be all right.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Well, I don't want to be unfair with you, but it's a fact.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
That won't hurt me, sir.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
No, that's all right.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
All right.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
The family is fair, sir.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Who had any questions?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
No questions.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
A chair will pass, and a metallion.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Questions?

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
Not a call, unless two or three more questions, I believe.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Well, that's an included yesterday.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
I believe you had agreed with me that the charge was against the second day of the arms.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
The second day of the arm and the SR Adams were quite serious.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
Yes, sir.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
Then, from your personal measure, you have already stated, and from the charges,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
to which we have referred.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
Generally, I didn't call each one specific to your attention, but you're familiar with it.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
Would you agree with me about the conduct that will secondale the army

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
and the missile add on to these charges, or should work quite improperly?

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Well, I think that we're improper, yes.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Don't you think they're quite brave?

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
If I take into account the security of our country,

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
if they were actually trying to protect as charged, those who were

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
both texting commoners in our government and in the army, wouldn't you say they're quite brave?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yes, sir.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
I don't think it's my position to pass on such matters, but I agree with you, they're serious and great.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
And they should have been exposed if that was true.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I would be happy to have them exposed, yes.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
Would they have been exposed in your judgment had not those chronological reports

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
of the army had been published?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I think they would.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
How long you think would he have gotten to it?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I really don't know, but I think it would have come about.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
At any rate, the issue of the chronological statement of events

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
did bring about the exposure of this conflict, didn't it?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Yes, sir.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
So, would it accomplish some good if these charges were true?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Yes, sir.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
That's the way of putting it, yes.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
That's the way it is in its proper perspective, if your charges are true,

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
the actions of that report immediately caused the response.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
That called the attention of the country, a condition in the defense department,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
in the department of the army.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
That certainly could not be tolerated, it's true.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Don't you agree with me?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's called it to the attention of the country, I agree with you.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
And it's a condition that came out to be tolerated.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I wouldn't want to tolerate it, no.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
That's all.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
But one other question, if I have more time, I did want to ask you about,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
have you helped staff director now?

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
You have checked the file to determine the documents that you may have in them,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
are related to Mr. Shine's work, did you?

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Well, actually, I had very little pot in it, sir.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Well, I don't know whether you can and then apply my notes,

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
but are you prepared to say that the documents that have been turned over to the council

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
are all that are in the files?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Are you prepared to say, as staff director?

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Well, I am not the one who went through the files physically.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
I have been advised by those who did that and by Mr. Shine.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
That the work which appears here is the, how do you say it?

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm raised all thanks to what Mr. Shine has been used to.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Well, all I've been trying to do is to get all of them before us.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
If I'm trying to find out who can tell us that they're all before the committee now,

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
can you, I think Mr. Cohn could probably tell you that, but I don't know.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
What's your name?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Senator Jackson, any questions?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
No questions.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Senator Jackson, any questions?

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
Mr. Cohn, I assume you formulated a file on Ford Monter.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yes, sir.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
What is the date of the first document in that file?

17:56.000 --> 18:05.000
I'm not sure, I think, at some time August, September maybe.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
The first document in the file was in August or September.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
I think that's right.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
What was the first document in that file?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I don't recall.

18:21.000 --> 18:30.000
Well, I think you indicated yesterday that there were memos and certain information that you had dictated

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
or that come to your attention that was put in the file.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, I don't recall that part of the testimony as you was.

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
As far as you know, there was nothing in the file prior to July or August then.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Well, let me say this, Senator.

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
The preliminary investigation of this case and all of the cases, I can't say all of the cases,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
but most of the cases, is a very informal thing.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
The information is gathered.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
Sometimes material is received.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
This is held as on an informal basis.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
Now, in connection with the Port Mama investigation, it's my recollection.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
It's only a recollection after these months that one, the investigation was well underway.

19:21.000 --> 19:34.000
Much of this material, which had been in the office, in the possession of the individual working on the case, was assembled into a file.

19:34.000 --> 19:42.000
Yes, but I think that you just testified that the first memos, or a number and other, went into the file with July or August.

19:43.000 --> 19:57.000
I'm only testifying that as I recall, the first memorandum is dated sometime, if I'm during that period yet.

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
And prior to that time, you don't know of any work that was done on the Port Mama investigation.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Yes, sir. I know of work.

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
As I said, I don't know. I believe that's the first date of the memorandum.

20:13.000 --> 20:20.000
Well, actually, Mr. Carr, the work didn't get underway.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
Full speech, or we say to August, did it?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I would say, yes, August.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
That was about the time when you found out that Mr. Shine was going to go into the Army.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
That was about the time when I got busy on this case.

20:38.000 --> 20:49.000
Well, but had there really, you took over the Port Mama investigation, had there really been any work done as far as actual investigation at Port Mama?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
There had been preliminary work done, so there had been...

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
What time?

20:52.000 --> 20:59.000
There had been informants developed, and there had been information obtained concerning the situation at Port Mama.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
Well, but actually, there hadn't been any specific legwork done on Port Mama.

21:04.000 --> 21:13.000
The large amount of legwork began during that period, I would say, August of come by, yes.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
But prior to that, you had the cross-document?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
We had the cross-document, yes.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
I don't put too much stress on the cross-document as such.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
But as a matter of fact, that's a pretty general statement.

21:26.000 --> 21:32.000
It's a general statement. I think it's a very good statement concerning a communist infiltration.

21:32.000 --> 21:48.000
But as an FBI agent, you were pretty well framed in the fact that there's well known that the communists would try to infiltrate halftime for years to infiltrate the military establishment, whether it's the Army, the Navy, the Air Force.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
Yes, so I was aware that I don't wish to overrate or underrate the cross-document or random.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
The fact that there are the statements in there are undoubtedly accurate.

22:01.000 --> 22:13.000
You know what I can't wait here. To me, the procurement of the system is more of a signal than an important in itself.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Well, he said there were a thousand communists in the Army.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
He didn't back up that statement with any specific bill of particular city.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
So I didn't place that sort of stress on the cross-document.

22:27.000 --> 22:35.000
As a matter of fact, the selective service act makes no prohibition against the drafting of communists into the armed services.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
That's right.

22:36.000 --> 22:45.000
So it's obvious that there's bound to be a certain number of communists in uniform, and particularly in the enlisted reign.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
The follow's logic, right, that your bound to get sound, is that right?

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
That's correct. So you come to the inevitable conclusion that there must be some in uniform.

22:54.000 --> 23:01.000
Yes, but I agree with you. But at some point, if you're going to give an investigation some serious consideration,

23:01.000 --> 23:10.000
at some point something has to be brought to your attention. I think the cross from a random in this case served as a means of bringing it to our attention.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
I don't say that I agreed with him and the memorandum that there were.

23:15.000 --> 23:28.000
Mr. Carr, you wouldn't want to leave the impression that what your long experience in the FBI that you need to have someone like Krauts explain to you that there might be communist infiltration in the Army.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
You knew that as an FBI agent.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
That's correct. I didn't need to memorandum.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I say say the memorandum.

23:35.000 --> 23:42.000
The Krauts document didn't refresh your recollection or give you any new information that you didn't already have.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
I don't know. I couldn't agree fully with your statement. I'm agreeing with what you're talking about.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
There's some of your language that...

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
Can you point out anything in the cross documents that you didn't know about before?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Well, no, I don't want to do that.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
All right. Well, we won't.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
Going to any further detail about that. When did you first see the two-and-a-quarter page FBI document?

24:06.000 --> 24:21.000
I believe that I first saw the two-and-a-quarter page document in this courtroom or just before that.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
The day that Mr. McCoffee handed it out here.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Attempted to have the chair read it.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
You've never seen it before.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I've never seen it. I knew about it, however.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I was never in the file.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Never in the file downstairs.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Well, how could you conduct this investigation? You're the staff director.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
And if you hadn't seen it until the day that you came in, how could you conduct this investigation without having seen that document?

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
I didn't have to see the document. I knew it was in it.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
You were told everything that was in it, but it wouldn't let you see it?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
No. It was a pretty hot document, then.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
No, I don't... I don't... I'm subscribed to that.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
There was no need for me to keep the document or to see the document.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
I was told what was in it. I was given the list of the persons who were in it.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
I had all the information contained in the document. I had no need for keeping the document.

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, Mr. Carr, isn't it quite unusual that you as staff director of the committee would not have access to this document and see it?

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Yet it would be offered here an evidence to the public.

25:26.000 --> 25:37.000
Well, I don't think it's unusual. I think it would be quite unusual if I was told by the chairman of the committee information.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
And I insisted that I had the document to back up what he was telling me.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
Yes, but wasn't it the heart of the whole investigation report month?

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
It was an important part of the investigation, yes.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
Well, at pinpoint of the key individual there in Coleman did that, yes?

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
Well, wouldn't you... did you have any reason why you didn't want to look at the document?

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
No, I didn't have any. I would look at it.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
I looked at it here. You want? I looked at it here.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
In the courtroom.

26:07.000 --> 26:18.000
Yes, but you hadn't looked at it up until that time, although you were in charge of the entire investigation that Fort Monmouth directing the staff work.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
No, the day that it came down here, I think it's the first time I...

26:22.000 --> 26:32.000
I say, but that's the first time you looked at it, even though you had directed the staff investigation of the Fort Monmouth hearings and investigations.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Yes, I think that's correct.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
That's all.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
And if I...

26:37.000 --> 26:50.000
Mr. Chairman, I've concluded my examination, Mr. Carr, however I would like to announce that I'm chairman of the Communications Subcommittee of the Interstate Reform Commerce Committee.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
And you have hearings which are both phone three times that are most important hearings.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
And the hearings on the future of television.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
And I both phone Monmouth until... until this afternoon.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
And so I want to ask the big excuse for the afternoon seconds, so that we can go ahead with the hearings.

27:12.000 --> 27:19.000
I've seen a little different to tap hearing development television rather than hearings beyond television.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Very good.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I'm going to go ahead.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm going to go ahead with the roll of the press.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Mr. Warden, gentlemen.

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
The filter of the car of the investigation was discussing the coach documents.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
The coach documents, the very call.

27:41.000 --> 27:48.000
Here's the fairly good resume of the attempt of the Communist Party to open so better army as I...

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
Yes, sir. I think it's a good document.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Yes, it's good to have him.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Having worked with the FBI and...

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
It's not our communism for a number of years having been head of the subversive debt, whatever you call it.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
I call it...

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
You didn't hear anything, Majesty.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I just didn't hear.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
You wouldn't need any resume by Mr. Couch.

28:12.000 --> 28:19.000
You had followed information that you gathered over a number of years, I assume.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
That's right.

28:23.000 --> 28:32.000
Well, sir, it's sometimes, since I've actually read the crotch document over, but I think that I can generally agree with you.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
I want to hand you a...

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
Documentary, if you can follow that, to say, memographs.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
To shoot the paper.

28:45.000 --> 28:52.000
Blancing through that, Mr. Farty, a fine glass.

28:52.000 --> 29:03.000
The Communist International, various communist meetings, communist writers, daily workers, have over the past,

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
old, 20, 25, 30 years.

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
Reaffirm that one of their principal targets was the army of every free nation.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Yes, sir.

29:16.000 --> 29:28.000
So that when you came to the committee, you didn't need anyone in the visual to tell you that the military would be a target for the Communist Party.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
No, sir.

29:31.000 --> 29:42.000
Mr. Couch, abstract that as of now, we are always going to go ahead of hearings.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
Hearing of the which...

29:46.000 --> 29:57.000
The Committee of Mr. Couch, a moderate chairman, having to do with the holding of prisoners of war, by the red, some of them even some World War I.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
Yes, I think that we'll be ready, on the partisan writing.

30:02.000 --> 30:10.000
And we've been discussing, well, there enough, this investigation was holding up the investigation of communism.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
Is it true that we've got a tremendous backlog of work now?

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
Great numbers, communists, and defense plans.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Yes, sir, we have knowledge and such.

30:21.000 --> 30:40.000
And instead of investigating communists now, as a result of this investigation, we're spending the time and the very limited funds which we have to investigate, in the fact you, Mr. Couch, myself.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Yes, sir.

30:43.000 --> 31:00.000
The appeal, Mr. Couch, that this calling off of the investigation of communists in canedistries in the military is a great victory for the Communist Party.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Yes, sir, I think it is.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
This one or the rest of it.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
When you came with my Committee, Mr. Couch, did I...?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Yes, sir.
