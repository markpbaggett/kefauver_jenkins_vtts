WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
We'll never be tight-bombed proper conduct in the book.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
And I told you I was one of the penalties of working with my committee.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Yes, I did.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Despite that, you said you were going to...

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
...could have a very good job with you out of the FBI.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
The job had a security desk, I believe you called, in New York,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
and come down and work with my committee, is that right?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Yes, sir, I did.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
But, uh, in terms of the car, I say that I...

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
...feel very strongly.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
I think, ma'am, I've indicated it last night,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
that I must protect the...

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
...young man who come with my committee to do a job of exposing communists.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
I feel very strongly about the smear, the level against them.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Sometimes, not by the communists party,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
but sometimes by the communists party using...

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
...mega-phones, unknowing mega-phones, by my side.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
A man who don't realize what they are doing.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
And I just want to, again, assure you and assure Mr. Cohn...

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
...the rest of my committee, that whenever any of these smear, they're attempted.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
As you can be sure that I will do everything I can to...

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
...try and give the American people the truth.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
And I think that something hasn't been accomplished by this...

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
...he's hearing from the figure.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
I...

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
...will further question Mr. Chairman.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Mr. Wohl, Mr. Cohn, you have ten minutes.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Ten minutes.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Mr. Cohn, the clear is not through that...

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
...Mr. Cohn, here you are.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
You, uh, clouds, do what you like to bomb these.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Try again, Mr. Wohl, maybe.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I'll stop right here.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Take up.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Mr. Wohl, here you are.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Mr. Cohn, I was about to say to you, sir, that this fair...

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
...will continue to conduct a portion of this...

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
...with this cross-examination, but with an...

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
...interruption from me on a small point at this time.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
First, I'm...

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
...between you and William.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
That's right.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Uh...

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Mr. Carr, first as to your joining this committee...

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
...when you came from the New York desk.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
You know, I take it that you looked on it as an advancement...

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
...did you not, sir?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Yes, I looked on it as a...

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
...somewhat of an advancement.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Uh, although looking back on it, I'm not sure.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Well, uh...

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
...in any event, and I have no slightest criticism of you, sir.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
You looked on it as a step forward in your career.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Yes, sir, I looked on it as an interesting...

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
...challenge. I was interested in it.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Right.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
One other item, uh, we have often heard about the limited...

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
...appropriation that you have.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Would you know the amount of it, sir, for this year?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Yes, sir. It varies from year to year.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
This year, I think it's approximately 214,000 dollars.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Pretty close to a quarter of a million dollars.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Yes.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
And it was, well, a senator asked for it, was it not?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
From Congress.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Uh...

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Yes, sir. I think during the period...

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
...there was some debate back and forth, but I think it's generally what was asked for, yes sir.

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
Now, what I really wanted to ask you about, Mr. Carr, was this two-and-a-quarter page document.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
And I was somewhat surprised to learn that you first saw it in this courtroom.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
You told us that, is it?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I said that, uh...

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I believe it was in this courtroom.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I have a recollection that it was on the days that it was shown in this courtroom.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
I may have brought it down from the senator's office.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I'm not sure.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I know, I'm sorry.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yes, sir. For the first time.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
You also told us, of course, that you knew about it.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Yes, sir.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And that you were told what was in it.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes, sir.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
And that you had all the information that was in it.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I think that's correct, sir.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
How did you get that information, Mr. Carr?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
How was it related to me?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yes.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Uh...

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
At first, I believe, it was related to me in a general conversation, uh...

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
with Senator McCarthy and Mr. Cohn.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yes.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Later, I think that, uh...

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
in a conversation with our conference, you might probably call it,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
with Senator McCarthy.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Uh...

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
He told me in detail what was in it.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
And, uh...

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
As I recall, I made a list of the names in pencil.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Now, when they were talking to you about it,

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
did you realize that it purported to be a confidential document of the FBI?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Uh...

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
No, sir. I did.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Was that concealed from you?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
No, sir.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Uh...

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
When...

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
To answer your question, when I...

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
When we first talked about it, uh...

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
It was told to me that this was a document which...

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
uh...

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
Substantuated the statements made by an informant within the Army.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Well, I didn't quite ask you that.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Did you learn that it had at the top of a confidential?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Uh...

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
I'm not sure that I did.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I may have.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Was that...

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I'd like to know whether you were told that or were not told that.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Uh...

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
At this point, I can't say what there was or I wasn't.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
It would have been pressed.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
You had you heard it, would it not?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
No, not particularly.

06:07.000 --> 06:15.000
Not as an old FBI man, if you saw it as a letter purporting to be signed by J. Edgar Hoover and Mark's at the top confidential,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
you'd say you wouldn't have been impressed by it.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Well, I've seen many such letters, sir.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
In your files?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
No, sir.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
In my...

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
In my day.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Oh, when you were in the FBI?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yes, sir.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
But Mr. Carr, you're out of the FBI.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Now you know.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yes.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Have you seen many of them since you got out?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
No, sir.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Never even saw this one until this courtroom.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
That's right.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
And now once again, remembering that you are not now on the FBI or remember the FBI,

06:44.000 --> 06:55.000
had you known that that document, the two-in-a-quarter page document was reported to Carrie J. Edgar Hoover signature and was marked at the top confidential?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Was that of impressed you?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Uh...

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't think it would have impressed me, particularly, no, sir.

07:05.000 --> 07:12.000
You just wouldn't have been impressed, is that right?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Well, I'm not sure what you mean by impressed.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Well, I'd say that it wouldn't have particularly impressed me.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
No, sir.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Suppose I were to produce a document like that now.

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
For pointing to Carrie J. Edgar Hoover signature and marked at the top confidential, would you have been amazed to find it in my position?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
No, sir.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I wouldn't have thought.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
Well, then you think confidential documents, reporting to Carrie Hoover signature or bouncing around Washington by the dozen?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
No, sir.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
This is the only one you ever heard of bouncing around, is it not?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
No, sir.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
If you produced one, sir, I would say that it was one that was directed to the Army.

07:50.000 --> 08:00.000
Were you in the courtroom when we heard from the messenger to J. Edgar Hoover, who said it should not have been made public or transmitted to anyone?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
I was in the courtroom. I don't recall that he said that.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Mr. Murr, what's the right messenger to J. Edgar Hoover did not say that?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Well, did Mr. Brown know?

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Were you in the courtroom when Mr. Brown said he could not be disclosed to anyone?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I think I was.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Now, what happened is I understand it.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
It's... it... strike it out.

08:23.000 --> 08:33.000
When you... when Mr. Carr or when Mr. Extra strike it out, when the senator and Mr. Cohen talk to you about it, did they have some documents in front of them?

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
As I recall, when they first talked to me about it, they didn't.

08:42.000 --> 08:50.000
I think when I talked with Senator McCarthy about it, I think he may have.

08:50.000 --> 09:00.000
I know he told me in detail what the document contained that I can't, at this point, say that he did or he didn't.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
He very well did they have?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Did they tell you, sir, that they didn't want to give you a copy of it?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh, no, sir.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Did you get the impression they were being very careful about it?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh, no, sir. I could have had a copy of what I suppose, if I wanted to.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Then I think we understand each other.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
If you, on the first time you heard about it, had said, may I have a copy of it, but you could have had it.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
I have no reason to believe that the senator wouldn't trust me with a car.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
And then you... you could have put that in the files of your committee.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
I probably could have... I didn't, yes.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Now, what did you do strike that out?

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
Did they give you... did either, Mr. Cohen or the senator give you a typewritten list of the names that were in the document?

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
No. Did they read them to you and you wrote them down?

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
As I recall, the senator...

09:52.000 --> 09:59.000
I don't know whether you'd say he read them or perhaps he knew them all by heart.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't know, but I copied down a list of names, yes sir.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
In long hands? Yes.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
And that list of names become the basis of the fort-moment of investigation as you suggested to the senator?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
No sir. When you used them did you not?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Yes sir, we looked into this list of names.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
And... and examined a portion at least of the men who were named in it?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yes sir.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
How many of the men who were named in it did you examine these or an executive?

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
If not strike that out. How many of the men whose names were listed in it?

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Did you examine in any form, whatever?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I couldn't say exactly, but I would say a good portion of them.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
A good portion of them.

10:39.000 --> 10:50.000
Then isn't it a factor that the fort-moment of investigation was substantially based on the names that you got out of the two and a quarter-page document?

10:50.000 --> 11:00.000
That was one of the main sources for the beginning of the investigation, yes sir.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
There were other things.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
But that was read in the base for it. That was not really the base for it. That was one of several things.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Well, but the point is you took those names and started with those.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Well we had those names and we had some other names.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
I understand. But as you question the people whose names you have, they in turn turned up other names for you.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Yes sir, but what I'm trying to say is that the time that we had these names,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
we had information concerning other situations at fort-moment.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
But did you have the names of other witnesses?

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
We had the names of, as I recall, a few other witnesses.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
We had also other informants concerning fort-moment.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
By the way, do you have your own personal list of informants?

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
No sir, I have no list. You have no list of informants that come to you with material.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
No sir, no list.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Whose names you protect?

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Does Mr. Conde your knowledge have a list of informants?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't know what Mr. Conde has in every time.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And the answer is you don't know.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I don't know.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
The senator, of course, you do know, has got to list.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
No, I don't know the he has to list.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Well, you understand or you're not, that he has informants whose names he will protect?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Yes sir, and I have them so.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Well, that's what I'm asking about. Do you have your own list sir?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Well, I have no list sir.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Well, I don't mean a list.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
Is there a collection of informants who report to you rather than to anyone else?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
No, there is no collection.

12:34.000 --> 12:43.000
There is no, there are no such group of informants that come steadily to me.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
I have people who tell me things.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
The senator, I'm sure, has people who tell him things.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Mr. Conde does, and I'm sure you do.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
I don't intend to ever reveal the person's name to tell me things in confidence.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm sure you won't. I'm sure the senator won't.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
You can't be surprised about that.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
You think it's good?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Charyl pass under McCollum?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Well, they're going around, and while we have the opportunity, let's return to it.

13:09.000 --> 13:19.000
Mr. Carr, you agree with me that these hearings have also investigated the Army as well as you and Mr. Conde and Senator McCartney, don't you?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Yes, sir, the sum extent I think they have.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You mean slightly.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Ah, sir.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm in agreement with you, Senator.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
Have a man I have to address his heart, or I'd ask questions against the Army as I have anyone else?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Yes, sir, I think you've been fast.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yes, sir.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
But I have to do one other thing, let's still be fast.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
Don't you think that it's just as important to get out of the head of the Army?

13:46.000 --> 13:54.000
Those who are cobbling and protecting commoners, it is to get them out of the individual commoners out of defense plans.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
Yes, sir. That's one of the basis for perhaps the trouble here.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
We want it to happen.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Well, it may be the whole trouble.

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
Maybe the whole trouble, but what I'm going to get at it and it's happened, going to get at it, is the truth of the charges on each side.

14:11.000 --> 14:18.000
And do you agree with me that if your charges are true, that this committee can hardly be engaged in more important work?

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
Then try and establish the fact that it takes for them to have immediate action according to.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Well, I think that I'm in pretty general agreement with you, yes, sir.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Well, I think you are, too.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Then I have to do one other thing, and I'm through.

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
And speaking of smears, is it not all so true from your observation and experience with senators who do their duty?

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
And connection with investigations like this also gets smeared.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Yes, sir. I think anybody who comes to Washington, I can a good chance.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
All right, wait for it.

14:51.000 --> 15:08.000
You and I, you and I, you know, in agreement with respect to the seriousness of the charges and also that you get exposed to smears if you do your duty.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Always can happen, yes.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
What has happened, does not only come, but does.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Thank you.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
That's right, I just can't not have to.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
One, or perhaps two questions.

15:22.000 --> 15:31.000
Mr. Carl, I've heard that expression quote, coddling communist and quote, number of occasions in the hearings.

15:31.000 --> 15:46.000
Drawing on recollection, do you recall that that expression appears in the answer in charges made by Senator McCarthy for himself and Mr. Coleman, you.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
I don't know.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I could not phrase being used.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
No, sir.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
I could not find it in the answer and in the county charge.

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
And I wondered whether I had overlooked it or whether you knew whether it was there or not.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
I don't recall that phrase being used in the statement.

16:11.000 --> 16:23.000
And one other observation rather than a question, it's first to me that the language used was that there has been growth, mischambling of the communications.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Is that correct?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yes.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
That, of course, would be something different, I think, from the expression quote, coddling communist and quote.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Yes, that's all, Mr. Jim.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
Senator Jackson, Mr. Carl, maybe you would say that I'll have New York?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
No, no comment, sir.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
You're taking no amendments on that.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Do you feel anybody on this committee has feared you?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
On this committee here, sir?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Yes, no, sir.

16:59.000 --> 17:12.000
Some of us on this side of them in these hearings have been given some smeared publicity as a matter of fact, so that it isn't all just a one-way affair, is it?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I don't know about that, sir.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I have never given any publicity, made any statement.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I'm not saying you.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I'm not referring to you.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
And I might say that you have never done anything to make it.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It's all.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Senator Potter?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
I have a question.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Senator Simon?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
All right.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Senator Boych, I have a question.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It's all in some of the questions.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Yes.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm going to have to go question.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Mr. Wells, I have a question.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Mr. Carl?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Yes, sir.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Mr. Carl?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Yes, sir.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Mr. Carl, I have a question.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I have a question.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
You're about your list.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
There's one question, Mr. Wells, I would like to ask the next, just one.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Mr. Wells, I have a question.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Mr. Carl, I'm glad to hear this up this morning.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I'm not sure.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
I'm saying 6691.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
I notice you say as I think Senator McCarthy has testified, you bring the FBI.

18:21.000 --> 18:30.000
They have advised us in time to time that they had no drug affiliates for making concerning members of the staff.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Am I correct that you were testifying us to...

18:34.000 --> 18:42.000
...one I told you and that the FBI has given no direct reports to any member of the staff including yourself.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
No, the reports come through the chairman, yes.

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
And any reports that come directly to me are confidential for my use on it.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Yes, sir, that's my understanding.

18:53.000 --> 19:01.000
And I think we should also make clear that these reports do not have to do with investigation.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
These reports have to do with the members of the staff, is that right?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Yes, that's my understanding.

19:07.000 --> 19:18.000
And as far as you know, neither I nor any member of the staff has ever gotten any report of any kind directly from the FBI.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Is that right?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yes, sir.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
And these are using the word reports.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm thinking of a letter in which they say they had...

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
...it's a name check letter.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Yes.

19:30.000 --> 19:39.000
Now, when you say that there is a report of all employees you are relying upon when I told you.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Yes, sir.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
No further questions.

19:43.000 --> 19:53.000
Mr. Carr, I was asking you to just close the My Ten Minute Period about your little group of informers if you have one.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
And I think perhaps we were misunderstanding each other.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Yes.

19:57.000 --> 20:09.000
Because as Justice My Period ended, I think you were saying that you have some people who give you information in respect to the activities of government employees.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yes, sir.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Sometimes it's fine, yes.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Sir, sometimes it's fine, yes.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yes.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
And those men, you protect them as to their names.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yes.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
And I take it, Mr. Cohen, has his list of informers.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I don't know about Mr. Cohen, sir.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
All right.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Do you have no information, Mr. Weather?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
No, he has.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I think he has, but I can't say.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Do you understand that Mr. Shiner also had a list, perhaps a smaller one?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Uh, my understanding has, yes.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Yes, he had one.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Yes.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And of course we know the senator has one.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yes.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
Now Mr. Carr, to turn to another subject for a moment.

20:49.000 --> 21:06.000
And speaking of communists, the one group of people are the one arm of this government that has literally bought communism with blood and with steel.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Is the army in Korea, isn't it?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yes, sir.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
There's no doubt about all of us being proud of us.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Act on the part of our arms, not in the laces.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
And of course nobody could think that was coddling communists.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
But no, sir.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
And isn't it just incredible to you, Mr. Carr?

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
Just simply incredible to you that anybody in the army should actually coddle communists.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It would be incredible.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yes, it is.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It's a week and a grey on that one.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
And you don't want to sit in that chair.

21:45.000 --> 21:53.000
And have anybody in this country think for a moment that you believe the United States Army coddles communists do you?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
I don't think the United States Army coddles communists.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
I would like to complete it, though, sir.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Well, would you like to qualify now?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I don't want to qualify.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
Wouldn't you rather just have it simply that way?

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
No, I'd rather have it said my way if you don't mind.

22:11.000 --> 22:21.000
Well, I'll let you say it your way provided you say it nicely, sir, to the effect of the United States Army does not coddle communists.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
Is that what you'd like to tell us in your own words?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
No, not exactly.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
That I'm in agreement with you, Mr. Wallace.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Well, as you are, Kathleen, move along.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
No, well, I think he kind of works a lot of the qualifications on this.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
And I don't think he ought to really want to finish it.

22:38.000 --> 22:46.000
Well, you left him in the car, but you want to add something to what seemed to be so clear and so cranked and so nice.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
No, sir.

22:48.000 --> 22:57.000
I would just like to say that I don't think that at this time the Army is coddling communists.

22:57.000 --> 23:04.000
I think that the Army has gone to a great extent.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
I shouldn't say the Army, I apologize for saying that.

23:07.000 --> 23:17.000
I think that Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams went to great limits to prevent the exposure of persons who had cleared communists.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't say that that's a silly coddling communist.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
No, what you're talking about there and for a loyalty board, these are the right.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
That's correct.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
And you know perfectly well, by the way you told us you went to law school.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Yes.

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
And you know perfectly well there's a very grave legal issue involved right at that point, don't you?

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
I don't... I'm not sure that I follow you on that.

23:43.000 --> 23:53.000
Well, you have heard Mr. Cohen in me discuss the proposition as to whether or not your committee may legally call members of the loyalty board and put them on the...

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
Staying and saying, how come you decided this way in this case?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
You heard that discussion haven't you?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Yes, sir.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
And don't you know as an investigator and a lawyer that that prevents grave, presents grave legal problems?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Yes, sir.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
There are two arguments for this, sir.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Thank you for that.

24:12.000 --> 24:21.000
And I understand and patriotic men can have Mr. Cohen's view that you ought to be able to summon him in question that Dickens ought to.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
That's right, isn't it?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Yes, sir.

24:23.000 --> 24:35.000
And I understand patriotic men can have, let's say, the Welsh view that it's pretty awkward to call up the judge and say, how come you decided the case the way you did.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Right.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
You think you can have that view, sir?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Yes, sir.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
And that's a proper and a patriotic view, isn't it?

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
Well, I just... I can't say patriotic or proper.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
I know nothing un-p patriotic about your view of persons that hold us view.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
I didn't think that it's not the view that I would hold.

24:56.000 --> 25:04.000
I think that any government employee is responsible for what he does, just as I'm responsible in sitting here.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Understand me, Mr. Cohen. I'm not saying I'm right. You understand.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
I'm just saying it's perfectly possible to have that legal view.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
All right, thank you, sir.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
And you must see yourself that it's a little awkward for these people who sit on the loyally boards.

25:19.000 --> 25:32.000
If they're going to decide questions fairly, it's a little awkward for them to have to bear in mind all the time that after they decide the case, maybe they'll be hauled up, put under oath, and question just how they reach their decision.

25:32.000 --> 25:42.000
Well, it may be a little awkward, but I can't say that if they're doing their job and if they do it right, why they should worry about it.

25:42.000 --> 25:49.000
Well, in any event, I want you to make it clear that the only point that puts your committee and the army came into collation.

25:49.000 --> 25:55.000
Real collation was on the point of whether the members of the loyally board were going to be produced in the government.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
Well, there was one other thing that seemed to...

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Well, there may have been some other things.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
There wasn't that, where the other thing was the Perez case.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Well, that's another matter.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
The real collation came about the loyally boards, didn't it?

26:10.000 --> 26:19.000
That was when... yes, the collation came there, and it came over the Perez case.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
Well, there was a laugh about the Zwicker matter.

26:24.000 --> 26:31.000
It was a combination, yeah, just a real thing where Adam stood pat and said, you're not going to do it.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Was that the point where he wanted the loyally board members?

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
You wanted the loyally board members, and he said no.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
That's what he said, yes.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
Now, Mr. Car...

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
You wanted to take a minute to get your mind reoriented, perfectly alright.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Alright, fine.

26:56.000 --> 27:07.000
We were discussing the attempts that you say to Mr. Adam and Mr. Stevens made to get you to call off the Floor of Longland Period.

27:07.000 --> 27:16.000
And you suggested, I think, that the first animation came from Mr. Adam, as early as the bounce August, October the 9th.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
That's correct.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
To my knowledge.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Yes, to your knowledge.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
And that's what I'm asking you about.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
Now, on October the 21st, there was another occasion I think you told us about.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
That's the night you went to the Price Fight, remember?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Alright.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yes, sir.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
Is the denolated you paid for your ticket, Mr. Caron?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
No, I was a guest for Mr. Collins.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Did he ever ask you to pay for it?

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
No, sir, and I never offered to pay for it.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
But it all was a rather expensive flight, isn't it?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I said it was a championship flight.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
Rather, I'd get tickets for the first flight, sir.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
No problem with it.

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
Now, on that occasion, there was a party of four, was there not at some time?

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Yes.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Who was the fourth member?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
A friend of mine.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
Is there some reason why you don't want to say his name? It's perfectly alright.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't think I let you exercise that up.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
I don't think it adds to this hearing.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Well, if Mayor may not, was he with you part of the evening?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yes, sir.

28:24.000 --> 28:34.000
He was with us during the fight, and I think afterwards we went to a restaurant and had something to eat, and I think maybe a drink.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
And he was with you there.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
For a portion of the time, as I recall, he left early a few minutes.

28:44.000 --> 28:51.000
Well, now that these efforts are by Mr. Adams to get you call off the hearing stake place in his presence?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
No, sir.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
That wasn't been a rather impolite thing for Mr. Adams to do with it, no matter?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yes, sir.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Is the stranger to Mr. Adams with you, no?

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Yes, sir.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
Now, Mr. Adams, Mr. Adams was the reasonably intelligent person.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Don't you think, Mr. Carr?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Yes, sir, very much so.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
He was a fine interviewer, wasn't he?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I thought he was, yes, sir.

29:17.000 --> 29:30.000
Now, I think the next thing you testify to that I can remember, and I may skip over some of them, but I think you testified that again on December 9th.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
You had a talk with Mr. Adams.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
He, again, suggested to you that it might not be a bad idea to call this whole thing off.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Is that right?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Yes.

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
On this occasion, however, he started to use some rather frightening language, according to you, did he not?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Yes, sir.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
He started to use some, I didn't quite hear you, I'm sorry.

29:54.000 --> 30:05.000
Well, he started to use, in accordance with your testimony, sir, some rather frightening language, like blackmail and hostage, and what's there in it for us, and things like that.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
He used the latter, the last two.

30:08.000 --> 30:18.000
The last two, and I think your testimony is that the substance of his conversation consisted of what you deemed as a blackmail, is that right?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Yes, I thought it was a blackmail.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Or something equally as...
