WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.860
I will say whatever length you would like, but I have said nothing this morning of every any kind on this

00:10.860 --> 00:13.540
critical and important point to the situation.

00:13.540 --> 00:15.300
Chairman, do I have a right to answer time?

00:15.300 --> 00:17.140
I would appreciate your name.

00:17.140 --> 00:25.540
I know whether or not answer time of a crime case, that the Mr. McCarty gets through is the answer that I will be allowed to proceed before the recess.

00:25.540 --> 00:34.540
The chair of our under-sendman, and he is the president of the CIRP, I think Mr. McCarty has the point of place on television involved because thank you, Mr. Chair.

00:34.540 --> 00:40.540
The personality involved this discussion at the moment, is that he is ready to be sending McCarty under and signed on a track.

00:40.540 --> 00:46.540
The sound of the sound can get into it, I'm afraid it's going to be prolonged, but I will follow him after I conclude the send of McCarty.

00:46.540 --> 00:54.540
Mr. Chairman, as the chair knows, the Attorney General, which is a place from the other place, the effect of this...

00:56.540 --> 01:04.540
The executive has the soul of duty and right to enforce the law that is correct.

01:04.540 --> 01:15.540
So, Mac, he apparently jumped the huge gap and said that therefore the Congress could not investigate whether or not they are badly enforcing that law.

01:15.540 --> 01:22.540
But because they have the right to enforce the law on the duty, the Congress could not examine how they are enforcing it.

01:22.540 --> 01:31.540
I appointed out Mr. Chairman previously that as chairman of the Investigating Committee, I have no choice.

01:31.540 --> 01:40.540
Under reorganization act I have the duty to examine and expose any wrong-doing in the executive branch.

01:40.540 --> 01:47.540
I have pointed out that you cannot hide the wrong-doing behind a stamp of secrecy.

01:47.540 --> 01:57.540
And let's not bring Jager Hoover into this. Jager Hoover made no decision as holding up these documents to be made public, but was made by the Attorney General.

01:57.540 --> 02:02.540
Let me finish, please. I have an interrupt, Mr. Tom.

02:02.540 --> 02:19.540
I want to make it very clear that while I am chairman of the Committee, I will receive evidence of wrongdoing, wrath, corruption, racism, from any government employee who gives that to me.

02:19.540 --> 02:30.540
I feel those government employees have a high duty to do that. They all take an oath as I recall to defend this nation against all enemies born and domestic.

02:30.540 --> 02:33.540
I believe that will.

02:33.540 --> 02:41.540
The power is far above any loyalty to a superior officer who might be jailed if they give us the files.

02:41.540 --> 02:50.540
As I said before, back in 1924, we had a situation in which we were dealing with the prison with the chairman.

02:50.540 --> 02:57.540
We were dealing then with the theft of money. The nation can recover from the theft of money but not some prison.

02:57.540 --> 03:08.540
At that time, the Attorney General advised President Cooley not to allow the Congress to know what is going on instead of covering it up.

03:08.540 --> 03:14.540
The President discovered that the Attorney General was involved in fires at Attorney General.

03:14.540 --> 03:18.540
He told the Committee of Congress they could have all the information.

03:18.540 --> 03:26.540
The chairman officer could testify that they did some of those chairman officers as they were called into jail.

03:26.540 --> 03:42.540
Now, Mr. Chairman, I do have a very serious problem here. I realize that the members of the Committee, the investigating committee, should have access to every piece of information in the file.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.540
I think that should be the rule.

03:45.540 --> 03:54.540
I have told the members that they could have complete free access to all the files that the Minority Council could have accessed all the files.

03:54.540 --> 04:05.540
However, when Senator McClellan goes and as a member, as he speaks to the other members, he goes out and says there should be an investigation.

04:05.540 --> 04:23.540
I have been guilty of a term and getting information about communist interest, information Mr. Chairman, which shows that the security department of the military has been one time and time again.

04:23.540 --> 04:47.540
By a very competent FBI, the man guilty of a term, because I let the people know those facts, when I am confronted with the very serious problem of how I can do the two impossible tasks, number one, make all files, including the names of the informants available to the members of the Committee.

04:47.540 --> 04:51.540
I might say that connection I never put the names of the informants in the files.

04:51.540 --> 05:03.540
Number two, protecting the informants. I wanted to discuss that with my chief counsel today to find out whether or not the individual's name is in here gives their consent.

05:03.540 --> 05:27.540
Also, as early as possible plan, I would like to have a meeting with the not-this Committee but my investigating committee, which is, frankly, the same, the membership and determine how we can iron out this problem in the meantime and the meantime may I say, John, may I say that you will not get the name of any informants.

05:27.540 --> 05:31.540
May I say that I will not be the name of your informants.

05:31.540 --> 05:41.540
Now you get away from the issue, you face it. Where is the agent? You said you did not ask the I to be brought into the forensic records.

05:41.540 --> 05:49.540
Mr. Collier, who testified your own affair, was instructed by this committee to come tight, necessarily, by regarding the document.

05:49.540 --> 06:01.540
Here is what he reported back to this committee on the road. Upon your instructions, I communicated with the FBI, expressed my desire to talk to Mr. Hoover.

06:01.540 --> 06:17.540
In a few minutes or after Mr. Hoover called me on the telephone. He stated that the letter to General Bowling, January 26, 1951, was classified by the word confidential.

06:17.540 --> 06:25.540
He does not feel that he has any life to discuss, be classified, or to discuss its contents.

06:25.540 --> 06:31.540
That is from Mr. Hoover himself regarding the document that came in confidential here.

06:31.540 --> 06:35.540
I hold in my hand a couple of letters from the tenant General Bowling.

06:35.540 --> 06:53.540
Mr. Hoover, I dated May 13, 1954, just to the chairman of this subcommittee, an entity says, if the confidential classification of us, the I report, I never am, is not respected.

06:53.540 --> 07:01.540
She is an irreparable mom who will be done to the FBI.

07:01.540 --> 07:11.540
The copy of our meeting from a father-in-law left the chairman of the barricade, a letter of May 13, 1954, the northern one,

07:11.540 --> 07:17.540
a father-in-law, Jr. to his Mr. Hoover's boss, who's on the stand.

07:17.540 --> 07:23.540
So, if the confidential classification of us, the I report, some memories, does not respect it.

07:23.540 --> 07:32.540
She is an irreparable mom who will be done to the FBI. I have argued many times, for his Mr. Hoover.

07:32.540 --> 07:40.540
No, I don't know whether you must have suggested, but the president, because Mr. Brown, has taken this position, and Mr. Hoover takes this position.

07:40.540 --> 07:49.540
I don't know what he means when fired, if they should be fired, or something done with them, as was done with one back in 1924.

07:49.540 --> 07:53.540
May I say to you, Senator? May I say to you?

07:53.540 --> 08:00.540
I'm trying to settle a basic issue of law. I'll award any of your confidential information.

08:00.540 --> 08:09.540
All I want is left to confront and get this legal question settled so we can go, operate it in the law, if that's possible.

08:09.540 --> 08:18.540
I say it for myself, you say what you'll do and what you'll unboot. I tell you, Senator, that I will not set myself up the law, then I'll park in the law.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.540
I'll go into some form. I do the way you say.

08:21.540 --> 08:24.540
Mr. Hoover, you're coming up to the chair.

08:24.540 --> 08:36.540
I think the chair agrees to recognize Senator Simon's in next step before going so, as deciding as to Roger Dupes as the chair, he would again want to play out.

08:36.540 --> 08:40.540
But none of the discussion which is occupied is for the last 10 to 15 minutes.

08:40.540 --> 08:46.540
Has anything to do with an issue before this committee? The chair has already ruled and nobody has challenges ruling.

08:46.540 --> 08:53.540
Any of the materials produced in evidence before these hearings becomes available to all of the members of this committee and to the staff.

08:53.540 --> 08:58.540
The discussion we're having deals with, a different state is all together, a different committee.

08:58.540 --> 09:03.540
A committee headed permanently by Senator McCarthy, and the comments from the Senate investigating committee.

09:03.540 --> 09:08.540
The chair is agreed to get Senator Simon before so doing. He dismisses from the stand.

09:08.540 --> 09:10.540
So the committee goes in.

09:10.540 --> 09:13.540
The chair will be back by two o'clock.

09:13.540 --> 09:16.540
Senator Sherwin, I'm here to take the corner.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.540
Senator Simon's coming from above.

09:18.540 --> 09:21.540
Senator, that's a personal participate.

09:21.540 --> 09:24.540
For you along with the first answer, we say from the front of the phone.

09:24.540 --> 09:27.540
I yielded the union senate with council and the chair.

09:27.540 --> 09:28.540
Senator McCartney, I'm fine.

09:28.540 --> 09:33.540
From you and your age, we tell others who that box of my two o'clock, you can deliver the material which is.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.540
They selected an answer to our substitute points to be.

09:36.540 --> 09:45.540
Mr. Chairman, may I first say that I think it might be well if Mr. Cohen will stay until we get through some points that I would like to bring up with respect to these files.

09:45.540 --> 09:48.540
An off person to the matter that we're now discussing. I'll be very happy.

09:48.540 --> 09:49.540
Hello, thank you.

09:49.540 --> 09:50.540
Thank you.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.540
I'm Senator Sunford from Mark and so.

09:52.540 --> 09:59.540
And it deserves to be greatly to give you an argument here with the ranking Democrats member of my nut-be-getting committee.

09:59.540 --> 10:02.540
I spoke with Dr. Longbury well for quite a few years now.

10:02.540 --> 10:09.540
While the thunder was chairman, when I was ranked in Republican members, I was on the Chuck T right of time this summer.

10:10.540 --> 10:20.540
The senator has quoted to one of Brown now that he says that you can't be classified in the public and the FBI.

10:20.540 --> 10:23.540
Well, there's something about a question I'll recall a length.

10:23.540 --> 10:29.540
I would like to call the senator's attention to the facts that from Mr. Brown now made a speech out in Chicago,

10:30.540 --> 10:37.540
claiming a did spy and then when he was criticized and accused of not telling the truth, the truth of lying,

10:37.540 --> 10:41.540
he made the file of the public.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.540
The secret file, he declassified.

10:44.540 --> 10:48.540
And I don't put a sign for doing that.

10:48.540 --> 10:52.540
I think those files were made public long before that. He didn't give them any informants.

10:53.540 --> 11:02.540
Now, my position is that if a Attorney General can declassify a document to expose a dead spy,

11:02.540 --> 11:06.540
then he should declassify the document to expose living spies.

11:06.540 --> 11:10.540
The message of the senator, I know we've got a very naughty problem here,

11:10.540 --> 11:15.540
if we can talk about violating the law, setting yourself above the law,

11:15.540 --> 11:19.540
there's no law that prevents our getting this information.

11:20.540 --> 11:24.540
So they're going to me say this. If there's presidential directions,

11:24.540 --> 11:28.540
one I think mistakenly may, one way may.

11:28.540 --> 11:33.540
I don't think this kind of risk is bound by any presidential directive of secrecy.

11:33.540 --> 11:39.540
When Truman, uh, Logan's blackout order in 1948,

11:39.540 --> 11:42.540
which protects the other Algiers, Hissons, and the government,

11:42.540 --> 11:45.540
I thought he was making a serious error.

11:46.540 --> 11:50.540
When President Eisenhower, whom I respect, great place,

11:50.540 --> 11:56.540
uh, had his pictures of the order which went far beyond the Truman order,

11:56.540 --> 12:00.540
I thought he was making a video there and I thought he was not quite on the billet.

12:00.540 --> 12:03.540
May I say Senator, just for your benefit,

12:03.540 --> 12:06.540
I am not setting myself above any law.

12:06.540 --> 12:12.540
I think I have an oath as a senator, an oath as the chairman of an investigating committee.

12:13.540 --> 12:17.540
That will lengthen to me to get information of wrongdoing in government.

12:17.540 --> 12:21.540
I feel that there's no vow of direction of any kind,

12:21.540 --> 12:26.540
which can say that as chairman of the committee, I must not do that.

12:26.540 --> 12:30.540
Now if the Congress passes the law on the president's hands,

12:30.540 --> 12:35.540
saying the chairman of these investigating committees must not get information of wrongdoing,

12:35.540 --> 12:38.540
the American people must not know what's going on,

12:38.540 --> 12:41.540
the American people must not hear of reasons,

12:41.540 --> 12:44.540
they must not hear of grafts or uptops.

12:44.540 --> 12:47.540
If we pass that law,

12:47.540 --> 12:51.540
and it's made of all the weather, there's nothing I can do except the bite-size.

12:51.540 --> 12:58.540
But, Senator, I just will not abide by any secrecy directives of anyone.

12:58.540 --> 13:02.540
I think you and I have, and we will see President come and go.

13:02.540 --> 13:05.540
So, Senator, we will, we will, we have a duty,

13:05.540 --> 13:09.540
including we have a duty, we have a duty to do our job,

13:09.540 --> 13:12.540
even though we may differ,

13:12.540 --> 13:17.540
with a perfectly honest version of the president thinks his job is.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.540
But, we may just look that way,

13:19.540 --> 13:22.540
and that's what I think the American people in doubt are our children.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.540
Whether you either the president's right,

13:24.540 --> 13:26.540
that's what I'm trying to find out.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.540
If it didn't say I'm trying to put you in jail,

13:29.540 --> 13:31.540
I'm asking no such thing.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.540
I don't care if I'm saying it out.

13:33.540 --> 13:36.540
No one's afraid of the out-of-the-mode or the end.

13:36.540 --> 13:39.540
I know, but the point I'm making is, Jo and you know it.

13:39.540 --> 13:42.540
We'll reach the course rules in this thing.

13:42.540 --> 13:46.540
And we're entitled in the course of these hearings now

13:46.540 --> 13:49.540
to have this thing settled if there's any way to settle it.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.540
On that fall, I will.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.540
On that fall, I will.

13:53.540 --> 13:56.540
But first of all, as you have to mention the powers

13:56.540 --> 13:58.540
of the Dr. Lutha, ladies and gentlemen,

13:58.540 --> 14:01.540
there's a very high specification

14:01.540 --> 14:03.540
he's holding Mr. Lutha.

14:03.540 --> 14:06.540
Back then, he put a home abust in the foot of the FBI.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.540
The other thought that the condense

14:08.540 --> 14:10.540
is a two-on-four-page resort.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.540
Well, now we have to say that to you,

14:12.540 --> 14:16.540
you've ought to mess about by and out of this folding and dead column.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.540
Well, I, I, I, I, I ask you,

14:18.540 --> 14:21.540
not six to four-borrowed questions.

14:21.540 --> 14:24.540
After hearings, there's a member that's permitted.

14:24.540 --> 14:28.540
Just what public-wonders maybe he has in mind to serve by doing so.

14:28.540 --> 14:30.540
I've never gotten an answer here.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.540
I'm a new government, gentlemen.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.540
I, I may agree with you back there.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.540
But we've passed the call shows now

14:36.540 --> 14:38.540
in committee investigations

14:38.540 --> 14:40.540
and in the administration's position.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.540
And I'm simply doing nothing.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.540
I don't just keep all your information

14:44.540 --> 14:47.540
and bring your head in somewhere else for once there.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.540
Now, she won't stay in that room.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.540
You know, I've answered.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.540
I've watched a several of these eight-year-old

14:53.540 --> 14:56.540
at his vital eye-cancel to the security of his nation.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.540
From you, from the Federal side.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.540
I'm a fundamental scientist.

15:00.540 --> 15:02.540
I can, but we'll, I'm sorry, but we will speak.

15:02.540 --> 15:06.540
So this is this quarter, the legislative quarter.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.540
A plan is to all investigation.

15:09.540 --> 15:12.540
In order to respond, but there are two people in government

15:12.540 --> 15:15.540
who get together and can thrive.

15:15.540 --> 15:19.540
Others for draft stuff and one of you.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.540
They can't be called upon to testify.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.540
Wouldn't draft a million effects

15:23.540 --> 15:25.540
just in the work of all investigating committees.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.540
I'll, I'll reach two, seven, or any special way you should.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.540
I'm going to see if we can agree.

15:29.540 --> 15:31.540
But in the meantime, you just believe

15:31.540 --> 15:34.540
that the high floor and force today can see our worst government

15:34.540 --> 15:36.540
and the federal division on its face.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.540
And I think we invited Adam Chettos.

15:38.540 --> 15:40.540
Well, whether anybody goes to jail or not,

15:40.540 --> 15:42.540
I am not concerned.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.540
But I am concerned.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.540
Both of us, I believe,

15:46.540 --> 15:49.540
that gives the fallacy of power.

15:49.540 --> 15:50.540
That you advocate.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.540
The never-centered type of law.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.540
Another gentleman of humility has that law.

15:54.540 --> 15:57.540
I'll vote for me, we can maintain.

15:57.540 --> 16:01.540
The security system that now has been in both venues.

16:01.540 --> 16:04.540
Security of Trump, I have to put back this one.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.540
Well, I don't think that who was the vote for.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.540
And those vote for, I think it would be.

16:08.540 --> 16:10.540
I'm ready for me to be right.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.540
Who's going to let you down?

16:12.540 --> 16:14.540
I'll say it now, it's quarter to one.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.540
He promised, I'm going to sign in sometime and soon.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.540
If he's just going around as well.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.540
Getting in, I just saw a fool.

16:20.540 --> 16:21.540
I recognize him.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.540
And if he's first on it, he's well-rescuing.

16:23.540 --> 16:25.540
He's resuming, he's going to say something.

16:25.540 --> 16:27.540
Which is only critical as under McCarthy.

16:27.540 --> 16:29.540
If he does, he'll recognize under McCarthy.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.540
If he's too many, it's only at the end of two minutes for the judge.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.540
And will recess at noon.

16:33.540 --> 16:34.540
It's our time.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.540
But, gentlemen, I, I am, he will be ready.

16:36.540 --> 16:38.540
He's not about the chair when he gives.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.540
If he's too many, it's under McCarthy.

16:40.540 --> 16:43.540
But, gentlemen, have I now got the floor?

16:43.540 --> 16:45.540
We have the floor.

16:45.540 --> 16:48.540
Well, I'd like to have a date for lunch.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.540
Yeah.

16:51.540 --> 16:56.540
The chairman had a very, uh, a GUA of, uh,

16:56.540 --> 16:58.540
belonging to hearing agenda.

16:58.540 --> 17:06.540
I must say my admiration for his operation is only seated by something else.

17:06.540 --> 17:14.540
I'd like to say Mr. Cohn's going back on the train and has the, gravitate, agreed.

17:14.540 --> 17:19.540
I could shorten up and, uh, have nothing that would interest Mr. Cohn except then.

17:19.540 --> 17:24.540
And the right way, therefore, he'd like to have Mr. Cohn leave, that's all I would make.

17:24.540 --> 17:28.540
Mr. Cohn, would you like to, uh, make Mr. Cohn the way, Mr. Sharon?

17:28.540 --> 17:31.540
Yeah, I'd like to have Mr. Cohn, he's going to discuss this in the box.

17:31.540 --> 17:34.540
I have no going to it, so, sir.

17:34.540 --> 17:36.540
Why, I only, sir, I know it's in this box.

17:36.540 --> 17:37.540
I know it's in the chair, sir.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.540
I have only the talk with, uh, the chairman of the committee about it.

17:40.540 --> 17:44.540
Chair also be happy to listen to McCockey, but he won't go.

17:44.540 --> 17:57.540
Mr. Chairman, first I was, uh, uh, uh, make a point that never would have wanted to serve on this committee in the beginning.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.540
I was never accepted.

17:59.540 --> 18:08.540
I membership point, if I have not felt that everything that was available to the chairman and the majority of the committee was going to be made available to me.

18:08.540 --> 18:20.540
Now there's been quite a lot of trouble, uh, recently about talking over the airways to people, about giving information when they think the government is not operating properly.

18:20.540 --> 18:26.540
And as I said last week, and say a game, in my opinion, this is very dangerous.

18:26.540 --> 18:31.540
We've gone back to bed, we've gone back to 1924.

18:31.540 --> 18:42.540
I'd be willing to go back to that a dictatorial and say that I hope that everybody remembers that there can be traders in the military establishment in this country.

18:42.540 --> 18:49.540
I'd like to urge everybody who is listening to this television to follow the rules, with the rules, the relatively simple.

18:49.540 --> 18:59.540
Just a man in the Air Force believes that this graph, the corruption, in his superior officer, he can immediately go to the officer superior to him.

18:59.540 --> 19:13.540
For example, a captain, if he believes his major is wrong, he can go to the Colonel, or he can go to the officer special investigation run by a great young general, and he can complain directly there.

19:13.540 --> 19:27.540
As a matter of fact, the officer special investigation is put around the country so that there would not see any effort on his part at the very adjacent, the same thing is true in the Army.

19:27.540 --> 19:35.540
The captain or Sergeant or a private field, if there's a superior officer or anybody else, is acting in properly, they can go around.

19:35.540 --> 19:38.540
They're normal supervision, and go to another officer.

19:38.540 --> 19:56.540
Or in the case of the Army, they can go to G2, which is also around the Army, and in the case of the Navy, they can go to the office of Naval investigation directly at headquarters or through one of the many branches that are established.

19:56.540 --> 20:07.540
For just that purpose, in the case of graphs or corruption or unfair treatment, it's important that they do it in the case of subversion or disloyalty.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.540
This would be even more important.

20:09.540 --> 20:14.540
That is the pattern which worked for the last 150 years in our government.

20:14.540 --> 20:23.540
It did pretty well in many wars, including World War I and II, and I would urge that they do it that way and know what a way.

20:24.540 --> 20:49.540
Now, finally, if they feel that the entire establishment, military establishment under their secretary and their chief of staff and the secretary of defense and the commander in chief, is just no good, and if they should correct that, then they can go to either the problem of justice or to the federal bureau of investigation and they can make their charges there.

20:49.540 --> 20:58.540
So they have at least four definite steps set up where their charges can be made without going out of the executive branch.

20:58.540 --> 21:07.540
And then, of course, the executive branch to side, whether or not that should be given to the legislative bodies or the legislative body can ask for it.

21:07.540 --> 21:18.540
I am not protesting about anybody giving any information anywhere, but I do think that it ought to be done on the basis of the laws of the land.

21:18.540 --> 21:33.540
Now, with respect to these files, Thursday afternoon, we were told that the Democratic members of the committee that it was their responsibility after the crash letter was introduced to know what was in the files.

21:33.540 --> 21:39.540
And our council asked that he be seen the files on Thursday.

21:39.540 --> 21:51.540
He was told that the files in question were not in the normal files and that therefore they could not be seen at that time.

21:51.540 --> 21:58.540
On Friday, there was a great deal of testimony because now we are back on the question of these charges.

21:58.540 --> 22:12.540
On Friday, there was a great deal of testimony as to whether or not the improper questions which the Army said were utilized with respect to private chimes were justified.

22:12.540 --> 22:20.540
And the witness made his statements that they were justified based on committee business.

22:21.540 --> 22:27.540
It was then requested that the files be turned over to committee council.

22:27.540 --> 22:31.540
That was refused by Senator McCarthy without Suspina.

22:31.540 --> 22:43.540
There upon a Suspina was issued between lunch in the lunch period on Friday to get the file at the time it was issued and it was served.

22:43.540 --> 22:48.540
Senator McCarthy told the persons who served it that he would not honor it.

22:48.540 --> 23:10.540
We then went ahead to the best of our ability on Friday afternoon to find out what was in the files to verify the statements made by the witness as to what private chimes was doing when he was off of the base on the various times that he was allowed to leave with the premise that he was going to do committee business.

23:10.540 --> 23:14.540
We did not get anywhere on Friday with respect to that.

23:14.540 --> 23:24.540
So Saturday morning, the minority council went to the committee and asked to the committee chambers and asked that he be allowed to see the files in question.

23:24.540 --> 23:37.540
And he was told at that time that neither he nor any members of the committee and it's my understanding not Mr. Jenkins to counsel for the committee could see the file.

23:37.540 --> 23:44.540
So since then, we've had one, two, three, three days passed since the last request.

23:44.540 --> 24:01.540
And I'm, I say, Mr. Chairman, but I think that there's an extraordinary interest in not showing these files considering the importance of the files with respect to the information and the whole basis on which the hearings are being held.

24:02.540 --> 24:09.540
Chair recognized on the mic, right? If the two minutes, if the end of two minutes, the time people will notify the chair, the chair will notify the audience, we'll meet you until two o'clock.

24:09.540 --> 24:17.540
And I'm, I don't stand you demean and I'm after this long day of time, but the chair arbitrarily gives me two minutes to answer.

24:17.540 --> 24:24.540
So they have a much argue for you, too, and just, the chair will recognize this experience as a past, as this call up we can go on endlessly.

24:24.540 --> 24:29.540
I think you were the democating message for your message. I think we've been covered in two minutes, Mr. Chairman.

24:29.540 --> 24:34.540
I don't want to name new two minutes rule, so I am only to the center of Wisconsin.

24:34.540 --> 24:38.540
There's a five minutes to speak, yes, and two minutes to recognize you in a few minutes.

24:42.540 --> 24:52.540
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, this is plenty of Mr. Simon to keep information about wrong doing graph corruption, secrets in the Congress.

24:53.540 --> 24:57.540
He put them in the department of so fantastic, so dangerous.

24:57.540 --> 25:07.540
Well, I'm going to ask the young man who has done a great job of prosecuting criminals to try and answer, I think the two minute rule is unreasonable, but I'll yield a two minute to Mr. Cohn.

25:07.540 --> 25:13.540
Sir, I can't possibly answer in two minutes. I need a little bit more, sir, and I think it's important that I think we'll be unfair to us.

25:13.540 --> 25:19.540
So let Mr. Simon can stay and stand over the lunch hour when some of them, sir, I suggest they're not so.

25:20.540 --> 25:22.540
You might proceed to what you can do in two minutes.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.540
And I'll, I'm just a minute now, but...

25:24.540 --> 25:30.540
...for all of you say something to say because I made or not so. Let's start right there. What is it that I said?

25:30.540 --> 25:36.540
I'd like to start. I saw it very hard to say to the fact that I was given them, and if they're incorrect, let's get to two minutes.

25:36.540 --> 25:37.540
I thought I'd say...

25:37.540 --> 25:42.540
Right, sir, and that's why I have... I think the Simon to Simon knows I've always had a great deal of respect from.

25:42.540 --> 25:45.540
And that's why I was very sorry to hear him say what he just did.

25:45.540 --> 26:02.540
I believe Simon to Simon can say that, and I thought he was addressing this to me, that we're trying to keep these strong facts as there's a reluctance in our plot, and the fact is to be interpreted in some way as bearing on the issue of what Dave Shine was doing when he was supposed to be working on Simon's business.

26:02.540 --> 26:03.540
I know.

26:33.540 --> 26:41.540
I want to be allowed to say that I wasn't arcing in remarks, especially as because of your great southern hungers, you wanted to leave as soon as he finished it.

26:41.540 --> 26:51.540
Sir, I have no idea. I care for Lee's in the next place, as he has said before, he wants to reiterate now so there's no mistake about it, so none of this fall, if we have anything whatsoever to do with any issue of the bloody committee.

26:51.540 --> 26:53.540
I'd specifically call the inquiry.

26:53.540 --> 26:55.540
I have any relevance to the issue.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.540
I'm in charge of the issue.

26:57.540 --> 27:10.540
I'd specifically disagree with that. I think the question of the file, and when we have claimed the file, and why we waited for Dave for the file to enter the testimony, is it close to anything that has ever come up in this hearing with respect to the charges in hand.

27:10.540 --> 27:11.540
Certainly.

27:11.540 --> 27:18.540
I'm in charge of the fact that I'm not going to win this interview because you've got to gavill and you've got to chair, and therefore I will be ready to go to lunch.

27:18.540 --> 27:26.540
Chair would simply like to say, very clearly again, there's no argument about these files, whatever is the medical committee is to all members of the committee.

27:26.540 --> 27:30.540
I'll ask this to Mr. Cohen because Simon is an interviewer, and Simon is an interviewer.

27:30.540 --> 27:35.540
When he was trying to answer him, he believes now he's been titled a make-your-reflight without a deduction.

27:35.540 --> 27:37.540
However long it will be at which time we shall reach it.

27:37.540 --> 27:46.540
So it won't be long, and I hope I'll never say anything in the subject again, and I want to say I don't mind being interrupted by Simon's in any time, if he feels I'm not making an accurate statement.

27:46.540 --> 27:54.540
On the issue here, sir, I think Simon's in his name, and I hope, and I will always tell him the truth.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.540
I have sworn under oath, and other witnesses will do likewise.

27:57.540 --> 28:02.540
But when they shined without working on committee visits, that's what he was doing.

28:02.540 --> 28:12.540
He was not in Florida, he was not in the stock club, he was working on some committee visits, and the army has produced not one word to show he wasn't before they can.

28:12.540 --> 28:20.540
Now sir, I have my testimony, and I'm open to cross examination on that in full detail, and I want to make it very clear.

28:20.540 --> 28:26.540
But in any request I have amazed, I have never abused my oath of office and my obligation to this committee.

28:26.540 --> 28:31.540
As far as the files are concerned, there is no reluctance on my part in producing them.

28:31.540 --> 28:46.540
I am anxious to produce them, to show the committee the amount of work, and I think a number of members know about it, that they've shined did well and did for nothing for this committee, and work which he did, and a very limited period he had when he was in the army,

28:46.540 --> 28:55.540
getting up early, doing his basic training, and at the same time, after hours, instead of recreation and other things, giving his time to this subcommittee.

28:55.540 --> 28:58.540
Now sir, the final thing I wish to say is this.

28:58.540 --> 29:04.540
I've heard a name here at the Grace Field this morning, which means a good deal to me. That's the name of John Etgo Hoover.

29:04.540 --> 29:15.540
And the work I've done, in Communism, the work I've done with boy, some of whom are in this room, will prosecute at these cases, or spies, the Rosenberg case, the Remington case,

29:15.540 --> 29:44.540
the U.M. cases, and the others along with me, there is one man above all of us, whom we worship, and that's J. Etgo Hoover, because over a period of years and years, long before it was the popular thing to do, that is a man who has been the leader, and the spearhead of the fight against communist infiltration in our government, and in this country, and it is when the report prepared under the direction of J. Etgo Hoover has been ignored by government agencies,

29:44.540 --> 29:53.540
and by the head of those government agencies. It is when that situation arrives that without the work of congressional committees such as this,

29:53.540 --> 29:59.540
Alger Hitz and William W. Remington, to my personal knowledge, would not be in jail today.

29:59.540 --> 30:05.540
I work on the Remington case, sir, as a member of the Executive Branch, as a member of the Department of Justice.

30:05.540 --> 30:21.540
In I know, sir, that that case was broken by this very committee, because Remington's superior is ignored, FBI report, and then had it not been for this committee, this communist spy that never has been exposed.

30:21.540 --> 30:28.540
I know, too, sir, that Alger Hitz, that not be in jail today, or not for the work of a congressional committee.

30:28.540 --> 30:40.540
I know, too, sir, that Edward Rothschild, who is in both the Fifth Amendment, as the weather and not he is a communist, SB&I agent, will still be handling the secrets of this committee,

30:40.540 --> 30:51.540
will still be excuse me, will still be handling the secrets of the government printing out, will still be handling classified work from the Army, the Navy, CIA, and other states,

30:51.540 --> 31:11.540
unless Senator McCarthy and Senator Dirtian had come back to Washington during the summer, and received information from people working in the government printing office who knew that the FBI report was undoubtedly for stamps of secrecy, had been violated and ignored over a period of years.

31:11.540 --> 31:27.540
Unless Senator McCarthy and Senator Dirtian had gotten that information and done that job, this man who was a Fifth Amendment communist and a Fifth Amendment spy, would say this very minute, be working in handling the secrets of this country and the government printing out.

31:27.540 --> 31:34.540
I never before, sir, from a fair level saw any conflict between our duty and the duty of the executive.

31:34.540 --> 31:47.540
I understood the duty of this committee to be that of stepping in, where, and I'm sure the instances of you, the executive might fail to act on FBI reports and things of that kind.

31:47.540 --> 31:58.540
In a very limited way, sir, our staff has tried to carry out that duty. The staff are handfuls, a handful, sir, of hard working boys who work day and night.

31:58.540 --> 32:07.540
Up again, probably hundreds and thousands of people who work over in the Army and in other places, this handful of people, this handful.
