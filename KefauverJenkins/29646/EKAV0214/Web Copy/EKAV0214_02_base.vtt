WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
of the community and five.

00:03.680 --> 00:06.540
And sir, it is hard to hear them criticize

00:06.540 --> 00:08.000
for having done that job.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.600
They've done it as best they know how

00:09.600 --> 00:11.840
and the keeping with the law of the land

00:11.840 --> 00:15.160
and in keeping with the mandate of this committee

00:15.160 --> 00:18.840
to investigate inefficiency and failure to act

00:18.840 --> 00:20.560
on the part of the executive.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.760
And I am sure sir, that John Edgar Hoover

00:22.760 --> 00:24.880
and the FBI and what they picked off

00:24.880 --> 00:27.760
would be the last people to criticize this

00:27.760 --> 00:29.760
or any other congressional committee

00:29.760 --> 00:32.000
for pointing out to the American public

00:32.000 --> 00:35.280
to fact that government agencies have taken north.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.080
That's the I warning and fail to act

00:38.080 --> 00:40.080
on the basis of information which Mr. Hoover

00:40.080 --> 00:41.040
had given to them.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.640
And I want to thank you Senator Runch

00:42.640 --> 00:45.640
for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.880
This is your last report.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.480
We just start by today.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.080
I'm in Palley and Favour of any government employee

00:51.080 --> 00:53.160
coming here as a last resort.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.000
Well, maybe as a middle resort, if he is followed it,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.360
but as a court of first resort,

00:58.360 --> 01:01.280
I don't think this is the right place for it in the car.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.800
You've just heard Chairman modern out

01:09.800 --> 01:12.200
that the next session of the hearing will be at 2 p.m.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.760
Disapproved.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.400
Of any kind or at any time.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.960
The uniformed officers that you see before you.

01:22.960 --> 01:27.040
And the plain closing seated among you

01:27.040 --> 01:29.680
have standing orders from the committee

01:29.680 --> 01:32.280
to remove immediately from the room

01:32.280 --> 01:35.200
a lightly but firmly and without any further instructions

01:35.200 --> 01:36.840
on the chair.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.240
Any advice to the reasons no one did

01:39.240 --> 01:42.400
and for all the students to violate the terms of the agreement

01:42.400 --> 01:44.120
by which you entered the room,

01:44.120 --> 01:48.120
namely to completely refrain from audible manifestations

01:48.120 --> 01:50.960
of approval or disagree.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.640
As we concluded the morning session,

01:52.640 --> 01:56.440
Council Zincens was interrogating in cross examination.

01:56.440 --> 02:02.200
Mr. Rauy-Colk, Mr. Zincens, you may resume at this point.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.080
Mr. Coln, you may now have ready and prepared

02:06.080 --> 02:08.440
to turn over to this committee.

02:08.440 --> 02:13.920
The documents, memorandum, data,

02:13.920 --> 02:18.880
prepared by either Mr. Shine or as a result of the conferences

02:18.880 --> 02:21.840
between Mr. Shine and the members of the committee,

02:21.840 --> 02:24.480
after his induction in the Army.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.440
Mr. Zincens, during the lunch hour,

02:26.440 --> 02:28.040
we imposed the prime minister,

02:28.040 --> 02:32.280
may the review staff to come up and shut him his fan's talk,

02:32.280 --> 02:35.280
which we had and we started going through it

02:35.280 --> 02:40.320
to the purpose of eliminating the names of confidential informants,

02:40.320 --> 02:42.760
which were not called for by the statement.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.680
We have made a certain amount of progress,

02:44.680 --> 02:48.640
and I can make a partial production now, sir,

02:48.640 --> 02:51.920
with the assurance that the end of the day or tomorrow,

02:52.760 --> 02:56.640
whenever else it might be, with the member of your staff working along with us,

02:56.640 --> 03:00.280
we will continue going through the material and furnishings,

03:00.280 --> 03:02.880
as we go along.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.440
I wonder if Mr. Coln, next in action,

03:05.440 --> 03:09.120
is just to state this matter up,

03:09.120 --> 03:12.120
I have got several members of the staff available.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.720
It was Mr. Zincens, one member of the staff,

03:15.720 --> 03:17.600
and I have no objection at all,

03:17.600 --> 03:21.640
including the Illinois Council of Work Bism,

03:21.640 --> 03:23.560
with the understanding of personnel,

03:23.560 --> 03:26.160
the names of the informants involved,

03:26.160 --> 03:30.760
there we go through the balance of the material and the,

03:30.760 --> 03:32.760
there are a bring-up once,

03:32.760 --> 03:37.760
a little tear to the bear on the shine work.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.400
We have members of our staff available,

03:41.400 --> 03:42.600
and they can take a condition of that,

03:42.600 --> 03:44.600
they can continue to be grateful to you.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.000
Well, I was going to say something,

03:46.000 --> 03:49.040
I could be there, and I wonder if we could do it after the hearing.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.480
I think he wanted to shine there,

03:50.480 --> 03:52.000
I know he followed your hearing,

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
so I'm sorry.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.760
On television, Mr. Jam and I think that I can finish

03:56.760 --> 03:58.560
the center of theography,

03:58.560 --> 04:00.840
one of the members of my staff,

04:00.840 --> 04:02.600
this is the preparation that worked,

04:02.600 --> 04:05.800
because the activities, so the Jam and the staff,

04:05.800 --> 04:07.880
they'll learn the task and know that they're easy,

04:07.880 --> 04:09.320
they should be able to work together,

04:09.320 --> 04:11.200
they're complete, checking the parts of the files,

04:11.200 --> 04:13.520
they're not being checked, and the means are in the,

04:43.520 --> 04:48.120
so the first folder I'll give you,

04:48.120 --> 04:50.720
contains grants and notes carrying on,

04:50.720 --> 04:52.920
will be in German annually for us

04:52.920 --> 04:54.560
for the, uh,

04:54.560 --> 04:55.960
what's the committee?

04:55.960 --> 04:58.360
Uh, I wish they'd shine work.

04:58.360 --> 05:01.000
I've discussed these in some detail with Mr. Maynard,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.160
and thought Mr. Shine,

05:02.160 --> 05:05.120
and I think he has a general idea of it,

05:05.120 --> 05:06.200
but some of the required,

05:06.200 --> 05:07.360
I might say we did not,

05:07.360 --> 05:10.120
unfortunately say all of the draft,

05:10.120 --> 05:11.120
as a matter of fact,

05:11.120 --> 05:14.120
we do not say the draft is of any of our reports.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.880
We still have the end product,

05:15.880 --> 05:18.280
the important thing, the reports themselves,

05:18.280 --> 05:19.680
and we still have some notes

05:19.680 --> 05:22.680
and the reference to earlier draft,

05:22.680 --> 05:26.600
uh, some of them I noticed are in the kind handwriting,

05:26.600 --> 05:28.320
and we are submitting those,

05:28.320 --> 05:32.360
so, uh, you hear, sir, in one folder,

05:32.360 --> 05:33.960
um,

05:33.960 --> 05:36.600
I've got,

05:36.600 --> 05:41.360
uh,

05:41.360 --> 05:42.640
some other material here,

05:42.640 --> 05:44.240
which we've gone through,

05:44.240 --> 05:45.320
I worked with Mr. Shine,

05:45.320 --> 05:47.640
that while he was with the committee,

05:47.640 --> 05:50.200
communications written by him,

05:50.200 --> 05:51.400
uh,

05:51.400 --> 05:53.160
which we've all looked over and determined

05:53.160 --> 05:54.320
that there is nothing in here,

05:54.320 --> 05:56.560
which would violate security,

05:56.560 --> 05:59.480
or disclose the name of a confidential informant,

05:59.480 --> 06:02.480
not anything in the first folder of the valley.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.720
I don't think so, sir.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.720
Please be to just be, uh,

06:05.720 --> 06:07.040
most bearing on the, uh,

06:07.040 --> 06:08.240
intermin annual report,

06:08.240 --> 06:09.280
and I don't see anything in those

06:09.280 --> 06:10.520
which could violate security.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.800
Mr. Cohen, are you sparing those now with this committee?

06:13.800 --> 06:14.880
Well, I'm too bolder.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.160
I'm submitting a fee as there are

06:16.160 --> 06:19.000
a facility or direction for whatever use you might be sent.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.400
There are no restrictions with tax, um,

06:21.400 --> 06:23.920
I'm certainly not twice by me.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.480
And as far as you are concerned,

06:26.480 --> 06:29.280
or as far as none of the McCarthy is concerned,

06:29.280 --> 06:31.520
they are available for inspection by each

06:31.520 --> 06:33.000
and every member of this committee.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Yes, sir. That's greatly understood.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Yes, sir.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.400
And Mr. Cohen, you are preparing

06:39.400 --> 06:42.600
a working reception and, uh,

06:42.600 --> 06:46.000
was the ending you are presenting to this committee,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
the balance of the documents

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
that are worth done by Mr. Shyam,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
representing the end result of the work

06:54.000 --> 06:55.400
that he did for the committee,

06:55.400 --> 06:57.800
I think his induction in the army is that correct?

06:57.800 --> 07:00.000
You know, well, I was just giving everything.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
You're giving us everything, yes sir.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.400
And there is deleted from it the name of any informants

07:05.400 --> 07:07.000
as we understand, yes sir.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And those are the only deletions.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.400
Well, sir, there's a question about things

07:11.400 --> 07:13.200
with your security information.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.200
I don't know what you want to do about that.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.400
But they are being fired with the committee.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.600
So I don't know if the decision has been reached on that or not.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
Now,

07:22.600 --> 07:23.600
sir,

07:23.600 --> 07:24.600
sir,

07:24.600 --> 07:25.600
sir,

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
sir,

07:26.600 --> 07:29.400
uh, I don't know just what my position is going to be

07:29.400 --> 07:31.000
with respect to these files

07:31.000 --> 07:34.400
that I can certainly simplify for everyone.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.000
Uh, as I think Mr. Cornwall,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
as I am interested in the work,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
as if you were Mr. Jenkins,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
you're questioning a waste of work.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
Uh, Mr. Shyam's work's taught us after induction.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.400
And I said to Mr. Smith,

07:50.400 --> 07:53.400
that he's now produced everything that Mr. Shyam did

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
while I was in committee,

07:54.400 --> 07:56.800
while I was a talk to induction holder.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.800
No, sir, uh,

07:58.800 --> 08:01.600
the notice that the proposed covered

08:01.600 --> 08:05.800
worked on by him during the time he was with the committee.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.200
Uh, there was sort of a second category of work done

08:09.200 --> 08:11.400
between the time we knew he was going to be inducted

08:11.400 --> 08:13.600
and the time he was actually inducted.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.000
One material after his induction,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.200
and of course after his induction,

08:18.200 --> 08:20.200
there was only that very limited work he did

08:20.200 --> 08:23.000
while doing his army training at the same time.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.600
Now, the bulk of that work,

08:24.600 --> 08:26.200
as far as written works is concerned,

08:26.200 --> 08:28.400
was on the interim report

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
and certain sections of the annual report

08:30.400 --> 08:31.400
is a subcommittee.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.200
We did not keep the draft,

08:33.200 --> 08:34.200
however,

08:34.200 --> 08:36.400
how there are any fits in some of the notes

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
concerning the draft.

08:37.400 --> 08:42.200
And, uh, I am submitting those for your inspection now.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.000
The Dragonfolder, Mr. Chairman,

08:44.000 --> 08:45.800
before we leave that,

08:45.800 --> 08:48.800
I hope the witness will have learned in one folder.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.300
But in five of the time,

08:50.300 --> 08:53.200
complete work product for an interior of folders

08:53.200 --> 08:57.200
is complete work product after induction.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.000
Mr. Morris talked about a work product with the Jenkins.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.400
Uh, maybe I haven't made clear the way the committee functions.

09:03.400 --> 09:07.800
Or, we don't produce a work product or anything like that.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.800
Uh, what we do with lessons to these reports,

09:11.800 --> 09:15.600
particularly is what was done with lessons to these reports was.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.400
We got together,

09:16.400 --> 09:19.400
the various people who worked on the investigation

09:19.400 --> 09:23.000
and we prepared to report it underwent several drafts,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.200
and then submitted it to members of this committee,

09:25.200 --> 09:27.400
no, also members of the committee then.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.200
These are the members of the subcommittee.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.200
They made suggestions and changes.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.600
And eventually the end product results.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.800
I have already given Mr. Welch that end product

09:37.800 --> 09:39.800
in the form of the three interim reports.

09:39.800 --> 09:43.200
There are some others with which shine has nothing to do.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.800
And I believe I've given Mr. Welch the annual report

09:46.800 --> 09:50.800
and Mr. Shine worked on certain sections of the annual report.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.200
I am now in addition in a folder,

09:53.200 --> 09:56.200
giving to you, sir, and Mr. Welch,

09:56.200 --> 09:58.000
certainly welcome to it.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.400
Uh, what notes we have with reference to the preparation of the interim reports.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.000
We did not, unfortunately, say,

10:06.000 --> 10:11.200
full of the draft prepared by Shine and myself and other staff members

10:11.200 --> 10:15.600
and worked on by Senator Munch, Senator Dixon,

10:15.600 --> 10:18.200
Senator Potter and Senator McClock.

10:19.200 --> 10:23.400
We do all we have is some isolated notes and things of that time.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.200
I've assembled some of those together here in a folder.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.600
I'm now filing those with the committee for your inspection

10:29.600 --> 10:31.400
and that of Mr. Welch.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.400
The second folder which I have is some work with Shine did

10:35.400 --> 10:39.000
when he was a very small question of the work.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.400
With Shine did when he was with this subcommittee.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.200
We have gone over this, going a lunch hour

10:44.200 --> 10:46.000
and there's nothing to worry,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.200
why that's being filed.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.400
The first thing which I was about to come to

10:51.400 --> 10:54.400
are certain minutes.

10:54.400 --> 11:01.800
Uh, Santa Grafick minutes made of staff interviews conducted by Dave Shine

11:01.800 --> 11:06.200
in the month prior to it's being inducted into the Army.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.600
Because you remember Mr. Jenkins, you asked me what stuff we took

11:09.600 --> 11:12.800
to have Shine clean up his work before he went in.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.000
I think I told you that certain things were done.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.600
One of them was that we called in for examination witnesses

11:19.600 --> 11:21.400
on whom he had information.

11:21.400 --> 11:25.600
We had a stenographer there and we let Mr. Shine question

11:25.600 --> 11:29.000
those witnesses and get that information down so we would have it.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.400
Now that is confidential.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
And it's never been released public.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.400
But publicly there are references in here.

11:38.400 --> 11:43.000
These call from October 8 through two or three days before Mr. Shine

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
was inducted.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I think Philip A. Before he was inducted.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Now, there are matters in here.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Uh, sort of executive, executive session type of material.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
So there are matters in the concerning allegations against witnesses

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
which might be unfounded.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.200
Things which this committee would ordinarily not make trouble

12:02.200 --> 12:05.600
because they were constitute a reflection upon the person

12:05.600 --> 12:09.400
under investigation and it might be an unwarranted reflection

12:09.400 --> 12:12.400
if he could explain away the derogatory information.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.900
But we are submitting to you sir, the interrogatories

12:16.900 --> 12:22.600
or questioning conducted by Mr. Shine during that period of time

12:22.600 --> 12:25.600
in the right here.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.600
Now,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
well sir.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.200
Mr. Cohen, this one question I don't think will interrupt you.

12:38.200 --> 12:43.000
I'm sure what Mr. Wells has in mind and I believe that I have asked

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
for it, Mr. Elk and it's...

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I think this one question will embrace precisely

12:48.000 --> 12:50.400
for these answers and what I have here to ask for.

12:50.400 --> 12:55.000
Just hand you in one folder, segregate,

12:55.000 --> 12:59.400
from everything else in your file that pertains to the work

12:59.400 --> 13:01.400
at Run the day Shine.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.800
Invases that one folder.

13:03.800 --> 13:08.800
Documents and memorandums that will fully reflect

13:08.800 --> 13:11.800
the types and the character and the standard work

13:11.800 --> 13:14.400
run by Shine, Icedhurst, November 3rd.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.400
Not so we can fully reflect the type of character work.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.400
Thank you.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
Thank you, Mr. Wells.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.400
Well sir, I can only tell you again when I move things three to eight.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.000
I don't even think you can substantially do it.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.800
You can tell us to this extent.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.600
Some of the work he did in perhaps the most important,

13:30.600 --> 13:34.600
certainly one of the most important things was working on

13:34.600 --> 13:36.800
the preparation of the interim report.

13:36.800 --> 13:40.000
Now I can tell you in some detail just about how the interim report

13:40.000 --> 13:43.600
were written, just what Shine did with reference to them,

13:43.600 --> 13:46.600
why he had to do anything and how he tried to avoid having him

13:46.600 --> 13:48.600
do anything and run for trouble.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.600
Well now there are no documents to replace.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
Yes, to pay for the work.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.600
A lot of them.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.600
Actually, there are.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.600
There are some documents which still contain his notes and do

13:58.600 --> 14:01.600
like some extent this preparatory work.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.600
Can you actually move now?

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
I've done that, sir.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
You already done that.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
Yes sir, and this report.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.600
And do you have no report told or reflect the work done

14:09.600 --> 14:11.600
the day Shine subsequent to November 3rd?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.600
This falls, it does not reflect more,

14:13.600 --> 14:15.600
or even a good part of the work he did.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.600
It's subsequent to November 3rd.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.600
Because the good deal of the work he did was talking to various staff

14:22.600 --> 14:26.600
members about investigations and problems and witnesses,

14:26.600 --> 14:28.600
and he was in the committee.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.600
And that would not reduce itself to written forms.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.600
Part of it was documented in part not.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.600
Well, sir, I would say very little of it was documented.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
There is some.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
I have to say that, sir.

14:37.600 --> 14:42.600
For instance, we found here a witness with prepared by Mr. Shine

14:42.600 --> 14:43.600
giving the name.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.600
And in some cases, the phone number and the approximate

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
location of witnesses, he had handled.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.600
When he was in the committee, he thought we ought to take up

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
the information.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.600
Now that he was in the army, we talked that over during the new

14:58.600 --> 14:59.600
now, it's there.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.600
And some of those witnesses, I believe, worked for government.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
Others have not been otherwise exposed.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.600
And I believe it was none of the positions.

15:06.600 --> 15:11.600
That's a furnished that list, which was prepared by Mr. Shine when he was in the army.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.600
We'll give away the names in in some case to see telephone numbers and locations

15:15.600 --> 15:17.600
from these witnesses.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.600
And he thought that that should not be done, sir.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.600
Now, in that same fall that there are other notes, Mr. Shine,

15:25.600 --> 15:32.600
made putting down his recollection as to certain derogatory information we had received,

15:32.600 --> 15:36.600
an located shooter that might be a revelation of these sorts of that information.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.600
And it was sent in a must-havey position.

15:38.600 --> 15:43.600
And I, my stator, that was always psyched from a fair standpoint,

15:43.600 --> 15:48.600
I think it's a very well taken position, that we should not be required to make

15:48.600 --> 15:52.600
public the names and the phone numbers of these informants,

15:52.600 --> 15:57.600
even though it is work sent by Dave Shine, as for his induction in the army.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.600
I have that in this folder here.

15:59.600 --> 16:04.600
In addition to that, sir, apparently a couple of the staff members who went to see him

16:04.600 --> 16:10.600
fit, discussed that matter with him and did prepare memoranda or something like that,

16:10.600 --> 16:12.600
as they're having torque with him.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.600
Those will be examined later this afternoon, or are being examined now,

16:16.600 --> 16:20.600
to see whether or not production of those will reveal the name,

16:20.600 --> 16:24.600
will or will not reveal the name of confidential informant,

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
if they will.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.600
We will not submit him, if they will not, sir.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.600
We will be very happy to submit them.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.600
In short, now, as we understand it, Mr. Cohen,

16:33.600 --> 16:38.600
you will submit in one jacket or one size, isolated from everything else.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
Yes sir.

16:39.600 --> 16:43.600
Documents and data and memoranda, reflecting the work done by Mr. Shine,

16:43.600 --> 16:49.600
subsequent to November 3rd, which does not reveal the name of informant or security risk.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.600
Yes sir.

16:50.600 --> 16:57.600
And on the very, on the state, sir, that this is not a business of producing writings or producing work.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.600
I'm saying the committee will have to take you on other members of the staff's work.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
Sure.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.600
For additional work that he did.

17:04.600 --> 17:05.600
Are we on the same page?

17:05.600 --> 17:06.600
Yes sir.

17:06.600 --> 17:12.600
Well, now Mr. Cohen, you have examined the summer-leaven memoranda.

17:12.600 --> 17:17.600
Have you not, that were finished, that were delivered to the chairman of this committee,

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
back in March?

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
Yes sir.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.600
I suppose I pass.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
Yes sir.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.600
I suppose memoranda, do you, Mr. Cohen?

17:24.600 --> 17:25.600
Yes sir.

17:25.600 --> 17:33.600
And I will ask you to identify those memoranda for the benefit of the record.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.600
Yes, American, from our HISTANDI.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.600
Yes sir.

17:36.600 --> 17:45.600
Now what are the minutes, Cohen, for the benefit of the record?

17:45.600 --> 17:57.600
As far as I know sir, they are not the only ones who have been here.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
Yes sir.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.600
Now what are the minutes, Cohen, for the benefit of the record?

18:03.600 --> 18:10.600
As far as I know sir, they are memorandas from Senator McCarthy's file,

18:10.600 --> 18:16.600
concerning various of these matters in our relation for Senator Adams and Mr. Steefe.

18:16.600 --> 18:22.600
How many, if any of those memorandas were six-tated, are prepared by you?

18:22.600 --> 18:26.600
Just one moment, isn't it?

18:27.600 --> 18:33.600
I would say that the November 6th one was probably six-tated by me.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.600
That's the second memoranda in the file was probably dictated by you.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.600
Now let's talk about that, Mr. Cohen.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.600
Yes sir.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.600
Now you may go ahead and answer the question fully.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
Whatever you say.

18:43.600 --> 18:47.600
Chairman of the rest of them and the fellow committee, how many of those memorandas were dictated

18:47.600 --> 18:50.600
are prepared by you and your supervision?

18:50.600 --> 18:51.600
Yes sir.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.600
I'll say no.

18:52.600 --> 18:59.600
No other 17th probably sir.

18:59.600 --> 19:10.600
I know if I mention my name left, which means I probably dictated it.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.600
That's probably the same for obviously, I think.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.600
Not that, it's just standard procedure.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.600
November 6th, November 7th, is that correct?

19:18.600 --> 19:19.600
Yes sir.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.600
December 9th.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.600
December 9th.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.600
January 14th.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
January 14th?

19:39.600 --> 19:47.600
January 14th?

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
That's it.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.600
That's it.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.600
Now let's see whether or not there are two memorandas dated December 9th.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.600
So I was referring to the first one which passed my name, sir, and was dictated by me.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.600
Then you dictated there are eleven and all are there not?

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
Yes sir.

20:02.600 --> 20:08.600
And the eleven four of whom were dictated are prepared by you are under your supervision.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
Yes.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.600
Is that correct?

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
Yes sir.

20:12.600 --> 20:17.600
Picking up these memorandum Mr. Cohn, particularly the first one November 6th.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.600
Yes sir.

20:18.600 --> 20:24.600
Now let's see the exact same of the median and then I will ask you to tie a last as an exhibit for your testimony.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.600
Sure.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.600
Do you want me to read the whole thing?

20:28.600 --> 20:32.600
As our members isn't long and I'm sure the committee would be interested.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.600
How was it?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.600
They put you want me to read that a while.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.600
Yes sir.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
Yes, I was.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.600
Friday November 6th, at the recross of Mr. Steven.

20:40.600 --> 20:45.600
Senator McCarthy, Frank Karin, Roy Karin, went to Stevens-Buff, the Pentagon for lunch.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.600
John Adams was present.

20:47.600 --> 20:53.600
Steven said so to outline what evidence would be presented our schedule of public hearings on the Army's signal call which we did.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.600
Steven said that if we brought out everything he would have to resign.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.600
He said he had been in office for ten months and would have to take responsibility.

21:01.600 --> 21:09.600
He said they were practically, they were particularly worried about our seeking to identify those who were responsible for not acting

21:09.600 --> 21:14.600
to get rid of Tommy and his security risks in the Army and would order everything to take.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.600
Mr. Steven said that we hold up our public hearings on the Army.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.600
He suggested we go after the Navy Air Force and the Defense Department instead.

21:22.600 --> 21:27.600
We said first of all we had no evidence warranting an investigation of these other departments.

21:27.600 --> 21:32.600
Adams said not to worry about that because there was plenty of fear there and they were furnished as police.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.600
Mr. Steven thought this was the answer to his problem.

21:35.600 --> 21:43.600
We said this was not possible because we have already planned our next investigation which was one of the version in defense plan,

21:43.600 --> 21:46.600
handling government and military contracts.

21:46.600 --> 21:55.600
He asked why we did not start on that and we told him we were jammed up trying to get out our reports to fire and with the moment's investigation.

21:55.600 --> 22:02.600
And that they excited about the end of the Army and had much information and material on the reports and investigations that we could not get along with that.

22:03.600 --> 22:09.600
Mr. Steven said he would arrange for Dave to complete the work over weekends and after training hours.

22:09.600 --> 22:13.600
We said this would be silent factory in a bay was going to do this work after hours.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.600
It would help some extent.

22:15.600 --> 22:24.600
After lunch general Rich Ray, General Trudeau and General Munchie came in and we reviewed our evidence of the signal on the signal court for their benefit.

22:25.600 --> 22:37.600
The Sergeant McCarthy reiterated in the appraisal that he would cooperate as much as possible but that under no circumstances would there be a white wash of the Army situation because one reason a North Administration wise alike,

22:37.600 --> 22:40.600
was to prevent the covering up of communist and local detectives.

22:40.600 --> 22:46.600
Now you have been investigating Fort Monmouth and some virtues in Fort Monmouth.

22:46.600 --> 22:51.600
So, I was probably,

22:51.600 --> 22:54.600
a huge later groundwork strike months prior to that.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.600
So, here was a coronavirus investigation which started back in the spring.

22:58.600 --> 23:06.600
And you had had numerous conferences with both the Secretary of the Army and Mr. Adams prior to November 6th said you not Mr. Cohn.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.600
I was just saying numerous by the way.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.600
You mean you were both Mr. Steven's and Mr. Adams?

23:11.600 --> 23:13.600
Yes.

23:13.600 --> 23:19.600
Why had you not made a memorandum of any previous conversation with the Secretary of the Attorney, Mr. Cohn?

23:19.600 --> 23:22.600
I believe we did.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.600
When you had not made any yourself as we have done.

23:25.600 --> 23:34.600
No, but Mr. Cohn made one of the, I told the second meeting with Mr. Steven Ben Sir I was not have seen the necessity of us all still.

23:34.600 --> 23:39.600
Did you know that Mr. Carr had made that memorandum of October 2nd?

23:39.600 --> 23:41.600
I can't say that I did say no.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.600
You did not participate in the dictation or preparation of it?

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
No.

23:46.600 --> 23:53.600
Did you know of its existence until this matter came to public life in March?

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
I can't say that I did say.

23:55.600 --> 24:00.600
But you own your own initiative and alone prepared the one of November 6th.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.600
No, sir. I wasn't quite like that.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.600
Was not on my own initiative.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.600
Public did not allow.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.600
First of all, I believe Mr. Carr was there with me as I recall if that was 6th 8th.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.600
Perhaps we had come back to this building from the meeting in Mr. Steven's office.

24:12.600 --> 24:19.600
And I believe that Senator McCarthy has done before on another occasion which I remember in a different investigation.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.600
Told me to dictate to Mary Driscoll 8th and up to supply it.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.600
Clawed on at the meeting.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.600
Did Senator McCarthy direct the unique thesis memorandum of November 6th?

24:28.600 --> 24:30.600
Is our equality just there?

24:30.600 --> 24:32.600
I don't know, I don't know, but the direction.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
I was a suggestion.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
Suggest you.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.600
Yes sir.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.600
Where did you dig deep in Senator McCarthy's office?

24:37.600 --> 24:38.600
To whom?

24:38.600 --> 24:39.600
Mary Driscoll.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
To Mary Driscoll.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
Yes sir.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.600
She is the senator's secretary.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
That's right.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
She's the personal secretary.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
She is the one that will make you dictate something.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.600
Now that is not your office's.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
It's cold.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.600
Your office is in 101.

24:54.600 --> 24:58.600
Actually sir, I don't have an office as such.

24:58.600 --> 25:02.600
We have a room down in 101 with one desk and one chair.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.600
That is you jointly by Mr. Carr and myself.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.600
The person who gets their first occupied chair.

25:08.600 --> 25:15.600
In addition to that, I spend, I would say, a good deal at my time, up in and around Senator McCarthy's office.

25:15.600 --> 25:20.600
I don't know which I call home when I'm down here, but I'm in both of them a good deal.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.600
To whom was the one that was second dictated?

25:23.600 --> 25:25.600
I don't know that in my own knowledge sir.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.600
Mr. Carr, I would tell you to whom he dictated it.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.600
Yes sir.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.600
Who did he say Mr. Carr?

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
That's the Mary.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.600
Mary Driscoll.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.600
To Mary Driscoll.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.600
To whom was the other nine memorandum of the dictated?

25:36.600 --> 25:38.600
I can't say sir, my own personal knowledge.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.600
I would say you'll find the most of them.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.600
I would dictate it to Mary Driscoll.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.600
I'll say you would find them.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.600
Now three additional ones were dictated by you as we know.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
Yes sir.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
Well to whom were they dictated?

25:47.600 --> 25:52.600
Sir, I can say with a few exceptions possibly that anything I dictated up in Senator McCarthy's office.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.600
With the dictated to Mary and much she's there, I might...

25:55.600 --> 25:59.600
But you have not said that you dictated your four in Senator McCarthy's office.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.600
Did you miss Cole?

26:00.600 --> 26:01.600
I did sir.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
All four of them.

26:02.600 --> 26:07.600
And your best recollection is that maybe Driscoll, Mr. Wilson, the dictation.

26:07.600 --> 26:12.600
Yes sir, except in a very rare instance I was only dictating for something like that.

26:12.600 --> 26:13.600
Too Mary Driscoll.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.600
Unless she isn't there I might get mad on.

26:15.600 --> 26:20.600
Now you have six occasions to take dictation in Room 101 to you not.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.600
Oh yes.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.600
So well, that depends again.

26:24.600 --> 26:28.600
We have thought recently in the past two or three weeks,

26:28.600 --> 26:36.600
it's been a realignment in the office set up so that I think three or four of them have been moved down to 101.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.600
And five to that time I believe there was one sir.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.600
Francis Mendes.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.600
Was Francis Mendes in Room 101 working there?

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
That was your eight quarters?

26:46.600 --> 26:50.600
I had been in the months of October and November December and month seven to go back to him.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
I think so sir.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.600
I couldn't be...

26:52.600 --> 26:55.600
I couldn't be positive but we could check that very easily.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.600
That's four of these.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.600
Uh...

26:59.600 --> 27:01.600
You being the author of those four?

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
Yes sir.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.600
Were dictated to Mary Driscoll in Senator McCarthy's office?

27:05.600 --> 27:07.600
Yes sir.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.600
Where were the original's left?

27:09.600 --> 27:10.600
This call?

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
I don't have any items.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.600
I can throw all items with dictation.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.600
You did not sign them?

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
No sir.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.600
I never...

27:16.600 --> 27:17.600
Did you ever see them?

27:17.600 --> 27:18.600
I see you dictated?

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
I don't believe I did and I might say this.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.600
I don't think I ever sign any memorandum.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.600
Do you know where Mr. Driscoll kept those memorandums?

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
No sir.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.600
I assume she kept them.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.600
You never had occasion to call for them since that time?

27:31.600 --> 27:33.600
No sir. I did not.

27:35.600 --> 27:40.600
I'm sure understanding that Mr. Nino, how many of these memorandums were dictated by Mr. Carr?

27:40.600 --> 27:42.600
Like a townspear.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.600
So I will ask you to do that.

27:44.600 --> 27:45.600
Yes sir.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.600
One...

27:48.600 --> 27:51.600
Two...

27:51.600 --> 27:54.600
Three...

27:54.600 --> 27:57.600
Three...

27:57.600 --> 28:00.600
Four...

28:00.600 --> 28:02.600
Five, six...

28:02.600 --> 28:03.600
I might...

28:03.600 --> 28:04.600
Did you say five or six?

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
Six.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
Six of Mr. Carr?

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
Four of you?

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
Yes sir.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
And one of the Senator McCarthy's.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
I think that's it sir.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.600
Now, did Mr. Carr tell you that he dictated all of his to Mrs. Driscoll?

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
Yes.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
I think he said he could have given them all the memorandums.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.600
Did the Senator ever tell you to whom he dictated his one memorandum?

28:19.600 --> 28:21.600
I sure that would have been married to Mr. Driscoll sir.

28:21.600 --> 28:32.600
Then it is your opinion now that Mrs. Driscoll took in shorthand and tied these 11 memorandums that you've hired before you.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.600
Yes.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.600
Is that correct?

28:34.600 --> 28:35.600
Yes sir.

28:35.600 --> 28:43.600
Well Mr. Cohn, do you know whether or not I've you ever asked Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. or Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. She's married ladies.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.600
Yes.

28:44.600 --> 28:51.600
Have you ever asked Mrs. Mrs. Giskole to ascertain whether or not she could find her original shorthand notes?

28:51.600 --> 28:52.600
No.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.600
You've not made any claim about that.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
Well, there was a discussion about it sir.

28:56.600 --> 29:00.600
I'm pretty sure that Mrs. Driscoll and I suppose nobody out there keeps shut in notebooks.

29:00.600 --> 29:05.600
I think to get a picture of that officer, Mr. Jenkins, I don't know if you've ever been up there.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.600
But uh...

29:07.600 --> 29:11.600
Well, I haven't had the pleasure in the Army yet and you mean the same.

29:11.600 --> 29:16.600
And I'm not the pleasure to mean that the senator is not from a sobrietyl in the keeping of these records.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.600
Sorry, sorry.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.600
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.600
It's not being a sobrietyl and you get seven or eight thousand letters a day.

29:21.600 --> 29:29.600
And you have a cotton bowl of letters and uh... stock it in and you think just uh...

29:29.600 --> 29:32.600
All around the place there is just a thing.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.600
I spoke just about the 50th office in the field.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.600
Oldenburg, E.S., have never been never around with it.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.600
That's the year of the old position chairman.

29:43.600 --> 29:50.600
They were given the chairman months of management at history class by Trump's class,

29:50.600 --> 29:54.600
since I'm here to determine that...

29:54.600 --> 29:57.600
That's about the second part of the office.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.600
That's on that day right there.

29:59.600 --> 30:03.600
Do you know where this difficult battle goes, documents?

30:03.600 --> 30:05.600
I don't know of my own personal knowledge.

30:05.600 --> 30:13.600
I was able to isolate them from the very smiles and assemble them and send them over to Senator Munn.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.600
So I can't say I know of my own personal knowledge where she found them.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.600
I have very good ideas. They were being the files.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.600
Would being evolved in in one file?

30:22.600 --> 30:26.600
I can't answer that sir.

30:26.600 --> 30:34.600
Mr. Cohn, would you consider it out of order if we ask you to step aside and call Mr. Cohn?

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
I'm Christian.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.600
Do you hear about these documents?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.600
Not my judgment sir, whatever you say.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.600
I miss chairman, I think perhaps that should be that.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.600
At this time.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.600
Very well.

30:44.600 --> 30:50.600
While they're looking for Mrs. Dessko, let's return to our studio to cost the country to permit our station to identify themselves.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.600
This is ABC telep...

30:53.600 --> 30:57.600
I am Joe, I'm Mr. Jenkins.

30:57.600 --> 31:06.600
The dramatic is a great deal, but I probably could have passed my call with some sort of giving them 20-hour notice.
