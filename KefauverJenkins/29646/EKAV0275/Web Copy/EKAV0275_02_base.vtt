WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
I'd like to welcome once again, and he's got come to the committee room to witness these hearings,

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
and to be present at the concluding session of a long series of hearings.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
I must again report to our friends in the audience these standing committee rules,

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
and since we want to move forward with the maximum dispatch and decorm this afternoon,

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
I want to emphasize the standing committee rules for a bid,

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
any audible manifestations from the audience of any kind at any time.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
That includes any unnecessary disturbances in the nature of applause or any other type of

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
activity which might be disturbing to the committee proceedings.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
The uniformed members of the Capitol Police Force and the plane closements scattered to the audience

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
for whom once again the chair would like to say they have done a perfectly magnificent job.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
Those officials have a standing order from the committee to immediately remove from the committee room

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
any of you who for reasons best known to yourself elect to eject yourself by violating the terms under which it enters the room.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
As the chair enters the chamber this afternoon, he observes several hundred, I believe,

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
people standing in the hall of age each wishing he were where you are now.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
And consequently, the guards may have that in mind,

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
and so they need have no hesitation about carrying out the chair's instructions.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
If any of you should, by someone happy,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
failure to comply with the rules of the committee,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
do anything to disrupt or disturb the conduct of the hearings in this room.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
I am confident that you will continue to give us the splendid cooperation that we have had throughout the year.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Subject to being directed by his colleagues, I believe,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
that Senator Dirkson has the last ten minutes.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
And if that's correct, I believe,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Senator Dirkson had you had your ten minutes, I'm not just going to be your pass.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
The Senator's time is in.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
That's fine.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Chair would like to say, in behalf of Senator McCullough,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
the meeting with you is called to attend this morning,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
involving an atomic energy installation with resumed at two o'clock,

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
and he thinks he'll be with us by about two thirty.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And the Senator Potter has had to go back to the conduct of his committee,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
dealing with the television industry,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
and Senator Dirkson will be with us shortly.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Do you pass under the judge's act?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Mr. Cohn, do you pass?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Very well, Mr. Welch.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
We'll start with you.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You have the first ten minutes.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm going to move out.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I think.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
When I was last pressing, you said I was pressing,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
you pressed me, you, about the item of leaning over backwards,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
in respect to a commission or other special treatment of any time for the day of its time.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And you would told me, I think that you had made it quite clear,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
that the secretary was to at least, was to lean over backwards.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Is that right, sir?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
That's right, that's right, that's right.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And I was asking you, I think,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
and I don't believe you, and yet, made it that clear to me,

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
whether or not you yourself had any termination to lean over backwards on that point.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I didn't know any lady.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
You didn't lean over backwards, but I didn't lean as well.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Either way, is that right?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Either forward or backwards.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
That's right.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Now, on the occasion,

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
when you were at Mr. Stevens in respect of this matter on March 12, 1954,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
you did not make any reference to the effect that you had asked him to lean over backwards.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Is that right, Senator?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
You have the wire before you went out.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And why didn't you read it this morning?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
And similarly, when you wrote in December 22, 1953,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
a letter which is in evidence and which, and through which I will return again,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
you did not mention that fact in December.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Like a flower, what do you mean?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Like a flower, what do you mean?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
The ones in the box,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
the ones in the box,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
the ones in the library.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
You know that's not the ones in.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Yes, that's the one.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Your question was that I asked,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
did I ask Stevens to do any leaning on this letter?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
The question is, I don't want to say a few things.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
You didn't say anything about it.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I think in that letter, either, Senator.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
No, but I made it very clear here.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Well, I just told you,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
some of my fewer things that are to me more early.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I take it the letter of December 22,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
and then again, I will come back out and let's add another time.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Was there pretty carefully prepared letter with it now?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Is one of the many letters I just said?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I explained it, I knew it was in it.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Right.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I have no apology for it.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, I'm not suggesting that you apologize,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
but my question is whether or not it was a reasonably carefully prepared letter.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh, I think all the work in my office is carefully prepared.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Now that, again, you would have been an appropriate time

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
to record this oral statement of yours,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
the Secretary Stephen Chabino backwards, what does not?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
No.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
When you could have done it, Senator,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I mean, if you remembered it,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
it would have only taken a line or two to remind him of that fact.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Could color the work.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
You could have reminded the Secretary of the fact

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
that you had told him early that you wanted to lean over backwards

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
in respect of G. David Stein.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I could have put anything in the letter, yes.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
And you didn't?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I only have put in the letter, what is it, before you?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Yes. Did you think of doing it, Senator?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Think of asking him lean over backwards?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
No.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I've reclawed him the Journey of the Backers.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I didn't, uh...

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I put it in the letter, I, uh...

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
Don't think that there's any debate in my mind as to what I should put in the letter.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Did you think of it at that time?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, I wouldn't know.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Sir?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh, I wouldn't.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I mean, do you mean the...

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
I said I'd remember 16th conversation.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Yes, I'm sure I did.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I was aware of the fact that I had told Bob Stevens not to, yes.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Did they have signed any special consideration?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
And were you thinking...

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I told him we lean over backwards so he wouldn't be cut at times.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
And were you thinking of that fact when the decade is a letter?

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Well, I, uh, as soon as I looked like we remembered that conversation at the time...

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
And thought about, is that right, Senator?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I don't know, but I was, uh...

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
What I thought about besides what's in the letter.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
I don't.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I dictate to many of these in the course of one day, Mr. Ralph,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
and you're what else I'm maybe thinking about besides what I dictate.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I think the letter is very complete.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Wait, except what I say for this point.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
One thing is very complete.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
Now, to put that for a moment, to the autumn of 1950s.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
May I remind you once again of the day, so on June 22nd, you're against the Shine family.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
On September 15th, you're at the Shine apartment, and it's just even...

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
On September 16th, the morning of the 60s.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Well, I think it's the night of the 15th, I believe, that you are at the apartment,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and meet Mr. Stevens there on the morning of the 60s.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I'm not even the morning of the 60s, so they told you...

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
I may well have stayed in the Shine apartment, that is the apartment of Mr. and Mrs. Meyer,

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Shine, and not Dave's apartment, I may well have stayed in that tonight before.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
I don't remember.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
And on October 13th of that year, there was a dinner party,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
and what's D. David Shine was a guest?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Do you remember?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Dave's a girl with a party with him.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yes, David, he's a great...

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And Mr. Collins, and I think his family were guests, all were giving the party.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Mr. Collins was giving the party a given for...

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Well, Jenny, my...

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Mrs. McCarthy and May, wait a little bit for turns tomorrow.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
And do you remember that there was an arrangement made, or that Mr. Stevens testified,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
that he was driven downtown the next morning by D. David Shine?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I think that was his testimony.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Does it strike you, Senator, that there was some kind of a concerted...

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
move on at that time to try to get a commission for D. David Shine?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
No, the officer is served.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
What do you mean there was a move to avoid giving him one?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Mr. Wilson, I have told you...

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
You said the officer...

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
So many times now that I know it must be boring to Arlesby's.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I told you that Mr. Stevens brought up the question of a commission.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
I told Bob Stevens and knew the fact that we were investigating

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
communism till face to the Army,

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
until the question which he and Herethas, not that he was responsible for,

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
that I thought it would be a mistake if he did anything which could be misconstrued

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
by those elements of the press and radio, which had been opposing any exposure of communists,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
in the presence of Dave Shine and Roy Cohn.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I suggested that he lean over backwards.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
In any decision he made in regard to Dave Shine,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
he apparently has leaned over very, very far backwards.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
What does Dave Shine is silly private?

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
He has had no consideration of any kind and rightly so,

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
except he was given the right to take his hours' time off and to committee work.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
In that connection, Senator, are you aware of the fact that Mr. Stevens himself has

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
a son 21 months or more abroad, who is the corporal only?

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
I am aware of the thanks about Mr. Stevens' son, yes.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I will not discuss them unless you insist upon me.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Are you aware of his rank, sir?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
I am aware of the fact that he was a corporal when we last heard about him.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Right.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
Now, let me ask you about Dave's shine only,

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
quite aside from talking to you about the secretary,

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
from your observation of Dave's shine and your conversations with him.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Did you get the impression that Dave's shine was extremely hopeful that he was going to be?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I think Dave was anxious to get a commission.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Very anxious.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
Well, I think he has the normal attitude of any young man who is going into the military.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
I think he wanted a commission.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I think he knows how to do that.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Did you observe on his plan on his part,

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
a plan to secure whatever assistance he could with the limits of pride?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
From you, sir?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
He asked for no assistance to me.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Well, he was not unwilling to take that.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Except for me to follow for that.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Except for me.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
He asked me to have the liaison officer with a senate who, as I have explained,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
has an officer over here who works at every senate district.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
Yes, and I have the liaison officer giving him the details of how he should apply,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
how he should apply what possible openings there might be.

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
I think the first application is with transport because of his background and experience in that.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Did he know that you were talking to General Reaver on his behalf?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Nothing is to him.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Well, did he know you were talking to General Reaver?

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
He knew that I had asked Reaver to give him the technical information of how to apply.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
And that I had asked Reaver before there was nothing as entitled as much.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Now, I have to go back for a moment.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I think I'll pass that assistance.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
I would like to ask you if I made one or two things about your filing systems.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
May have been implied into somewhat my others here.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Right.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
Do I understand, Senator, that some of the files that I respectfully are really committed file,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
so I kept in your office, in your mini-year senatorial office?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
No.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Well, where do you keep the documents like the two-in-the-part of page documents that we had here?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Mr. Welts, I was only a thing in that that was down on the committee files.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
However, I heard Mr. Tach has to file the effects that it was not of to my office.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
I will take Mr. Tachar's testimony on that because I'm sure he's right in that.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Well, that you would consider an important document, would you not?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
It was important, but not important, beyond many documents.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
You wouldn't allow it to lie around carelessly with the senator?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
It did not lie around carelessness.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
That's what I want to ask about that.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Have you was safe in your office?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
I have.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Was that document kept in that state?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Apparently it wasn't, Mr. Welts, I may have said that I wasn't aware of that,

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
so I heard Mr. Caracastopry, and I checked that Mr. Visco Aaron,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
he tells me that that document was in my safe rather than in the committee file.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
May I ask who had his access to your safe?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Others are new and not.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
My, and most of the substance.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I have access.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Mrs. Visco, now I have for some.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I don't think anyone else will come in.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Mr. Tachar, any questions?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I shall pass, under my phone.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
No, the senator is in my right.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Under my left.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Mr. Cohen?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
No, Mr. Welts, no, Mr. Tachar.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
There's also a period senator.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
But at the time, Mr. G. D. W. Cine was at Camp 6.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Some of the files of the committee were in the cone home.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Did you hear that just by do?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Mr. Cohen tells me that when they were working on the reports in New York,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
he took to New York Materials, as you needed,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
and to work on those reports.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
And some in Mr. Shines home.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Uh, within the business.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Uh, and I understand yes.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And some in Mr. Shines office.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I don't know about that.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Well, I think that was so test-fived, too,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
if you asked Mr. Cohen, I think you would confirm that.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Mr. Cohen, so yes, there was material in there, though.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And I take it, uh, those files.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Uh, I'm not so clear about what was in New York,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
but I gathered from what it's been said about them.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
But it makes the summit stamp, those files contained information

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
from private informers.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Uh, will you ask Mr. Cohen whether or not that is so?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, let me have a look at what that says.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
I have a standing rules that, uh, my stamp of void,

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
uh, putting a name for any, uh, government employees

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
to give us information in the files,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
unless that's absolutely necessary.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Now, your question is, when I ask Mr. Cohen whether or not

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
there are any such names and files.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Well, I don't think you need to do what you say to us now.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And what you say makes the,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
and the insistent inquiry to you.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
You spoke to the speak of government employees as informers.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I gather senators.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Let's use the word informant.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Way out informant.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
You know what I mean by the word, don't you?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Uh, except I, uh, I use the word informant rather than informant.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Way out informant.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Well, maybe I could use the word informant.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I don't see any grades in between them.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I use seats of the, of the informant.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Um, as well they are cheaply in government service.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Is that correct or not?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I would say, yes, we get most of the information

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
in regard to wrongdoing from people who are in government.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
Are any of them, uh, think about this a moment before you answer

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
NACM obscure?

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Are any of them anonymous to you in the sense that you even do not know their names?

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Well, we receive, uh, anonymous tips.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Some of them are proved to be completely ignored.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
That, yes.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Of course.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Some, uh, proofs be of some of that.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yes.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
But I'm thinking more of, uh, as to whether or not you actually have informers

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
from the identity they can feel from you,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
although you know them as a person of some, as a person.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Do you mean, uh, have I just just any matter,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
as good information as many of them,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
and have them conceal their name from me?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Right, that's some of the answers. No, the note of that.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Now, one, one or two other questions along this line.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Would you be embarrassed, Senator?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And just think though if you are,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
would you be embarrassed if I asked you to tell us approximately

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
the approximate number of such informers?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I wouldn't be embarrassed by such an suggestion.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Does it run into scores?

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
Mr. Welter, I wouldn't have to be able to tell you as, uh, you know, I think,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
many investigative agencies, each investigator,

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
uh, has his own people who give them information.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
Uh, I never asked any of my investigators, uh, for the names,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
the number of people who give them information.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Uh, I am merely concerned about their getting information,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
about wrongdoing, which I think should be,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
well, may it be public.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
If you were to tell me, Senator, that you would be embarrassed

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
to reveal the number, I think I would have quickly respected

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
the number. No, not anymore.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
But since you are under no embassies, I wish you would give us

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
a notion as to, as of today, let us say,

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
as a number of informants of our in-government services.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
No, I'll.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Mr. Welter, uh,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
I think Mr. Julianna, back here, one of my ex-

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
excellent investigators,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
like Mr. Fungcar here, Mr. Roy Cohn.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
I know they all get information from various people.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Uh, information about wrongdoing,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
since the American people entitled to have.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't have the slightest impression.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Uh, how many people come to that?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Anyone of these young men would get a total of 14 investigations,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I think, right?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Total 14 investigators, how many people, uh,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
give them information, I just don't know.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm thinking now only of yourself.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Can you tell us some notion of how many informants

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
have, as they part direct with you?

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
Oh, that would be impossible, since I...

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
I think after the five percent investigation,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
in the investigation of five percent as in government,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
the information that the government employees then learn,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
that, uh, their identities,

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
but not they made public if they gave us information about wrongdoing.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Uh, we try to get information from them,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
because the number I don't know after the tidings hearings,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and Mr. tidings, others,

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
tried to force me to give the names of those who were giving us information,

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
and I assured,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
that if people in government thought their names were not big,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
given the, uh, 12 information,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
please, again,

17:13.000 --> 17:19.000
I frankly did not give you any idea, uh, Mr. Wells,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
so the number of people is supply-inly within the nation.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Would you think it was more than 100, Senator?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I would not judge.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Now, many are asking this.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Uh, you've knew about the opportunity to extend over the radio and television,

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
and invitation to government employees come to you,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
that these hearings have been going on.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Can you tell us whether advertising pays or not?

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
Just, just any of the truth, I have not had an opportunity to, uh,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
to, uh, examine my mail,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
to, uh, meet people who,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
offer information as I go to this room.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
I think I was button-rolled about three times today by individuals who appeared to be,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
good honest people,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
so they had information to give me.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
I had to tell them that I couldn't stop from the last of this,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
was over, uh,

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
lost the result of my assurance to,

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
the government employees that their names will be protected,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
how much more information will get around doing communism?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Uh, I don't know.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Well, I just, I just hope that an increase in the flow of information.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
You trouble me at one point.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
You say your mail is file left and is not unopened?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
No, I did not.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I, I, I said that I personally have no chance to examine them.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I look at a very efficient staff.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
You, you don't, I think, I think they've been, uh,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
when you give me a good opportunity now that you're else,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
they've explained that people who fly in there,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
letters are not answered.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Absolutely impossible to answer the mail that comes to our office.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
And I'm glad that the,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
my television viewers will know that, uh,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
they just know when Earth,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
with a small office staff that I can answer,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
all of the mail, uh,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
we saw it out the mail from Wisconsin.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
And, uh, I think my staff does a pretty good job of answering that.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Well, now a senator, if you have a,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
seven colleagues,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
just a committee to you,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
who also have a lot of mail.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I'm, I'm sure that's true.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
In fact, I'm sure that, uh, Mr. Jenkins here,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
from what I hear.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Has, had a vast amount of mail.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm sure that doing the job he's been doing,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
he's been unable to even open.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
A great number of those letters.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
And, uh, I hope that,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I hope that you're people back in Tennessee.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Realized it's not, uh,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
a lack of a desire to answer them.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
I think I screwed all the numbers.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
But, uh, just, uh,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
no possible he's doing it.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
But now a senator,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
you, uh, you have a new chair to say something about a guy he needs.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Well,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I, sir, have a little trickle of mail.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
A trickle I would say compared to yours.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And I'm very happy to say some of it says

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
that I'm seen to them quite a good lawyer.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
And some of them say they're about the worst they ever heard.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
And in either event,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
whether they praise me or blame me,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I haven't had a chance to answer them either.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
And I guess they all understand that.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Now, as to you senator,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
as to Mr. Cohen,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
and I happen to know that I have had a very heavy mail.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
And I'm sure it's true.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I'm sure it's true everyone on this side of the table.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
It is not impossible to do the work that we have had to do.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
The finance of that may be.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Can I say, Mr. Wells,

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
that, uh,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
to those of you who are a good lawyer,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I would like to, uh,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
add to the House of the Palace,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
as not they became to Wellstake.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
But I think that you have, uh,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
uh,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
fought this lawsuit,

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
you can call that,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
made good,

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
hard,

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
rough,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
fashion,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
uh,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
it's the American tradition.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
You and I might have agreed.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Disagree, and what,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
uh, you might do some days,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
and I might do some days.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
But, uh,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I think you've, uh,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
fought a very good fight with an impossible case.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
Well,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I don't know whether it's actually cast

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
them or all of adversaries or not,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
but I might turn it right around

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
and then you've fought an excellent fight

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
with what I hope, sir,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
and believed to be a losing case.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Thank you.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
I was inquiring about your mail only in this respect.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Although it gave us an opportunity to say something about it,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
it would make me uneasy to think that it all

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
had been sent to a little attention as given.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
We have any of these confidential documents bouncing around.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You suppose they're our senator?

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
I wouldn't say a little attention was given to it.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Uh, I believe we received, uh,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
uh,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
oh, I think I'll ask that as much as around

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
seven or eight thousand letters a day.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I've got, I think,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
eight girls in the office.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Uh, obviously they can have answered all those letters.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
We try and give the mail the best possible attention.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
I think my pop-up staff is doing, uh,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
just an outstanding job.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Are those girls sufficiently trained

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
so that if a confidential FBI document

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
from some disgruntled employee bounced in,

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
they know what it was?

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Well, number one, let's not talk about a disgruntled employee.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
If anyone knows the wrong doing,

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
he doesn't have to be disgruntled.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Well, let's face it.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
You don't have to let me finish the letter.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Let's face it.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Take your out.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
This is a very important point.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
You have the inside to

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
intimate the flows

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
to give us information wrong doing our disgruntled.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Well, to else,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
all these sundries at the table here,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
and including myself,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
have been, uh,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
given the highest job this nation can offer.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That is the man who's the man who's the worst-tower explanation.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Anybody who knows that he's wrong doing,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
or is an absolute truthy

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
to bring the information to us.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
There's not a case of being disgruntled.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's a case of loyalty.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And many of them risk their jobs.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Risk their jobs to do that.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
We've been all through that, Senator,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and I think we don't retire each other,

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
and those that listen to us,

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
we'll go through it anytime you will,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and the disgruntled.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Uh, let's say that we have an unhappy employee.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
Well, one that thinks his boss doesn't move swiftly enough.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
That's where the pink comes with me, Senator,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
on this scheme of yours.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
So maybe cases where patience is required to catch Communists.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
You can understand such a situation, can't you?

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
I have no patience with a Communist family in Cyprus.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I think Senator, you either miss Sunday.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I think Senator, you either miss Sunday.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Senator, I'm glad to hear you again today.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
You're welcome.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Mr. Jenkins, any questions?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
I, Cheryl, pass, on to my phone,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
or any of the sundries on my left.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Any sundries on my right?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Mr. Collins, back to you, Mr. Wilson, have another time.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I think Senator, you either miss Sunday.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Or, purposefully change what I said.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
I said there are, can be circumstances where in the pursuit of Communists or subversives,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
patience is a great virtue.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Is that not right, sir?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
What?

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
And you answered me by saying you have no patience with Communists.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
I haven't either, sir.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
But when it comes to tracking them down, finding out who their friends are,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
finding out whether they may actually have espionage features

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
and spit amurally subversive or poor security risk features,

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
patience sometimes is required, isn't it?

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Mr. Wilson, I mean, instead of getting a yes or no answer,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
I think the patience with Algebra hits ten years of patience.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
The patience with halidextra point has done unlimited damage to this nation.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
I think there are a great number of young men dead today because of that patience

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
if you want to call them.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
It was more than as far as I am concerned.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
I have no patience with a man who is guilty of treason.

24:30.000 --> 24:38.000
I will agree with you however, but I'm typing down Communists that sometimes

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
the investigation may be long, may be tedious, it may take months and months.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
That's right, sir.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Now you have said what I hoped you would say because that's quite obvious.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
My trouble senator comes at this point.

24:52.000 --> 24:59.000
If you have a threatful, impetuous employee who sees an FBI document

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
in his boss's hands and doesn't see immediate results,

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
I get a little nervous about that threatful, impetuous fellow.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
For fear he will shoot it over to you before his boss has had a chance

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
to be patient about tracking down the Communists.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Do you ever have any uneasiness from that point, senator?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Mr. Wilson.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
If the answer that you do or don't, Mr. Wilson, unless until

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
you can give us one eye over whatever,

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
showing that we've been too impetuous and exposing Communists.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
We've been too impatient.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
The question is a much question.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Senator.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
We take each piece of information we get.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
We evaluate it and up until this time Mr. Wilson,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I have said that probably in here you have 36 days.

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
No one has accused us of exposing a Communist who should not have been exposed.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
No one has accused us of following a witness who should not have been called.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Now your question, I'm sure you don't mean it that way.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Your question intimates that maybe we've been rushing anything blindly.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
If we have been, I'm sure.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
I'm sure that the Sumters here, you would have exposed us back long before the closing day.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
Senator, you just messed my question and we don't have any other job there in the dark.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm not talking about your impatience, sir.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
You've never exposed the Communists too suddenly for me or too suddenly for Mr. Robert Steven.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Thank you.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
I am talking about the guy that may have the copy of the document.
