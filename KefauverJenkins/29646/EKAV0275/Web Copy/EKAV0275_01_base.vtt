00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
The time just with the investigators are taking a few days' rest and finding future activities

00:06.720 --> 00:07.720
with the committee.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.720
Is it true Senator, that you were there?

00:09.720 --> 00:12.720
I've been in the house for a few days before I wasn't making full, and I think I know

00:12.720 --> 00:13.720
what you were.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.720
I wouldn't call the rest, I was clear.

00:14.720 --> 00:15.720
We were working on...

00:15.720 --> 00:19.200
No, the committee goes over the weekend.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.680
And what is fair to say?

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
I...

00:21.680 --> 00:23.880
I might say that Irencies a little.

00:23.880 --> 00:24.880
Two.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.480
More than we'll take a bosn.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.560
I've just been from what you have told me, that is fair to say.

00:29.560 --> 00:35.400
That your relationship with David Chine developed reasonably rapidly into at least an

00:35.400 --> 00:38.400
noticeably close social relationship with his family.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.400
Is that right?

00:39.400 --> 00:43.400
I had a very little social contact with his family.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
What?

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
I...

00:45.400 --> 00:49.400
The way it is, I think he was a very valuable man.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.400
I'm not discussing that, Senator.

00:51.400 --> 00:59.120
I only know that what extent you became a social guest and presenter.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.920
What do you think you're trying to find?

01:01.920 --> 01:03.280
Practically not at all.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.200
I may have said that I hadn't...

01:05.200 --> 01:10.760
Practically no social activity since we got in this investigation.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.520
Well, then if you have any family days where you left this...

01:14.520 --> 01:17.960
Their home, that late...

01:17.960 --> 01:19.960
How long has it been?

01:19.960 --> 01:22.960
I don't see...

01:22.960 --> 01:24.640
I think I'm in a Saturday.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.640
I might have been fighting with them Saturday.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.640
I left to make a speech.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.640
If I was in Syria...

01:31.640 --> 01:33.640
In Syria, at the end of the day.

01:33.640 --> 01:41.640
And on September 16th, we know he was born a night at the Shrine of Fire, but do we not?

01:41.640 --> 01:46.640
I don't think I was a mere part from that night.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.640
I don't expect the...

01:48.640 --> 01:51.640
The use of the night of the 15th, then, sir.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.640
I don't know.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.640
I have breakfast, I know, in the morning at a 16th, yes.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.640
I have to spend the night before at the Shrine of Fire.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.640
I might well have been a...

02:01.640 --> 02:03.640
My cousin told us no.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.640
And you were there at the dinner party on October 13th, weren't you?

02:06.640 --> 02:07.640
The party.

02:07.640 --> 02:11.640
And you were there at the dinner party on October 13th.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.640
No, no, no, no, sir.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.640
But they're not at dinner party.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.640
In the hall door, but not in the other party.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.640
On the night of October 13th, it's what you were again.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.640
There was a dinner party.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.640
It was not the party of the Shrine.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.640
Chairman, at this point, I might make a short point of personal privilege.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.640
I did not see fit the interrupt, Mr. Stevens,

02:40.640 --> 02:42.640
or only his testimony when he gave it.

02:42.640 --> 02:48.640
He said that on the night of October 13th, he attended a dinner party,

02:48.640 --> 02:50.640
given by Mr. and Mrs. Shrine,

02:50.640 --> 02:54.640
whose parents met Senator McCarthy was present and some other people.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.640
That was not true.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.640
Mr. and Mrs. Shrine did not give it in a party.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.640
They were not there.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.640
They were not present.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.640
As far as I know, they weren't even in New York.

03:05.640 --> 03:09.640
Senator McCarthy had just returned from his honeymoon in higher range.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.640
They get together with some of his good friends for him.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.640
I think it was the first day he had returned.

03:15.640 --> 03:20.640
I had Senator and Mrs. McCarthy and Mrs. McCarthy's mother

03:20.640 --> 03:23.640
and a few of our mutual personal friends.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.640
The Senator asked that he could bring Mr. Stevens along and be dead.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.640
I think Mr. Stevens had called the Senator in Wisconsin over the weekend

03:31.640 --> 03:34.640
and asked the Senator to be his guest at dinner that same night.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.640
The conflict and engagement developed.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.640
The Senator asked that he could bring Mr. Stevens along.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.640
I was very happy to have Mr. Stevens come along on that occasion.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.640
Mr. Shrine did not give the party.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.640
They were not present at the party.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.640
Mr. Stevens was in error when he testified here.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.640
Yes, sir.

03:53.640 --> 03:57.640
The amount of television that worked is bringing to your children's facilities.

03:57.640 --> 04:02.640
In any event, I think it's quite clear that on the night of September 16th,

04:02.640 --> 04:08.640
you were at the Shrine of Pipe and that Mr. Stevens was invited to come there the next morning.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.640
On the night of 15th and on the morning of the 16th.

04:11.640 --> 04:18.640
I'm sorry, first day of that matter, frankly.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.640
I can't recall what this is.

04:20.640 --> 04:28.640
Did you earn that occasion and the bad address discussed with Secretary Stevens

04:28.640 --> 04:32.640
a possible commission for G. David Shrine?

04:32.640 --> 04:34.640
Yes.

04:34.640 --> 04:44.640
And did you refer to that discussion in a telegram of March 12th, 1954,

04:44.640 --> 04:46.640
with two censors, Mr. Stevens?

04:46.640 --> 04:48.640
You left the show with a letter of applause.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.640
I have it here and I assume you have a copy.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.640
I don't have any copy here.

04:52.640 --> 04:59.640
It can be handed to you and either you may look at it and you may read it if you wish into the records.

05:04.640 --> 05:11.640
Yes.

05:11.640 --> 05:24.640
This is a, frankly, an actor, the top user of the wire I sent.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.640
Would you like to be read it in the record?

05:27.640 --> 05:29.640
You may read it if you'd like.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.640
I wanted it in the record.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.640
Secretary of the Army, Stevens, in view of news stories this morning,

05:35.640 --> 05:40.640
regards Colin Shrine, I would appreciate if you would make it clear to the class

05:40.640 --> 05:47.640
that the only time you and I ever discussed the subject of a commission for David Shrine

05:47.640 --> 05:54.640
was in his presence at Putz-Mammer Earth and you fully agreed that his case

05:54.640 --> 05:58.640
had to be treated the same as the case of any other draftee and that we agreed

05:58.640 --> 06:03.640
that any other handling of the case in view of the investigation of the Army

06:03.640 --> 06:08.640
would be extremely bad for the committee and the Army and that David Shrine was present

06:08.640 --> 06:14.640
and fully agreed with us in this matter signed Joe McCartney.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.640
They had to tell a grand back now because I'll be wanting to look at it.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.640
So you're mine back to the moment to that weekend if it was a weekend

06:22.640 --> 06:27.640
when you were at the Shrine home on Lake Corova.

06:27.640 --> 06:33.640
Is it not a fact, Senator, that within the very few days after that visit on your part

06:33.640 --> 06:40.640
you were busy with dental reaper in an effort to procure information for David Shrine?

06:40.640 --> 06:46.640
No. Well, it's what time did you begin to have some contact with dental reaper in respect

06:46.640 --> 06:49.640
to a week of mission for David Shrine?

06:49.640 --> 06:52.640
If I couldn't give you the big reaper, it's hard to find the big deal with the office.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.640
I don't recall the big deal.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.640
No, it was early in July, do we not?

06:57.640 --> 06:59.640
No, it's a big deal.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.640
Do you want to have the accident on some?

07:02.640 --> 07:03.640
I'm sorry.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.640
July the eighth, right.

07:05.640 --> 07:09.640
And it remains, too, whether it is significant or not,

07:09.640 --> 07:13.640
that on June 22nd you were a guest in your family's home.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.640
I couldn't give you the date. I told you I was a guest.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.640
I only go over to home.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.640
I can't give you any specific date as of now.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.640
I told you this in your testimony.

07:24.640 --> 07:29.640
That the one thing you did about Dave Shrine, which might not have been fair to him,

07:29.640 --> 07:34.640
was to lean over backwards in respect to his having aching aching or any special favor.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.640
That's incorrect.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.640
Would you tell us what is correct?

07:38.640 --> 07:41.640
I told you that I was Bob Stevens.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.640
I told you, over backwards, and handling the shine takes us well.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.640
You wish yourself to lean over backwards, too, or not?

07:48.640 --> 07:52.640
I told you, Mr. Wells, I told Bob Stevens, lean over backwards.

07:52.640 --> 07:58.640
By a final concern, I did nothing before curing a commission for Dave Shrine,

07:58.640 --> 08:04.640
except to have a liaison officer explain to him how he would file an application.

08:04.640 --> 08:08.640
Ask a liaison officer whether or not he would be entitled an application.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
He said, yes.

08:09.640 --> 08:13.640
Well, I think I am pleased that you also produced yesterday.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.640
But you started my signature on his application.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.640
I think it has been cleared up, but it is incorrect.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.640
I signed the lawyer of the...

08:21.640 --> 08:24.640
I signed as a witness in the lawyer of the orchestra.

08:24.640 --> 08:29.640
Well, that's on the occasion of September 16th,

08:29.640 --> 08:33.640
that you told Secretary Stevens that he should lean over backwards.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.640
It was only morning with breakfast and the Shrine of Park,

08:36.640 --> 08:39.640
when I believe it was April 16th, on the right of the state.

08:39.640 --> 08:44.640
Did it not seem to you, Senator, that it was equally important for you to lean over backwards?

08:44.640 --> 08:48.640
I took no part whatsoever in the obtaining of any commission,

08:48.640 --> 08:50.640
so I didn't have to do any leanings at all.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.640
Well, had you taken any part?

08:52.640 --> 08:55.640
You were the wish to lean over backwards, just as you wished.

08:55.640 --> 08:56.640
I seconded it. I took no part.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.640
No, but had you taken any part,

08:58.640 --> 09:00.640
but where do we found you did anything about it?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.640
I just told you that I took no part by any commission.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.640
But why is it your personal desire to lean over backwards?

09:06.640 --> 09:09.640
Well, if I want to continue the sewing or ring we can,

09:09.640 --> 09:11.640
I told you I took no part.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.640
I told you exactly what it is in regards to Dave Shrine.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.640
Was it yours for you to say now, if I did take a part, what would I have done?

09:17.640 --> 09:21.640
Was it your personal desire to do so?

09:21.640 --> 09:25.640
Should it appear to lean over backwards about Dave and Shrine?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.640
It was a time to decide which answer the question.

09:27.640 --> 09:31.640
We answered like a few parts, depending on your commission for Shrine.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.640
Wait.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.640
Tell us, Senator Shrine.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.640
Before the next question, you ask much for turn to ask.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.640
Could you help me?

09:37.640 --> 09:41.640
Senator, I was right, I was very cruel.

09:41.640 --> 09:49.640
If we may, I'll get back to the document and tell you a few things my paragraph was to ask you about.

09:49.640 --> 09:55.640
I'll read some very little, dry lots of well on them until we get those.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.640
The beginning of the page of your review.

09:57.640 --> 10:01.640
I hate loving it, this memory of how they have,

10:01.640 --> 10:04.640
a paragraph 19.

10:04.640 --> 10:09.640
We went to the States after mid-September when the chairman directed open hearings

10:09.640 --> 10:12.640
on the Communist-Win Police Station in the Army.

10:12.640 --> 10:17.640
Mr. Stone, whose main John G. Adams to the post-Evarmate council

10:17.640 --> 10:22.640
for the considerable purpose of who handling the committee,

10:22.640 --> 10:30.640
and for saving it, the sea ships and the investigation of Communist-Win Police in the Army.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.640
I'm sure you believed that to be true at that time,

10:34.640 --> 10:36.640
and at the time that statement was filed.

10:36.640 --> 10:44.640
And when I tell your attention to number 23,

10:44.640 --> 10:47.640
the next page, and I read it as follows,

10:47.640 --> 10:55.640
as a part of the attempt to halt the committee's investigation of Communist-Infiltration in the Army,

10:55.640 --> 11:00.640
Mr. Adams, frequently and Mr. Stevens, on two occasions,

11:00.640 --> 11:06.640
offered up the major draft portion of the fence establishment proper

11:06.640 --> 11:14.640
as substance-fifth targets as follows and then you support in some five or six.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.640
In some eight other paragraphs, I believe,

11:22.640 --> 11:26.640
specific instances in which this attempt was made,

11:26.640 --> 11:29.640
are both true and correct, Senator.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.640
Two leave of us, the one who was here a minute late,

11:32.640 --> 11:38.640
Mr. McComb, that November six meeting is one that I have personal knowledge of.

11:38.640 --> 11:43.640
You do have personal knowledge, yes, that is true, yes sir.

11:43.640 --> 11:50.640
Number 32, from 1912 through January 1954,

11:51.640 --> 11:57.640
Mr. Adams sought on numerous occasions to secure from the German and subcommittee staff,

11:57.640 --> 12:04.640
a promise of silence that he and Mr. Stevens spoke, both unfolds, general law,

12:04.640 --> 12:09.640
commanding general of both members and relieving of this command.

12:09.640 --> 12:14.640
Is that one also true within your personal knowledge of what it's true?

12:14.640 --> 12:19.640
When I call your attention to number 46,

12:20.640 --> 12:29.640
from my reading, the pattern followed by Secretary Stevens and Mr. Adams is clear.

12:29.640 --> 12:36.640
As long as only individual communists were objects of the subcommittee's investigation,

12:36.640 --> 12:41.640
they made continuing offers of cooperation with the investigation.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.640
I think this one is pretty significant, Senator.

12:45.640 --> 12:52.640
Next, Senator Lee, but as soon as the vote turns to the implements laid,

12:52.640 --> 12:56.640
more important questions,

12:56.640 --> 13:02.640
or who was responsible for protecting communist infiltration

13:02.640 --> 13:06.640
and protecting communists who had infiltrated,

13:07.640 --> 13:14.640
or reconceivable obstacle was placed in the path of the committee's search for the truth.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.640
The correct, is that statement true, some little truth.

13:18.640 --> 13:23.640
Now let me ask you Senator, one or two more questions, I think I shall ask including.

13:23.640 --> 13:29.640
As I recall, you testified in your direct examination possible,

13:29.640 --> 13:33.640
or somewhere in the course of your examination,

13:33.640 --> 13:37.640
by the charges issued by Mr. Stevens.

13:37.640 --> 13:46.640
If, please, I guess Mr. Cohn and Mr. Shine, the particular image of Cohn,

13:46.640 --> 13:50.640
for its damage, they have to spare application.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.640
Is that correct? New person of them.

13:53.640 --> 14:01.640
One Senator, if the charge is you have made against Secretary Stevens and Mr. Adams,

14:01.640 --> 14:04.640
and the charge is part two,

14:04.640 --> 14:09.640
two days non-also damage, where applications are.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.640
It's a certain word in him, stir-up position, I assume.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.640
All I'm doing here is, I understand, but Senator, yes, what I'm doing.

14:17.640 --> 14:23.640
Yes, I assume that they've proved here that they have been trying to call off these hearings,

14:23.640 --> 14:27.640
won't help the reputation of Mr. Stevens or his madam.

14:28.640 --> 14:38.640
Senator, Senator, you are referred to the charges of the chronological statement of events,

14:38.640 --> 14:44.640
as well as the, if we may term them that, the formal charges filed by the committee,

14:44.640 --> 14:49.640
by Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams of those representatives,

14:49.640 --> 14:56.640
as if they're through being smeared, in fact, in the arms, who are not through their smeared.

14:56.640 --> 15:01.640
And if the charge is, if those charges are on the tools, then they have,

15:01.640 --> 15:05.640
and would be calculated certainly to damage the character.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.640
No question about that.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.640
And I think that's also the best part,

15:09.640 --> 15:12.640
very good, that's a, Senator McCormick.

15:12.640 --> 15:16.640
And if the charges, if those charges are on tools, then they have,

15:16.640 --> 15:20.640
and would be calculated certainly to damage the character.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.640
No, no, you speak of it.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.640
No question about that.

15:24.640 --> 15:30.640
Well, I think that's Senator McCormick's effect, that originally there was no,

15:30.640 --> 15:34.640
there were no charges against us to, uh, uh, charge,

15:34.640 --> 15:37.640
give us a draw drag into the last minute.

15:37.640 --> 15:41.640
Charges made against him, but no evidence has been addressed to, uh,

15:41.640 --> 15:43.640
substantiated those charges.

15:43.640 --> 15:44.640
Well, yes, sir.

15:44.640 --> 15:53.640
One son of a, four-three charges made by you against Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams,

15:53.640 --> 15:59.640
were there unprovenly with these smears and calculated the damage character too within us.

15:59.640 --> 16:05.640
If they run through, then there was, there was very, very improper things of issues in them that they are true.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.640
Here, I'm saying you've done something that we're not arguing that now,

16:08.640 --> 16:12.640
but they were constitute smears with the damage character.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.640
If they run through, yes.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.640
If they run through, yes.

16:15.640 --> 16:22.640
But actually, now then, Senator, can you reconcile for me something that I can't understand?

16:22.640 --> 16:32.640
How you could make these charges which are serious to me and I am for them and I make sure I'm not responsible for it.

16:32.640 --> 16:43.640
And then reconcile them with your testimony that Mr. Stevens is a man of honor and integrity.

16:43.640 --> 16:51.640
I said that I knew nothing discernible about Stevens actions except in regard to the first case and regard to these charges.

16:51.640 --> 16:58.640
Well, do you now decide that his charges will get respect for his honest?

16:58.640 --> 17:03.640
The charges are just honest, but if we make it again clear, Senator, and I have repeated this so often,

17:03.640 --> 17:05.640
I don't like to bore our audience with them.

17:05.640 --> 17:10.640
But Mr. Stevens, you'll find, from one of her calls, protested again and again.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.640
So he was willing to testify.

17:13.640 --> 17:20.640
He testified that, rather than the one of her calls, you'll find that he said in a fact that there were just really nothing to these charges.

17:20.640 --> 17:27.640
Now, the thing that remains secret is who introduced Stevens in the three days of his reign.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.640
The wish of the charge is overdid.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.640
Overdid, I think, is the honest me on word.

17:32.640 --> 17:37.640
Well, don't you think, like I said, he's in the honor of me and the responsibility.

17:37.640 --> 17:45.640
He's the man, whether he's cute, influenced, well naive, or whatever he is, he's the man responsible.

17:45.640 --> 17:52.640
Well, the man assigned the charges of Mr. Welts, who gave Mr. Welts the most well-known line,

17:52.640 --> 17:56.640
the chronological statement of events.

17:56.640 --> 18:03.640
Mr. Welts, what was that, was the issue before and the formal charges simply re-88 and such when so.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.640
That's not right. You'll find a great variance.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.640
Number one, the chronological statement of events were all on the sign, I believe.

18:10.640 --> 18:18.640
We find that they were prepared, cutting material, testimony and conjunction with four or five members of the press.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.640
To put it mildly, it certainly hasn't been a sweat of it.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.640
I would have.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.640
Friendly for exposure, coming in.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.640
I would have both the thought they had.

18:27.640 --> 18:32.640
Including what a man was honest, what a man was integrity, who had the issue,

18:32.640 --> 18:38.640
was chronological statement of the books against me, where they were not told.

18:38.640 --> 18:43.640
Mr. Welts, let me say, I think that the charges made were extremely dissonance.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.640
Sure, yes.

18:44.640 --> 18:51.640
Now, we know that Mr. Welts signed them as a lawyer, I assume, that he nearly got information,

18:51.640 --> 18:56.640
relied upon it information, and did not think of any of these charges himself.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
That's what lawyer does.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.640
Now, who gave him the information?

18:59.640 --> 19:02.640
Who was responsible for this document?

19:02.640 --> 19:07.640
I don't know, I tried to get that from Bob Stevens, I don't know, I've got a bad tone, I've got a bad tone.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.640
I've got a bad tone, I've got a bad tone, I've got a bad tone, I've got a bad tone, I've got a bad tone.

19:09.640 --> 19:13.640
I tried to get that from Bob Stevens, you recall, first he said, I did not put out the charges,

19:13.640 --> 19:15.640
but I had nothing to do with it in the fight.

19:15.640 --> 19:20.640
Many writers said, yes, I have put them out, and still later he said, no, I did not.

19:20.640 --> 19:25.640
And you were three with me, though, I don't know at this point.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.640
You were three with me that he must take the responsibility of man in his position,

19:30.640 --> 19:35.640
and having the responsibility that he must accept the purpose of these hearings.

19:35.640 --> 19:39.640
Yes, in the turn of command, here's the man who is responsible.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.640
Here's the man who has the responsibility.

19:42.640 --> 19:47.640
He has the responsibility, but I don't want to try to tell you that I said, Bob Stevens.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.640
That's what I knew, I don't know.

19:50.640 --> 19:55.640
So, just for this statement, if the gentleman I'll think I can conclude,

19:55.640 --> 19:58.640
I ask you these questions, they call.

19:58.640 --> 20:04.640
I have been trying to understand how we could regard a man as honest and a man of integrity

20:04.640 --> 20:10.640
that would deliberately and willfully issue a thought document like this,

20:10.640 --> 20:17.640
a follow-up of the dance, and then follow-up of these charges before committed like this,

20:17.640 --> 20:22.640
and then still be a little charge of one who's got the offer of him.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.640
There's a man of honor and integrity.

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
Did I say that?

20:26.640 --> 20:30.640
And that he's finally stopped the investigation of coming,

20:30.640 --> 20:33.640
it's actually his patriotism so far, Bob, I'm sorry.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.640
You can actually send her an answer to that.

20:35.640 --> 20:44.640
That the filing of the false fraudulent charges are a complete contradiction of all I know about Bob Stevens.

20:44.640 --> 20:50.640
In all of our contacts, up until the time these charges were filed, there was liquor case,

20:50.640 --> 20:58.640
I could find nothing of these conducts that indicate the use of paper man with filed these false charges.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.640
But that means that I can't reconcile.

21:00.640 --> 21:09.640
I can't reconcile the man Stevens that I knew and worked with with an individual throughout these charges.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.640
Up at most points when I say we're still in the dark,

21:13.640 --> 21:23.640
who it was who dreamed of this most dishonest, this most fraudulent attack which has not been proven so far.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.640
I don't think it was Bob Stevens.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.640
Before filing our contradiction, the charges agreed to recognize

21:29.640 --> 21:33.640
Senator Simon gives the purposes of correcting his statement, he's very amazing, he's sure to...

21:33.640 --> 21:34.640
Thank you, Senator.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.640
The official correction.

21:35.640 --> 21:36.640
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.640
I'd like you now to prove the claim that may I say.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.640
What is there in it for us, the black communism?

21:41.640 --> 21:46.640
What I would meant to say, of course, what is there in it for us, the black investigation of communism?

21:46.640 --> 21:49.640
I'll ask unanimous approval of the committee.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.640
That's right.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.640
That's right.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.640
I'd like to raise the point of personal privilege for Mr. Welch, if I may.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.640
It's now 1230.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.640
We normally, during the 1230,

21:58.640 --> 22:05.640
and I think Mr. Welch and Ryan White prefer having a recess, right?

22:06.640 --> 22:09.640
It was...it was seen so well.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.640
It was seen so, Mr. Chairman, that is...

22:11.640 --> 22:12.640
I think it would be...

22:12.640 --> 22:15.640
Well, it would be better run out of a cheapest for 1130.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.640
Detained a lesser than today.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.640
For me, I'll make a parliamentary inquiry.

22:20.640 --> 22:26.640
In support, I know my colleagues, Mr. Edward Worshack and Mr. Potter, have no further questions.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.640
I have no further questions particularly.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.640
I wonder therefore if the chair cared to run through,

22:32.640 --> 22:36.640
depending on how long it would take Mr. Welch to complete his examination?

22:36.640 --> 22:42.640
I think it's quite clear both to the senator and to me that it would be sensible to have our regular adjournment.

22:42.640 --> 22:43.640
I...

22:43.640 --> 22:49.640
The challenge of closing the questioning is, finally, it's maybe when we resume.

22:49.640 --> 22:54.640
And, just being here, he's doing a conclusion this day.

22:54.640 --> 23:01.640
The chair will usually be unfair to Mr. Welch to put him under the pressure of the lunch hour.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.640
And I'll turn it too much to Worshack and committee members.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.640
Because more time is morning than he anticipated, I'm sure.

23:07.640 --> 23:12.640
And I think it might be appropriate if he were to make the customary recess and reconvene into it.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.640
So, please, please, please, please, please.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.640
Well, I'll explain it.
