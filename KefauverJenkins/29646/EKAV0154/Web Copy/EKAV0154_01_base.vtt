WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.580
We must have had access to the original, because the

00:04.580 --> 00:06.340
identical language is contained therein.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.940
Is it still restricted to far, if the I was concerned,

00:09.940 --> 00:13.820
Mr. Hoover told me, and as I've stated to the committee,

00:13.820 --> 00:16.960
beginning of this testimony, that it

00:16.960 --> 00:20.460
carries the highest classification, the built and placed

00:20.460 --> 00:25.700
on the document, confidential, that he does not feel that he

00:25.700 --> 00:28.600
has any right to declassify.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.900
Does Mr. Hoover expect to you any concern about his

00:31.900 --> 00:35.200
having been relieved?

00:35.200 --> 00:36.060
No, sir, he did not.

00:36.060 --> 00:36.740
He did not.

00:36.740 --> 00:37.540
Right.

00:37.540 --> 00:38.900
I don't know what he feels.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.580
Hey, other passengers, do you know that?

00:40.580 --> 00:41.580
No questions.

00:41.580 --> 00:42.780
Do you know up to any first one?

00:42.780 --> 00:43.580
And rejection?

00:43.580 --> 00:47.180
Part of the question is, why is purified one point?

00:47.180 --> 00:51.060
And that is that in addition to the fact that the paragraphs,

00:51.060 --> 00:55.260
all except one were the same, I think he will agree that there

00:55.260 --> 00:58.500
and I'm sure Mr. Collier will agree that there was one

00:58.500 --> 01:01.380
other matter overlooked in which there is no similarity.

01:01.380 --> 01:05.060
And that's the argumentation at the beginning and at the end.

01:05.060 --> 01:05.560
Am I right?

01:05.560 --> 01:07.860
As I testified, the form is completely different

01:07.860 --> 01:08.620
in the few memorandum.

01:08.620 --> 01:12.100
In other words, Mr. Hoover's name at the end,

01:12.100 --> 01:13.780
his name was the beginning.

01:13.780 --> 01:18.420
Yeah, the 15 page document was an interdepartmental memorandum,

01:18.420 --> 01:21.220
which does not require a signature.

01:21.220 --> 01:25.580
This one would send by a signature,

01:25.580 --> 01:27.660
which would require a signature at the end.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.140
And fairly yours, I mean, you would have to sign his name.

01:30.140 --> 01:33.620
Well, Mr. Collier, you asked me a question.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.220
You asked me to clear something up.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.580
Yeah, I would have it like that.

01:36.580 --> 01:40.060
Part of the question, I would like you if I may, with your permission.

01:40.060 --> 01:43.340
So no question that seems from Jan Hoover was directed

01:43.340 --> 01:45.940
to General Bowling.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.860
Regardless whether his name was at the beginning or his end,

01:48.860 --> 01:50.140
regardless whether he signed it or not.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.540
There is no question that the 15 page document

01:52.540 --> 01:53.660
went to General Bowling.

01:53.660 --> 01:54.660
That's not me.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.660
Well, now, let's go to Mr. Collier.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.140
And there's no question.

01:59.140 --> 02:02.140
But the 200 fourth quarter page letter,

02:02.140 --> 02:06.220
there's no four committee never came from Mr. Hoover in that form.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.820
It was not prepared for the FBI.

02:08.820 --> 02:13.620
Well, let's give a, Mr. Hoover.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.660
Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Justice,

02:16.660 --> 02:19.180
you heard it, Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Washington, right?

02:19.180 --> 02:23.460
Just one question, Mr. Collier, would you look at what I have referred

02:23.460 --> 02:26.580
to as the hot letter again?

02:26.580 --> 02:31.100
And would you tell us there if you were found anywhere in Washington

02:31.100 --> 02:35.940
an original letter of what's the document before you could be said

02:35.940 --> 02:37.700
to be a carbon copy?

02:37.700 --> 02:40.740
I have not found the original of any document,

02:40.740 --> 02:43.420
reporting to be the original of this document,

02:43.420 --> 02:46.660
but I have not investigated it.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.260
What do you mean you haven't looked everywhere

02:48.260 --> 02:48.940
under the sun?

02:48.940 --> 02:49.740
Yes, sir.

02:49.740 --> 02:50.460
I have not.

02:53.460 --> 02:56.100
And if I cry, do you have any further questions?

02:56.100 --> 02:56.900
Yes.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.940
I would like to, Mr. Chairman, at this time,

02:59.940 --> 03:03.180
view the fact that our trust will be made to the attorney general.

03:03.180 --> 03:04.380
This material has been made public.

03:04.380 --> 03:08.940
I would like to ask, counsel for Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adam,

03:08.940 --> 03:14.420
this fellow or not, they would object to this being made public.

03:14.420 --> 03:15.940
Now that we've established all the letter,

03:15.940 --> 03:21.740
except the security material, the new vascular would be released.

03:21.740 --> 03:23.300
If the attorney general is an object,

03:23.300 --> 03:26.580
and I think this might be a guiding factor in his making

03:26.580 --> 03:29.620
to his decision, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adam's

03:29.620 --> 03:31.740
object to this being made public.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.340
That might influence Mr. Brown and all,

03:33.340 --> 03:34.940
and I'm not too sure of that.

03:34.940 --> 03:36.980
But you're all now that we know that the MAC Church

03:36.980 --> 03:42.060
report from FBI.

03:42.060 --> 03:46.020
Would you join with me and ask me if the American people know us?

03:46.020 --> 03:48.060
Then I'm going to talk to you.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.300
I will join with you in two propositions.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.860
I will join with you in a search for the truth

03:52.860 --> 03:54.980
as to how your committee got it.

03:54.980 --> 03:56.740
And I will join with you in an effort

03:56.740 --> 03:58.820
to get the opinion of the attorney general

03:58.820 --> 04:02.500
as to how much you've got this here before it should do any public.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.820
Well, I guess you're not on the role

04:03.820 --> 04:06.220
of black men proxies now, and you're not.

04:06.220 --> 04:09.380
Mr. Chalier, do you know?

04:12.780 --> 04:16.580
It's like an ordinary, let me be asking you some questions.

04:16.580 --> 04:17.180
You can't answer.

04:17.180 --> 04:17.700
I don't know.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.380
All right.

04:18.380 --> 04:19.220
I'll tell you.

04:19.220 --> 04:21.980
Don't hesitate.

04:21.980 --> 04:25.180
Normally, when an FBI report is sent out,

04:25.180 --> 04:29.140
one of the threats that we have here, the abbreviated form,

04:29.140 --> 04:31.100
this is a memory I'm not reporting.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.500
Remember, let's talk about the memorandum.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.900
I'm sorry.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.820
Neither a letter nor a report in the memorandum.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.380
When you have the names of some, or 30, 30, 40,

04:40.380 --> 04:43.180
40 individuals, I don't know how many.

04:43.180 --> 04:49.060
Some of them are apparently on which

04:49.060 --> 04:51.020
they're from this evaluation.

04:51.020 --> 04:53.620
There's no drug or information.

04:53.620 --> 04:56.260
There will be the normal procedure for a horrible repeat

04:56.260 --> 05:02.740
that to make a copy or a summary and have this put

05:02.740 --> 05:06.660
in the file of each individual who has mentioned them in the report.

05:06.660 --> 05:08.860
Senator McCarty, I can only answer that by saying,

05:08.860 --> 05:12.380
I think that depends upon the policies

05:12.380 --> 05:14.700
of the department or agency concerns.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.180
I say, thank you very much.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.860
No further questions, Mr. Chairman.

05:17.860 --> 05:22.420
Is everybody concluded the questioning of Mr. Carter?

05:22.420 --> 05:25.020
Yes, sir, you may step down and be unspoiled, Mr. Carter.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.500
And thank you again.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.740
Mr. Counsel, you may follow the next report.

05:28.740 --> 05:32.980
Mr. Chairman, the file of purpose of further pursuing

05:32.980 --> 05:37.500
the inquiry relating to the two documents.

05:37.500 --> 05:41.020
The one referred to as the two-in-the-quarter page document

05:41.020 --> 05:43.260
dated January 26th.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.780
The other referred to as a 15 page document.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.460
So that's purpose and so that's purpose only.

05:51.460 --> 05:56.660
I desire at this time the call is the next witness, Senator McCarty.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.660
Senator McCarty, you think to stand?

06:05.780 --> 06:07.780
General, my counsel, do you believe me?

06:07.780 --> 06:10.220
Now, my counsel is getting some material ready.

06:10.220 --> 06:14.220
Do I have an understood then that perhaps the next witness

06:14.220 --> 06:16.740
was the Senator McCarty who will devolve his hurry

06:16.740 --> 06:22.060
asking information about Dave Stein and Tony Rezko.

06:22.060 --> 06:24.740
Any other company that has any information

06:24.740 --> 06:27.300
through your call into the stands, I favor that.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.580
I want to take the stand that the chairman,

06:29.580 --> 06:32.540
but I want every senator that's now on

06:32.540 --> 06:35.820
who receives information questions about it.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.380
We put on the stand, put on the role,

06:37.380 --> 06:41.380
so it's very receiving that sort of testimony.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.620
We have a ruling in there.

06:42.620 --> 06:45.220
As the chairman, though, the site of every page

06:45.220 --> 06:46.580
what he said, I probably didn't do it.

06:46.580 --> 06:50.060
And I, number one, I am glad to take the stand and the subject.

06:50.060 --> 06:51.900
May we come right before you say we can hit it

06:51.900 --> 06:55.060
and even plan to take the stand and the subject.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.860
But I would like to make sure that this is to be the practice

06:57.860 --> 07:01.660
now on, take for example, talk about calling the other day,

07:01.660 --> 07:04.340
but that he had information that Mr. Stein

07:04.340 --> 07:06.940
was examining some picture of the colony

07:06.940 --> 07:08.460
from the reward of the place with the chairman.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.940
But, might he have taken your head in the curtain as raised

07:14.940 --> 07:16.820
for the number three, I see here something else

07:16.820 --> 07:19.460
gave Senator McFallon an information.

07:19.460 --> 07:21.860
He could have gotten a private sources.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.860
Well, I have the highest respect for the senator's

07:23.860 --> 07:25.380
mark and so let's make that short.

07:25.380 --> 07:27.020
You want that information now?

07:27.020 --> 07:28.060
No, I'll give you something.

07:28.060 --> 07:29.060
No, no, no, I'm not asking.

07:29.060 --> 07:30.380
No, thank you, no one.

07:30.380 --> 07:33.140
Do you want me to finish my, I'll finish my statement.

07:33.140 --> 07:35.020
At least, if there's any time I'm praising you.

07:35.020 --> 07:35.860
But yeah.

07:37.860 --> 07:39.820
The five you're ahead.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.340
You don't want that off the way.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.860
I still don't get the highest respect

07:42.860 --> 07:44.860
for the senator's mark and thought.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.740
I know there's nothing improper about the way

07:46.740 --> 07:48.780
he received his information.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.660
I just want to make it clear that we are now

07:51.660 --> 07:53.260
establishing the president of the polling

07:53.260 --> 07:57.780
to defend any senators' windic case he has information

07:57.780 --> 07:58.940
as I say.

07:58.940 --> 08:01.620
With the understanding that is the presence

08:01.620 --> 08:04.900
and I'm not concerned about the specific information

08:04.900 --> 08:08.060
from Mr. McFallon, but the rules, if you're following me,

08:08.060 --> 08:11.220
done, the rule, I want to make sure we're going to follow

08:11.220 --> 08:12.020
that.

08:12.020 --> 08:15.460
I'll be glad to be the first of an array of senators.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.460
I don't object to those.

08:16.460 --> 08:21.660
Mr. Chairman, if I have any confidential or restricted

08:21.660 --> 08:24.580
information that goes through this security

08:24.580 --> 08:27.380
of this nation in my possession, I'm

08:27.380 --> 08:31.180
ready and willing to take the stand and disclose

08:31.180 --> 08:34.900
the source from which I've received it.

08:34.900 --> 08:38.900
Now be glad to tell the senator the source of the information

08:38.900 --> 08:40.660
that he had for a while ago.

08:40.660 --> 08:44.460
I'm not concerned about the fair rules and the fair.

08:44.460 --> 08:47.860
The fair rules a long time ago.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.740
They're these here.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.500
Anybody would be called as a witness who

08:52.500 --> 08:55.460
had any information distributed on the system's

08:55.460 --> 08:57.660
inspectors, and he would follow them

08:57.660 --> 09:01.180
and request a deduced of that council for any time.

09:01.180 --> 09:03.380
Raise your hand.

09:03.380 --> 09:04.180
You saw me, sir.

09:04.180 --> 09:06.260
I'll test them on you about to give the truth to the host.

09:06.260 --> 09:07.980
I have nothing but the truth to help you guys.

09:07.980 --> 09:08.580
I do.

09:08.580 --> 09:09.820
Chairman.

09:09.820 --> 09:11.380
That's a care of the making.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.260
It's a question of the point of war.

09:13.260 --> 09:13.780
Right.

09:13.780 --> 09:16.260
How are you going to send him, sir?

09:16.260 --> 09:18.780
Now let us understand that his senator

09:18.780 --> 09:21.780
takes the stand if they're cold.

09:21.780 --> 09:26.100
Do they waive that senator a immunity?

09:26.100 --> 09:26.700
We have to.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.220
If I have any immunities, next to the son of I worded that.

09:30.220 --> 09:35.820
And just act here as a witness to the order before the fair.

09:35.820 --> 09:39.020
And beyond that, I desire no amuse of any kind.

09:39.020 --> 09:39.900
Let's make that clear.

09:43.420 --> 09:48.940
But may I ask this morning, who may have you

09:48.940 --> 09:49.660
got out?

09:49.660 --> 09:51.060
He's found from people's labs.

09:51.060 --> 09:52.580
And now, how many must you have?

09:52.580 --> 09:54.420
At least one of the places.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.060
Let the colonists retire.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.140
Under the rules of the committee,

10:00.140 --> 10:01.540
the situation you are now in the familiar,

10:01.540 --> 10:03.380
every witness has a right to get a couple.

10:03.380 --> 10:04.220
Look at that.

10:04.220 --> 10:05.620
I've just been not exactly countless.

10:05.620 --> 10:07.900
But I want to leave two young men here with these lawyers.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.420
Here's one of our men to go out with us.

10:09.420 --> 10:10.220
Here's three of them.

10:10.220 --> 10:12.780
Let's just say, say on I word, the vagabond, the sea to sea

10:12.780 --> 10:13.300
to sea.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.420
So long as they're going to use in this area.

10:15.420 --> 10:16.580
I think we've got to go out with them.

10:16.580 --> 10:17.580
Let's go out with them.

10:17.580 --> 10:18.580
I know, sir.

10:18.580 --> 10:24.060
I think you make a point of order that the chair will have to sustain.

10:24.060 --> 10:25.340
Because you are.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.420
I am a very deep yourself over at the other side

10:27.420 --> 10:29.980
of the army officer's chair where you can catch them there.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.100
Otherwise, they could call us there.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.100
It is.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.700
I'm going to go out with them.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.580
I'm going to go out with them.

10:37.580 --> 10:41.020
I'm going to go out with them.

10:41.020 --> 10:41.860
Never.

10:41.860 --> 10:44.140
And if the party is in history,

10:44.140 --> 10:47.060
remember, under the party is history.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.140
I don't know about history right now.

10:50.140 --> 10:54.860
I'm going to go out with them.

10:54.860 --> 11:00.660
I just really want to go out with them.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.340
But, Julie, I know you may be pleased

11:02.340 --> 11:04.420
that the Franco table is tomorrow,

11:04.420 --> 11:07.060
and it's a safe guy to know everybody's happy.

11:07.060 --> 11:10.060
OK.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.060
Are you?

11:12.060 --> 11:13.940
Very good, sir.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.780
If I'm happy now, it's about everything.

11:15.780 --> 11:16.700
All right.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.180
Well located.

11:18.180 --> 11:18.700
Yeah.

11:18.700 --> 11:19.700
All right.

11:19.700 --> 11:22.300
Are you ready to send him a card?

11:22.300 --> 11:25.300
Let's take it.

11:25.300 --> 11:28.420
The benefit of the director is you are

11:28.420 --> 11:30.580
Senator Joseph Armacardi.

11:30.580 --> 11:33.460
No, no, let us take it.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.460
Senator Armacardi, I'm sure you understand.

11:37.460 --> 11:41.540
I desire to make it perfectly clear to you.

11:41.540 --> 11:44.700
And you are all of us concerned at this time.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.220
You ought to be examined.

11:47.220 --> 11:53.020
And examined only with respect to a documented January 26,

11:53.020 --> 11:56.860
1951, the first referred to by Mr. Cot.

11:56.860 --> 11:59.540
Here is a 2 and a 4-page document.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.060
Good.

12:00.060 --> 12:03.100
And a 15-page document of the same date.

12:03.100 --> 12:03.940
Good.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.940
We all understand that.

12:05.940 --> 12:10.060
I'm sure with a democracy yesterday afternoon,

12:10.060 --> 12:15.620
there was presented to me to be read to me.

12:15.620 --> 12:19.420
I desire to say that I hate to read it, Mr. Chairman,

12:19.420 --> 12:22.300
and that my mind was completely

12:22.300 --> 12:29.020
shared of all knowledge of its content by the mean, which

12:29.020 --> 12:31.940
perhaps may have filed me a guilty knowledge.

12:31.940 --> 12:34.100
The humidity of which the photo has been lifted

12:34.100 --> 12:35.860
and so may be the post-dark news, I'm

12:35.860 --> 12:39.660
well, and we can take it.

12:39.660 --> 12:43.500
There was handed to me Senator McCarthy a letter.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.060
The date is January 26, 1951.

12:46.060 --> 12:51.100
I'm referred to here as a 2 and a 4-page letter.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.460
And as I recall, Senator, that letter was handed to me

12:54.460 --> 12:55.220
by you.

12:55.220 --> 12:56.580
Is that correct?

12:56.580 --> 12:57.500
That is correct.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.020
Just have fun with it, look.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.940
Let me.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.740
Senator, I'm sorry I didn't get your life.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.940
I say, have fun with it, at least have fun with it.

13:05.940 --> 13:07.060
Oh, yeah, fun with me, do you?

13:07.060 --> 13:08.060
I'm the same.

13:08.060 --> 13:12.060
But you'll pull the matter for an unpleasant date.

13:12.060 --> 13:13.980
And that letter, the first time I've

13:13.980 --> 13:17.820
known it completely couldn't hear me.

13:17.820 --> 13:23.460
That letter was used as a basis by me in further examination

13:23.460 --> 13:25.700
or cross-examination of the sectarian army.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.980
Let us read.

13:26.980 --> 13:31.020
And I believe Senator was used by you and by Mr. Cohn

13:31.020 --> 13:34.420
as a basis for our examination of the sectarian army.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.180
That is correct.

13:36.180 --> 13:41.940
Now, Senator McCarthy, you are bound to be aware of the fact

13:41.940 --> 13:46.620
that some attacks has been made upon that letter.

13:46.620 --> 13:50.780
And I want to ask you this time to tell this committee,

13:50.780 --> 13:53.020
all of your knowledge without my asking you

13:53.020 --> 13:56.740
to any specific questions of this at this time,

13:56.740 --> 13:59.340
all of your knowledge would respect to you

13:59.340 --> 14:03.980
the two-in-a-quarter page letter, particularly where

14:03.980 --> 14:08.620
you obtain possession of it, when you obtain possession of it,

14:08.620 --> 14:12.260
when it came and giving you the knowledge

14:12.260 --> 14:15.380
that you may have pertaining to that two-in-a-quarter page

14:15.380 --> 14:16.380
letter.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.540
First of all, to make it very clear, Mr. Duncan's

14:18.540 --> 14:21.460
and Mr. Chairman, that I will not

14:21.460 --> 14:25.380
under any circumstances reveal the source of any information

14:25.380 --> 14:28.180
which I get as Chairman of the committee.

14:28.180 --> 14:30.780
Now, one of the reasons why I have been successful,

14:30.780 --> 14:32.860
I believe, in some extent, in exposing

14:32.860 --> 14:36.380
the communism is because the people who give me

14:36.380 --> 14:38.900
information from within the government

14:38.900 --> 14:41.580
know that their confidence will not be violated.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.820
They don't have to violate it today.

14:43.820 --> 14:46.140
There's an attempt to get me to violate that confidence

14:46.140 --> 14:48.220
before a committee some two or three years ago

14:48.220 --> 14:49.820
before the piting committee.

14:49.820 --> 14:51.900
I want to make it very, very clear.

14:51.900 --> 14:56.540
I want to notify the people who give me information

14:56.540 --> 15:02.660
that there is no way on earth, that any committee, any force,

15:02.660 --> 15:06.700
can get me to violate the confidence of those people.

15:06.700 --> 15:10.500
May I say that that is the rule which every investigative

15:10.500 --> 15:14.740
agency follows, Mr. Ginger Hoover insists

15:14.740 --> 15:17.900
that no informants be disclosed and brought up

15:17.900 --> 15:19.660
in public, they will not be brought out today

15:19.660 --> 15:21.260
aside from that.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.500
I will give you the information with your expressness

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
to James.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.540
We did this work with this came to me from some of them

15:28.540 --> 15:29.980
in the army.

15:29.980 --> 15:31.860
Does that recall the time?

15:31.860 --> 15:33.460
I don't recall the date.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.140
Does that recall?

15:34.140 --> 15:37.300
He stated very clearly the reason why he was getting

15:37.300 --> 15:38.820
his information.

15:38.820 --> 15:42.260
Well, because he was deeply disturbed,

15:42.260 --> 15:48.020
because even though there were repeated reports

15:48.020 --> 15:51.260
to me at the eye, to the effect that there

15:51.260 --> 15:57.260
was commuters in filtration, indications of espionage.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.940
In the toppled secret laboratories,

15:59.940 --> 16:03.980
they read our laboratories that nothing was being done.

16:03.980 --> 16:07.940
He felt that his disease, to his country,

16:07.940 --> 16:13.140
was above any duty to any human directive.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.140
To be effective, he could not disclose this information.

16:16.140 --> 16:18.900
And may I say, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Councilman,

16:18.900 --> 16:22.460
I would understand it has been now established

16:22.460 --> 16:26.660
that this is a completely accurate resume

16:26.660 --> 16:30.900
of all of the information in the FBI report.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.100
But that, our informant, whoever he was,

16:34.100 --> 16:37.300
was very careful not to include any security

16:37.300 --> 16:38.700
information.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.180
I give him credit for that.

16:40.180 --> 16:41.900
And I call the chair of the attention of the fact

16:41.900 --> 16:44.820
that there is no security information in with.

16:44.820 --> 16:49.580
And I urge you, Mr. Chairman, that this be made available

16:49.580 --> 16:50.700
to the public.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.380
Number two, if you pardon me, Mr. Jenkins,

16:52.380 --> 16:55.340
I know I have objected along with the answer.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.900
But may I answer you?

16:57.900 --> 16:59.180
Long but fairly, you have said to go ahead

16:59.180 --> 17:01.740
in phonological fashion.

17:01.740 --> 17:05.500
We, I received information also, for me,

17:05.500 --> 17:06.660
thank you, Roy, thank you.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.660
This will be a cigarette crack.

17:08.660 --> 17:14.500
Then in 1949, those reports may add to the same nature.

17:14.500 --> 17:19.620
From the FBI, from planning of what

17:19.620 --> 17:24.460
it appeared to be apparently, Epinod, September 15, 1950,

17:24.460 --> 17:29.500
October 27, 1950, December 1950.

17:29.500 --> 17:33.540
Again, December 1950.

17:33.540 --> 17:40.140
Again, June of 1965, 1961, January 26, 1951.

17:40.140 --> 17:41.580
What do we have here?

17:41.580 --> 17:44.340
February 16, 1951.

17:44.340 --> 17:48.140
February 19, 1952, June 19, 1952.

17:48.140 --> 17:52.420
September 19, 1952, January 1953.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.820
April 10, 1953.

17:54.820 --> 17:57.300
April 21, 1953.

17:57.300 --> 18:00.300
And a young man who gave me this information.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.020
Was deeply disturbed.

18:02.020 --> 18:05.820
That's why he gave it because there was no action taken.

18:05.820 --> 18:11.220
By the Army, the Get rid of individuals after the FBI,

18:11.220 --> 18:15.220
had given a complete report and a very tall stipend.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.300
Period.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.300
OK.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.060
Is that the end of your answer, Senator?

18:19.060 --> 18:20.220
That's the end of the answer.

18:20.220 --> 18:23.020
Then do we understand, Senator McKisney,

18:23.020 --> 18:26.180
that you did not get the two-and-a-quarter page document

18:26.180 --> 18:28.420
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

18:28.420 --> 18:31.780
I not only, Mr. Roth did not get this from the FBI,

18:31.780 --> 18:33.700
but let me make a sure that I have never.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.500
You referred to any of the major wealth

18:35.500 --> 18:38.300
and perhaps you'd better apologize to Mr. Welch.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.780
I certainly am always very sorry if I told you

18:39.780 --> 18:41.020
Mr. Welch.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.660
I've seen all the things that Mr. Welch said.

18:44.660 --> 18:47.740
When, Senator, you did not get the two-and-a-quarter page

18:47.740 --> 18:50.180
document from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

18:50.180 --> 18:51.180
I did not, sir.

18:51.180 --> 18:53.300
Now I'm not going to ask you.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.980
And I did not intend to ask you the name of the individual

18:56.980 --> 18:59.620
who gave you that document.

18:59.620 --> 19:02.900
But as I do understand it, Senator McKisney,

19:02.900 --> 19:06.260
and we are trying to pursue this question to its logical end

19:06.260 --> 19:08.980
so that the committee may know all of the facts,

19:08.980 --> 19:10.780
that two-and-a-quarter page document

19:10.780 --> 19:14.540
was delivered to you by someone from the Army.

19:14.540 --> 19:16.900
Yes, I know that further, Mr. Jenkins,

19:16.900 --> 19:18.820
and perhaps in the intelligence department,

19:18.820 --> 19:21.820
can you go that far and also through the intelligence department?

19:21.820 --> 19:22.820
Very well.

19:25.340 --> 19:28.500
Senator, when was that letter to the four-and-a-quarter page

19:28.500 --> 19:29.740
document delivered to you?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.020
I'm going to consult with Council on that.

19:36.020 --> 19:37.940
If I may, it's very well you know, you're entitled to.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.940
Mr. Welch, Mr. Jenkins, I would

19:47.940 --> 19:49.820
have difficulty giving you an exact date,

19:49.820 --> 19:57.820
but it was early last spring, roughly a year ago.

19:57.820 --> 20:01.420
Council sadly thinks the Mayor June, Mr. Carrera,

20:01.420 --> 20:03.100
so they think it's all so perhaps in June.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.820
I think it was a bit earlier.

20:05.820 --> 20:08.460
I think it was, we had it before, Mr. Carr came

20:08.460 --> 20:10.300
with us in the last spring.

20:10.300 --> 20:13.380
When it was delivered to you, like spring,

20:13.380 --> 20:18.460
and approximately a year ago, which would be in early May,

20:18.460 --> 20:23.780
53, were you then a bad Senator?

20:23.780 --> 20:32.980
That it was not a copy of any exact copy of the 15 page

20:32.980 --> 20:36.580
documents in the thousands in the intelligence department.

20:36.580 --> 20:44.580
But a condensation evidence, we'd call it, that is.

20:44.580 --> 20:47.860
What information did you receive at that time

20:47.860 --> 20:51.140
with respect to this two-and-a-quarter page document

20:51.140 --> 20:53.940
in relation to the 15 page documents?

20:53.940 --> 20:55.260
What, my high school, Mr. Jenkins?

20:55.260 --> 20:57.580
If you had any such information, my high school,

20:57.580 --> 21:01.140
Mr. Jenkins, that's a very call I just

21:01.140 --> 21:03.940
got to be offered with to deliver this.

21:03.940 --> 21:07.220
We fact that the document itself shows

21:07.220 --> 21:12.380
that there has been deleted security information.

21:12.380 --> 21:15.900
That will appear on page two of the,

21:15.900 --> 21:19.220
level of peer experience, who,

21:19.220 --> 21:21.660
did you get my answer with the second page?

21:21.660 --> 21:24.180
I see you, Senator, for the photographer.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.860
May I ask you this, too?

21:25.860 --> 21:27.620
To start it in clarify.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.940
At the time, the two-and-a-quarter page document

21:29.940 --> 21:32.140
was delivered to you by an officer in the intelligence

21:32.140 --> 21:33.620
department of the Army.

21:33.620 --> 21:36.660
To say to whether or not you were advised by him

21:36.660 --> 21:38.660
that the information he'd be given

21:38.660 --> 21:40.740
the two-and-a-quarter page document was

21:40.740 --> 21:43.380
taken from a 15 page document?

21:43.380 --> 21:44.540
No.

21:44.540 --> 21:45.540
No, I was not.

21:45.540 --> 21:46.380
All right.

21:46.380 --> 21:48.420
What information did he give you the respect

21:48.420 --> 21:50.020
that said, of course, he must have done so.

21:50.020 --> 21:52.780
Mr. Jenkins, to the best of my knowledge,

21:52.780 --> 21:56.100
and keep in mind that I talked to the last number of people

21:56.100 --> 21:58.620
he'd today to the best of my knowledge.

21:58.620 --> 21:59.620
And I can't quote him, bro, babe.

21:59.620 --> 22:03.500
And I got the impression that this was the document

22:03.500 --> 22:07.260
that was circulated as a result of a methamia report

22:07.260 --> 22:09.660
because it's obvious on the face of it

22:09.660 --> 22:13.860
that there has been deleted security information.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.100
Now, that may be an infracting question.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.300
Keep following me, sir.

22:17.300 --> 22:21.140
In other words, if the FBI reports to the head of G2

22:21.140 --> 22:24.180
on some 30 individuals as they did here,

22:24.180 --> 22:28.380
the normal thing would be the G2 as soon.

22:28.380 --> 22:32.260
Either family complete copyright or a summary of this.

22:32.260 --> 22:35.580
You put them in the file of the V to individual concerns.

22:35.580 --> 22:41.380
Now, as I say, it's obvious that the security information

22:41.380 --> 22:42.540
has been deleted.

22:42.540 --> 22:44.060
Beyond that, it hasn't testified

22:44.060 --> 22:47.420
that the complete word for word for a metham

22:47.420 --> 22:48.740
transcript of the FBI report.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.420
I was very happy to learn that this morning.

22:53.420 --> 22:55.660
I knew it would be the same material.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.380
And I was very happy to learn the word for word for a metham.

22:58.380 --> 23:03.420
When did you learn of the existence of the 15 page document

23:03.420 --> 23:05.900
and most of the time to about Miss Kogger?

23:05.900 --> 23:09.220
About 11.30 last night, Mr. Kohn's all been

23:09.220 --> 23:13.180
and told me that he had heard that this was nearly

23:13.180 --> 23:17.580
a summary of a document that I think he said was 11 pages,

23:17.580 --> 23:19.740
not 50, and he had that figure wrong.

23:19.740 --> 23:23.420
And there were eight other pages covering the security

23:23.420 --> 23:26.860
information I told him that I assumed there were other pages

23:26.860 --> 23:28.820
either at Dunham or something covering the security

23:28.820 --> 23:29.980
information.

23:29.980 --> 23:32.980
And at that time, if I may continue to be responses,

23:32.980 --> 23:36.220
I told him to promptly contact you.

23:36.220 --> 23:39.460
If it was too late last night, the contact you this morning,

23:39.460 --> 23:40.300
tell you that.

23:40.300 --> 23:43.020
And also to send away our commissioner,

23:43.020 --> 23:47.660
Steven asking him to produce the balance of the material.

23:47.660 --> 23:51.660
So I think in all fairness to Mr. Kohn and the committee,

23:51.660 --> 23:56.900
I should say that Mr. Kohn did in fact contact me last night.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.420
I was a respect to that request.

23:58.420 --> 24:02.540
Now, Ben, Senator McCarthy, do we understand

24:02.540 --> 24:06.300
as the committee understands that at the time

24:06.300 --> 24:09.340
the two-and-a-quarter page document was tended to me

24:09.340 --> 24:11.420
yesterday afternoon.

24:11.420 --> 24:16.180
You did not know of the existence of a 15 page document

24:16.180 --> 24:18.020
in the intelligence files of the Army.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.780
Is that correct, little friend?

24:20.780 --> 24:24.660
You did not know at that time that the two-and-a-quarter

24:24.660 --> 24:33.420
page document contained the information, the statements,

24:33.420 --> 24:36.340
the paragraphs of the 15 page documents

24:36.340 --> 24:41.820
with the exception, in substance, of the information

24:41.820 --> 24:45.820
given opposite the names of each one of the parties listed

24:45.820 --> 24:48.100
there in all pages to their office.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.860
Is that correct?

24:49.860 --> 24:52.460
I think that's the exact statement.

24:52.460 --> 24:54.940
I'm so at the time.

24:54.940 --> 24:57.860
Miss, may I say Mr. Jenkins, I don't want to belong to it.

24:57.860 --> 25:00.460
I've found.

25:00.460 --> 25:06.060
I had written the belief of that time

25:06.100 --> 25:07.900
that there was no security information.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.900
I assume the original report might

25:09.900 --> 25:11.420
have had some security information.

25:11.420 --> 25:13.780
So at the time this two-and-a-quarter page document

25:13.780 --> 25:16.980
was handed to me and used as a basis

25:16.980 --> 25:20.580
for a coffee examination of the specter of the Army,

25:20.580 --> 25:24.780
it was your understanding that as far as you knew,

25:24.780 --> 25:29.580
that was an exact copy of the documents

25:29.580 --> 25:33.060
then in the file of the intelligence department

25:33.060 --> 25:34.380
of the Army.

25:34.380 --> 25:37.780
You like the acceptance of those rights?

25:37.780 --> 25:40.140
The famine I have no further questions.

25:40.140 --> 25:41.900
I have just one.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.260
I'm going to ask you in such a way

25:43.260 --> 25:45.460
that I don't overrule myself on a point of order

25:45.460 --> 25:47.460
because I have incidences that the senator

25:47.460 --> 25:51.660
do not read aloud but in the letter.

25:51.660 --> 25:52.940
But you have read the letter.

25:52.940 --> 25:55.540
No member of the committee has.

25:55.540 --> 25:58.780
If the letter is ultimately made part

25:58.780 --> 26:01.740
of the exhibit to this committee, which it will be

26:01.740 --> 26:04.420
if we get the permission of the Attorney General,

26:04.420 --> 26:06.660
is it your testimony that the letter

26:06.660 --> 26:10.980
will show on its face that part of the information which

26:10.980 --> 26:14.220
might be in some other report is not contained in that letter?

26:14.220 --> 26:15.020
That is correct.

26:15.020 --> 26:15.820
That's the paragraph.

26:15.820 --> 26:18.300
Prime, which Mr. Collier referred.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.380
And then the comments.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.380
And also, the letter part is clicked.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.900
That's one question that I understand you

26:23.900 --> 26:26.660
to say this document was delivered to you

26:26.660 --> 26:29.020
as chairman of the committee.

26:29.020 --> 26:33.460
I was chairman in what capacity has been delivered.

26:33.460 --> 26:33.860
I don't know.

26:33.860 --> 26:34.660
I was chairman of the committee.

26:34.660 --> 26:38.060
I asked you now to you regard it as a committed document

26:38.060 --> 26:40.980
or as a personal document.

26:40.980 --> 26:41.900
What is it?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.980
It's available to the committee.

26:43.980 --> 26:46.100
All such documents, the number

26:46.100 --> 26:49.540
do you available to the committee?

26:49.540 --> 26:52.220
I can't think many that are not available to the committee.

26:52.220 --> 26:55.780
Have you ever made that available to the committee before?

26:55.780 --> 26:57.540
I tell it's for the you-round, the committee,

26:57.540 --> 26:58.980
then the senator?

26:58.980 --> 27:01.300
Or the bit old that it's there.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.500
This would be available to any member of the committee.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.540
May I say that all of the files are available.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.140
I don't turn out of the file, senator.

27:07.140 --> 27:07.980
I bet 40 questions.

27:07.980 --> 27:09.780
Wait until I make it clear.

27:09.780 --> 27:12.620
This was one of my few hundred thousand documents

27:12.620 --> 27:13.940
in our file.

27:13.940 --> 27:16.100
I do not think it's on myself to get out of the file

27:16.100 --> 27:18.020
and take them out and come into the cemetery.

27:18.020 --> 27:20.980
That is why I argue that you have a minority council.

27:20.980 --> 27:23.620
I do not think it's on the general's file.

27:23.620 --> 27:24.660
It's all available to him.

27:24.660 --> 27:25.700
That's all I want to know.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.540
I just wasn't a way of such material.

27:28.540 --> 27:31.500
As you are proposing to introduce here,

27:31.500 --> 27:33.860
is available to all members of the committee.

27:33.860 --> 27:38.100
Such as you now are if you treat it as a personal document

27:38.100 --> 27:39.460
or an summation.

27:39.460 --> 27:43.220
Senator, I treat nothing that I receive as personal.

27:43.220 --> 27:46.460
The only I consider as personal is the man with the informant.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.500
And that I consider personal.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.300
But everything that we have is available to any member of the committee.

27:51.300 --> 27:52.300
As well, Mr. President.

27:52.300 --> 27:53.300
Good afternoon.

27:55.700 --> 27:59.020
Senator McCartney is an unusual or extraordinary

27:59.020 --> 28:02.020
for confidential documents of this nature

28:02.020 --> 28:04.860
to come from you either as chairman of the Senate

28:04.860 --> 28:07.580
from the Investigating Committee for Ethnic Individual

28:07.580 --> 28:08.500
Cemetery.

28:08.500 --> 28:12.980
It's made daily and a nightly occurrence for me

28:12.980 --> 28:16.500
to receive information from people and governments

28:16.500 --> 28:18.340
in regard to comments and post-pictures.

28:18.340 --> 28:23.180
And that's true of many agencies and governments.

28:23.180 --> 28:24.380
That is true.

28:24.380 --> 28:24.880
Great.

28:24.880 --> 28:25.580
That's all.

28:36.140 --> 28:38.340
The DuMont Television Network is bringing to you

28:38.340 --> 28:40.980
through its facilities the Army McCartney Subcommittee's

28:40.980 --> 28:41.480
area.

28:41.480 --> 28:45.420
For Christy, I understand that the letter

28:45.420 --> 28:48.620
has introduced yesterday came to you in that form,

28:48.620 --> 28:49.260
last April.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.020
I mean, the letter is correct.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.620
I'm not sure what they're for, maybe, in the region.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.980
Now I mean whenever I arrive, I'm not asking you

28:55.980 --> 28:57.020
the exact one.

28:57.020 --> 28:59.060
Let it be.

28:59.060 --> 29:00.500
Was it delivered to you personally,

29:00.500 --> 29:03.940
or are there any one of the staff initially?

29:03.940 --> 29:05.380
There may have been some members of the staff

29:05.380 --> 29:07.860
first, and I don't know the letter

29:07.860 --> 29:10.380
came in the mic possession first point.

29:10.380 --> 29:14.860
You don't know whether your informant gave it to you

29:14.860 --> 29:17.780
directly or a member of the staff received

29:17.780 --> 29:19.340
the first and then gave it to you.

29:19.340 --> 29:22.340
I am reasonably certain, good, well,

29:22.340 --> 29:24.580
I just was given to the hand of the people personally.

29:24.580 --> 29:26.660
People mind that I talk to so many people every day

29:26.660 --> 29:29.300
that I can't remember who's hand of the something

29:29.300 --> 29:30.020
a year ago.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.660
Well, I mean, your best knowledge and belief

29:31.660 --> 29:33.000
has changed you personally, and not

29:33.000 --> 29:34.660
it is for the staff.

29:34.660 --> 29:35.180
But it's for you.

29:35.180 --> 29:37.700
You recall meeting the person or seeing him

29:37.700 --> 29:41.340
at the theater very, very well.

29:41.340 --> 29:42.860
That's all.

29:42.860 --> 29:45.340
And the letter?

29:45.340 --> 29:48.740
Senator McCarthy, that I understand,

29:48.740 --> 29:50.260
you just said I briefly the yesterday

29:50.260 --> 29:54.860
or today, that the letter referred to me

29:54.860 --> 29:59.420
Mr. Cohen and Aaron Fullman, the OLLMAs.

29:59.420 --> 30:01.100
I also understand you say that there

30:01.100 --> 30:04.420
are several other names on this.

30:04.420 --> 30:07.300
There are 34 names.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.700
And if I don't violate the sheriff's order,

30:09.700 --> 30:11.660
I can send you the own involved.

30:11.660 --> 30:14.740
People connected with the full well-rogan bird

30:14.740 --> 30:18.740
firing and seven theme of them still working

30:18.740 --> 30:22.380
at the greater laboratory of the time

30:22.380 --> 30:23.580
or in the investigation of the men.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.260
But I'll take it for you.

30:25.260 --> 30:26.300
All right.

30:26.300 --> 30:29.140
Some of them are least confidently seven years.

30:29.140 --> 30:32.900
Now, does that two and a half states you thought you have?

30:32.900 --> 30:36.980
Deal with justice to Cohen or in particular,

30:36.980 --> 30:39.740
or does it deal with, in the general nature of,

30:39.740 --> 30:41.900
well, I'm more likely to have something

30:41.900 --> 30:43.820
that's a question you can answer.

30:43.820 --> 30:48.820
I don't, the general letter deals principally with Mr. Coleman.

30:48.820 --> 30:51.420
Now, as far as individuals listed,

30:51.420 --> 30:53.380
I can turn, I don't have the report

30:53.380 --> 30:55.060
in each individual.

30:55.060 --> 30:58.060
All I have here is the evaluation.

30:58.060 --> 31:02.220
Either an evaluation placed on the butter by my informant,

31:02.220 --> 31:05.580
or an evaluation placed on by some other agents,

31:05.580 --> 31:06.540
things.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.580
And all I have here is the notification

31:08.580 --> 31:12.100
after each name, the Rogatory, not the Rogatory,

31:12.100 --> 31:13.380
rather no the Rogatory.

31:13.380 --> 31:14.380
All right.
