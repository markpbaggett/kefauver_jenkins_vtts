WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.320
If a woman has ever fought, broken down by the emplaced and individual files of the

00:10.320 --> 00:17.960
persons that are named in the report, I, if the report is met nature, I think that might

00:17.960 --> 00:19.960
shed a little light on me.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.760
I get your total maths, but give it a pyramid for a brother.

00:23.760 --> 00:28.160
Well, if your friend and his brother are not disappeared, it would be the ex-surfing

00:28.160 --> 00:30.480
of information in regards to one of the thirty-fourth.

00:30.480 --> 00:33.240
The name they have been named the group and then doubt it's known.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.240
They were at the admissible.

00:34.240 --> 00:41.480
No, this is the general letter, the general covering letter, complaining of the rather

00:41.480 --> 00:46.080
stunning fourth of the situation, and it does not excerpt the information about anyone

00:46.080 --> 00:52.400
individual, except there is mention of Mr. Coleman and certain members of the Rosenberg

00:52.400 --> 00:58.800
firing and the connections between people at the strike that have been violating the

00:58.800 --> 00:59.800
Thursday.

00:59.800 --> 01:04.080
Senator McCartney, do you?

01:04.080 --> 01:10.680
New York farmers can inform you as to whether that report had been given to any other

01:10.680 --> 01:17.880
persons, other than people within the Pentagon, who I was sent within the DQ section or the

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
air force.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.960
I think it's a mention the air force had a copy of the fifteen-page report.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.480
You know whether any other persons have received a copy of this report.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.640
Well, again, keep in mind I can't recite it.

01:29.640 --> 01:36.000
He is the language verbatim, but he was very positive about the fact that this information

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
was well known to all of those responsible for the condition which was existence, and

01:43.000 --> 01:48.880
he mentioned not only this letter, but the others that I have enumerated, all memorandum

01:48.880 --> 02:00.120
or letter, report from what you may, from the FBI, all dealing with potential sabotage,

02:00.120 --> 02:07.680
espionage, the contacts between individuals there with the Old Rosenberg firing and the

02:07.680 --> 02:10.120
very, very bad security situation.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.120
That's that report, mon.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.560
I believe this is restricted almost exclusively to Fort Mon, North and South.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.880
It's in other areas, but large of the report mon.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.480
You, and you're not ready.

02:21.480 --> 02:27.880
No one else has that report other than yourself, the army personnel who have a right, that

02:27.880 --> 02:34.520
it's too much to have it in the air force, but they are in the FBI.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.520
As far as I know, let me say a number one, Mr. Hunter.

02:38.520 --> 02:44.520
I don't know how circulation got in the army if they were on their tolls, reckon there

02:44.520 --> 02:48.920
was a copy in the file of each of the 34.

02:48.920 --> 02:53.800
Beyond that, I wouldn't know who had the copy except myself.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.800
The Sumters all should have a copy.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.240
It's available, and I think they, as it's not for how they shouldn't be ready to get

03:00.240 --> 03:04.360
the deals with espionage, sabotage, no reason why the Sumters should be north and the

03:04.360 --> 03:05.360
north.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.880
You have your files that had the bone copies.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.800
I think there's only one copy in the file, yeah.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.800
I mean, that's the copy.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
That's all, Mr. Hunter.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.800
I have a card on your evidence, I have a text.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.800
I'm just finding it.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.800
Hunter, I have two questions.

03:18.800 --> 03:30.320
First, did you discuss this article or letter with the Mr. Hoover, the FBI before you

03:30.320 --> 03:31.320
offered it for evidence?

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
No, I did not.

03:32.320 --> 03:44.720
I often come into the question of misindustigation and going through various departments of reports

03:44.720 --> 03:47.080
with apparently written in the FBI.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.080
I will never put Mr. Hoover in the position.

03:49.080 --> 03:54.640
Obviously, they're saying yes or no, although I said, they make use of this material.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.600
I don't think you want to be put in my position.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.600
I have never discussed with them.

03:59.600 --> 04:04.600
To make it clear, I know it's an obvious question, but we use a question that I haven't

04:04.600 --> 04:05.600
read.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.600
I have never discussed with Mr. Hoover any report that appeared originally from the FBI.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
I use one on judgment.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.600
One of the most important to be used, I use it.

04:14.600 --> 04:20.600
Now, the next question, am I correct that you got this around April 1953?

04:20.600 --> 04:23.600
What is the April May or June of last spring?

04:23.600 --> 04:24.600
I know about a year ago.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.600
Now, in this at least twice a day, you've mentioned this as a Truman Directive.

04:28.600 --> 04:35.880
Don't you think that if what you call a Truman Directive is in the opinion of misindustations

04:35.880 --> 04:40.600
and fit it wrong, but by now they've had enough time to change it?

04:40.600 --> 04:45.600
I'm just as unhappy with that directive since we have the new administration as we have

04:45.600 --> 04:46.600
the old.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.600
I sincerely hope that that directive is the same.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.600
I frankly can see no reason.

04:52.600 --> 04:59.600
Senator, why a committee of senators representing the people should not have information about

04:59.600 --> 05:06.600
cumulators and sabotage estimates, the same way as we can information about robbery,

05:06.600 --> 05:07.600
cook, grass, grass.

05:07.600 --> 05:13.600
So if your question is, do I like to directive any more since President Eisenhower's in

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
office?

05:14.600 --> 05:15.600
The answer is no.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.600
I thought it was wrong then.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.600
I still think it's wrong.

05:19.600 --> 05:25.600
The only encouraging thing is that we can get a more liberal interpretation of this

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
when you get more information.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.600
I do think the order should be repealed.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.600
Oh, question.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.600
They'll give you more of them.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.600
I was wondering.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
It's OK.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
I was.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.600
It's OK.

05:36.600 --> 05:41.600
I think that there was none brought the bad guest in O'Anne's just that I'll go along with

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
the chair.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
Well, I haven't had.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.600
I got the impression that maybe you won a little campaign material.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.600
I think you're very keen enough that it is.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
Thank you.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
Thank you.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
You OK?

05:53.600 --> 06:03.600
Mr. Well.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.600
Mr. Well.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.600
Mr. McKinsey.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.600
Uh, may the, uh, yes, Mr. Well, I think it's been in the car.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.600
I think it is a committee witness that one called by himself.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.600
So I'll call on you first.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
I think it's hiding.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.600
The chair is momentarily uncertain whether you should receive Mr. Kohn, Mr. Paul, and

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
I think I'm correct.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
You go ahead.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.600
The committee witness, you would not call me the by you or by yourself.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.600
Mr. McKinsey.

06:31.600 --> 06:38.600
When you took the stand, you of course understood you were going to be asked about this letter.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.600
I assume that it is a bit of a subject.

06:41.600 --> 06:47.600
And you, of course, understood you were going to be asked to start from what you got.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.600
I never tried to, I just did you understand you would be asked to start?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.600
No, I meant to let.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.600
I never tried to read the minds of the hunters, not they last week.

06:55.600 --> 07:04.600
Well, doesn't you understand from Mr. Jenkins' attitude that he intended to ask you from whom you got the letter?

07:04.600 --> 07:08.600
I don't know what Mr. Jenkins' attitude could indicate.

07:08.600 --> 07:15.600
Could I have the oath that you took red to a trolley by the reporter?

07:15.600 --> 07:18.600
Mr. Woh, that doesn't seem to be an appropriate question.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.600
You were present.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
We took the oath to yourself.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
We took the same oath to you.

07:22.600 --> 07:33.600
The oath included a promise, a solemn promise by you to tell the truth, comma, the whole truth, comma.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.600
And nothing but the truth.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.600
Is that correct, sir?

07:37.600 --> 07:45.600
Mr. Woh, you're not the first individual to try to get me to betray the confidence and give out the names of my informants.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.600
You will be no more successful than those of tried in the past.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.600
Period.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.600
I am only asking you, sir.

07:52.600 --> 08:02.600
Did you realize when you took that oath that you were making a solemn promise to tell the whole truth to this committee?

08:03.600 --> 08:05.600
I understand the oath was to tell.

08:05.600 --> 08:16.600
And when you took it, did you have some metal reservations, some gifts or six amendment notions, that you could measure what you would tell?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.600
I don't take the theft of six amendments.

08:18.600 --> 08:28.600
Have you some private reservation when you take the oath that you will tell the whole truth that let you be the judge of what you will testify to?

08:28.600 --> 08:31.600
The answer is there's no reservation about telling the whole truth.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.600
Thank you, sir.

08:33.600 --> 08:38.600
Then tell us who delivered the document to you.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.600
The answer is no.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.600
You will not get that information.

08:46.600 --> 08:52.600
You wish them to put your own interpretation on your oath and tell us less than the whole truth?

08:52.600 --> 09:00.600
Mr. Woh, I think I'm in a great place here, that neither you nor anyone else will ever get me to violate.

09:00.600 --> 09:07.600
The confidence of the loyal people in this government will give me information about the coming of the student oaths.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.600
I repeat, you will not get their name.

09:10.600 --> 09:17.600
You will not get any information until all you identify them, so you or anyone else can get their job.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.600
You can go ahead and try and do the same.

09:20.600 --> 09:33.600
You will not get the name of any informant who rely upon me to protect them from the type of things like that.

09:33.600 --> 09:40.600
Did you tell your informer under oath that you would never reveal his name?

09:40.600 --> 09:44.600
Mr. Woh, you know the former informant with another life for me under oath.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.600
You didn't tell him under oath then?

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
Well, that's not the silly, Mr. Woh. You know that I was under oath for an informant all over.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
Right.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
And when you...

09:53.600 --> 09:54.600
Dr. Woh.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.600
When you stepped to that chair, you went under oath there.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
Is that right?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
Is there any doubt in your mind that I'm under oath?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
I think not there.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.600
All right, good.

10:02.600 --> 10:07.600
Now this man that gave it to you was an officer in the intelligence corps. Is that right?

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
Good is right.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.600
And he was young.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.600
I wouldn't give you any information that might enable you to identify him.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.600
You testified that he was young.

10:15.600 --> 10:20.600
If I did, then I'd have to be two thousand money.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.600
Would you tell her where you were when you got it?

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
No.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.600
Where you in Washington?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.600
The answer was I would not tell you.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.600
So I wouldn't give you any information to allow you to identify my informant.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.600
How soon after...

10:33.600 --> 10:35.600
That's from the rule of Mr. Woh.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.600
How soon after you got it, did you show it to anyone?

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
I don't remember.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.600
To whom did you first show it?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.600
I don't recall.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.600
Can you take up the name of anyone to whom you showed it?

10:47.600 --> 10:51.600
Oh, I assume it's the past one to my staff, most likely.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.600
Name the one on your staff who had it.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
I wouldn't know.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.600
You wouldn't know?

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
No.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.600
What would it include Mr. Colm?

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
With my...

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
The wood one, then?

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
I thought my...

11:02.600 --> 11:04.600
What would it include Mr. Car?

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
With my...

11:05.600 --> 11:07.600
What would it include Mr. Colm?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.600
With my...

11:08.600 --> 11:10.600
What would it include Mr. Colm?

11:10.600 --> 11:15.600
It was an information from people who have been in prison for 15-20 times a day.

11:15.600 --> 11:23.600
I don't recall a year later to just exactly which one of my very confidence and investigators I have had information on to.

11:23.600 --> 11:29.600
Ultimately, ultimately that information was brought for the attention of my chief counsel Mr. Colm.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
Right.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.600
My chief's staff was not that we then, Mr. Car,

11:33.600 --> 11:39.600
but they asked to proceed with the investigation of communist information at Fort Monmouth.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.600
This was only one of the many reasons.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.600
He's only one of the very, very many reasons.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.600
Any other?

11:47.600 --> 11:48.600
No, Mr. Nitson.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.600
Don't I tell you that as a year ago I can't tell you this was handed to?

11:52.600 --> 11:55.600
I just don't know who it was handed to.

11:55.600 --> 12:02.600
Mr. Senator, when it was handed to you, was it put in the files of the subcommittee?

12:02.600 --> 12:06.600
I assume it was.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.600
Like any other paper?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.600
Like any other one of the thousand papers.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.600
And became a document belonging to the subcommittee.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.600
It now belongs to the subcommittee.

12:15.600 --> 12:22.600
So that is the subcommittee now vote that you already own the name of the man who gave it to you.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.600
You will be bound by that vote.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.600
I won't have to participate in action to the subcommittee.

12:28.600 --> 12:33.600
May I raise a point of inquiry here,

12:33.600 --> 12:39.600
but for my own information and I address this to the chair and also the council.

12:39.600 --> 12:44.600
Would it be required a little witness, concerned with his old,

12:44.600 --> 12:49.600
that he revealed the source of the document when he had pledged himself

12:49.600 --> 12:54.600
to respect the confidence and not reveal the source?

12:55.600 --> 13:00.600
You know, it is required under his old that he make a revelation of that time.

13:00.600 --> 13:05.600
I think the chair off to do the moment and I think the advice of council also be taken on that matter

13:05.600 --> 13:09.600
because this matter may recall again in the course of these years.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
I'd be very grateful if you would.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.600
I'd be happy to hear from council President.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.600
Chairman.

13:15.600 --> 13:23.600
It is elementary that the senator does not have to reveal the name of his informant.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.600
That is one of the most elemental principles inducted in the law.

13:28.600 --> 13:34.600
Otherwise, law enforcing officers with the so-haemstern and hamperd

13:34.600 --> 13:38.600
has that they would never be able to fade out crime.

13:38.600 --> 13:45.600
Iron hesitating the rule that senator McCarthy does not have to reveal the name of his informant.

13:45.600 --> 13:50.600
That is why I did not pursue the matter further with this.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.600
I am not a part of the matter.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.600
I am a question of parliament.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.600
Yes, it is both of the council and the chair.

13:58.600 --> 14:05.600
Both the chair ruling of the council ruling suggested the chair

14:05.600 --> 14:09.600
include all witnesses who make that sacrifice as a judge.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.600
It depends entirely on the senator McClellan,

14:13.600 --> 14:16.600
upon the chagged evidence,

14:16.600 --> 14:20.600
a witness is required to give.

14:20.600 --> 14:30.600
My point is that's to illustrate an officer of all those before a judicial body.

14:30.600 --> 14:39.600
He strives out a search warrant, uses the basis for the confiscation of contraband that leads.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.600
We have that down in Tennessee.

14:42.600 --> 14:48.600
Upon the trial of the case, he is not required to give the name of his informant.

14:48.600 --> 14:53.600
We imparted to him the information used in preparing the search warrant.

14:53.600 --> 15:00.600
Otherwise, he would never be able to detect crime, similarly as in this case.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.600
Senator McClellan is engaged in the character of work we all know about.

15:05.600 --> 15:11.600
And must necessarily rely on him, as law enforcing officers,

15:11.600 --> 15:14.600
do always in the detection of crimes.

15:14.600 --> 15:20.600
Senator McClellan is in the vain nature of things must rely upon information that he gets.

15:20.600 --> 15:26.600
If he were required to publicly state the name of his informant,

15:26.600 --> 15:32.600
I'd say that the efficiency of his work would be impaired 99%.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.600
It's a child and just one child of that.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.600
Why do we think of that?

15:38.600 --> 15:43.600
Are they in battle to the same point?

15:43.600 --> 15:46.600
Senator McClellan, chair, when you know me,

15:46.600 --> 15:49.600
it's when you have asked me a general question.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.600
When any specific question comes up,

15:52.600 --> 15:57.600
I think then I hope I will be able to give you an intelligent, effective measure.

15:57.600 --> 16:01.600
I can know before the vote is over, so far, I'm ready to give you my file.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.600
All you have to make is an idea.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.600
I get one last word, I'm going to make a movie, and I'm going to do this case.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.600
And then I'll do it.

16:11.600 --> 16:15.600
I just want to determine now if one's fine or not.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.600
If so, I'm all that's okay with me.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.600
My answer is Senator McClellan, the five-year-old,

16:21.600 --> 16:23.600
be permitted to speak again.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.600
That as each individual case comes up,

16:26.600 --> 16:29.600
they and another until they and could out possibly

16:29.600 --> 16:33.600
give what I would consider an intelligent result.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.600
Well, we are suggesting that each one may offer just some

16:36.600 --> 16:40.600
of that confidential relationship of any informant.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.600
We may add any one on the phone to my direction.

16:43.600 --> 16:51.600
I will take the position when any Senator hung him up to getting committed.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.600
We will not have to reveal his source of information.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.600
Or may I get any clear? I must go out and take my sharp.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.600
He can have mine.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.600
And I'll give him a few years straight.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
I don't want that.

17:01.600 --> 17:07.600
I'm afraid to say to you, he unhceptically and unaccurate

17:07.600 --> 17:12.600
of the rules that in his opinion, and this is sustained by an unbroken precedent

17:12.600 --> 17:15.600
so far as he knows before it's cannot investigate in his memory.

17:15.600 --> 17:19.600
The law and personal officers investigate it.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.600
Any of those engaged in the investigative field

17:22.600 --> 17:25.600
who come in contact with confidential information

17:25.600 --> 17:28.600
are not required to disclose the source of their information.

17:28.600 --> 17:32.600
The same you have been followed by the FBI and, in my opinion,

17:32.600 --> 17:34.600
very appropriately so.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.600
Difficult for the care to do on the hypothetical questions that are in the problem.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.600
But I think if something analogous occurs,

17:40.600 --> 17:44.600
we can discuss it at that time and certainly any senator

17:44.600 --> 17:47.600
has the same rights to receive confidential information

17:47.600 --> 17:49.600
as as a chairman of this committee.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.600
I can relate in the same work as the chairman.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.600
I point out to you one other thing.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.600
I have second theory of the Army.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.600
It's the duty of the Second Theory.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.600
I take it to all of those right of discovered commoners

18:03.600 --> 18:06.600
that move from out of the organization.

18:06.600 --> 18:10.600
Then I assume that the same room with a right of him

18:10.600 --> 18:13.600
would respect the confidential officer

18:13.600 --> 18:15.600
that he may have in his possession.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
Is there any question that would have been similar

18:17.600 --> 18:19.600
to the circumstances of the Secretary of the Army

18:19.600 --> 18:21.600
if engaged in similar investigating works

18:21.600 --> 18:23.600
that have the same considerations?

18:23.600 --> 18:25.600
The chairman of this one, President.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.600
When the files were turned over,

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
the committee was just letter included in the file.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.600
The files were turned over to Senator Martin.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.600
The files were never physically removed as far as I know.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.600
The files are still down the committee rooms.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.600
Well, I'm not out of file file.

18:41.600 --> 18:48.600
The files, anything having to do with the pressure exerted by Mr. Steve

18:48.600 --> 18:50.600
and Mr. Allen Adams on the committee

18:50.600 --> 18:52.600
to get us all off the hearings.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.600
We haven't physically turned over,

18:54.600 --> 18:58.600
but we did not physically move all of the files having to do

18:58.600 --> 19:00.600
with commoners' infiltrations.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.600
You know what I'm not very on?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.600
The matter contained in the controversy

19:05.600 --> 19:08.600
that this committee is now investigating between the Army

19:08.600 --> 19:13.600
on the one hand and you and Mr. Call and Mr. Car.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.600
Now, Senator Muntz does have a different space than file.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.600
I just want to get the records clear out.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.600
You will have a clear summary.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.600
I know that when you refuse to read this letter,

19:23.600 --> 19:25.600
it's impossible for you to know what's in it.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.600
You know whether or not I'm going to finish my answer, please.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.600
Yeah, but I'm going to finish my answer, please.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.600
All right.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.600
You know what?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.600
Let me finish my answer.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.600
It's possible for you to know whether or not

19:36.600 --> 19:40.600
this area is upon the time date.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.600
Insofar as the attempt to get this committee to tell a team's

19:44.600 --> 19:46.600
office to turn, I will tell you now

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
this is what it does not bear upon that.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
This is their report.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.600
I remember on them letter called what you made from the FBI

19:53.600 --> 19:58.600
to Army intelligence, setting forth the situation

19:58.600 --> 20:00.600
at Fort Munna.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.600
This is as far as I know and never has been trained

20:03.600 --> 20:04.600
over to Center Munn.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.600
It's available to Center Munn or any other Center on the committee.

20:07.600 --> 20:12.600
As are all of the last number of documents in the committee room.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.600
Well, you understand them.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.600
I only purposefully asked you the question.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.600
And if you're not, this has been served over.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.600
I just put your knowledge in the other part of it.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.600
Because it's the part of the particular milk file out here.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.600
Well, I know, but I mean it was taken from the regular committee file.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.600
Let us say.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.600
And the material turned over to the center of the month related entirely

20:34.600 --> 20:37.600
to the immediate controversy of the.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.600
So we're actually in any question to the chair.

20:40.600 --> 20:45.600
The material turned over to Center Munn was turned over by Mr. Car in a

20:45.600 --> 20:50.600
Sealed Brown envelope which has turned over to Mr. Jenkins without the Sealed

20:50.600 --> 20:52.600
ever having been booked.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.600
And the material that the chairman asked for was the original of the document

20:56.600 --> 21:00.600
which a press statement was made by Senator McCarty in response to the

21:00.600 --> 21:05.600
range of items issued thirty four numbers by the House.

21:05.600 --> 21:10.600
The man face under action for your information we sent a thousand orders

21:10.600 --> 21:15.600
to give Mr. Jenkins anything that he wants from the file getting full cooperation.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.600
I think Mr. Jenkins has stated that here the other day he has gotten 100 percent

21:19.600 --> 21:21.600
for operation from my plan.

21:21.600 --> 21:25.600
We haven't tried to physically move all the heavy files up on the car of the office.

21:25.600 --> 21:30.600
We have had this original meeting with council for the Army.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.600
We asked the Army whether all of its material and documents would be made available

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
to the committee.

21:35.600 --> 21:39.600
The Army said yes and to well speaking for his clients that yes.

21:39.600 --> 21:45.600
Council Jenkins has advised the chair privately on the committee publicly.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.600
He has had one thousand percent cooperation on that score.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.600
The same request was made of Mr. Cohn and Mr. Car from the Resendee for our committee.

21:54.600 --> 22:00.600
The chair has been advised privately and the committee publicly by council Jenkins

22:00.600 --> 22:05.600
that we have had one thousand percent cooperation from the Cohn car from the

22:05.600 --> 22:08.600
party side of this country where he owned that score.

22:08.600 --> 22:12.600
As far as we know neither side has deliberately was tell from the committee

22:12.600 --> 22:15.600
any credit in the committee.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.600
The chair sustains the point of order raised by Senator Dirkson and

22:19.600 --> 22:22.600
council wealth will proceed in order part of our chair.

22:22.600 --> 22:31.600
I mean, Senator, thanks to on the ruling of the chair and the council and the

22:31.600 --> 22:39.600
opinion of Senator Dirkson, I'm highly satisfied with the decision and the ruling.

22:39.600 --> 22:48.600
Yesterday I was trying to make a point on the investigative relationship of G2

22:48.600 --> 22:54.600
under the National Security Council with the FBI and I would like to present to

22:54.600 --> 23:01.600
you that the building any minutes, if not hours, have been taken in discussing

23:01.600 --> 23:06.600
matters of an investigative character with the secretary of the Army from the

23:06.600 --> 23:10.600
standpoint of the file of the investigation file of G2.

23:11.600 --> 23:18.600
My point of order, Mr. Council, is that you decide that the concept of the G2

23:18.600 --> 23:23.600
files and their relationship to the National Security Council and the federal

23:23.600 --> 23:28.600
Bureau of Investigation are totally different from the concept of the file of

23:28.600 --> 23:33.600
this Senate's investigating committee.

23:33.600 --> 23:38.600
May the chair of the minority and Senator that is part of our debate by Senator Dirkson

23:38.600 --> 23:43.600
dealt with a specific question of whether a man engaged in investigating work had

23:43.600 --> 23:46.600
a disclosed the sources of his information.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.600
It was on that that the chair made his rule.

23:48.600 --> 23:53.600
May I remind the chairman that General Joseph F. Powell, the Air Force, who

23:53.600 --> 23:58.600
was seen the copy of this with the investigator in the federal Bureau of

23:58.600 --> 24:03.600
Investigation first lent and then given to the Air Force by Mr. J. Edgahue.

24:04.600 --> 24:09.600
If the chair does not want to consider my point of order, then I would be glad to withdraw.

24:09.600 --> 24:14.600
The chair would say that in the events that General Terrell has called and asked to

24:14.600 --> 24:17.600
disclose an informant and refused to do so.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.600
The chair would certainly sustain the point of order defending his right.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.600
If no one else made it, the chair would make a decision.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.600
The law will certainly hold that the chair won't take a position, which means that

24:27.600 --> 24:32.600
an informant to this committee does not have to be told on where I have an informant

24:32.600 --> 24:38.600
to the intelligence department for the Army or the FBI on the investigating and

24:38.600 --> 24:42.600
advisory committee of the National Security Council, don't have to be informed on.

24:42.600 --> 24:48.600
So General Terrell appears to witness that the chair has stated what his position will be.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
It's an analogous case.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
All right.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
I'm not going with it.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Yes, sir.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.600
Tomso, well, she may proceed in order.

24:56.600 --> 25:02.600
Well, in two of the rulings, I have only one or two more questions, Senator.

25:02.600 --> 25:08.600
In two of everything that has been said now, if I were to go to the Army files looking for

25:08.600 --> 25:15.600
the original of a paper of which you purport to have a carbon copy, you now know I would

25:15.600 --> 25:18.600
not find it, do you not?

25:18.600 --> 25:23.600
You were asking whether or not you would find the original of this, the Army files?

25:23.600 --> 25:24.600
Yes.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.600
I don't know, you wouldn't expect me to which is Senator.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.600
I don't know, well, you would or not.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.600
You would find the same material.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.600
Well, I don't think I was able to.

25:36.600 --> 25:40.600
You would find exactly the same material.

25:40.600 --> 25:47.600
It was testified by Council this morning that every paragraph in the letter is identical

25:48.600 --> 25:56.600
to the documents that the military received except that the security reports on some 34 individuals

25:56.600 --> 25:58.600
has not been included.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.600
17 of them are roughly that.

26:01.600 --> 26:10.600
Working at the radar laboratories, doing top secret work or other classified works, you know that.

26:10.600 --> 26:15.600
So, let's not waste our time and you know the report is there.

26:15.600 --> 26:21.600
I understood you said you last night you'd appoint 14 journals for 14 days to find the

26:21.600 --> 26:22.600
reports.

26:22.600 --> 26:27.600
If you did, if those 14 journals are a component you found not only this one if the other

26:27.600 --> 26:34.600
reports, but you found one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

26:34.600 --> 26:40.600
The eleven other FBI reports all having to do with the same subject.

26:40.600 --> 26:47.600
You now understand, Senator, that the document that you have in your hand is an exact carbon

26:47.600 --> 26:52.600
copy of some letter that was both sent and received.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.600
Mr. Wolfe, I intend to question your client, Mr. Stevens, about that.

26:57.600 --> 27:04.600
I want to know whether or not he has seen this, whether he has had any files, whether he

27:04.600 --> 27:06.600
like you sort of stuff or ignored it.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.600
I can't answer what is in Mr. Stevens' file.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.600
I only ask, I can't answer a vote.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
Everything's in the file.

27:12.600 --> 27:16.600
I'm asking only as to your own understanding, Senator.

27:16.600 --> 27:20.600
Do you understand that there should be in the Army files?

27:20.600 --> 27:24.600
The original of a document, a carbon copy of which you claim to have in your hand.

27:24.600 --> 27:29.600
I don't know what from the Army files you have access to them, I do not.

27:30.600 --> 27:40.600
We've had a testifier of this document, went from the FBI, but a paragraph 1234-678 went from Jager Hoover to the military intelligence.

27:40.600 --> 27:47.600
So if it is not in the file, someone is grossly derelict, and I intend to question your client, Mr. Stevens, about that.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.600
By this document, you mean the 15 page document.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.600
No, you heard what I said, I think.

27:52.600 --> 27:57.600
I said that Mr. Wolfe has been testified on her own, Mr. Hoover has stated,

27:57.600 --> 28:03.600
that all the paragraphs of this letter are verbatim, who are forced to be sent to the Army.

28:03.600 --> 28:17.600
The only difference between this letter and the 15 page document is a paragraph 5, which is a apparent static explanation of why security material has not been included in this letter,

28:17.600 --> 28:25.600
and the fact that in this letter, instead of giving all the derogatory material, nearly the names of the individuals are involved.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.600
You can go over there again ten times if you like.

28:28.600 --> 28:33.600
All right, I would like to go over just one more time and have you listen to the question.

28:33.600 --> 28:42.600
Do you understand that Jager Hoover sent to the Army a document 2 and 1 for pages in length?

28:42.600 --> 28:45.600
Yes, yes or no?

28:45.600 --> 28:48.600
I don't know how many documents, I don't know what the other documents are.

28:48.600 --> 28:57.600
Based up to a senator, do you understand that Jager Hoover sent to the Army a document 2 and 1 for pages in length?

28:57.600 --> 29:02.600
The first document on January 26 is concerned, the answer is no.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.600
Thank you, sir.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.600
The other documents are concerned, I don't know their length.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
That's all.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.600
Is that all, sir?

29:08.600 --> 29:16.600
The chair would like to inquire whether Sam Acraciadisire is not an interrogating himself, or one of his counsels is designed to interrogate him, but is there a current...

29:16.600 --> 29:17.600
I have no questions.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.600
That is the chairman.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.600
Mr. Jenkins, have any?

29:20.600 --> 29:22.600
No further questions, Mr. Chairman.

29:22.600 --> 29:27.600
Mr. Chairman, I want to ask myself a question, but I will give an answer to one.

29:27.600 --> 29:34.600
I would like to explain why this document was brought to this committee.

29:34.600 --> 29:40.600
It was brought to the original air and I used it in the refreshing Mr. Stevens' recollection.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.600
I consider it a tremendous importance.

29:43.600 --> 29:49.600
Now that the authenticity of it has been established, so this is a verbatim copy.

29:49.600 --> 29:59.600
A verbatim copy from the 15 page report to the utility committee and the equalist country that extends to which.

29:59.600 --> 30:04.600
The FBI has done a usual outstanding job.

30:04.600 --> 30:08.600
Tried to get action must come into the reports.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.600
And the usual discouraging results.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.600
No action.

30:12.600 --> 30:16.600
Nothing until a congressional committee has had to cover.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.600
Running for the list, Jim.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Run number 12.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.600
All 14.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.600
The agenda is to my right.

30:21.600 --> 30:25.600
From the decadent, father, voice act, Jackson, Simonton.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.600
Mr. Wilkins included.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
You included Mr. Collins?

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
Yes, sir.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.600
From the McCarthy, you may step down and be temporarily unswarned.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.600
And next witness will be Mr. Stevens.

30:59.600 --> 31:09.600
Thank you.
