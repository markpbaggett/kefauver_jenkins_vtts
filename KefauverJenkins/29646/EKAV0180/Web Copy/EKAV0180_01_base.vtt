00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Well, these different states are already open for not to allow it.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
No, they're still any different causes I had.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
So, the people who say before the effect sooner or later we would have to have oil be born before.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Both are my friends who were right.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
No, me and Mrs. Amitabha, were there any...

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
...like that?

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
You feel there's anything improper with the spending, the 35 security risks?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
No, I didn't know.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
And most of the 35 were suspended because of coming to connection with the black cow.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
That is the standard correct.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I think 21 hours of the album they released until 10 hours before the time.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And of the reasons for this, the spend can have little with the first word.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
This was coming up with the...

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
...isolation in the background.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
What, for a little bit, time for the people?

00:56.000 --> 01:05.000
Well, it also affected many of them have been working in the secret radar laboratory for a very tight, well-periodic time.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
I can't be sighted to the least of times as I work there, but most of them work in the laboratory for a month.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
And some of them for 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12 years.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Well, this was for the proper interest of spend them after hearing the fact that if they should have been suspended.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
Then, we faithfully say that somebody was girlically duty and not having the spend of them before the hearing started.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, I don't think so, Senator.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I have testified as to one of the reasons.

01:35.000 --> 01:45.000
The principle reason was the fact that these things were brought up again and were for thanks to the fact that it was indicative of it.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
This has been published in the last week and April.

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
It required a re-examination of all cases of extrovert and low-grade examination of all of the country's work going on.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Now, I have stated that I have a list of the most important information that I have dealt with.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
That's one of the results of the investigation, which you conducted yesterday.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
The fact that the Army moved more to a greater extent since the fact that it is delayed, so I think you might have otherwise been in the case.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
The little bit of value that the President's new order made it possible to get rid of people who should have been got rid of years before.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, President's new order did one thing, and that was it required one principal thing, which was that the list of things were different from previous order.

02:29.000 --> 02:39.000
That was that it required that in cases where they were resolved, the case was then to be resolved in favor of the government and so is in favor of the individual.

02:39.000 --> 02:51.000
This requires a re-examination of the cases of a late number of people who have been made mindless and favorably resolved under the whole directive.

02:51.000 --> 03:04.000
And hopefully, the examination of a minimum of 80s, raise our burden or the suspension of new individuals who have not under the order, they have been suspended or who have been suspended or re-entertained.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
Let's just put the frame being forget about any particular order. We're talking now about 25 people, I believe it's set down to 21 now, is that right?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yes, that's right.

03:12.000 --> 03:22.000
21 individuals are suspended because of communist elections. Forgetting about any order if the suspensions are now justified.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
Otherwise, if they should not be working at the secret rate our laboratory has of this 13 day of May 1954.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
So, they certainly should not have been working there a year ago or two years ago or two years ago or five years ago.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Is that right?

03:37.000 --> 03:46.000
I think the citizens are ready to go over the stock of them and I think it's a new procedure to stock up and I think it requires a suspension of some people who have not previously been suspended.

03:46.000 --> 03:55.000
However, as you feel that people who are dangerous to the security of this nation have been gotten rid of because of the presence of the presence of New Orleans.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I think it's like truth.

03:57.000 --> 04:12.000
Then you feel that they're not very dangerous to the people who are in a sex system who might previously have had doubts resolved when they're paid or are now having doubts resolved and saved their citizens by the principle of the security of New Orleans.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
And it's a good thing.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
It's been an error that's down on a very simple property.

04:16.000 --> 04:34.000
The only reason for getting rid of what you call a security risk for a subversive is because there's reasons to believe that he might give our military sickness to someone who in turn will give them to a potential am.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
That's the electric industry.

04:37.000 --> 04:47.000
And so as of the day we started hearing, there were at least 21 people who were in that category.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Do that's right?

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
There were 21 and I think that was 21 already had been suspended.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And there were another 14, who were suspended.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Now, don't keep our feet bleeds, stay with your animals.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Actually, there were no suspensions until we started being left to get rid of them.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm not thinking about the hearing.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
I have no knowledge of the data of your investigation precedes one of our programs.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
It's me who have preceded that rate of not to mind now.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
No, there are 67 suspensions in September, one of our suspensions in September.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
So if you're a benefit, I can tell you that the investigation was out of line before that.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm sure that you have a comment later, but nothing has been mentioned.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
That's going to a different question.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
Can you tell us what witness was called a Chibnacle?

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Of course, Mr. Cohn, as my chief counsel did something to Zimpoffer,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
if he subpoenaed witness, we should have been subpoenaed.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I would like to know the name of one.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
You see, we call, I believe, some 500 and I can't recall exactly,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
over 500 witnesses in the 1956.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
Out of that 500, if there's one that was called by Mr. Cohn, out of the clear of vengeance,

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
as a result of the threat, I would like to know about that one witness out of the over 500.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Well, I can't testify that anybody who was called, should not have been called,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
so when you're having an investigation in the service,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
that you were a New York community ordinarily underpriced in order to develop an investigation

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
that's all possible, because many of whom may get your information at all.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Hello.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
This time, the full fire, I'm the victim of the fight against Mr. Cohn.

06:22.000 --> 06:31.000
Because at the end of my time in the search, as I was interrogating you about specific charges

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
of the Army or the investigation, the reason for the Army,

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
I'd like to have our committee consider as the director of the Civil War Against the Right Car.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
And if I am correct, you will be working up for today January 20th,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
the season of the day, breaking fine in the attitudes of the car.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
And the castifying of two dates, an incident, prior to January 20th.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
If I am correct for the detective, as far as the lighting of the passenger out of my role concerned,

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
you felt that he had done nothing between justice by the 11th and the charge against him on that occasion.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
That's it.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
That's it.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
And I think he said the same thing with truth, concerning the luncheon of November 6th is that, sir.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Well, that's not quite correct, sir.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I agree with you.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
I consider this that Mr. Cohn was a participant in the luncheon of November 6th,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
just that he was in the luncheon of December 10th.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
And that it was a form of accuracy, and I did say to you just as I say it to you.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
Well, I heard him calling him in response to an inquiry when I was in the year of office in January.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
But after the date of January 20th, for thereabouts, I had not felt that any actions

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
wanted the car to have so far been in the category that I could call him in properly,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
one person's in demean.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
What was the date of your sentence with Mr. Cohn in the phone about January 1940?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Correct.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Just the chairman was in the present chairman, Epstein chairman was not certain that that conference

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
was not always known, and it's rather a conversation that I had as an ambassador.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
That's right.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
So I would have to try to find out some new concerning situation in the conference.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
I've done it if I am correct, and your five-assignant attorney, Miss Oliver, was on January 20th?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
19 or 19.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yes, sir.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
One of that was three days of being 19 or 20.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
That was two days before your conference with me, and two days before your sentence was undirected.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Right?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yes, sir.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Do I misunderstand you if I did not?

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
We can jump from that date to the five-assignant's attorney and come closer to the president.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Did you say that you told Senator Miss Oliver in that conference?

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Up to that time Frank Carter has done nothing with you, so it's just about the...

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I mean, no.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
It's basically complaining of...

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
No, sir.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
You kind of like I said earlier.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Yes, me, whether or not I thought that Miss Oliver was action-designant's conference.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, Miss Oliver and I were pretty happy to find him there.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
But Carter's action has been in progress.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
They have not by them getting burdens from them.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
However, I have the faith in them.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
I have the faith in many...

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
So, for some of the persuasion from us, I stated to...

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I didn't say to them that I stated to you earlier today,

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
but I told them until last time that Miss Carter was more of an agent to another principal.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
And although he had it, I had a feeling bent.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Although he had...

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I spoke to me on some occasions with mid-tune,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
along this is called when you talk with him, along this is called when you're in Massachusetts.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
We've written back in the train and talked with some links.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
He had been eight co-parts of the political senator in the luncheon of December 10th.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
There's no way things end themselves at that time.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
It did not seem to me to be particularly burdensome.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
If you had a head, we could be sure to list up the...

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
If you had a...

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Carol, you told her that's the same one.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Let me say this as far as the chair is concerned.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
He's got a sort of a whole situation he's feeling about elementals of.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Which may or may not be correct, and you're a thing, you know, any a thing, you know about.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
But that whole situation elementals dealing with justice is that any of my actions,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
who is charged or doing something wrong,

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
are the right to have that charge made against him because the chair has been a member of the Investigating Committee to Congress now,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
are well over the senior.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
I know that investigating committees are frequently accused

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
of making charges which are not supported, of attacking innocent people.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
But I must say that I have never done a number, or have known as any of the Investigating Committee,

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
that ever to my knowledge has ever accused any Americans, simply instead you are a cook,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
and you're guilty to tell what cook is any day.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
I don't think that the Army to take the position to say this is a cook.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Or doing improper things, generally without giving us something specifically day.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
And I suppose to continue to determine its courage as a few,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
until he says this is what he did for sure.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I would say that he did nothing to me, so I don't think it's at all there.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
For any American to be charged, simply with being a cook,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
until you're willing to specify, did he rather think,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
did he steal a horse, did he burn down a barn,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
did he write a false check, what did he do?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Now what did Mr. Carter do, if anything,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
prior to January 20th?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
That's something that's clear,

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
that you're speaking for your point of view, says there's something resembling intimidation,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
or a theft, or an improper means,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
that you're preferring to your statements for days now.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Well, that's kind of a monster,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
both this morning and the staff and everyone,

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
I strive to complete a station to which it will develop,

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
at least in the farest ice of the doubt that the fact is that

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
it's appropriate to January 20th.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I have to turn you in one moment, there I am.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Was you on the main fire of the January?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Are you pleased with me, please?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Yes, but I would like to know that I'm in fire of the January question.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
First, I am going to try and tell you that one cannot answer questions,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
and what he will commit to, and I am trying to answer it,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
and I'll try and do it in about three minutes.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Well, what's subsequent to January 20th?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
That it appears to me, in looking back,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
about these matters, will part of the pattern.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm January 20th, and prior to January 20th,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
they did not seem to need to be so bad.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
What's subsequent to January 20th?

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
In February, and in March, then in March,

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
with the period that the required pattern.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I'm January 20th, they did not confirm me.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm December 20th, when I had lunch, I was December 25th,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and the Chicago students were putting on the bottom of the map.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
On November 26th, when I came back on the train

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
from Massachusetts, with the bottom of the map,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
from near New Jersey, it was later,

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
about here, on a reflection, that it was a pattern.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
What's the thing I was trying to tell you today,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
is that it was morning, and that's the thing I'm trying to tell you now.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Anything, could you give us one?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Yes, sir.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And maybe for you, is the question enough?

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
Did Mr. Carr do anything, or is there anything?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Carr has to graduate from you,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
which, as can tell, he did it, or said it seemed

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
in your opinion to be in power, or of that, or incomeration.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It didn't seem any after time.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Thank you.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I will move to January 20th, down the present day.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
And you tell me, the first date, and the first occurrence

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
that you felt was improper on the part of his car.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Well, I was curious during February,

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
and his urgent is that I should contact George at the call gate,

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
which he did through the latter part of the month of January,

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
the first few days in February.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
I did contact George at his persuasion,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
and from the point where he heard me again,

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
that I called the Chicago State.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
That seemed any of these dreams.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Uh, the load matters, the load matters,

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
and himself still wouldn't have been as bad.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Now, the following is the call.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
You were spending so much time with the American President of Election.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Are you doing what I'm talking about?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yes, sir.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Foreign cars would suggest that you would talk to George about this?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
No, I thought it was odd.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
It was strange, it was unusual.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I did not use that sort of thing.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
The cars, however, were not just the ones that were used in unusual or odd,

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
and you would just say that he stopped by in company to obtain different things.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
So I asked you specifically whether to ask a user about the jet to talk to you

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
or to consider volume to be improper,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
and whether you asked that to just the same type of car that you just didn't use on the jet.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
What drives you to the state of the state?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
The charge issued by the Army on April 30th,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
signed by Justice M. Welch,

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
by the time, as if the specifications for these games.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
The problem that we can see on the fourth line,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
was just paid by the provide, just for it.

14:45.000 --> 15:07.000
Well, this is what's on the fourth line.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
All right, do we read for it?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, sir, that's it, not specified.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
That's right, that's right, that's it, not specified.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Can I talk to you about that?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
I'll say it, of course not.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I'm asking you to talk to you about this.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I can say you did it with by the time that it was all done,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
as I have stated to you, sir,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
and this may not be a better factor, Hector.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
On this question, the team in the year goes out of the proper action.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And then you've very good question.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
And then we can sooner or later, we'll get you up with the date.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Ask the car.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
That's the car I asked you.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
The telephone, George the Coltie.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
If you interpret that as being an improper thing,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
you could hear me to do it.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
Well, I think more of an improper share.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
My family is fine.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Now, by unanimous consent, the chair would ask the permission

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
to call on Senator Potter, other word,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
because he has to catch you.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Yes, the chair will let me make one observation

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
of being led to yield.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I have to catch his brain also.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
And I may say a little, chairman before I depart,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
but some of my questions, at least,

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
will have to do with testimony

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
as if this witness, presently, is on the renovation

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
onto this closed and, then, here's testimony.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I assume cannot be concluded this afternoon,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
but if we call back one later,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
then I shall look forward to another question

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
on my part until that date.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm just contentioned with how long son the Potter has been.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Son the Potter?

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
Mr. Adams, in my previous ten minutes in chair,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
I question you as to whether or not

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
this time, you received preference for free.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Now, I believe you just advised, in fact,

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
that he received preference for free from hesitate

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
and result of a request made for committee duty.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
In no way, effective, in no way, was to interfere

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
with his training before that.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Now, this, the treatment card,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
according to private sign, you interfere

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
with his training before that.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
It is my understanding that it is,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
I am not really confident to answer that question

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
because the official report sticks,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
no it in the tail, and I have not read

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
that the bill reports the forcibly,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
so I cannot answer in detail.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I have no only that general round,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
the commander of forcibly,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
is calling on the age of December,

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
and this indicates that he was afraid,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
that the weekday of availability of the soldiers

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
is going to interfere with his training.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Well, then, can you testify as to whether he did,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
or did not receive preference for free

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
from which interfere with his training?

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
I cannot testify from my own knowledge,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
so I believe that the old answer is better

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
than the answer by general Ryan or his age

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
because I have not made a detailed study

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
about what happened before today.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
I would like to refer again to the stipulations made

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
by Fundament Carthamette de Cone and Mr. Cough.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
And stipulation number 10,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
they said,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
new stories,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
quote-unreliable thought is outstanding,

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
but the reason he, referring to Robert Cine,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
was not given the consideration

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
to which he would otherwise have been entitled,

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
but because of his connections with his committee.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Now, the question I wish to ask you, Mr. Adams,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
was Robert Cine discriminated against?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Because of his former associations with his committee.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I have no knowledge of this there.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I do not believe that he was.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I have never heard of a watch from any source at all.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
I have never heard anything in the State that, sir.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
In your knowledge of the Army,

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
the private time had gone in with all the panfares.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Would he have received any higher ratings?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Would he receive the commission?

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Would he have received more desire for duty?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, I think that the answer to the last third in the negative.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
I think your private Cine has been rather sniffed.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
But his application for a commission was then rejected.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I think that he would have been drafted.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I think that living in New York,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
he was the first eight weeks of face-to-face training at sports camp stage.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I think that with his background,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
he probably would have been considered qualified

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
for the same sort of additional training,

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
and that he probably would have gone to camp board.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
So I would say that I don't think anything happens to him.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Private, if my understanding,

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
the private time has a college education that too.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Yes, sir.

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
And I assume that the private time received the aptitude test

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
or the evidence test that everyone was able to receive.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Yes, sir.

20:17.000 --> 20:26.000
Is my assumption right that he is a semi-above average?

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
And in charge of the high rating, I don't know, sir.

20:29.000 --> 20:36.000
I don't know anything about his IQ or anything of that sort.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
I would say, sir, it was reference to whether or not he should have had a commission.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
The only person who is commissioning people only in certain special branches,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
such as the medical corps, the dental corps,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
the judge-athletes, the general corps,

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
people who have to have a special educational background.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
I don't think that the Alex commission generally are available to men

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
by reason of having a degree in the bachelor's degree.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
The reason I'm asking this year is the question.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
I think that we want to make sure that the weather's private time

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
was discriminated against or not.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I know, sir, he was not.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
All right.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
That's a different then to circulation number 15.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
And it's dropping down into several parts

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
and I would like to read number of subsection A.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
I have to admit to Adams and Mr. Steven's claim

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
that they were threatened and amused by the chairman of Mr. Cohen.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
They extended the hospital's health development

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
except his health development for the chairman of Mr. Cohen.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Now, is this true?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
That is true.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
The invite is asked to and why.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Well, the simple answer is the one I gave you yesterday, sir.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
No, no, hit of an executive agency is anxious to remain in the state of hostility

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
with the committee chairman or with the staff of the committee with which you must work.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
And that it's a normal thing to attempt to infiliate after there is difficulty.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And what occurs in this thing?

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
And in the purpose of accepting the hospital as a chairman of Mr. Cohen,

22:19.000 --> 22:28.000
following the claim that the elect threat was in order to better your relationship

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
with the committee that threat to keep our relationship,

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
which generally was good.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Despite the threat, we managed to infiliate Mr. Cohen.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I think this reveries the incident of the 20-odd total.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I think we managed to lift it so that we could develop on that day.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
All points be.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
The day after Mr. Cohen is alleged to have made threaten and violent statements

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
to Mr. Adams.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
Mr. Adams, Dying with Mr. Cohen and his family, Mr. Cohen, who?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Is that true?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
That is correct, sir.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
And was that done for the same purpose?

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
No, I think if I can give you about three sentences.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
The description of the incident, Mr. Cohen, within the Washington, about afternoon,

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
and I went to New York on the same airplane with Mr. Cohen and Mr. Car.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
We were going to arrive about dinner time in the evening,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
and I had suggested that we go to Christ by that night.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
And I was going indicated that the tickets would be at his house.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
So as we were at the point when we were in New York,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
I think as we were in a cab, Mr. Cohen said,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
well, we'll have dinner at my house.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I had a very obvious choice.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
I could either say, no, I'll eat at the drug store, and you pick me up,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
or I could go to his house.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
That's what I was in my savings.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You, the president of the Price Price, yes sir, and his family,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
the very best sister of me.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
This mother-in-law.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
As was Mr. Cohen.

23:51.000 --> 23:57.000
Now, point E.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
After Mr. Cohen has alleged to have said about wrecking the Army,

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
and causing us the sniffer of Mr. Adam's boss,

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
Mr. Adam continued to invite Mr. Cohen to lunch,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
and to discuss Hill Off Partnership with him.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
Now, maybe just a tie yesterday that we're discussing

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
on the Law Offerer Partnership for him.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
So, from and just that you had,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
that you weren't worried about it,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
but these theories are meetings,

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
of social meetings between yourself and Mr. Cohen.

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
During the period of time when the so-called threat will be in me,

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
was a for the, because the threat were,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
you just considered as the threat to the inside,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
and you, so you enjoyed the social friendship of Mr. Cohen,

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
or did you feel that by fraternizing to that extent,

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
he would be an a better position to heal the wounds,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
so called, or to stop the threat.

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
Well, this particular specification was about the last time we saw each other.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
We went to lunch together that day in the restaurant

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
in the Senate Office Building,

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
and I went back to his office that afternoon when that is to the occurred.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
And that was on about the 13th of January.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't recall that I saw Mr. Cohen very much,

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
or very often after that.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
And I saw him at a hearing in New York on February 18th,

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
and I think he had gone to Florida on January 20th,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
for thereabouts, January 16th.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
We saw each other.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
We saw each other very very little.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
There's a little more rope on that microphone,
