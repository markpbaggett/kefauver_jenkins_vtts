00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
On a baby's answer, that's the...

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
That you felt a sort of...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
You'd better call it with a few minutes.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Whatever it is.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
But I've been not, my friend.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
The answer I check in was led to believe that by Mr. Carr.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
I certainly gained that in question.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I don't think that I have survived

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
before the month of investigation will terminate.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
If Mr. Shine hadn't given a commission,

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
he'd call by the time I think you'd know that to Shine

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
will have been taken into the department.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
That to Shine will give me an army watch

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
what they're going to do in the army.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
No, no, not at me.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
You have to have some more.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I'll sue me.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I'll sue me, my friend.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Send them a copy of charges or a suit.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
If the army had a given,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
private Shine a commission,

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
or located him in New York.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
One of the benefactors, the army member of law,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
a pardoning power,

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
will the committee to co-op the investigation?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
No, no, no, no.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
The army never can fill a job of shine

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
as a piece of bargaining power.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I never can fill it in the fact.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I never can fill it.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Private Shine, in any way,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
and a soldier who should serve the soldier.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
You never can fill it by the time I'd

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
a pawn for the unit.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I did not say that.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Before Senator Jackson starts to question the witness,

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I've had to return to our chiefial

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
who dropped the concrete of the minor station

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
to identify themselves.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
This is ABC television network.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
The Miami story reveals the way Miami

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
puts the heat of the nation's biggest gun girl

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
gambling syndicate.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Films away at happenings with brutality and violence.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Where it happened in Miami's gambling casinos

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
under armed police protection.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
These are Miami's story now

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
of the paramount state at times.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Wait.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Overweights, cut no text.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Rouge those arms, get in step with Louis Sherry,

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
sugar free jelly.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Grape, strawberry, black, black,

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
orange, monolate.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
One of them was the gallery of three people fold.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
In an effort to get us to meet,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Senator Jackson has not yet started the question threat.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Similar to the questions that I put to Mr. Steve.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Chapter 79, title 18,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
section 1621 of the U.F. Code,

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
field for surgery,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
states in effect that any person that

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
ceptifies a girl,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
and will play in Comrade to such a

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
state first described any material matter

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
that she does not lead to be through

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
with children's surgery in jail.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Except there's otherwise expressly provided by the law,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
they find not more than $2,000,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
or in case of not more than five years.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
There are a number of allegations and statements

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
concerning Mr. Adams that I believe are material

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
to the controversy.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
None of these statements,

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
the allegations against you,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
and have had yet been made under oath.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
If those responsible for making them do repeat them under oath,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
and you denied them under oath,

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
if all of them suspect the many,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
then someone is guilty of surgery.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
I know you realize that this is the most serious matter,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
and I hope that you will confer deeply

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
as you answer the question that I'm about to put to you.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
The first question.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
This was stated by Mr. Cohn

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
on March 12, 1954,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
that he tried to blackmail him

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
and to calling off the suspect committee investigation

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
of the Army.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Is this allegation of Mr. Cohn

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
who or faulted his fault?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
You were quoted in the New York Times of March 13

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
as a label-angous charge of blackmail.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Fantastic and full.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
The fantastic and full of your fault.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Do you maintain that position under oath?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
How do you say it?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Next question.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
It is stated by Mr. Frank Barr

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
in a memorandum

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
to Senator McCarty of December 9, 1953,

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
that's December 9, 1953 for your reference.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Would you like to have us first?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I have it first.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And I told, December 9, 1953,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
from Frank Barr, memorandum to Senator McCarty.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
So even though they, the Army,

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
said he, shine, deserve a commission.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
They did not give it to him

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
because of the left wing threat

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
and they keep trying to dangle,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
to pull the small favors in front of us,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
in the full.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Did you ever make a statement

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
that private shine deserves a commission?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yes, sir.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Did you ever hear Secretary Steven make that statement

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
to any member of the McCarty Committee

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
or McCarty Committee staff?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
No, sir.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Would you label that allegation as true or false?

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
I would say, for the allegation has been false.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Mr. Roy Cohn has quoted in US News and World Report

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
of March 19, 1954 as stating,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
that the Army and I call.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
No improper influence

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
will ever exerted by me,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
may be combed.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Though by anyone else on behalf of Sean,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
end of call,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
is that statement true or false?

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
On the express,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
on March 14, 1954,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Mr. Cohn answered a question

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
by Mr. Jack Bell of Associated Press

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and I quote,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm quoting now.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
The only communication we had with the Army

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
was with Mr. Cohn speaking.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
The only communication we had with the Army about time

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
when he was down at court,

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
was pursuant to our arrangements,

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
but after his training was over at the end of the day,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
and over weekend,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
when he was doing no training,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
he would, instead of recreational activities,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
devote himself to work.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And that was the only purpose of any communication

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
we had with the Army

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
while he was at court big.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
There's this statement of Mr. Cohn's tour ball.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I am, instead of the driver of the Army there,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I will say that he did have communication

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
with me for the difficult of the math

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
for the patient to get false.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Next question.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Mr. Cohn has folded on me

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
to press on March 14.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I was sitting in an answer to Larry's feedback

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
and I quote,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Mrs. Mr. Cohn,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
please.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
As I said, Mr. Cohn,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
we did not ask for special treatment for him.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Chai, and her quote,

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
the best statement to her quote,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
has been its fault.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Okay.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
In an interview random from

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Roy Cohn to Senator McCartney,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
dated December 9, 1953,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
to following with state.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
This is December 9 for Roy Cohn,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
the Senator McCartney.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Since December 9, 1953,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
the following was stated,

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
and I quote,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
John Adams said today that following the idea

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
upon investigations of the Air Force,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
he had gotten specific information for us

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
about an Air Force base,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
where there are a large number of home affectionate.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
He said he was treated

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
with that information if we would tell him

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
what the next Army project was,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
we would investigate,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
and oppose.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Does that say a true or a false?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
That's both of his thoughts.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
You have stated under oath,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Mr. Adams, that Mr. Cohn used extremely

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
a scene and by two previous language

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
as there is time.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And so the Army had double caught him

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
when he said there was Cohn.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
When he felt Chai was not receiving

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
the treatment that Cohn felt the Army

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
should have reported him.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Am I correct?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Yes, sir.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I meet the press on March 14th

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
of the year Mr. Jack Dale,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
ask Mr. Cohn the following question.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Question.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Well,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
did you ever use my cooperative language

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
as noted twice in this report

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
in discussing this thing or say

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
that the Army had double caught you,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
and said Cohn,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I think some of the other people

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
at the table with you

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
have known me for some time

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and watched me know that

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
whatever else I might do,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm not a type who was used by

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Superdive Langtime.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I try to be a gentleman,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
and I think I was in my dealing with Mr. Steven

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
and with the Army in this report.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
There's Mr. Cohn's statement

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
that he never used by Superdive Langtime

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
as true or false.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
In your testimony,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
on May 12th, Mr. Adams,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
of this year,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
you stated that he

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
26,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
06,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
on the flyman.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
You stated that he,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
on page 26 of this date,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
that Mr. Delight's phone,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
when he heard that David Cohn

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
was liable to be sent overseas,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
stated, and I quote,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Steven is through a secretary of the arms,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
and then added with even more force,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
folks, we will wreck the Army into full.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Army suppressed on March 14th, 1964,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
the following call-up way,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
took place, Mr. Jack Cohn.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Mr. Cohn, did you at any time,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
under any circumstance,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
you'd wreck the Army?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Mr. Cohn, that statement on a face

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
is so ridiculous,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
that it's even hard for me to end.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Of course I don't,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
and of course I shouldn't,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
but I would deny,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
when Mr. Cohn,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
that he ever said he would wreck the Army,

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
through or fall,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
through the Army fall.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Jack Cohn,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
and then,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
this fall, Jack Cohn,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
did you say that you would speak to it,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
that secretary Steven would be through?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Mr. Cohn,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
that again is so ridiculous,

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
just on a face.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
How could I,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
one employee of a Senate committee,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
bring about the wrecking of an Army,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
which I've beaten Hitler and Sojourn,

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
and the foe?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Isn't it an aisle of Mr. Cohn,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
that he ever said that foe,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Steven would be through,

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
and secretary of the Army,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
through or fall?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And I, I just fall.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Illinois Cohn,

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Frank Cohn,

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
a Senate of the Conningville,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
a particular,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
and paragraph 24 page 12.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
You find that?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm paragraph 24 page 12.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It has stated my foe.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Honor upon October 13th,

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
1953, Mr. Adams suggested that the subcommittee go after the Navy,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
and Air Force,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
and drop its foe of communist infiltration in the Army,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
and the foe.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Mr. Adams,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
is that true or false?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
True or false?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
From the family's fire.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Senator,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Senator Femme.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I have no questions this time.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Senator Warton.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Mr. Warton,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Mr. Warton, Mr. Sinclare.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Mr. Cohn,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Senator.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Mr. Cohn,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
there you go,

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't know.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So we're wasting much time,

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
and here's Mr. Steven's private sign,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
but we'll have to wait a bit more at least.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I have these questions,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
and you have the questions,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Senator Potter asked you.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
I have them written in the site that you have been very close

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
to the reporters for the Washington Post,

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
which I've referred to often as the Washington Baylor worker, haven't you?

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I have a clean excuse before I took the Washington Post.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
You haven't traveled with you in touch.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
I traveled once with Mr. Cohn.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I think it's right now, traveled twice.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Now I quote from the

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
issue of Thursday March 25, 1954,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
article in Washington's

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
poster daily worker,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
there's something much I want to call him.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
They talk,

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
finding it unofficial.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
So the former unpaid consultant to Senator Joseph Rhyme

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
was not even left to getting committee,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
and both friend of Rhyme Cohn,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
chief counsel of the group,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
will become a student of the Army

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
criminal investigation school of Camp Gordon, Georgia next week.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Now I quote from the same sheet the next day,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
following the March 26th,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
with the front page survey,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
the Army has backtracked

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
on assigning private V-Day of a shine

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
to its criminal investigation school

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
after the White House intervened in the case.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
But if no, me at this,

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
but it's not true,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
or whether it's completely unsure.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I have no knowledge of how those stories came out.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
I have no knowledge of the

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
purpose of reference to the question of the effort

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
and I have no knowledge of any of the

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
program refining with their

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
best private shine.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I'm unable to give you any help on those new stories, sir.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Well, I wonder if you could do this for us, Mr. Adams.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
The claim here, the shine got special consideration.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Where are the new stories?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Where are one of the papers that you've

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
favorite with a preview of the charges against the

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
strong, tryingly story that shine was in pedals

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
to go to criminal investigation school

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
before the White House intervened.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
In view of the facts of this,

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
I can't believe this is true,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
I can't believe the White House will

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
intervieween the case of their private.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
But you apparently are friendly with this paper.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
So it happens to him.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
You think you could find out for me

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
the basis for this story.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
And tell me, if you can't find the basis of

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I know you can't ask for the source of their

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
information, could you come back Monday and

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
tell me whether or not there's any truth for this story?

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
What if you want me to come back and tell you on Monday?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
For the very truth to the original story,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
the shine was excited for our criminal investigation school

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
number one and number two I quote,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
so the army has tracked on assigning privacy to

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
the time of criminal investigation school after the

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
White House intervened in the case.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
If you could deal it over the weekend,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
give it an information Monday and I appreciate it very much.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I don't think that I could do it, sir.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
But if you could deal it, no, sir.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Well, frankly, if you're friend or a former

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
enough he has been excited to go to

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
criminal investigation school for the enough

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
of a million people in Boston.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Could I?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Yes, could you?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Well, I think it is.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Which would you do that for me?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Yes, and so far I know that it's not true.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
All right.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
But when you were checking,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
another one you said, sorry, it's because

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
he's unsure.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I say, it's far I know that it's not true.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
If you're getting mad, it's your favorite paper, can't you?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
My favorite paper is New York Times.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
And what?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's the right to go.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
It's the right to go.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
It's the right to go.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
It's the right to go.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
It's the right to go.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
There's one person, Mr. Adams,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
along that line, he left your favorite paper,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
why did you leave him out of your preview

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
of the charge of the gift, but there's no answer.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I'll tell you, I think it is only fair and fair

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
at the state tonight.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Nobody will give a drinkable any charge.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Because that's the time I told you these new

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
things, I mean, I haven't known that.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I think the charge of the gift is the correct.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
This doesn't do actually, Mr. Adams,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
for a trip.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
At least you didn't give your paper a paper

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
of preview of the fact that I didn't know

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
if there were people of preview of any charge.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Well, I was just simply understanding what the term means.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
You gave the child a complete run

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
of the charges, a month before the senator is gone,

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
some dentist.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
I told Mr. Adams what the fact that I had

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
is was not a run down of charges.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I have no knowledge that any charges

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
were going to be spared at that time.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Well, now, as you showed him your files,

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
and you saw him over the office?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
No, I didn't call him over the office.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
He came into my office.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
All right, and I hit that money for your protection

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
on his ad you did set the money

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
as if he was showing all of your files over the second.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Is that true that you've known?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I said that, that's true, I didn't hit it that.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
But I want to put them up there, too.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
I showed them all my files about the charges.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
You have authority to do that, Mr. Dean.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
No.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
I don't have any authority that I can relax

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
before you ever use and act on my part

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
over the prescription to the good, Mr. Man.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Those persons, please.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Thank you.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Let's go to the next object.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Now, we'll get back to that again, perhaps.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, Mr. Adams, I'm sure you'll agree.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
It's very serious matter as far as I'm concerned

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
and my staff are accused of improper conduct.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I'm very carefully recruited by a considered

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
an outstanding staff, all of them

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
with a background of FBI training,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Justice Department Secret Service

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
with the exception of one.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Mr. Cohen, as you know, has had a tremendous background

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
in prosecuting commuters in the Rosenberg case.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Now, I'm in case.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Some of the top commuters,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
exposing commuters to the UN.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
Mr. Kairz, you know, was head of the security

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
matters desk of the FBI in New York

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
and the light support came with my committee.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
So if there's done something in the proper,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'd like to know about that.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And we've been talking about the conversation

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
you've had with Mr. Cohen.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
For the time being, could we forget about

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
the conversations and get down to what he did

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
that was in law?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Can that connect with me and ask you this?

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
Doesn't I tell you that Mr. Cohen, Mr. Kairz,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
were following my instruction,

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
carrying out my orders and digging out

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
commuters infiltration of the military?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I told you that, doesn't it?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I don't remember such statements that I always assumed

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
that they were in your office.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Yes.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
Now, a scientific conversation,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
the threats that you talked about,

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
what exactly did Mr. Cohen do to follow up the threats?

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Saturday, where you been, you're looking on the 17th of December?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I was. We'd like to discuss that.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Yes, sir.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
But that's the right thing we're at.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And what's the discuss that we're getting on to

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
be my question, we'll get back to discuss.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
You and I, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Kairz,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
two friends of mine had lunch at Gasser's,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
that right?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Yes, sir.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
The Gasser's the rest of the short,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
away from Foley Square in New York.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yes, sir.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
And at that time, we spent a great deal of time

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
discussing General Law, and that we know.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
No, sir.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
You say we didn't know the discuss.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
We discussed for a very short time.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
How long were we in the press conference?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
We were in that restaurant,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
two and a half hours.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
Now, the refresher recollection, Mr. Adams,

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
that you not bring up the subject of Dave Shine,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
did not, and you brought up the subject, right?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I did, sir.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
And at it?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
You said you didn't know the answer, you know, right here.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Right. Now, you brought up the subject.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
When you brought it up, did not, Mr. Cohen sign?

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Let's discuss Lawton, because I want Senator McKite,

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
you don't know what Adams and Stevens are trying to do to Lawton.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
No, sir, he did not.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, we did get out of the question of Lawton, didn't we?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Yes, sir.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
And you indicated to me that Lawton was to be relieved of his command?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
On that occasion, sir?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Yes.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
The answer is in the meeting.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Well, what did you tell me about Lawton?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
I said, Dave, it was about Lawton on that occasion, me, yes.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
I remind my diary number was brought up on Mr. Cohen,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
about my only statement of reference to the truth,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
was to protest and say that the allegation he made

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
the reference to the Secretary's plans concerning General Lawton

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
was not true, but that Mr. Cohen

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
did seem to himself the same man.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
So, Mr. Cohen pointed out to me that Mr. Lawton,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
or the Honorable Lawton was to be broken, rather,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
to be summoned to the command, because of his cooperation

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
with the committee.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
And you said that he was being relieved of his command

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
for a different reason.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
And you asked me whether I would do the act of Lawton

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
or broken?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Not on that occasion, no, sir.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
When we entered a rundown town,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
then you were discussed that, right?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Yes, sir.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
And we came to a place where the door left turned well.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
That's right.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
The placement on the corner?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Very twice, sir.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
Mr. Cohen had a card.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
He held out the card to the placement inside

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
and the Saddam post of the railway station.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Can I turn left here?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
And the placement side, who the something others

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
with Saddam said, go on ahead?

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
I didn't have the sender there, I regret.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Correct.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Well, the thing keeps me on it.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
There's no one to turn left, and the police

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
does know that I'm full left card on me,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
but it's straight ahead.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
All right.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
So he tried to turn left to take you to the people.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Your time is exact.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
OK.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
This is what reminds me that it just has to speak

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
already.

22:53.000 --> 23:01.000
We will stand for five minute recess at this time.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
This is the first of the five minute recesses

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
that have been called under the new agreement

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
to have longer sessions in the morning and the afternoon.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It's sort of equivalent to the seven-pinning stretch

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
in the bulk.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And while we do have the opportunity,

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
let's return to our studios across the country

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
to permit our stations to identify themselves.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
This is ABC Television Network.
