00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
Secretary, this is ABC television.

00:03.500 --> 00:08.000
The nightward, the Missouri moves to the next time,

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
at five o'clock.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Right after the day, the Jolly Jean in the Star machine is 515.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Other highlights of the evening, John Daniel in the near-17,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Daniel is brand of the world of 730, at 8 Sky King.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
My hero is Robert Cummings, at 830,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Alan Bachelot-Neyam, and another unusual gunner,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
and the unexpected at 930.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
All these five shows are on the five channel, Ben.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
I'll make a video of you all this time.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
This is my editor today.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
The question of Senator McCartney was objective 2 by Mr. Welk.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
No, we asked it again.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm saying the direct, and I can't give a name with a few individuals.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
And I wish you that, put that in your pocket after you've gone through something.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Do you recognize those names?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Not first.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
No, I don't first.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I recognize those names.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Not first.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
No, I don't first.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I recognize them.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Is there any one of your age to continue?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
What John's they hold?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I can look it up for you.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Well, it would one of your olds, and they can't really tell me all of the security claims.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Did you have this, Adam?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Is there one of the generals?

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
So two names, Matthew, what John's they hold?

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
So that position, Lord, gets the more information they got us for this time.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I think those people don't recognize the names, yes, Adam.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
So the answer to this question was the...

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I don't think there's a fucking name on the list.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm asking to get this information far from here on the list.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm asking to get this information far from here on the list.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm asking to get this information far from here on the list.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
So I would encourage to the fucking name on the list.

01:46.000 --> 01:56.000
The first one of the other names is Matthew's, as a reporter, may showering a legend's comment

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
in action for his part, and that his secrets and how secrets were removed.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
But he is still allowed to direct programs that are secrets.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
If this were correct, I would like to know.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
It seems like a very unusual stuff of it, too.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So I don't think about it, but we'll check it out.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
That's one for my ass.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Mr. Cohen, Mr. Secretary, on the issue of letter,

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
and I was trying to get this committee to stop its investigation.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I'll report my notes.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
I'd like to look at the information of the investigation, or the allegation number 11,

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
in the charges with you and Mr. Adam's name, as it will follow in writing.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
New charge, the final of the out November 14, 1953,

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
Mr. Cohen threatened to continue the documenting investigation at Fort Monmouth.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
And in the next charge, you say that the final of November 16,

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Car renew the threat, namely the threat to continue the investigation

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
of Fort Monmouth, personally to you.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
I will ask you, sir, if you say that the taken on the part of Mr. Car and myself

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
that the investigation will be continued, is a threat,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
does it not follow it there?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
That you see it in fact once that investigation stops and regarts its continuation,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
as they threaten you.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Is not what that says?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I've set the fire on us repeatedly, Mr. Cohen.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Probably a dozen times, and you know the answer, Mr. Bolivier.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Mr. Secretary, I'm going to say the answer again,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
that I wanted the type of hearings stop that was given the American people

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
and the Army for the unfair picture of what the fact was at Fort Monmouth.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I wanted the type of hearings stop.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Mr. Secretary, there is not one word in this charge,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
which you made about changing the type of hearings.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
It says, threaten to continue the subcommittee investigation,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
comma, which has been before resulted in exaggerated headlines,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
stamens, and then around on first and now, at one.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
That's the first either second one.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Right?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
But that's the continued.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Mr. Secretary, that's the...

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh, that's right.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Then may, personally, to you, name it,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
to continue the investigation at Fort Monmouth.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Mr. Cohen, I've explained repeatedly,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
and I'll do it again if you want.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
But I want a type of hearing change.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
What type of hearing did you want, Mr. Chairman?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Every member on this committee, I am sure,

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
is there certain that the Secretary has repeatedly anxious that question

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and explainfully his position, and I do respectfully,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
in this, as Mr. Cohen types to a new subject, if there is,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
anything new.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Mr. Secretary, I think there's a lot more than that.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
By my respectfully say, so I think there's a lot on answer.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And I think, on course, examination, this charge is made

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
against Mr. Cohen and me.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
A charge that we've threatened to continue the investigation.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
And I think I can point it by nature to an upplained insinficency

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
between the Secretary's testimony and towards charge

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
with he himself as next.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
And that's what I'm trying to do now, sir.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
And I don't believe I've had a time to be poor.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So I have to do that, Mr. Chairman.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Now, the Secretary, just to move me on the first day of the first day of the

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Supreme Court, 42, is directly, as testimony, Mr. Staden,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
is directly contradictory what he says today.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
He then says that he wanted the hearing suspended.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Then after thinking it over and talking it over, that's where he has

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
changed.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So now he says he wanted a different change of hearing.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, and you are the inconsistency in the

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Secretary's sworn testimony.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
And I may say the only way that we can get up to truth if we ever

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
can with a selective memory is to cross the gentlemen in detail.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
And I personally hope the Jones was allowed to do that.

05:40.000 --> 05:47.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Cohen will ask a new question and point out

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
specifically any alleged discrepancies in testimony.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Get a full give them to the Secretary and testimony given there.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm sure including debate, I will say, with a proper question.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Very well, sir.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
I'm going to show that right now.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Mr. Frany, I'm going to show you that as always you've got my hands back on.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Number one, Mr. Secretary, you have today testified that all you wanted

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
was a change in the type of hearing.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
I now direct your attention if I may, sir, to your testimony,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
it pays 440 tools a record.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
And ask you whether or not you did not categorically admit that,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
that you wanted the hearing to spend.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I wanted the type of hearing change.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
There I am.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I didn't do that before in testimony.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
I recognize that in testimony.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
I said that they're not.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Mr. Jenkins, that is correct.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So in so far as this charge against you that you tried to stop the investigation

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
of what moment is concerned, that is not correct.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
You nearly tried to get its suspense.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Secretary Stevens, that is right.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I wanted to suspend the type of hearings that were being held.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
And I've testified on that at least a dozen times, friends.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Yes, I'll leave with this committee to judge whether my testimony is consistent

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
or accurate or not.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes, sir.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And I believe that under the rules of cross-examination I have to write the call

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
to the committee's attention cases where there is a plain inconsistency in testimony on this key issue.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And that was the process of my question.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And my next question is whether or not allegations.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Number 11, stating that Mr. Collins' retinue continues the subcommittee investigation

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
at London is not further in inconsistency with testimony you were given here.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I have to spread repeatedly that I wanted to type a hearing change.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I now repeat that that is what I want.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Did you want the hearing to suspend it?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I wanted the type of hearing that was being held suspended yet.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Do you want to decide to be a type of hearing?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yes, sir.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
What type of hearing did you want to suspend?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I wanted one of the conductors that were the American people

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
would get a fair and accurate idea of what's proceeding produced

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
and better having it have practically no relation or very little relation to the facts.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
Mr. Secretary, you are making people think that Fort Monmouth was a bed of us being asked.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And that was not in accordance with the facts.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Mr. Secretary, let's see now.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
First of all, is it a fact that either you or Mr. Adams

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
would like to spread or invite it to be present at every single executive session

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
or public session of ours subcommittee on Fourth Monmouth?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
A suggestion that is in cover.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Mr. President, you have to be quick to carry that here.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Now we have that, Mr. Secretary.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
First of all, is it a fact that either you or Mr. Adams

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
would like to present or invite it to be present at every single executive session or public session

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
of our subcommittee on Fourth Monmouth?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
That's all on cover, please.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Mr. President, is it all the best question you have ever answered earlier?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
And say it can be settled in one second by a yet 1-0 answer, Mr. Chairman.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
The obvious purpose of the question is this.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
The Secretary says that he objected to the type of hearings being conducted for the MacGee Investigating Committee.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
The scone has now seen him whether or not he and Mr. Adams attended every executive session.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Mr. Chairman, is it clear that the committee has been in the position of the committee?

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
The scone has now seen him whether or not he and Mr. Adams attended every executive session.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
The obvious purpose being to show that the Secretary did not know all the time of the exact type of hearings

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
that was being conducted directly.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yes, sir.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
What's one further section?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Mr. Chairman, if I would like to show, that's all.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Some of these very executive sections that we were discussing.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Mr. Stevens met the press along with Senator McRotty.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
And so it seems that Senator McRotty said and never once objected to a single segment

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
which Senator McRotty had made.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
My eyes just like the question Mr. Chairman played at.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Well, I believe it is, but no, definitely it's way.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Mr. Cone has entitled to have an answer to this question and I'll let you know.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I do.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I defer Mr. Stevens.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
Did you and Mr. Adams attend every executive session of the MacGee Investigating Committee?

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
I certainly didn't very very soon that I attend.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
I don't know about Mr. Adams.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
He attended many more.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
He attended many more than you did, that's right.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
But are you certain whether or not he attended all of the hearings?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I would say about half of it.

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
He attended then all of the hearings were not attended by you and I, Mr. Adams, correct?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
That's all.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
Mr. Cone, Mr. Secretary, may I ask, whether after any of those hearings that you attended,

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
when you met the press along with Senator McRotty, you had made any objection to anything which he had said.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I don't ever recall having met the press with Senator McRotty,

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
that's on the one hand sentence at Court Monmouth, and it went down there with the inspection,

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
and after that meeting was over, it wasn't a hearing and the usual sentence I would say,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
and the witnesses were not called if I was called.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And there I joined with Senator McRotty, I don't recall any other.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, I'm going to try to produce on this page as to see if we can request your recommendation.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm very glad.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Mr. Cone, I'm going to move back here.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
If your objection to the type of hearing I address with all the sessions which you attended

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
or all of which you did not present, both the folks.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Did you make the objection at the time?

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
I'm very glad, however, to the ones that I did not attend, because I only went to very few,

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
and the reports on those, I got the same reports that the people there, namely on the newspaper.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
On those which you attended?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
On those which I did not attend.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I thought on those which you attended, sir.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Did you want to suggest the sentence on the coffee and to have anything wrong with the type of hearing when you were there?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I think that I went to...

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I think I went to two.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Two out of important ones, that right?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Well, I don't know if there are any more important than any other.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
When you heard Aaron Coleman said to find one, did you not?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
That's right.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I'd say that was an important one, you agree, were you not?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
That's right.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Did you find anything objectionable in the amount of absence conducted?

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
I had what I and a senior question was,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
did I take part in press conferences with Senator McRotty?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I had to make a very good role, but my answer was I did not.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Well, that was a question about three questions ago.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
You said you didn't recall, I'm going to try to get together some new sites to see if I can request your answer right away.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Very good. My question is to see if it's right or not.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
After the executive session is completed, you haven't made any objection whatsoever.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Do any characterization made by Senator McRotty?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
What's the matter of conduct of the hearing?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
What's anything at all?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Did you start the hearing that you didn't know?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I've testified over and over again that I wanted this type of hearing.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Stop. The hammering over the head and I've medically seated.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Is this hearing and I now go it again?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I can't get any answer.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Mr. Chairman, is that not fully responsive, Mr. Secretary?

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
You could tell him whether or not at the time of the hearing immediately there after.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
You made any objection to the manner in which Senator McRotty conducted the hearing.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Anything that was better done, now that is a simple question.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
I've already called on the hearings on the 13th and 14th of October,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
which was very early on the Fourth Monument's investigation,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
and I made notes, comments to the press,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
and I made no objections at the time.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Not at that time.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Not at that time and it wasn't there after it was a respect of the fabric.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
You had a range of the question.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Mr. Stone, if the statement of fact that the Secretary of the First time,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
the objections to the five hearing has been raised, has been right here in this room.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
No, sir.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
It is not when do you say the first time you raised an objection.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
I'd like to know that at our meeting, for example, on the spectrum of November,

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
I said that I wanted this hammering of the Army over the head stop.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
That was one very clear talk.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
I was asking you about an objection to a type of hearing

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
with the out-charging secretary, if I can make this clear,

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
that you decide to get it to stop the investigation to stop holding here.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
You first stated on page 442 in the right hand,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
no, you didn't want to stop it. You merely wanted to suspend it.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Later on, your testimony became, no, you didn't want to suspend it,

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
but you wanted to change the size of hearing.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I was now right to know the first occasion on which you made any complaint

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
about the type of hearing, and I'd like you to tell us what specifically the complaint was

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
and what subject you made as to the type of hearing which would be satisfactory to you.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
I'd say I'd probably have at the length and November expected the lunch.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Was that the first time, sir?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I'll have to reflect on my memory to see what there was,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and I thought I'd know about that.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Is it a kind of desire?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Mr. Jenkins?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Hi, it's Mr. Chairman.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Carol Fett.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Is that my right?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Is that my left?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Hello?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Mr. Coney, may I continue?

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
By the way, Mr. Stevens, isn't it a fact that one of the reasons that it's now 420

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
is the fact that the rest is ensued after this kind of suspicion?

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
By the way, Mr. Stevens, isn't it a fact that the principal reason you named Mr. Adams

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
is liaison to this committee?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Would the have him try to get the hearing stop, whether or not?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Well, can you explain to us then why you did name Mr. Adams

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
liaison and view of the fact the committee already had and still has general fan

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
personally, confidently, I found?

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Mr. Chairman, I remember specifically asking the secretary that very question myself,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
that question has been answered.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
When possible for the chair to recall all of the questions is an asking answer,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
but he does recall that one, so, come to grant me, if there is a requisition,

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
and the left hold the point of order.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Chairman, I don't like to go out in the wind, but I would suggest that the general fan

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
say that nothing mentioned here, and that this question has nothing.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
The question was, why is he afraid of Mr. Adams as a reason?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I raised because he did.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And the secretary denied it for this purpose.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
I am now trying to get out of on that to know if I shown that there was already a liaison

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
to the committee and that there was no need for any additional liaison.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm asking the secretary whether it's not a fact that general fan was the regular liaison

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
to our committee and still is.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
He worked for our office of legislative liaison and a fact contact with the committee.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
That's true, but I wanted to remember on my own personal staff to handle a relationship

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
with this committee, which I have started to handle myself personally,

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
on the 8th of September, and so Mr. Adams came in to take care on the first of our shoulders.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I gave him that as one of many other assignments.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
The stage Mr. Cole.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Mr. Secretary, you testified here at Sunlink,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
at Sunlink about the meeting of November 6th.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
And that is one of the allegations in your own specification.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
You were crazy, you're not the you are the one who invited us to your office on November 6th.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
That's right.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Mr. Chairman, I think we owe this floor a minute for that.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
The stage should not have a representation.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I'm trying to identify Mike. I'm sure I can do it as well.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
So Max, the James Pleasant, who's Mr. James, is close to the secretary in repetition form,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
on Friday morning concerning a pattern here.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
And I would like to show the various of these charges made here,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
which the secretary says involved,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
left by us to him,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
was actually meeting one after the other,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
full bindness of seating, and not fire.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
By the way, just trying to identify if he called the meeting,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
because the new element, so you had to ask the question,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
if there is simply, is not able, I'm sure, because he called,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
I've said in the many hundreds of thousands of words,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
the person, but where he is sure,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
you will have to rule with repetition questions,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
you will have to, you may proceed.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, I cannot do this line of interrogation.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm not sure if there's a exact question that we've asked,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
comes with any thought he could have asked before,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
if he's positive that he has, then the chair will do it.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Mr. Chairman, if it's a statement,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
allegation number 13 by you against us,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
is a meeting of November 17th?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Is it not a fact that that meeting was at your request,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
and that you had suggestion, and not at all?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I've heard the fire, but it went on that,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
and the reason for that meeting was because of Senator McCartney's

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
just pleasure over my first statement of November 13th.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Who asked for the meeting for you, Senator McCartney?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
You asked for the first meeting.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Who, it was on the, which was on, as I recall, on 16th.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Mr. Steve, you asked for it, and out of that,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
you were the meeting with, with Senator McCartney.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Mr. Steven, my question to you, is seraphine may is.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Who asked for the meeting of November 17th,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
which is allegation number 13 in your complaint?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Did you ask, I said that I would go to New York

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
and see Senator McCartney, before you indicated that he thought

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
I had told the right out from under him on my statement of November 13th.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I testified on his repeatability.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Did you ask for that meeting, sir?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I said that I would suggest that I go to New York, and I did.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Did I ask you to come to New York to see Senator McCartney?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Or did you ask me to go to Senator McCartney,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
and see if he would not see you?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I don't recall anything like that.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Well, Mr. Steven, shouldn't you try to recall that?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
That's not something important.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
We go out already.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I've already testified.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
That's when you came.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
You saw it, Leah.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
After my first conference of November 13th,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
and what?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Are you saying to my office?

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
And you said that, sir, Senator McCartney felt that I'd told

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
the right out from under him.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
I said that was not my intention, and that Senator McCartney

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
was assured about it, I would go and see him and talk to him about it.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
When did I see you out there?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I thought about it on its great length.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Yes, sir.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I'd say not to let that affect you because we don't believe the facts have been shown yet.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
Would you now tell me, sir, when I thought you out following your press conference

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
of November 13th?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I would like to know, was it by telephone?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Was it in person?

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
You were kind of my office on the 16th.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Now, my question, you held the press conference on the 13th.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Is that right?

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
One between the 13th and the 16th, and I see you out there.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
On the telephone, one of the days in between there.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Wait, either directly or to me or to John Adams.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I don't recall with it at the moment.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Well?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Can you recall whether or not I communicated with you in any way?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I could check that up, and find out.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Couldn't you check out Mr. Secretary, and then come back and see whether the fact is not

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
that Mr. Adams called me at your request.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
On Sunday, November 15th, and asked me to be in your office the next morning at 1030A.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Well, why don't you ask us Mr. Adams?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
If he calls for, I would ask you for, you said I'd call you out.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
And I suggest the contrary is true.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I think I entitled to have that clarify.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I did the great with that.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Then could you answer my question, sir?

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Is it not a fact that at your request, I believe Mr. Adams said you would return from the country.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You turned from out of town.

19:26.000 --> 19:33.000
He called me on Sunday, November 15th, and asked me as a personal favor to you to be in your office at 1030A.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
The next morning.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I had the telephone slip of that call, too, I must say.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
Yes, I think that Mr. Adams called you following a call of yours if I have a member correctly, the day before.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
Did Mr. Adams call me and say you were doing so at your request and that you desire me to be in your office?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
You have heard of Mr. Adams, I don't know.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
All right, sir.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Thank you.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
That's the best decision to do on that.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
In any event we are clearly in agreement, that on November 16th, it was you who asked for the meeting with Senator McCawsey the next day.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I said that I wanted to please Senator McCawsey, if he thought that I'd told the right officer Monday.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I said, you said you wanted to see.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
That's right.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Now, allegations 27.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Mr. Secretary.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
I'm sorry, not allegations 27.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
It's allegations 25 concerning a request made by Senator McCawsey for an assignment to...

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
...private charge.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
We count a meeting between you and Senator McCawsey on January 14th, 1954.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
This is your charge.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
I will ask you who asked for that meeting on January 14th.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
You...

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I did.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
You asked for that meeting.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I did.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Now.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
The reason being that I was going to the far east.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And I wanted to see the senator before I left.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
When my dad's always a certain matter, when he said that, McCawsey went to the far west.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Mr. Secretary.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
We met over at the Cal Armed Actress.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
And Senator will know our more or less there.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
That's right.

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
And the purpose you said was to show me one.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
What's that?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
The purpose of the meeting was to show me one.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
My name's purpose to me.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Going over to the air, let's decide you that I was leaving shortly for the far east.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
With the law and for a two-year-old four-weekly good news.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
No, but I thought that you might call up the next Tuesday morning on a Tuesday for me.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I wouldn't be there.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
And I didn't.

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
To repress your recollection, as a matter of fact, didn't you ask me not to call any members of the loyalty panel until you came back?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I did not.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Did you discuss that?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
We did not.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Right.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Okay, so you came over, Bill, you are out to see me and tell me you're going to the far east.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
You could have done this by telephone or by message.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
With any other purpose for asking for the meeting this week?

21:47.000 --> 21:54.000
The principle purpose was to tell you that I was going away and just be gone for you four weeks.

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
And to talk all the matters of mutual interest between the Department of the Army and its committee.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
And what were those matters of mutual interest and respect?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Oh.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
I'd have to check up and figure out what was kind about particular time.

22:08.000 --> 22:19.000
The average person would assume that it was rather important from the Secretary of the Army as busy as you were, to sit by him out to come all the way over from the Pentagon, arrange a meeting with me.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
Now, it was important that you remember why you asked for that meeting.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Yes, I'd say it's a punch for you.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
You know, and besides knowing that you're reading that, you've done by a wire by a phone call.

22:31.000 --> 22:40.000
I also told you during the course of that meeting, apart from the... I think I told you that meeting, that private shine was going to go from...

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
... from...

22:43.000 --> 22:57.000
... to Camp Gordon, the meeting was basically tiny and that it was completed successfully and qualified that he might be sent to the Provost March of General School.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Did I tell you that time with the Secretary that I thought that...

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
You were wasting fortune with time and one private in the Army.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
You did not?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I didn't.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
No, sir.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
Didn't I indicate to you with the Secretary that we had much more important business to discuss than a private in the Army?

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
You bought up a New Yorker's time with the private time four or five times during the course of that.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
I...

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Who brought up the time's name?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
The New Army.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Who brought up the time's name?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I told you what the rest of his signing program would take.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
But then you came over to talk about time.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Did that really?

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
I came over primarily to talk to you about my trip to the party.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
I also told you what the program was for signs competing in space.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Well, no, no.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
You bought up four or five times for New York for an assignment.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Well, that's not the same.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Where is your going to the party?

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
You never, the only thing you were going to talk about, you would not have arranged a meeting to come over and tell me that I'm currently living for the party.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I very likely might have done that, George.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
Now, you and I have been great social friends, have we?

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
I thought it was good with them doing almost exclusively with the business of the Committee on the Military.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
That's right.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
And I thought that I didn't think that I also...

24:07.000 --> 24:15.000
They gone for three or four weeks for important matters, depending between New York's Committee and the party on the Army, with each other, at least, but you know I was going.

24:15.000 --> 24:23.000
Now, assigned to the important matter of private time, the other important matters you're leading in, I say, were there any other matters we discussed?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Those are ones I recall, times of one.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Yes.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
In other words, give him over to just those two matters.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
I came over, finally, I related to the stuff that touched the party.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
That was my principal.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
No, I said, you did not discuss it, except you only were doing it.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Oh, yes, I did.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
I had a touchable length, so I was aware I was going.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
I had a touchable discussion about my fifth of the party.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
No, I did.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
You're sure you did it, like that.

24:49.000 --> 24:55.000
You did not come over, so I could try to threaten you or pressure you on private time.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
That is not the first.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
All I can say is, Canada, that you brought up four or five times, the question of a New Yorker's time, and two or five a chance.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Who brought up nine?

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
I finally reminded you of your letter of these numbers 20 seconds, and what you said that there wasn't a big any pressure or a flag of labor for Sean.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Who brought up nine?

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
I told you what it says, but the compilation of the New Yorker's program was these.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
But you brought that matter up, but I told you what it's a Chinese program, and then you started talking about the New Yorker's time.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
I was already at a variety, but you're not going to go 10 to 10 to my money.
