WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Yes, sir.

00:01.000 --> 00:07.000
And you called on Senator DeFart out of the office.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
I think that was on the night.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
I think that was on the night.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Yes, sir.

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
Now then, if you'd not for me particularly asked you what you may have discussed with Mr.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
McCuff, except the direct testimony shows that you went into the air and the instance of

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
the death of the Attorney General, Mr. Ratton, and Mr. Ratton, that is good.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
There are 26 members of the law enforcement that are in the same state.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
There are, or there were, or that the extension is under the number of the law enforcement.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
That is coming.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
There's a recall of our 19 year old, the division's seven of the Mara County Office.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
And that's probably so.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I have a little here.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
I dropped for, uh, eight December, 1953.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
In any case, there are 26 members of the law enforcement.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
So that's 19 or a particular set of the law enforcement.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Are these the videos of the law enforcement, the law enforcement, the whole law enforcement

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
fire administration?

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, I think that I think most of the Mara County's over there has been in the civil service

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
sometimes.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
So it's a fair assumption that they have an in government for quite some time.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Yes, I don't have any back means to sign, but I think all of them.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Now, Mr. Ratton, the law enforcement operation on the channel basis, they get a few of the time

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
to sit on a given number of cases.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
That's the right question.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
And in the testimony on the 19th of January, when you were created before the committee,

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
it was in November that certain members of the law enforcement were going to be summoned.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
That's your answer.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Among them, although he's not on the board, General Michael, there's a list of these companies

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
that are if you recall.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I think the name of Michael, there's a work offered to me.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm not sure.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I have a name that they wanted to have a full and successful number of the ones who are here

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
at the next few days in the kitchen.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
And it was indicated by the chairman of the General Haudier of the Jordan B. Schultz.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
The indication came from the kind of artist's court.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
The record also shows that Mr. Malcolm's two rooms with the Gordon B. Schultz

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
and Dr. Wright's was where I would recall, according to the executive hearing on January 19,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
the same day that you called on Thomas M. Buck.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yes, sir.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
So you have the session with...

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
The look with the committee in the afternoon.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
And at six o'clock on that day, you went to discuss something with Thomas McCullough

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
after he incident to the death of the attorney general.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yes, sir.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
On the 22nd of January, you came to my office.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes, sir.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
About what time of the day it was.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
It was about 5'45 in the afternoon.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And you came with some other persons.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Mr. Gerald Morgan, Mr. Gerald Morgan, any directs.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Now the person who's the problem in this testify us to the discussion that's placed about R.M.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
will be somebody who was there at the time, with that he's correct, one of the persons.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
And you would agree that it is the responsibility of a member of this committee

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
if he has some special knowledge that would have a bearing upon the issue.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
That he ought to testify to that section.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I agree, yes, sir.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Now in a high thing, Mr. Adams, we offer action to the stand-by star.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Mr. William, Mr. Committee.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I was there at the chairman who has got the council.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
That he asked me one half of the money off from the 22nd of January.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
And we now interrupt you, and I would like to tell you.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Here, Justin, you haveings and directs.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
We're out of this time to share his numbers.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And he's going to be.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Well, before I go to the ceremony, I'm going on my return to our studio.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
I'm going to return to our studio to help the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
This is ABC Television Network.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
An important message from Senator Smatters about the Miami Star 8.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
This picture shows what a few courageous citizens, honest politicians,

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
and just alert police agencies can do to rid their cities of gang-rans in Florence.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
See the Miami Star 8? Now the panel's there at times with us.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Modern hospitality calls for light refreshments.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
All of us, you got a cotton occasion with your guest.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
We're fresh without feeling.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
As a member of the director, Senator, I would ask you,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
under it, when the question starts to be made,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
is ever as a leader.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
We have all heard your examination of the stratum

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
with respect to a conference in your office about 5.45 at the end of January 22nd,

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
in 1954, at which time, you, Mr. Adams and Mr. Markin were present.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Is that correct, Senator?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Was anyone else present on that occasion?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
No, sir.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
I will ask you now, Senator Dirkson, to tell the committee

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
what plans are on that occasion and the conversation in full.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Mr. Chairman, by way of preliminary investigation

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
for the benefit of the record and for those who may be watching this procedure.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
That there arrived at my office about 25 and with letters and telegrams today.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Some of them are so engemored and so abusive and so unrestrained

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
that my office force is afraid they might affect my finer sensibilities

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
and they don't even show them to me.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
It would occur from an examination of this uploading of mail

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
that I have been charged with the belligerently partial on one side or on the other.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, I have seen that my duty to tell what I know about this matter

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
and what I have to say relates entirely to this question

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
of the issuance of the cleaners for members of the loyal devoid.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
My generally familiar with the operation of the board is complexive

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
and I know from my examination of the transcripts of the executive testimony on January 19th

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
what transpired and who was to be summoned and generally watched.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
But Mr. Chairman, I was not honored by any visit with respect to the shine matters

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
until the afternoon of January 19th, 1950.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Frankly, I knew nothing about the incubation of this controversy

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
or that it had become a prescient or that there was such a controversy as a matter of fact.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
And so in the afternoon there came to my office Mr. Adam and Mr. Geryl Morgan.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
I have known Mr. Geryl Morgan for a long time.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
He was a member of the legislative council staff in the House of Representatives

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
when I served there and I have seen him as Mr. Chairman as a friend.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
I think he is a fine citizen and a brilliant lawyer and a very few legislative threats.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
And so I want nothing to reflect upon Mr. Morgan.

07:28.000 --> 07:37.000
If he is a friend then I can only assume that he was contacted for the purpose of bringing Mr. Adam to my office.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
I know the reason why Mr. Adam shouldn't have come on his own.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I have been a member of this company for a long time.

07:46.000 --> 07:54.000
My door is always open and it does require the intervention of anybody to influence my conduct

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
or my behavior or my guts.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't say it was done for that purpose.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
But that was the first time that I had ever been honored by a visit from Mr. Adam.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
Now, for spending the time that he appears that his controversy was in a development stage

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
for a period of nearly two and a half months.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
The question came up with Mr. Chairman about the suffice.

08:20.000 --> 08:28.000
Which were the issues for certain members of the lawyers as I recall from the testimony

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
before the executive session of the committee on the 19th of January,

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
only of the five members of the lawyer to go out and whether it be summoned at that time and in addition.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
General Reichelgurth there was to be summoned with respect to an individual asked for it.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
It serves no purpose for me to come in upon those admins.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
But frankly as I reconstruct the conversation in my office on that afternoon,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Mr. Adam came to my office for the purpose of enlisting my hearing.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
Of enlisting my influence to kill those subpoenas and the sculptors.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I can place no other instructions.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I can place no other interpretation among that action.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
And in pursuance of that, wanting to do what I thought was the right thing,

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
being interested in the Army and in the maintenance of this morale,

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
I promptly called my call of the committee and I could not get it.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Because it was evidently too late.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
I went to my office early the next morning because I was early agitated about it.

09:40.000 --> 09:48.000
And I should go back for a moment to say that in connection with the deficit of those subpoenas,

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
that is the first time Mr. Chairman that I heard about the cone shine contest.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I knew nothing about it after that time that I can recall.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
But that matter came up and it came in the form of a hearing.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
And it disturbed me so greatly that I went to my office early the next morning

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
to make sure that I would get a hold of Mr. Car.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
Before any action might have been taken upon those defeats.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
I think Mr. Car may have monitored my conversation.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
And may I say for the record, Mr. Chairman, I never monitored telephone conversation.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
I speak entirely from memory. I have no dire.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I have no no to refresh my recollection.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
What I say to the committee, I say, a holy on the basis of what recurs to me

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
with respect to that conversation and what ensues there is.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
The next morning I got a hold of Mr. Car.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I expressed to him my dismissive spirit.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
And I said, simply Mr. Car, I trust that if the subpoenas have not been issued,

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
that you'll hold them because it's my understanding that the chairman is out of town.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
The chairman was in fact out of town and if I recall correctly and he can correct directly

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
if this is not right.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
I believe the night before he had been in the chisaro Illinois to make speech.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
But at 11 o'clock that morning he called me and over the telephone to hear my express my rage is just as bitter.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
I said, Mr. Car, I trust that no one for it will be assisted at action will be taken

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
with respect to these subpoenas until we can have a discussion.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
And it was arranged then and there over the telephone that we immediately thought it was at 2 o'clock that afternoon.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
I still saw a memory Mr. Chavez but he runs the Marinerne.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
It's a session in Senator McCarthy's office that afternoon.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
There was President Senator Parfax.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I was president.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
I'm not sure that Mr. Chavez and I think you were president and Senator McCarthy was president.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
I opened the conversation and I said, Mr. Chavez, I am greatly distressed over what I learned

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
yesterday afternoon in my office.

12:07.000 --> 12:16.000
But here are some allegations that may have some effect upon the ultimate credibility and the effectiveness of this committee in the future.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
It is an important instrument of government in targeting out subversion and communism.

12:23.000 --> 12:34.000
And if it credibility is impeached or if it's destroyed, we must take traditional notice of this matter that came in my attention yesterday afternoon.

12:34.000 --> 12:44.000
And I said, Mr. Chavez, if Chuck was revealed to me in my office yesterday afternoon is correct, I think Roy Cole ought to be fired, self-wift.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
And I think every member of the committee will bear me out.

12:48.000 --> 12:56.000
I think I said on that occasion, is if this thing goes in that direction and it becomes something of a public scandal,

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
that maybe we also recommend to the Department of Defense and Mr. Adams be fired along with it.

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
That session continues for a past hour and a half and we went into a pretty thorough.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And so that's the jumping off thing.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
But I just leave it at the end.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
That Mr. Adams came for my office on the afternoon to evaluate twenty seconds.

13:19.000 --> 13:31.000
For the purpose of enlisting my interests and my influence is possible to at least extend the issuance of those subpoenas for members of the Royal Labor.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I am perhaps the killed.

13:34.000 --> 13:45.000
I was not sure about the legal premises that were involved at the time because I have went into that matter later as to whether or not they could be rightly something.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
But I should say that I was familiar with the fact that in the hearing on January 19th,

13:52.000 --> 14:03.000
Richard certainly did not limit himself to questions concerning the actions of the Royal Labor already and reversing the decisions of lower-loyal labor,

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
or reinstating people who had been found guilty of this law, the by-law of the Lord,

14:10.000 --> 14:20.000
because I think the transcript will indicate that there were some questions of rest and some questions of corruption that he intended to raise.

14:20.000 --> 14:35.000
So it wasn't clear strictly whether the members were going to be summoned only for the purpose of investigating and exploring the actions that they may have taken in their review of the actions of lower-loyal labor.

14:35.000 --> 14:48.000
But I can only say on the basis of conversation that Mr. Adams came to my office to see what I might be able to do in order to defer detention from the subpoenas

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
and probably stop their issue. Periods, that's all I've done to say.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Council, any questions?

14:56.000 --> 15:09.000
Chairman, that very full restraint and a pan-be-complete statement of Senator Dirtian requires no cross-examination as far as I am concerned.

15:09.000 --> 15:20.000
Chair has only one question you would like to inquire of Senator Dirtian on the occasion of the visit to your office by Mr. Adams and Mr. Morgan.

15:20.000 --> 15:29.000
Primarily from the standpoint of trying to, as you say, avert the calling of members of the Royal Labor before our committee.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
How did a discussion of China and coal get into that conversation?

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
Mr. Adams, Mr. Morgan, why would you run?

15:40.000 --> 15:49.000
Frankly, I don't know nothing about the coal-sharing counter-versa, until it was brought up at that time and as I recall, it was first alluded to by Mr. Adams.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
It might have been by Mr. Morgan, but I think it was Mr. Adams.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Senator McArge, no question.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
As the June, the Senator has done for himself, there was a sort of, then there's no question.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
No question. Senator White, action.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Senator Simonton.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Mr. Wells, no question.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Senator McCarty.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Senator, you're a very serious person.

16:17.000 --> 16:27.000
Mr. Adams, kind of something, and to you, it was quite as you'd been involved with the car and told him that Mr. Adams had either kind of indicated.

16:27.000 --> 16:36.000
But if the proponents were not killed, that same issue of reports brought Mr. Cohn to be embarrassing, so it's not the same.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
May I say that my recollection is slightly vague on that point?

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
Am I not sure that it was said that a report was going to be circulated, yet my demeanor.

16:47.000 --> 17:04.000
But I know what my own agitation of spirit was at the time when I first heard it, and I thought if such a report were going to be issued and ventilated on the front pages, that it would seriously reflect upon the credibility of this committee and its usefulness in the future.

17:05.000 --> 17:19.000
And had it not been for that, Mr. Chairman, I certainly would have made no end to every contact with the car that night, and I wouldn't have gone to my office three quarters of an hour earlier than this morning, in fact, I think I got there at eight o'clock.

17:19.000 --> 17:28.000
And my first business with the contact with the car, to make sure that I ascertain what the status of the prospective superior is worth.

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
I have this may be a particular sound, but let me ask you this, that we have this absolutely clear in the record.

17:35.000 --> 17:52.000
You had the doing from what was said that, gives these subpoenas for a kill, that no report about Mr. Cohn would be made public, if they were not killed, then there would be reports alleging Mr. Cohn that Mr. Cohn was part of the public.

17:52.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm not sure that I came to any conclusion on that point at the time, but I will say this, because this was the first time that a question of stopping the subpoenas was coupled with the coal shine story as it came to me and it was the first item.

18:08.000 --> 18:20.000
You said that there was a hint, which to serve, I assume that hint was that if the subpoenas were issued, these charges would be made public.

18:20.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, it was a case of whether or not it would finally come out into the open and reflect upon the whole committee.

18:29.000 --> 18:41.000
And obviously, Mr. Chairman, I think it's on the at it. It has been stated here that on many occasions the subcommittee met when only the chairman was present, and I think that's correct.

18:41.000 --> 18:49.000
And that assumes from the fact that I, along with other members of this committee, are members of other committees.

18:49.000 --> 18:57.000
I know that Senator McCollum and Senator Munn were probably busy life nights, marching up an appropriation bill at a rather late hour.

18:57.000 --> 19:12.000
And that was my first choice this morning, and consequently because of our other senatorial responsibility, we cannot always be on hand, and so many of these meetings take place when only the chairman and the staff of this.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
So, one further question, Senator.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
As you stated, we met in my office the following day.

19:20.000 --> 19:27.000
I believe the only people present for you, Senator Potter, Senator Munn, to myself, no members.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't think that's correct.

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
No members of the staff, as I recall, I believe Mr. Carm, might have been there part of the thing, since the prior was there part of the time.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
Now, that time did I relate to the subcommittee.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
The tremendous pressure brought upon me to call off the hearings, the threats that they would issue a tragedy against Mr. Cohn, if it didn't.

19:49.000 --> 19:57.000
Did I tell the other three members, and the strongest language, like it's possibly used, I believe.

19:57.000 --> 20:16.000
If I was personally concerned, I would not be blackmailed out of any investigation by any threat that regard us a fall, embarrassing any charges might be that left them make some that I intended to proceed, unless I was also told by the members of my committee.

20:16.000 --> 20:24.000
In other words, did I give the committee the complete story of the pressure that you use upon me to call off the hearings last time?

20:24.000 --> 20:31.000
I think that's right, and while I cannot reconstruct the language, I know we discussed the whole capina issue with great length.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Now, Mr. Carm, may I make this suggestion?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
This proceeding has got to be fair.

20:36.000 --> 20:49.000
It was insistent that it be unopened hearing that everything be revealed, and I'm ready that I think Mr. Adams ought to have an opportunity to cross the Carm and me if he desires, with respect to the conversation.

20:49.000 --> 21:04.000
That's a great thing that all Mr. Welch was not there. Mr. Adams was there. He made his degree, and in the interest of complete fairness, I'm perfectly willing if you want to look forward to that rise, Mr. Adams, may cross the count.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
He's just saying that right now, and far from setting the country, if you can hold it your questions.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Just a one moment.

21:10.000 --> 21:22.000
Just a one question regarding the conversation with Mr. Carm.

21:23.000 --> 21:31.000
We recall, as some are let, might not be difficult recall, things occurred months ago.

21:31.000 --> 21:39.000
We recall that the additional Mr. Carm, the guest number one that he,

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
tell us the reason I have a mission and I am here, I'm going to meet Mr. Smith and it's really in favour of it.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
Which I think is the reason we're across when you were in a certain situation. He'd hold them up until you and I and the other members of the committee could get together.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
Number one of number two.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
You were told or led to believe by Mr. Adams. That if he did not kill the people.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
That then there would be issues they report charging with Mr. Coln of Smith's conduct.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Is that roughly what you told Mr. Carichou or Paul?

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
With respect to number one may I say that I specifically asked Mr. Carichou if the subpoenas had not already been issued.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Not to issue them until the chairman returned to Washington.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
The subpoenas had not actually been issued at that time and they were not.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
And I just must follow through on that point.

22:30.000 --> 22:39.000
That asked the discussion that following afternoon in your office that I took no further action and they had no further suggestions

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
with respect to the matter of the team.

22:42.000 --> 22:56.000
With respect to the second part of your question I can only say that if there was no such hint that the story might go out with Mr. Carichou.

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
That at least I developed in my mind the belief and the feeling that the story might go out.

23:02.000 --> 23:10.000
And that was based entirely on the conversation that had in my office the previous afternoon with Mr. Adams and with Mr. Marshall.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
With the message of the record so does no.

23:12.000 --> 23:23.000
Mr. Construction and my question I feel that everything Mr. Dr. Dirkton did here was completely normal to call me.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
I call Mr. Carichou holding up of the subpoenas for a few days time.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
The discussion of them just for the record I think for the public and the normal procedure.

23:34.000 --> 23:42.000
Many times during the court investigation the record sounders call and say let's discuss this matter further before we bring in the subpoenas.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
I don't make it clear that there was absolutely nothing in my mind even remotely in power about what's under direction.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
We've been working with questions.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
We have questions and I think I heard from my council.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Mr. Welk, have you heard?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I have a few very important questions.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
And the direction it is of course is somewhat delicate matter for one in my modest will it isn't Mr. Welk?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
You don't have to be restrained at all.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Thank you.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
And for that there will be no asking questions that I ask you sir.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And if there were I was more.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
My first question is a very simple one. I don't happen to know.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Are you allowed here sir?

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
Then I am sure that when the question of these subpoenas to the law of the board was presented to you,

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
you realize that that had in its constitutional implications that do not.

24:31.000 --> 24:38.000
I'm not sure that I did because I have seen some of them under which were in human conclusions with respect to that question.

24:38.000 --> 24:52.000
But there was in my mind a different time that they were going to be called for some other purposes besides the question of action that has been taken by members of the law of the panel.

24:52.000 --> 25:01.000
You and I as lawyers both know that if they were to be called and questioned as to whether or not they had taken bribes to make a certain decision,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
that land of questioning should be allowed to you not agree.

25:05.000 --> 25:14.000
And on the contrary, I say were to be called and examined as to the reasons which caused them to reach a decision on the matter of the case.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
That land of inquiry under our constitution would have been in offer.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I'm not so sure about that as to it well.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
Mr. Gertz, in any of any of any scenario where it's which presents great question by that I have been treated.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
In respect to which not everyone is in the grief, that's correct.

25:31.000 --> 25:40.000
And it follows from the fact that you were not only a senator to the lawyer and with some knowledge of constitutional law, properly quite a sitting mind.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
But you knew that question alone was a grave and agitating question.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I do indeed, Mr. Gertz.

25:48.000 --> 25:57.000
Well, that question did not agitate me quite so much as the fact that it was coupled with a matter that had not been directed to my attention before.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
That's right.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
That's the controversy which is the answer to this here.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Now, that's the one to which I now wish to turn my attention.

26:03.000 --> 26:14.000
The second thing that you heard in that hearing, in that interview was a summary title to the effect that Mr. Cohn had placed,

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
written remarkably, undue pressure on Mr. Adam.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
What was that again?

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
You don't strike it out. I don't like my question too well.

26:24.000 --> 26:36.000
In that interview, you also heard something to the effect of Mr. Adam that had been placed under cruel pressures by Mr. Cohn in respect to one David Chine.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
Yes, I think it was a very considerable discussion about that.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
And that was also a matter of agitation to you.

26:43.000 --> 26:55.000
Oh, indeed, you knew, sir, that if that was true, it was so improper that Mr. Cohn's employment by the committee should not continue until sundown, didn't you?

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Oh, I was so.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
You answered well with your restate, Mr. Cohn.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
If you read so easily, what are you going to do?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I thought the short question you repeated.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
All right. You knew what was said about Cohn was true.

27:10.000 --> 27:17.000
His continuation as an employee of this committee should not continue until sundown, didn't you?

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
Well, I indicated in the meeting that we had in the chairman's office that it was true.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
And I have no way of knowing the truth or the philosophy of the minute.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
That I thought Roy Cohn had how clear he is usefulness with the committee.

27:33.000 --> 27:43.000
I may say for the public in the country right now that at the moment certainly I take that, what I said about that, and I shall be due with him my own mouth.

27:43.000 --> 27:51.000
Well, in that case, I'm only saying that, sir, that if this charges of the cruel pressure on Mr. Adden, we're true.

27:51.000 --> 27:59.000
You, sir, as the senator and as gentlemen, would have known Mr. Cohn's badger than the committee with that in him.

27:59.000 --> 28:06.000
Well, Mr. Well, he had a crush to me that the cruel pressure is weren't discussed yet.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
I recall the conversation we had that afternoon.

28:09.000 --> 28:24.000
The thing that stuck in my mind mainly was not pressure, but rather the fact that here was an effort to secure the first Arnold L. E. Schepert to secure the third treatment for a fight.

28:24.000 --> 28:32.000
Which certainly would look good on the front page and might have made every member of this committee if it could be established.

28:32.000 --> 28:45.000
And that we might be, we might find ourselves charged with lectures and with neglect of duty that it hadn't come to our attention and that something hadn't been out about it before.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
But that was the first time coupled with the subpoena matter that it was ever directed to my attention.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
Now, that I fully understand, sir, and may I now ask you, Senator, how long you have lived in Washington?

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
I've been here nearly 20 years in the house and Senator, maybe longer.

29:03.000 --> 29:14.000
And did it not occur to you, sir, that if there was a word of truth in what you were being told about the pressures that Cohn had put on Adam,

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
that that secret in this kind of a city would soon be out?

29:19.000 --> 29:31.000
Well, I have an idea that on the basis of experience that some of us would leak and particularly, if you want to full answer, when newspaper men are called in,

29:31.000 --> 29:41.000
and who were told about this a month before a member of the Senate ever discovers what the real allegation and the chronological charges are.

29:41.000 --> 29:55.000
Because it's apparent from the testimony that Mr. Elsa knew about this at least 30 days before the junior senator from Illinois was ever advised about it, except in his office on the 22nd of January.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
I'm not discussing that with you, sir. I am only asking you if it is not your experience based on 20 years in Washington.

30:02.000 --> 30:16.000
The NFA man reaches the point where he comes to the office of the senator and recites the kind of pressures Mr. Adam recites it, that you know those that kind of thing is not going to remain a secret.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
Well, I have to move question. I can't answer any further from this matter.

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
Not very much of the senator. You knew perfectly well this thing could not be kept bottled up any longer.

30:26.000 --> 30:35.000
If it has got over your threshold and to gentlemen of standing we're telling us to you, but Mr. Elsa in all fairness to all of us.

30:35.000 --> 30:46.000
And since certainly my conduct has been impugned on occasion, it has been a land that I've been spending over backwards the shield of the army,

30:46.000 --> 30:55.000
and if you have any doubt about it, all you have to do is read through Pearson's column yesterday morning.

30:55.000 --> 31:09.000
I am determined that the stories all ends of the record because the subpoena question and the matter of enlisting my services in order to stop them was coupled with a cone shine controversy.

31:09.000 --> 31:17.000
And a subpoena is an indispensable weapon in the matter of investigation by a committee of dissent.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
Thank you, Mr. Senator. Let us not be disturbed in the attacks and the praise you've had.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
I have been given some wrongs throughout the two hours.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
Even as mild mannered as ever was well kept in this from both sides I assure you.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And we can none of us escape.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
But it was I want to ask this one time.

31:36.000 --> 31:50.000
And this for the record the senator from Illinois has the confidential transcript that was issued yesterday morning with indicate that junior senator from Illinois did his best to stop and open here.

31:50.000 --> 32:03.000
He didn't say that perhaps everything to be served by recommending to the army that they dispensed with the services of Mr. Adams and that the committees dispensed with the services of Mr. Cohn without prejudice.

32:03.000 --> 32:19.000
I wanted to stop the reason for the motion that I brought in here this week was to ring down the curtain because I'm just as much interested to prevent the demoralization of the armed services and the development of dissidents and the businesses here.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
Thank you.
