WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.100
Well, as I have previously stated there, the situation does not become oppressive to the

00:09.100 --> 00:15.320
end until subsequent November 10, which was the occasion that China arrived before 6.

00:15.320 --> 00:23.440
And one month after that, on December 9, I this 67th on the cracky about it, and then another

00:23.440 --> 00:30.440
14-80s later on January 20, as the result of the culminated on the World of Borders matters.

00:30.440 --> 00:36.360
My feeling was related to the colon's feeling of China.

00:36.360 --> 00:41.600
I talked to members of the subcommittee, those who were then armed at the beginning.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.840
I think at that time, the Democratic members were not participating.

00:45.840 --> 00:50.040
The members individually, rather than some official meetings.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.160
That is correct, so I talked to members.

00:53.160 --> 01:00.840
I had already talked a month earlier to Senator McCarthy, and a representative of mine talked to the other members.

01:00.840 --> 01:07.720
Notwithstanding the hearings being conducted by either the subcommittee or the activities of the Department of the Army,

01:07.720 --> 01:17.720
concerning the purchase of security risks at Fort Monlo, I did not occur to you that it might be a sensation

01:17.720 --> 01:26.120
in trying to maintain your own reasons to have a thorough understanding of the subcommittee concerning the status of David China,

01:26.120 --> 01:32.120
to what extent the subcommittee was interested in his welfare and the Army.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.120
Well, I can't say that that occurred to me.

01:35.120 --> 01:41.120
No, sir, I felt that the method we were using was the best method to use.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.120
It may not have been.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.920
You know, it's where he thought it might not be advisable to go over the head of Roy Cohn.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.720
I think he testified that you did that on one occasion.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.720
Well, I did that.

01:52.720 --> 01:58.520
I did go to Senator McCarthy, and then later I did go to members of the...

01:58.520 --> 02:04.520
Some of the Republican members of the subcommittee and subsequent to my visit with them, it's my understanding

02:04.520 --> 02:09.320
that those members met together to discuss this very problem on about the 27th of June.

02:09.320 --> 02:17.920
Do you think you might have avoided some of this unfriendliness and this friction if you have been furthered with members of the subcommittee concerning the subcommittee?

02:17.920 --> 02:20.720
Well, sir, it seems to me that the I did confer with you.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.720
Thank you.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.920
You exhausted all reasonable needs.

02:24.920 --> 02:29.120
So I have to pay the views of the members of the subcommittee concerning David China.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.920
I brought the matter to the attention of the chair.

02:32.920 --> 02:39.520
One month after he came, he pressed his knee and then another five weeks later, five or six weeks later,

02:39.520 --> 02:44.520
I brought the matter or the matter was brought to the attention of the other members of the committee

02:44.520 --> 02:47.520
who were participating on the committee at the moment.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.520
So you do think it's you who discharged your duties and the patients matters.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.120
I think it's hard not to invite you.

02:54.120 --> 03:00.320
You do think it's hard not to judge your duties as it is on a representative of the secretary of the Army

03:00.320 --> 03:04.920
in trying to maintain for the relations with the subcommittee.

03:04.920 --> 03:09.920
Well, matters of this or this, which deteriorates as this matter did.

03:09.920 --> 03:14.920
I always thought this second yesterday and looking back now,

03:14.920 --> 03:19.720
he can speculate as to whether other methods might have been better.

03:19.720 --> 03:28.920
That seemed to the people with whom I was associated and with whom I consulted today's assessment by which to attempt to bring this matter to the attention of the committee.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.320
It may not have been done specifically or not.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.720
Well, it was saying to me what I have observed during the past two weeks,

03:36.720 --> 03:43.520
that you were not quite as effective as you should have been in trying to protect the members of the subcommittee.

03:43.520 --> 03:48.120
If you consider this highly desirable, if you have this friendly relationship,

03:48.120 --> 03:51.720
certainly you should have submitted this entire matter,

03:51.720 --> 03:54.920
and it seems to me to be full subcommittee,

03:54.920 --> 03:59.920
so that if there were any misunderstanding, you might have eliminated it.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.920
Well, Senator, I might state that during the fall,

04:02.920 --> 04:04.520
Congress was not in session.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.920
The members were not in town.

04:07.920 --> 04:13.520
The matter during the last eight or nine weeks of the calendar years

04:13.520 --> 04:18.120
was a matter of which probably couldn't have been brought to the attention of the subcommittee.

04:18.120 --> 04:23.720
I believe that, as Congress recently, the matter was brought to the attention of both members of the subcommittee.

04:23.720 --> 04:29.920
Now, Mr. Adams, that was very disturbed by the apparent indecisive actions,

04:29.920 --> 04:33.920
by the department of the Army of the Secretary.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.320
The students in trying to follow through on the inspectors for its court,

04:37.320 --> 04:41.920
the conditions of the court model probably have been questioned so they've been asked to Secretary Stevens.

04:41.920 --> 04:47.520
I do prepare to tell us why there has been no decisive action in following through

04:47.520 --> 04:58.720
the report, Mama, to expose the proper action concerning the persons and security risks which may be found there.

04:58.720 --> 05:03.120
I haven't had the question again, sir, because I talked to you about the court's decision.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.320
I was thinking in terms of the court decision, I suddenly realized that I was going to have a bad day.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.320
I'm out.

05:12.320 --> 05:18.920
Mr. Adams, I was very disturbed by the apparent indecisive action,

05:18.920 --> 05:22.120
by the department of the Army of the Secretary of State,

05:22.120 --> 05:26.920
and trying to follow through on the inspectors' report, the conditions of the court model.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.720
Probably, this question should have been asked to Secretary Stevens,

05:29.720 --> 05:38.120
but are you prepared to tell us why there has been no decisive action in following through the report, Mama, to expose

05:38.120 --> 05:43.720
and strike the proper action concerning the persons and security risks which may be found there.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.720
I don't even know if the person has done it.

05:47.720 --> 05:51.720
Do you mean action prior to the first action?

05:51.720 --> 05:53.720
No, actually at any time.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.720
It has been justified that the inspector made an investigation.

05:57.720 --> 06:04.920
The report has been available to the department of the Army and yet there has been no action, or has there been any action?

06:04.920 --> 06:12.520
Well, I'm a little confused there because the living internment has begun to be available to the Department of Inspectorate and Dept.

06:12.520 --> 06:20.520
If you were asking what action has the Army taken and was it taking during the latter half of last year,

06:20.520 --> 06:22.520
there was a report from Mama.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.520
I'll answer that question.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.520
Is that what you're trying to find out?

06:26.520 --> 06:34.120
Why would specifically refer to the investigation that has made this I understand?

06:34.120 --> 06:44.120
It's by the inspector representing the Department of the Army and the security risks that have been taken on that report.

06:44.120 --> 06:51.120
Well, sir, I don't mean to be that.

06:51.120 --> 06:57.520
I'm not trying to evade this question, but I don't know what you mean by evade and the inspector's report has course modestly.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.520
I can assure a woman is my associate.

07:05.920 --> 07:10.720
Mr. Adams does not confirm Mr. Hatton who is his associate in the Department of the Army.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.720
But sir, there was a...

07:12.720 --> 07:14.720
There was...

07:14.720 --> 07:18.720
I wonder if you're asking here and you're talking about the inspector general's report

07:19.120 --> 07:23.120
of the matter having to do with the major threat at Camp Kilmer.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.920
There is such an inspector's report.

07:25.920 --> 07:30.720
There was no inspector's report at Fort Mama, the left-street Mama.

07:30.720 --> 07:37.120
Do you have the Army followed up at Fort Mama after the activities of this committee?

07:37.120 --> 07:37.920
Yes, sir.

07:37.920 --> 07:46.720
The Army, as I think the Secretary of State has been required by the promulgation of the President Eisenhower's new

07:46.720 --> 07:54.720
Secretary of Order in April of 1953, to read down on all loyal and security cases

07:54.720 --> 08:00.720
which might have been favorably decided on the basis of the new criteria which the President's

08:00.720 --> 08:01.920
executive order promised.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.920
Will you have your statement or any effect from action yet?

08:03.920 --> 08:04.720
Yes, sir.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.920
Directly.

08:05.920 --> 08:13.920
Then this chairman asked me to share this question to the director's, the President's executive order.

08:14.320 --> 08:20.320
He made one principle different between what was to be done in the future.

08:20.320 --> 08:26.640
What has been done in the past and that's why there is a determination that

08:26.640 --> 08:33.120
doubtful cases were to be resolved in favor of the government rather than in favor of the individual.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.320
Where the cases were, where the matter was presented.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.760
And that's why there is a re-examination of many cases.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.720
Those re-examination have to be done not only at Fort Mama,

08:42.720 --> 08:45.920
but in our hundreds of other installations all over the world.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.920
And they were going forward.

08:47.920 --> 08:53.520
And I continue to go forward every day and every week.

08:53.520 --> 08:58.320
I think new cases are taken from the files and re-examination.

08:58.320 --> 09:03.520
They were not under the re-examination criteria further set to be taken.

09:03.920 --> 09:13.920
The salary of the primary charge against the army would seem to be blackmail.

09:13.920 --> 09:20.280
Activate in that the army stated what this charge is against the staff of St.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.280
Mama Carthie.

09:21.280 --> 09:25.920
St. Mama Carthie did not fall off its investigation of the army.

09:25.920 --> 09:32.720
Now according to the bill of particular, most of these threats were made to the various principles.

09:33.120 --> 09:37.120
That is, a threat by Adams and Cohn and Carthie.

09:37.120 --> 09:45.920
But there is one time when this threat to the subcommittee is alleged to have been made to this interested person.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.720
And that is charge number 36.

09:48.720 --> 09:52.720
But I would ask you to follow me with.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.720
This charge states, quote,

09:59.120 --> 10:05.120
the following days, Mr. Adams communicated with other members of the subcommittee.

10:05.120 --> 10:13.920
And stated that unless the chairman was prevailed upon, the drop is investigation.

10:13.920 --> 10:18.720
And not to issue subpoenas for those in the loyalty set-up.

10:18.720 --> 10:25.920
Mr. Adams would cause an embarrassing report to be circulated about Mr. Cohn.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.720
My question to you, sir, is that true?

10:28.720 --> 10:33.720
My answer to you, sir, is that as false, the people through whom I talk,

10:33.720 --> 10:35.920
sir, I gentlemen, for sit on that committee.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.920
I have no remembrance of making such a statement.

10:39.920 --> 10:44.720
My judges and that respect will have to be the gentlemen through whom I talk.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.320
Three of them, Mr. Cohn.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.320
Now, Mr. Chairman, this would seem to go to the very part of the matter.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.720
Therefore, I think the members of the subcommittee, who were contacted,

10:55.520 --> 11:02.320
either by Mr. Adams or his deputy, should say now, or at earliest opportunities,

11:02.320 --> 11:05.520
whether or not the Army present to issue this report,

11:05.520 --> 11:10.720
unless the members of the subcommittee could prevail on certain McCarthy

11:10.720 --> 11:14.720
to call off his investigation of the Army.

11:17.120 --> 11:23.120
As Adams I'd like to ask you, you mentioned that sometime before January 21st,

11:23.120 --> 11:26.720
you talked with the Deputy Attorney General about the question of the loyalty

11:26.720 --> 11:29.520
of the board members answering subvenes.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.520
To do it that time, discuss the case of Mr. Cohn.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.320
On that occasion, I did.

11:36.320 --> 11:41.520
You say you talked to the Deputy Attorney General of the suggestion of Mr. Hensel.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.720
Did you discuss Mr. Cohn at that time with Mr. Hensel?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.320
I do not, sir.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.320
You did not.

11:48.320 --> 11:52.320
You say you discussed this matter with Mr. Hensel a month prior to this,

11:52.320 --> 11:53.920
which would have been in December.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.720
I discuss the matter with the lawyer before it.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.920
Uh, proper.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.920
With Mr. Hensel.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.520
Did you discuss Mr. Cohn?

12:01.520 --> 12:03.520
No, sir.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.920
Did you discuss, correct?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.520
Right.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.520
One of the points of these questions is, if you feel the loyalty of the board's situation,

12:12.320 --> 12:15.920
would be better or worse from the standpoint of the Army,

12:15.920 --> 12:19.120
based on what you did with Mr. Cohn?

12:19.920 --> 12:32.720
Well, by that time, sir, on January 20th, I think the dialogue was cast,

12:32.720 --> 12:34.720
and we had already done.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.720
We did a question a little more directly.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.920
Why not?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.320
So, may I have a question after that, sir?

12:40.320 --> 12:45.520
Sir, one of the points of these questions is, if you feel the loyalty of the board's situation,

12:45.520 --> 12:48.320
would be better or worse from the standpoint of the Army,

12:48.320 --> 12:50.320
based on what you did with Mr. Cohn?

12:50.320 --> 12:53.120
I'm talking about the time you discussed this with Mr. Hensel.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.520
Well, huh.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.120
That is in December.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.920
Well, it would be either in December or it would be in January.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.320
The loyalty of the board matters.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.520
In December, it was not A.A.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.720
It was not an immediate issue in the Paradai knew.

13:18.720 --> 13:23.120
It was below the surface, and I don't think I had a feeling at that time

13:23.920 --> 13:30.320
that shine or shine's treatment would affect what happened with records of loyalty of the board matters.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.320
But I didn't have a feeling then.

13:32.320 --> 13:39.120
That everything had first to say, committee desires,

13:39.120 --> 13:45.120
and Mr. Cohn's request to check if the shine would raise out in difficulty for the Army.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.120
So, your testimony is that, both in December and January,

13:51.120 --> 13:55.520
you discussed the loyalty of the board's situation, that army problem.

13:55.520 --> 13:59.520
But, Mr. Hensel, but you did not discuss the question of Mr. Cohn.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.720
Is that correct?

14:00.720 --> 14:01.120
Yes.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.120
Why didn't you discuss it with Mr. Cohn?

14:03.920 --> 14:04.720
What?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.520
Why didn't you discuss Mr. Cohn with Mr. Hensel?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.520
Well, it was an army problem.

14:09.520 --> 14:18.320
I was talking only about the loyalty of the board matter and the fact that it was that it was something that was continuously before us.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.720
It was below the surface that we might have to make a decision on it someday.

14:22.720 --> 14:26.720
And I was trying to clarify to the defense department's position.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.320
I wanted to be sure that the White Resolution of the Army is supposed to be the same as the Navy and the Air Force.

14:32.320 --> 14:38.320
I wanted to be sure that it was the same as the officer of the Secretary of Defense who takes Mr. Hensel with the officials

14:38.320 --> 14:42.320
who would make the decision in the office of Secretary of Defense.

14:42.320 --> 14:46.320
And it was the sole matter that I was discussing. It was a legal matter.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.320
Why was I back to the lodge at the meeting?

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
I don't know.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.320
Do I need to worry about it for the first?

14:52.320 --> 14:54.320
I don't know, sir. I didn't arrange for the President.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.320
But, are there anything that you discussed that had to do with the United Nations?

14:58.320 --> 15:00.320
Anything that we discussed?

15:00.320 --> 15:02.320
Anything that we discussed?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.320
Yeah.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.320
With the United Nations?

15:10.320 --> 15:11.320
Yes.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.320
I don't think the United Nations was just no sir.

15:14.320 --> 15:18.320
What do you think he was there for? Mr. Chairman?

15:18.320 --> 15:20.320
You have point of order, sir.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.320
I have a point of order.

15:22.320 --> 15:27.320
This was a high level discussion of the executive department.

15:27.320 --> 15:38.320
And this was that had been instructed not to testify as to the interchange of views from the people at that high level at that meeting.

15:38.320 --> 15:44.320
That meeting, if we're going to get the information about low level discussion, but not about high level discussion,

15:44.320 --> 15:50.320
you can only have to share what I have been informed of the committee, which is some of the people that were at that meeting they can deal with.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.320
If I'm only passing from the committee.

15:52.320 --> 15:58.320
The council is there any particular reason that you object to Mr. Adams stating why Mr. Lodge is there?

15:58.320 --> 16:03.320
If he knows that what Mr. Lodge says, I do not object to his stating why Mr. Lodge is there?

16:03.320 --> 16:07.320
If he knows, I think his answers are already for the definition he doesn't know.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.320
Well, he's not going to ask him what Mr. Lodge says.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.320
That is the point of my objection.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.320
You don't like that.

16:13.320 --> 16:18.320
If you question this time, what I like is the question what the list of his views is,

16:18.320 --> 16:20.320
in respect to that meeting.

16:20.320 --> 16:25.320
Now, Mr. Counsel, as I remember the testimony, Mr. Adams volunteered to misalign from there.

16:25.320 --> 16:33.320
But that's for when addressing it for his position as concerned, and we got to write to know what Mr. Lodge said.

16:33.320 --> 16:42.320
I would think if once Mr. Adams volunteered to misalign from there, then we have a right to know why Mr. Adams was there and what he said when he was there.

16:42.320 --> 16:53.320
I can only say that the instructions from the executive department are to the effects that the witness should not answer this fine instructions and what to place with that interview.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.320
What do you mean by executive department who's instruction dollars?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.320
They came in.

17:13.320 --> 17:17.320
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Scott, you can have to come off my time.

17:17.320 --> 17:19.320
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Scott.

17:19.320 --> 17:27.320
Mr. Chairman, as you have mentioned, as you know I was ill yesterday.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.320
Not very ill, but ill enough to be in my room.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.320
I'm beginning to regret it, but you weren't today, then I did yesterday.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.320
I'm sorry, it's signing from that interview.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.320
I say I'm beginning to regret your illness even more today than I did yesterday, and that was plenty.

17:38.320 --> 17:50.320
The instructions came as I understand it yesterday through the departments of the families, or at least were delivered to the witness by somebody in the department of the family.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.320
Oh, I do not know, sir.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.320
I have one question.

17:54.320 --> 18:00.320
Anything more like that or the discussion from the deputy secretary of the family?

18:00.320 --> 18:01.320
Who is that?

18:01.320 --> 18:02.320
Mr. Roberts, the end.

18:02.320 --> 18:10.320
Do you find out, for the hearing to say it, the new department, Mr. Roberts, the end is in the second of the funding stuff, tell you what you could, do you not testify?

18:10.320 --> 18:12.320
Who lies this committee?

18:12.320 --> 18:17.320
It's my understanding, sir, that he was transmitting instruction from where?

18:17.320 --> 18:19.320
I don't know, sir, but I understand.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.320
The disavarcing view is not a bad thing, sir.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.320
Do you think it's embarrassing to anybody else?

18:24.320 --> 18:25.320
I don't know, sir.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.320
Do you find out where the end is?

18:27.320 --> 18:28.320
The instructions came from?

18:28.320 --> 18:30.320
It's a very serious issue, sir.

18:31.320 --> 18:37.320
Sir, my wife and his aunt will have to call you up for the border.

18:37.320 --> 18:43.320
I'm not sure that the rough reason why I brought her here is because I think you've wondered what it is to help.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.320
The information is a serious issue.

18:45.320 --> 18:56.320
The name of Ambassador-Line has gone into this controversy and this discussion by Mr. Adams, not by any of the members of its committee.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.320
That is correct, sir.

18:58.320 --> 19:03.320
That being correct, it seems to me that it's not a resigning unit, it's quite an important project for two resigns of question.

19:03.320 --> 19:07.320
So long as Mr. Adams doesn't have to bring in the NATO together a lot.

19:09.320 --> 19:14.320
And this, with the design of the NATO, is the share with you, otherwise, it seems to be a question.

19:14.320 --> 19:21.320
I'll approach this for long as Mr. Adams says, a lot, you know, it's a certain term on the line.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.320
I quite recognize that you were not here yet to be.

19:24.320 --> 19:32.320
And now, Mr. Adams has agreed to find out for you Senator Samington the answer to the question that you asked.

19:32.320 --> 19:41.320
You have find a way to express further point of order that I may find out first of all when we are satisfied now Mr. Wilson, that one of us.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.320
I don't have any particular question, sir.

19:45.320 --> 19:50.320
The question is that the share has decided that Senator Samington has the right to act.

19:50.320 --> 19:58.320
Mr. Adams, about Mr. Laws, or anybody else, that Mr. Adams has been into this country of routine voluntary.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.320
Well, I think that's correct.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.320
I know quite a bit Mr. Joe.

20:04.320 --> 20:13.320
Senator Samington may ask quite a few, I'm informing the share that the witness has been instructed not to be held further with that conference in respect to what he has said.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.320
I'm not sure if he's on the telephone, he'll definitely be.

20:16.320 --> 20:19.320
Well, the care for it can also go a little bit over the top.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.320
So, this is a very hard one.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.320
I might have had a great test if I could ask you.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.320
You have a point of what it's been to check.

20:24.320 --> 20:42.320
So, Joe, I make this further point of order that the witness weighs in the right to claim immunity from discussing what one of us has been offered when the matter was brought up by him yesterday.

20:42.320 --> 20:51.320
I have no objection with interpol on his side against relating to that conversation.

20:51.320 --> 20:56.320
I think that maybe this testimony may be embarrassing for the administration.

20:56.320 --> 21:03.320
I don't think that because it's embarrassing for the administration and favorable to Senator McCartney that it ought to be deleted.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.320
I think we should get all the facts out on the table.

21:06.320 --> 21:18.320
I think we should know because there may be some information that went on within the defense department and between the defense department and the White House that is now embarrassed.

21:18.320 --> 21:24.320
I think this issue has to be settled immediately if we're going to get all the facts out on the table.

21:24.320 --> 21:28.320
Now, the share of the argument has testified since the chairman here before.

21:28.320 --> 21:33.320
The conversation will be until the sudden effect of the statement pointed toward the first before the argument.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.320
Here's what I'm making the point of order.

21:35.320 --> 21:41.320
The share has already ruled that the point of order that you have made is the question to turn your time into an asset appropriate.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.320
The chair has had enough worth any witness to question testify if he does.

21:45.320 --> 21:49.320
He will not or cannot as to consult with somebody first.

21:49.320 --> 21:54.320
I just had in the table as a result of the lunch hour.

21:54.320 --> 22:06.320
I think it goes to the full question here on out because the Army has permitted testimony that went on within the defense department and was in the executive branch here before.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.320
And it may have been favorable to them.

22:08.320 --> 22:18.320
Are we for year on out not going to permit testimony relating to conversations that took place within the executive branch because it may not be favorable?

22:18.320 --> 22:31.320
So there is a chair, but the chair says that he was just as surprised as anybody in this committee to find that the American ambassador, this is the United Nations, has been running into a discussion about what to do about private time.

22:31.320 --> 22:42.320
The question has been the testimony of Mr. Adams and the owner of the deal that he's ever asked you questions, but I feel that Mr. Adams does have the right to find that one in the discussion's dark.

22:42.320 --> 22:52.320
So then I make the further point that we have had to find a committee on the piece by if there is an executive order issued in the instructions of an issue.

22:52.320 --> 23:18.320
I think this committee should find out now whether it covers just this conversation or whether it covers all conversations that went on between the various officials within the executive branch of the government because we're going to be forequalled here immediately from asking any further questions relating to conversation between officials within the executive branch.

23:18.320 --> 23:25.320
Here to four, most conversations have been coming in. There's been favorable amount of their unfavorable order to be excluded.

23:25.320 --> 23:32.320
And the chair says that if you're back in the dining committee, you can send some of these questions to the party and you have to leave the room with them.

23:32.320 --> 23:41.320
The point of order has gotten a little dizzy now. I like to tell me what I can do to interrogate the witnesses.

23:41.320 --> 23:49.320
You'll be advised that Mr. Carer has the service action that he has to do on the point of order because he does not have any information in the process.

23:49.320 --> 24:03.320
Mr. Carer has said that he thinks if the evidence is made appropriate, we request that he never opportunity to do the month's charge of final just by the assumptions are and whether they came from it and he will reply back to you questions when he has given the meeting.

24:03.320 --> 24:17.320
Mr. Chairman, that I had one other remark. I hope the chair believes now that if we're not going to go back into the policy of having prolonged discussions on the party council, we just make you remarks after you have finished your point of order.

24:17.320 --> 24:26.320
I think the point of order should be very short, Mr. Dex has indicated that the testimony of a person who would be unfavorable beyond his death by counter-utilizing my mind.

24:26.320 --> 24:49.320
I think the chair will be questioned to be gay and not with fowards anybody, only to try to get the truth before the committee.

24:50.320 --> 25:00.320
Now, Mr. Adams, you stand at the suggestion of Governor Sherman Adams. You made up this report with respect to Mr. Shines.

25:00.320 --> 25:08.320
Is that correct? What's there? What was the position of Mr. Lyd with respect to that report? Did he approve it or did he disapprove it?

25:08.320 --> 25:16.320
No, it was very casual conversation. I think it disproved within the pain inhibitions that I had with Mr. Welk.

25:16.320 --> 25:23.320
In other words, you feel that he was just there for the ride or did he say anything to him? So what did he say?

25:23.320 --> 25:33.320
I'm not there. I'm not there. I'm not there. I'd like to say that I believe that if the indian structure is on hand, I would like your permission to defer answering matters.

25:33.320 --> 25:37.320
Having to do with that until the subsequent to the lunch hour.

25:37.320 --> 25:44.320
All right, well, sir. Will you tell the committee what the position was just being that was taken by the Attorney General, Mr. Brown L?

25:44.320 --> 25:53.320
Sir, I think the same position. I'm not there to use the same way. It's my instructions and compass. The entire camera is immediately dialed.

25:53.320 --> 26:05.320
Now, Mr. Adams, I've had a little experience with the executive side. You face something about some horrible, armed or subjective order of the unity of what you bring up and writing to them.

26:05.320 --> 26:09.320
Oh, he's right there.

26:09.320 --> 26:12.320
That's okay.

26:12.320 --> 26:17.320
You mean something in writing with the director?

26:17.320 --> 26:19.320
Sure, I can. I can. I can. I can.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.320
That's right. Yes, sir.

26:20.320 --> 26:31.320
When you bring in writing instructions, signed by somebody, my brother, to why you are unable to tell us what the people said at the meeting, you being the person who told us they were at the meeting volunteer?

26:31.320 --> 26:33.320
Yes, sir. I will.

26:33.320 --> 26:42.320
Now, Mr. Mr. Adams, the general position of the morning will also include Mr. Carol Morgan.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.320
He was at that same meeting.

26:44.320 --> 26:48.320
Did he come down also and talk to members of the subcommittee?

26:48.320 --> 26:50.320
He came with me and talked to one member.

26:50.320 --> 26:54.320
And yet, he was unallowed to say what he said to a member of the subcommittee?

26:54.320 --> 26:56.320
Oh, no. I had.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.320
He's just not doing a clue as much as he said to the members.

26:59.320 --> 27:02.320
The justice, what he said, is misleading to you.

27:02.320 --> 27:10.320
That is instruction and truth, conversation between members of the executive branch.

27:10.320 --> 27:15.320
What were the recommendations or instructions that were given you at the end of the meeting?

27:15.320 --> 27:18.320
I think it's the same as the media.

27:18.320 --> 27:21.320
I'm not giving it to an officer and so something went wrong.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.320
But Mr. Morgan, no, it's no, though, as you said it, it was the justice.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.320
Right. Right.

27:25.320 --> 27:30.320
I am sorry. I am a year old. I am permitted to be state matters that I've already heard.

27:30.320 --> 27:37.320
He believes that if the witness is going to select Mr. Six with all of these,

27:37.320 --> 27:40.320
especially if he thinks they're not clear, the different of them,

27:40.320 --> 27:44.320
he cannot say that he's just until they're very in conflict with his position.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.320
There are no such decisions at all.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.320
He's just a decision that's entirely.

27:48.320 --> 27:51.320
The legislature might start to take a stand in the process.

27:51.320 --> 27:55.320
I'm not going to decide it is finding it in my instructions and provisions.

27:55.320 --> 27:59.320
To this, does what I have already?

27:59.320 --> 28:07.320
And will that be the part of that is concerned I can't answer to time and let them decide it is quickly?

28:07.320 --> 28:09.320
I'd like to make a personal judgment.

28:09.320 --> 28:15.320
I view that it's not just the use of my executive committee,

28:15.320 --> 28:20.320
I'm sure these some members of the executive committee have held the executive branch

28:20.320 --> 28:23.320
that they think it's right to be allowed to tell the truth to his meetings.

28:23.320 --> 28:29.320
That thing that you've already brought up gets the life of an environment and in the German.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.320
I'm sorry about that. I don't have it.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.320
Please, that's why I view it in a rough way.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.320
You want to argue with the panciful people who they do so.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.320
That's why I'm just going to be in the same respect.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.320
I'll be glad to explain it to you.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.320
Time to time out for the government.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.320
Thank you.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.320
Time to get for the meeting.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.320
The fire is a part of the system.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.320
No.

28:46.320 --> 28:49.320
I want to say, to the time and up, it's up to start a deterrent.

28:49.320 --> 28:53.320
If any member wants to argue with the panciful, that's appropriate.

28:53.320 --> 28:57.320
The undercover will tell you now you're going to drift the out of the room when you're time is late.

28:57.320 --> 29:01.320
Well, this chairman I'm going to ask the chairman to do questions.

29:01.320 --> 29:05.320
And then I declare this committee to have Mr. Adam Samson's time.

29:05.320 --> 29:10.320
I'd like to have the chairman to swear me and I'd like to tell what I know about him.

29:10.320 --> 29:14.320
But first I want to ask Mr. Adam, please.

29:14.320 --> 29:18.320
As I get it from your testimony,

29:18.320 --> 29:24.320
are you stated as a shawaiimatic aim of pressive sometime in early November?

29:24.320 --> 29:26.320
I think that is correct.

29:26.320 --> 29:31.320
And it continues through November and December all in the January.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.320
Yes.

29:32.320 --> 29:38.320
You did not call on any members of this subcommittee until the 19th of January.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.320
The 19th of the 20th.

29:40.320 --> 29:44.320
The 19th is the day that you call on Thomas and MacArthur.

29:44.320 --> 29:48.320
Call it your direct testimony.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.320
I may be off today or show that that isn't fitted in that week.

29:51.320 --> 29:55.320
What time of the day will this be called on Thomas and MacArthur?

29:55.320 --> 29:57.320
About taking classifieds that you need.

29:57.320 --> 30:03.320
There has been a meeting of the subcommittee and staff that day.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.320
Same day.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.320
I don't remember.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.320
Sir, is there a meeting of them?

30:14.320 --> 30:25.320
Well, I have before me a very transparent list of the executive sessions on January 19, 1954.

30:25.320 --> 30:32.320
And I assume that that meeting took place even in the morning or in the afternoon.

30:32.320 --> 30:38.320
Do you recall when you appeared before Thomas MacArthur and the staff with respect to the subpoenas?

30:38.320 --> 30:47.320
Or that they intended to issue more certain members of the law to the board?

30:47.320 --> 30:49.320
Let me get my things ready.

30:49.320 --> 30:52.320
I don't want to get this in on the table.
