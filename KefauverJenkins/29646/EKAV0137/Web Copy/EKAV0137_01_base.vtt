WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
I don't think that I don't particularly know the general law of the fear, but I do not

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
recall having an particular connection with what we're wearing, testify to until we can

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
blow when I learn more about what we're looking about, the monastic law of the

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
generation here in the general law. And you do it if you are. I gave the

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
consideration to the tired of the world's general law of the women, to the tired of the men in the

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
group, and to the government of the government of the government. Did you do that? You are in the

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
position, the political rally for the women that have been murdered in the second one.

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
Because you're giving a higher set of early general law of the qualifications, 100%. The only thing I have

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
to mind is that I'm really concerned with as I talk about yesterday, where the question I was

02:16.000 --> 02:28.000
about, is that, anything I was talking, I was just wondering if I was just trying to find my

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
self-esteem, but it was using too much of a mini-job in the day that it's so good now that

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
the morning is here today. You are not going to do the power of the men. You are not

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
going to do the power of the men. The general law of the women and men and men by

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
telling them that they are not going to defend themselves in the human world and the human

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
human humanозможism. I don't have any idea. I don't have any idea. I don't have a

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
hundred-quarter particular law of the human world. We can go to power in the

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
future. The movement that happens for the human human, the general law is required to

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
the committee's question within certain states. No one has not sustained any harm from the

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
age of 21 months, but I have been incognized by the month with the exception of the right

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
to weeks. There's a lot of evidence to we even expect it. I think I heard you. He's

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
the leader of that. I think I want to listen to this draft. Who needs your

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
abilities and drawings, then you don't need to. Mr. Jenkins, it's terribly hard for me to

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
answer these questions very quickly. I don't get a chance to answer one question before

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
you start on another. I have to thank you, Pat, for the opportunity. And I'll try

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
to mock you if you can see it. But I don't really know what it's called. I'm trying my most

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
sincere, ready to get back before the night. I don't even know what it's called. I'm

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
finished. Mr. Lynch, Mr. Lynch. Well, I'm not going to stand right in front of you. It's

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
all my mind now, sir, because I'm time for the Royal set of modern events. I'm not

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
going to be nervous, but I'm the question that I ask you and I am not for

04:17.000 --> 04:26.000
I got you right. Mr. Lynch, do you know what I'm called? That's a really

04:26.000 --> 04:35.000
Mr. Lynch. You got the information that General Wattens your child's eyes. That is

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
really hard to hear. You know, my child, the answer is, you know, the answer is

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
that I need an answer to that. I need an answer, Mr. Lynch. Mr. Lynch, you said

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
the answer.

05:35.000 --> 05:50.000
Alright, you think we'll all live. That Mr. Adam Stoward did that General Wattens

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
replied to be made for a certain distance. No, I have not surrendered any more to the

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
other. Well, I have been in demand and I'm on the exception of the last week. So that's

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
right as to what you, Mr. Secretary, and I think that I heard that.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
There is a space to honor that you've received my information from Mr. Adam. That's correct.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
I can't say that I received a commissioner's address, but you can't receive my

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
message. That's right. I think I received my message. That's right.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
You were informed by either Mr. Adam Stoward or anyone else. The General Wattens

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
was really asked why he did not affect his suspension's always on the

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
issue. No, sir. You don't look all at me. No, sir. Well, he was

06:51.000 --> 07:00.000
informed that Mr. Adam was informed you or anyone else informed you. The General

07:00.000 --> 07:10.000
Wattens stated that there is an incident. No, letting the facts to question Mr. Wattens

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
and that he pointed to someone and said, there is one reason. I don't recall

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
around or is that. Well, do you think I ever heard that? I don't recall having heard it.

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
Even if I already was at this specific question, it's Secretary Stevens.

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
Every direct you not to make any suspensions on your own initiative.

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
Any, now that's one question I was about to ask. Actually, Mr. Jenkins, I had orders

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
out to all of our commanders, to all of our field in relation. Your actions are not the

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
same, but they were to make a decision. They were to make a decision. They're on judgment

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
and they matter. I know, but your actions are not responsible. Your lawyer from

07:57.000 --> 08:05.000
his bank in Edges is not responsible for this. My question is, the use of call. General

08:05.000 --> 08:15.000
Wattens being in interrogated and asked, did Secretary Stevens ever order you not to make

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
these suspensions? That's one question. I certainly never heard anything like that. You

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
didn't hear that nine years instead. I don't recall anything. All of the General Wattens

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
was, I was in substance. I was rather not answer I'm working for Secretary Stevens.

08:37.000 --> 08:46.000
I thought I'm unfamiliar with it. You are telling this committee that you're involved.

08:46.000 --> 08:56.000
Mr. Adams did not communicate to you a message. He was vitally important to us with respect

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
to General Lawton, one of your generals. Mr. Jenkins, I have given instructions that

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
our field commanders were to exercise their own judgment in these matters of suspension.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
And I expected them to do it. And I made that clear and that applies to General Lawton

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
as well as the field commanders of other installations. I expected them to do it.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
I can't conceive of having suggested that do not do it and I certainly did not.

09:26.000 --> 09:35.000
And Smith the Moore to do. I'm not pursuing any further. Mr. Secretary, Mr. Adams is under your command.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Of course he did not. Yes sir.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Take instructions from him. Yes sir.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Gang is out to order. Yes sir.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
As far as he knows he has always done that for you.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
And he is still in the same capacity in which he was originally employed.

09:54.000 --> 10:06.000
That's right. I will ask you this. Did you instruct and as far as he knows he has never given the order.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
Are you directing? Extend upon the direction.

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
Mr. Adams doesn't have the authority to give the instruction. I will ask you this with secretary.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Did you not?

10:21.000 --> 10:32.000
I am November of last year. Mr. Adams taught the General Lawton and say in substance.

10:32.000 --> 10:40.000
General I hope you see your way clear to withdraw certain cases which you have recommended

10:40.000 --> 10:51.000
for removal of bad security risks. Did you direct Mr. Adams to make such a communication to General Lawton?

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I can't recall anything about that. You can't recall anything about it.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
No sir. Mr. Adams ever advised that he is human such a directive.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
I make such a request to General Lawton. I can't recall anything about that.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Well I already said tremendously important that you won't blame me.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
I will say that I am sick for the great light of the issues with this kind of work.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
And I ask you not to search your minds.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
And you make yourself with elsewhere.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
Ask for a respect. I want you to search your minds and I want you to answer this.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Did you not?

11:32.000 --> 11:40.000
You direct Mr. Adams to call General Lawton by the telephone and say in substance.

11:40.000 --> 11:51.000
I hope you can see your way clear to withdraw certain cases which you have recommended for removal of bad security risks.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
And General Lawton replied this following.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
I will not let this secretary take the responsibility.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Now again I can't.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
And Mr. Secretary, in all fairness to you I want to say six.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
I have not asked a single question of you or any other with this.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
Unless I thought there was some reasonable basis for it.

12:22.000 --> 12:34.000
And I think it's fair that you and your eminent counsel now know that I am reading from the written document prepared by now.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
Captain Hardin has been promoted.

12:38.000 --> 12:50.000
Prepared by Captain Hardin, my presence and in General Lawton's presence and in the very handwriting of Captain Hardin, I pass it to the chairman.

12:50.000 --> 13:01.000
To determine whether or not I have correctly quoted it from it and I say that it is a vital importance to the issues of disolving.

13:02.000 --> 13:11.000
And I must be well investigation and I must be far and answer yes or no.

13:11.000 --> 13:21.000
Can I look at the paper? You certainly may.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
Before I say that the paper may I say a word to my friend Mr. Jacob?

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
Yes, I am informed Mr. Jacob that you have tried many murder trials and with great success.

13:36.000 --> 13:48.000
But may I remind you my friend that this is not a murder trial and that you are examining the secretary of the army.

13:49.000 --> 13:57.000
It may feel good to me when you jump down the throat of the witnesses on the other side.

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
But I beg of you, this witness is entitled I think to that least ordinary courtesy.

14:07.000 --> 14:17.000
And in your clear retirement I think by the tone of your voice you may convey as impressive to the country that you would not waste to convey.

14:17.000 --> 14:33.000
I have no particular comment I think the witness should be subjected to course and acceleration and I think these questions are further to the issue.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
I think the witness should be required to answer.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
As charity or a case concerned all witnesses must appear that in this community have the same look.

14:43.000 --> 14:53.000
We expect channels and pilots, senators and secretary employees all to be treated the same were trying to find out the truth.

14:53.000 --> 15:05.000
There is no measure of disrespect for any of them. I am sure I can apply to any of the questions that come from the asking in his zealous and difficult task of getting out of the truth.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And the end to this development.

15:07.000 --> 15:18.000
I would like to completely support the remarks made by my colleague, this thing received the sound of the mark and so.

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
Mr. Karen may I give it to you before we know to read the paper that has been asked to the witness.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
If you are not allowed to make it, you are not allowed to make it.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Of course you make it.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
So I will make it.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
What year will you make it?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Well, it's just the word no member with a question in OV with a question mark after.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
Then it says Adam asked Lawton by phone.

16:27.000 --> 16:38.000
I hope you can't you can see your way clear to withdraw certain cases which you have recommended for removal as bad security risk.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
Lawton I would not let the secretary take the responsibility.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Isn't that precisely what I read to you Mr. Cate?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Yes, Father, I know it is.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Yes, sir.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
This is the point of right.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
We very clear could.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
The council advice.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
What we are reading from just for our dinner.

16:59.000 --> 17:06.000
We are reading from a document written by General Lawton's aide.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
previous to the lice he was a lieutenant corps.

17:11.000 --> 17:22.000
Now Captain Corps, the telephone comrade No sir written by Captain Corps in my presence and in the presence of General Lawton this morning.

17:22.000 --> 17:29.000
By our executive session and with the consent and approval of General Lawton.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
I request general a General's aide to write it out in his presence.

17:35.000 --> 17:46.000
It was written in his presence in the handwriting of Captain Corps was read by General Lawton who is in this room along with his aide Captain Corps.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
And that son of his Jackson is what I looked at on his head but what's the November date?

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
There is a November question mark.

17:57.000 --> 18:12.000
General Lawton told me and Captain Corps that that conversation was early in November but he was unable to give the date and for that reason it is put November question mark.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Oh, I see.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
It sounded like a memo that Ireland could have been written today but it had November date on it.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
You have finally made a good year as well.

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
Would tell if you're Jackson, look at the memorandum because they had the memorandum with Henry and the committee members if at all it is.

18:34.000 --> 18:44.000
Council will proceed with these questions now. Mr. Chairman, I have not yet received an answer to my last question.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I have no right to answer any of these questions.

18:46.000 --> 18:55.000
No right, I have just read that and I have it in mind and I have no right to answer any of these telephone conversations and obviously could not have been on the phone.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Your answer is that you have no right to answer any of these questions.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I have such a conversation.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
That's right. And that he obviously could not have been with the telephone.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
No, I mean the right but not on the telephone. Mr. Secretary, there he is.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
Nothing in my question to imply that that was a conversation between you and General Welton.

19:19.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm sure that you understand the important plain meaning of my words.

19:27.000 --> 19:36.000
And what I was trying to say sir is that this was evidently a telephone conversation between Adams and I guess General Welton.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I don't want to interrupt but important.

19:38.000 --> 19:54.000
I know I read him for the more than earlier and I have read the memorandum and I know in the first sentence verses November question mark and then it says this.

19:54.000 --> 20:02.000
Adams asked Lawton by Paul and then he goes on I hope so and so it is a reference to telephone conversation.

20:02.000 --> 20:13.000
The order that I had made earlier and I'm not trying to unnecessarily take up time but I'm just trying to keep the record first like and follow this testimony.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
It is a memorandum. I've never end up.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
You have to sing it right here.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Yes.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
We'll reference to a telephone conversation. I think that ought to be purified at this point.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
If it's being offered by my question, send it to Jack.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Well, but I'd have to hold it in my life.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
It was not a separate answer to this question or you were consulting the memorandum.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
They always read you it is.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Oh, may I have a number of them on the telephone conversation.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
There's nothing in the question to be in the case of anybody listening to you.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Well, I know but there's no, there's no, as far as I know.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Nobody's listening. It may develop in somebody's being. Somebody's not being so dying.

20:56.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, if I raise the question of relevancy, this was not a telephone conversation between this witness and general law.

21:05.000 --> 21:14.000
No, no, no, no, no, no. General Lawman, Mr. Adams, he was the representative and the mouthpiece of this witness, they are okay.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
Now, that is another matter, sir. Mr. Adams may be asked about it.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Yes, the matter is asking this witness, Mr. Adams, report it to me.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Point of order was made at this witness's direction.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, to waste, one point of order at a time to chair a rule on the point of order, Mr. Welton,

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
and appears to be in to be a perfectly relevant question to find out was the secretary knew about the telephone conversation or not.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
That's the question he should answer.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
I say I have no recollection of it at all.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Shut up, proceed.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
But it is this point of order, I'm trying to keep this.

21:50.000 --> 21:58.000
Never random straight mind, obviously from this memorandum, which I assume is from Captain Ford.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
It's not two hours old. It's from Mike, written out by Captain Ford.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
In my persons and in the persons of General Lawman, I have the direction of General Lawman.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Yes. Well, now, my point of order is, my point of order is,

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
that I would like to know whether or not Captain Ford are listening in on his telephone conversation

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
because the memorandum is that, and that's what I thought.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
And then it goes on to repeat the memorandum of the conversation.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
Obviously, I just have the point of order.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Obviously, Captain Ford must have listened in on the telephone conversation.

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
That memorandum was dictated by General Lawman in my persons to Captain Ford this morning,

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
and Captain Ford wrote it out at the dictation of the law.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
Okay, now we all understand the memorandum, and the Council may contain it to ask Captain General.

23:03.000 --> 23:13.000
Now I'm just keeping these three previous, means that Mr. Adams acted at your direction only.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
No, I wouldn't say that. He was the department of the Army Councilor.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And he takes orders from me.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Yes, he takes orders from me.

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
And I have to say to the Sergeant you, he has executed all of those orders.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, I can't say that, Michael Staten.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
What did you say to that? I asked you that.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
The Sergeant you know, has Mr. Adams carried out your directives in orders?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I know that he's a tough at all.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
As far as he know, has Mr. Adams given any orders our directions,

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
except with your consent our right to your direction?

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
Well, I don't know, Mr. Jenkins. He's not in the line of command.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
He may have a time for the time to give orders, I just don't know.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
He had no authority to did him his secretary.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
He did not have actual authority to do it.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
This is Adams, ever reporting to you,

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
that in the early part of November, 1953, he called General Love Mountain at the home.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
An estimate he could see is way clear.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
From the caucus room of the Senate on the building in Washington,

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
mutual has been bringing his special coverage of the congressional hearings,

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
which the resulting command had recommended for removal of that security risk.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
And General Love and the fly that he would not do it

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
led to secretary meaning you take the responsibility.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I've answered that question once, sir.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I answered again with you.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
I have no recollection of that telephone call.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Well, Mr. Secretary, do you regard that?

24:56.000 --> 25:05.000
If it happens, do you regard it as the vital importance in shedding light

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
on the issues involved in this controversy?

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
You being charged as you are by this Senate committee

25:17.000 --> 25:26.000
with having tried to repeat the progress of the investigation of Port Mountain.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
I have spoken to him, he has been by one of the committee,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
he means by certain personnel of the committee.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
I mean the investigation committee, you being charged.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
We have a dialogue, I'm born of water, I'd like to pray for that.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Yes, yes, yes.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
May we also recognize it?

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm looking to work out together, but we all know what we've done for that.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
You being charged by senior commander, we have the time.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
And having tried to stop the investigation of Port Mountain,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Mr. Having tried to repeat the progress of it.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
Now, in view in the night of all night, do you not recognize?

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
Well, I would like to have that question of the judgment that I've read back for you.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
I would like to have that question of the judgment that I've read back for you.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
And I hope that the chairman will conclude that this can be a bit confusing to a witness

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
who is now on his sixth day on the stand when the quiver is in and then it's withdrawn.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
And I don't know what the question is.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
So, I'm going to be there.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
There are no questions before you know it's going to be noble.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
The right answer you give the committee,

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
well, that you have no recollection, whatever.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
Having been informed by Mr. Adams or any relief,

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
of this conversation in early November between Mr. Adams and General Lovman,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
correct about that, I'm not mistaken.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
You're actually asking the recollection.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Are you afraid, again, of a telephone call?

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
I've answered it twice right now.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
You can write now in the state, there are fees explained.

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
I've answered that question twice and I hear by answer the third time I have no recollection of a telephone call.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
If you have the grievance, here you charge me against you by Senator McCurdy in his death,

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
then you try to stop their investigation of subversives.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
At four months, type in CD, retirement progress and so forth.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
Would there not you regard such a conversation as I ask you about in the past

27:50.000 --> 27:58.000
which you say you have no recollection of going to the very heart, the very core of that issue?

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Would you not regard that as such?

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Well, I wasn't a party to it, Mr. Jenkins.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I wasn't a party to it.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
What kind of your influence?

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
And, Converter, it is not claimed that I think the proceedings were spectacular.

28:17.000 --> 28:26.000
The Senator McCurdy was a party to certain activities of phone calls on the part of the phone.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
And, yes, you have charged him.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
And, if it may be, Mr. Committee will seem to be in his department.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
We will know about that.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
We are talking about two sides of this conversation now on the close information

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
for the purpose of discerning whether or not that charged by a phone call to Mr. McCurdy is too or false.

28:47.000 --> 28:55.000
And, I, too, have found you for the committee that I regard in as the breaking part of this

28:55.000 --> 29:02.000
and shedding light on the truth or quality of that charge as you excuse or reject.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Well, I think, he has a vital role to be seen.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
Mr. Jenkins, I think that, if, before I could answer that question,

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
I think we ought to retrace the whole of the fort-monets situation

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
and get the whole thing in the proper perspective without taking out one little incident

29:21.000 --> 29:29.000
and making so much out of it because there's a large, complicated, long story connected with fort-monets

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
which I have justified to at length and which I'll be glad to continue to testify to.

29:34.000 --> 29:42.000
Mr. Jenkins, I think the security matters there, of which this is one incident that I have no recollection of.

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
I may seem to have a one isolated fact.

29:49.000 --> 29:58.000
There's a relatively occurredness in early November 1953, one isolated fact.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
That you say is a part of the whole part of it.

30:02.000 --> 30:12.000
Now, you testify fully about fort-monets and that my last question is with you such killed the fact.

30:12.000 --> 30:24.000
Wouldn't you regard it as being a great way in the 16th Committee in determining whether or not you were against them

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
and whether you were the investigation of fort-monets?

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
I would log up that in the perspective of the whole picture before I could answer that question.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Now, that is your nature as it stands.

30:35.000 --> 30:44.000
That's why I'm on the sentence to leave it there, the Committee will judge of whether or not I like the word.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
If I may, say this.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Well, I think I have that, but I'll excuse me in a minute.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
I'll take your part.

30:56.000 --> 31:09.000
Well, I simply wanted to say that in respect to fort-monets, I wanted the right kind of a job done in farading off the security risks.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
If there was any espionage, it must be eliminated.

31:16.000 --> 31:26.000
If there are fort security risks, I must be the best one to make sure people are on this morning to be expedited to see an object of action.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
For Mr. Jenkins, I think if we can limit the...

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
I have a very important point that I have to go there as on all of it.

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
You may make it because you want every witness to have every conceivable channel, I say everything she wants to say.

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
I mean, she says, oh, I want an expediting degree, but it's more important than that, is to lose the nation and get into fact she may talk.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
All right, so here is the point.

31:48.000 --> 31:56.000
I wanted to get more background for the information of the Committee of the Post, but I'll confine it to this point.

31:56.000 --> 32:06.000
The very human, Mr. Baker, because in getting into fact, can I get important with the issues that I'm working on in time to ready to get into this matter?

32:06.000 --> 32:20.000
I wanted it done by all of our commanders, including the Commanding General of Fort Monmouth, with the finest of judgments of which they were catered.

32:21.000 --> 32:35.000
I did not want to have a spam-peam started that would resolve in your whole-sale suspension of people on a basis of your fire association.

32:35.000 --> 32:44.000
I wanted to be sure that they, to want to have any commander, because I was so interested in this subject,

32:44.000 --> 32:57.000
I was thinking of the virtues and security risks jumped to an extreme in his action, which could result in unfairness to any individual employed in the Army.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
And I think that is a very important thing.
