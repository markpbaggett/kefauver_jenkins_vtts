00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I'm not any people today.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
I've taken by my two-much citations.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
You say you take too much citations.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
You have an independent recollection of anyone

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
particularly pay for this.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Do you recall, if you and the government

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
have taken one place, no one would take this,

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
you did not.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
No.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Do you recall, Mr. Colesick,

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
do you think these are any other

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
of those documents for you, Mr. Schultz?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
I don't know.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
It's an independent recollection of them.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
But I'm sure that he dictated some of these to me.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
All of these that say,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
from the Capricorn,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
were obviously dictated by him,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
although I have not had put a claim on paper.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
How many young ladies,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
are ladies,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
or gentlemen in your office,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
either who takes the patient?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I would be the only one who can do it.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I would be the only one who can do it.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
You mean to make you answer those seven

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
thousand letters of any number?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I believe you will find a family.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I am the only one who would take this type of citations.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
We have all of the young ladies and now

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
office dictations on mail.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
About what do you mean,

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
but that type of dictations.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
So start the work with my father.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I want to just say to my wife,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
if they can't see the fancy,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
they want to make a note for him,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
why I'm the obvious person to take it.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Did you have your notes?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
You could take short hand to go in.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And I presume that you took those notes,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
remember I moved in short hand.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I think probably 11 were dictated.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Maybe they might be a few here.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
So there's a terrible out there.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I know in their own writing,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
they did it to me and I would talk to you.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Did you have your original short hand notes?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I think it used this one.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
No, I don't think so.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I never keep short hand notes.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
You do not, when you have a short hand,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
look at what you take short hand notes.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I try.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
And when that note will be still,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
and I have finished typing everything in it,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I just try it.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
You just try it?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I always try.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You'll wear any reason, Farglade.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It's a thing in the way I don't want to keep them there.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Of any value, I'll never keep them in all these other works.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
You have in years, and you've been there.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
I've been with them for almost 15.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
And you've never had a station to refer back to notes that you've chosen.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
No.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Do you have operas of those, my mind?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Certain to be.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes, operas of the ones you now have before you.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I think perhaps we have,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
because we've talked at least,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
when they were released to the press,

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
and I'm sure you must have extra copies in the office.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
You said you've operas when you released them to the press.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
That's right.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
You are, you're talking about the release of March 12th.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
How about we call the date?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I think it was about that time.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
About that time it was a day or so I think the Army release was not clever.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
And with the pace of the Army release means that this will

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
let you make this copies and release it.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
The original are copies of the play of this.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I think so.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
You think so?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
When the Army release was made, Mr. Eskoy,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
you then have those memoranda in the particular jacket

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
in which they are now, is that what you're telling us?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes, it's about the same time.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
That is that jacket, Mark.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
What identification does it have on it?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
The West Asian Committee.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Investigation committees.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, if there is nothing on it to indicate,

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
what particular phrase of investigation the committee was saying out there.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
That's right.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Just by the investigation committee.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
That's right.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
You have a lot of ties on the musical.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes sir.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
How many would you estimate?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I can't ask the estimate.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
You have a lot of ties on the board,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
not on the investigation.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yes.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Would you estimate how many?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
No.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
You have a lot of ties on the voice of American investigations.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yes.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And a lot of them on the government cleaning all things.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yes.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
And that's the particular file now.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
It's just identified by the words investigating committee.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
What kind?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
It's not all say-by-stay.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, how did you know where to go to look to that file in this book?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
When you were called upon the release.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
I can't tell you that.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I can't tell you that.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I can't tell you that.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I want my way of fighting.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I didn't.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
There's just no out-how.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I did not get your answers.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Which I doesn't.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
The chairman says that your reply was,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
that's just 9-way of finding.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
That's right.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Another way to say a lot of it if you remember it is, Eddie,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
what's that?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Who I would accuse to get those in my mind?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
How much is 12, sorry.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
They are so private.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Thank you.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
Mr.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Is that ice to the release of the orange?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I think so.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
That's all I would have created.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Any invention in the time is just a thing.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
The building is made just whose mind and new work was running out to us.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Those are my lines.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
That's right.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
That's right.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
That's right.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
That's right.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Did you recall the compensation every other decision?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
No, this is thank you.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
So he asked me to get what to remember, what memory we had on this project.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
What were the three?

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
What memory did you say you wanted?

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Any memory I'm expecting is a compensation.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
So it was fine to worry or you remember?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Some kind of compensation.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
On that ticket assessment.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
All I did was take a ticket.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Take compensation, please.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Nobody's there.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
No, I can't tell you.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
That's what I'm saying.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I think I know.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
Those wrong questions I can't ask.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I miss that, miss that, miss.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
Will you examine those memorandum and tell us whether or not they are the original,

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
written up by you, or whether they are copied?

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I think you can say they may be the original.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
I talked about that, but I can tell you how it's supposed to be.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
You're supposed to be the original, or isn't it?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Well, because they are original.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Because they're the ones who were stuck out in different instances.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I couldn't tell you that.

07:13.000 --> 07:22.000
Because when they were recocked enough,

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
I thought of getting them all ready and getting enough copies for the first.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
The original, both of them, the pictures,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
which may have gotten away.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
I think it's a fair time for me to just mind self of those documents I've had in my possession

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
for more than two months now.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
It's been a source of a lot of worries.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Because they might be lost in this place, and I'm one dad.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm just going to file all the evidence I've got.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
This is supposed to be a moment.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
And they now become a matter of public record.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
And I am completely this possess of them.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
And your answer will be, I think it's a few so far.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
You will be not just a doctor.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It's with a number of them.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
They're cheering fire at those of the...

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
The rituals that they are, with you and they're healed on the loose.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
They are, for a time, enough.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Correct.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
And I believe we're copies that they are the original,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
for every to me, for the chairman.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
And I am not completely this possess of them.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Have you concluded this?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I've concluded this, Mr. Chairman.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Just for the purpose of the correction, you're lectured.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I think Mr. Cohen, or you testified earlier,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
that I had requested, in fact,

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
to hire, to produce those original memorandums, on March 12th.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
I'm sure that was not today, because I was not selected.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
I was in unhappy position as chairman.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Until some days later, it was the afternoon of the day,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
when I was selected as chairman,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
like Paul Frank Carr, and so I believed,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
as long as I was chairman, I should have position

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
of the original documents, and he procured them,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
and delivered them to my office late for afternoon.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
We can establish the exact date,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
by going back to the date, when we held the executive meeting,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
at which time I was designated as chairman.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
We'll show it.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Mr. Sanders, you would like to see the original

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
to request a number to the tape.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I think I have just one question, Mr. fiscal.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
This file in which you kept the original,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
was that a file in your office,

09:26.000 --> 09:26.220

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
For four years he is starting tokins company.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
First, the county department.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
For three years he is starting to concentrate.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
So it's one that looked in the committee files

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
by two.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
The time that the council pushed your rules.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
These would not have been in the committee files.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
We now have a vote.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
They were regarded as personal.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
For their practice.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
That's all, Jeff.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Underjection.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Underjection.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
Mr.吼, do you ordinarily put your initials on your...

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
...clipers and documents.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Unlettered yes on Memorandum notes.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
On Memorandum you do not.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
No.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Newtron, we're on the cotton poppy.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
A little file.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
This is the original on his family's thing here at Eastern Records.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Yes, that was tight.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
These were all tight on the dates

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
for the pair on Memorandum.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I couldn't say that, sir.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
The exact same thing.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
They were either.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
They dated.

11:09.000 --> 11:09.000


11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
The day that we did pay to me.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
We didn't.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
They are too active.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Well, I'm happy with them.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
They were very soft, here.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
The least involved.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
There are the time few hours after you've received the dictation.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
But I was.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I would.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Maybe that day.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Maybe they are.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Maybe they are.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Maybe they are.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Now, are there any other Memorandum

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
that have been dictated by Mr. Cohn or Mr. Carr?

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Is that the usual practice in the office?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Memorand, on flat.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Well, I mean, not a matter relating to the committee work.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Oh, yes.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
There's a lot of Memorandum.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
That's that.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
That's that.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
And they are in the file now.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
That's if the personal Memorandum is sent to the info.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Which would be in the time itself.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Right.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
That's that.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
And the part.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I have one.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
What is that?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
That one question.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
You'll use more than one typewriter in the...

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yes.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Yes, I do.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Well, the Corbin copy.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
The key.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Do you mean the Covens who were made at the time?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
They were originally tyrants.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
They may have gone out with the best office or they may be a copy of key in the office.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
And the correct answer.

12:29.000 --> 12:39.000
I believe now that the first out procedure since the recating size of the controversy will come out and tell the McCarthy to expand the question.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
And Mr. Wolf, send the McCarthy and Mr. Kong, do you have any questions?

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
You want me one by the way, so I'm trying to be down.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Yes, sir.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Yes, sir.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I'm sure it's a full of people.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I have a repeat.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Mr. Wolf.

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to make an arrangement where I can sit by Mrs. Distol as I asked her about these.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Could I have a chair by the witness?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Let's have a look at them.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Mr. Chairman.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I might be heard on that.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
I have not received the formal retainer, but I am sitting here with Mary Drystal.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
And I wonder why Mr. Wolf couldn't just ask questions from the same place to be senate.

13:22.000 --> 13:33.000
And when we were in Mr. Welch's position, it seemed to me appropriate Mr. Welch, or at least you did not sit so close to the witness that you could overhear what your counsel was saying.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Oh, it seems that I'm out there.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
You see, I want her to look at the memorandum as I do. I've never seen them yet.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
This is my sign in the House of Justice, that's the number of people.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Right.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
So that I thought it would be a convenience if I sat near her as I examined her.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And the chair had no point.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
The chair believes that there are some printed copies of the memorandum around which have an identity being completely acted.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
If one of my friends is my left with lone Mr. Distol, Mr. Prins and Toppies, I think that we share the purpose.

14:07.000 --> 14:16.000
And I do think it's a bit unfair to deny counsel for these witnesses the same right Mr. Welch, that you had another to talk with them on a confidential basis.

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
Mr. Smith, I think Mr. Chairman, I think Mr. Welch is making that request, but I think it should be denied.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
Mr. Chairman, having transphabetic in a hurry, I believe I can...

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
We identified previously Mr. Welch the fact that the printed copies of Distol, topfully, have made where our verdict and correct.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
So if you take one of those and give Mr. Distol the original, you can proceed from where you are without any conclusion.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Now I think she better have the original.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Yes, he doesn't come to the copy.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
I think they are cluttered, perfect as far as similar as you can turn.

14:54.000 --> 15:07.000
Mrs. Distol, it's always somewhat awkward and difficult to cross exam in a lady, but I must ask you one or two or perhaps more questions about this file.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.000
When did you make the file up? When did you just start making the file?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
When did you make the file up?

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
When did you make the cover? When did you...

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Time to crack my random was 6K.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
I would say I was alive in your ass like that.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
About October, 1953.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
That's the rate of the crack my random.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
And what did you write on it?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
That's Jason's committee.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
That's all the code. The investigation committee.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
That's all it says.

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
I think I only told this just the way you knew whether or not anything was to go into the file.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
Whether or not it had to do with Mr. Steven, is that right?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
No, no.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
What was it? Yes.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
Or was it? Yes. After what when it was this file?

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Anything's been changed to the first memorandum.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
It was 6K. It was 2K.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
There's no fault with anything else like I was playing public. I'm asking to put it in the same folder.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
What was the subject? It's my phone.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
The first memorandum to change to a conversation to Steven.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Anything after that?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
It's okay to come straight to Mr. Steven.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I'm a fitting same folder.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
That's what I was thinking the same as the fiscal.

16:35.000 --> 16:44.000
Now, the first memorandum is marked confidential.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
What is the confidential about it?

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
I don't think I can tell you that, Mr. Ross.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
When the boys did take me, that's me, the mark on memorandum confidential, I do.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
But I don't ask them why.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
What is the effect of marking the confidential?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Can you write a name for it?

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
Why? Because you want to give it to the Santa and that was all.

17:10.000 --> 17:18.000
Well, I know that the one that's December 9th,

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
from Mr. Cohn is all for the professor and is not marked confidential.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Do you serve that?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
That's the date.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
December 9th.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
That's the Mr. Caw.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Okay.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Sure, I have it.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Mr. Caw.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Oh, there's two on that date.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I see.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
There's a little shorter.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I have it here.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Now, that one is not marked confidential.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Is that right?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I think.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Okay.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
And similarly, the, what I call the number 5 one, which is from Frank Caw, the Senator

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
McCarty.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
It's not marked confidential.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
That's the second answer.

17:56.000 --> 18:02.000
You might have been in the second and longer one of those two on the 7th, 1953.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
But this one I have, is marked confidential.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
It is?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yes.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
So, the number 1, the 1st, is the 7th, 1953 marked confidential?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
No, they are not, as well.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Don't have a company, if I had you.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Good job, when it's not marked confidential and wrong, when it's marked confidential.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Well, I'm sorry.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I'm a printed one, and we try to be very careful.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
Amongst from Frank Caw, the Senator McCarty dated December 9th, 1953,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
as I have it in print before me, it's not marked confidential.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Yes, I guess, Mr. Caw.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Mr. Caw, Mr. Caw, Mr. Caw, Mr. Caw is not responsible.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
For the Mr. Caw, I don't know, for the Mr. Wells.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Oh, I suppose he has the original.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Mr. Wells has the exact copy of it.

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
He's now waiting from his home for Mr. Caw, I think that's rather unfair to the witness.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Oh, I've done my thing, I was missing.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Who, me, as I say, who, as I am.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
He's printed by us and read back to a member of Mr. Jason Spass.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
And I now understand that on the one date of December 9th from Frank Caw, the Senator McCarty,

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
the word confidential should appear.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Is that correct, Mr. Gibson?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
The length of Frank Caw keeps an empty copy.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
On my Caw, the Senator McCarty.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
The way it's confidential, I'm just wondering.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
But on the one from where he's home to Senator McCarty, there's not a fear.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
That's right.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
You may not know, but is there a significant difference between the two,

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
or is it the way in which you handle them, or is there a mark confidential or not?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
No, I don't know.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
I know a significant, in the world, confidential, appearing on the one from Frank Caw,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
the Senator McCarty, the day Dr. Oversey seconds being the first one.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
It's not to be up to me, Mr. Wells.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm sorry.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
It is not to be up to me.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
It's a big thing to me, Mr. Martin's confidential, I'm Martin's confidential.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I don't give it.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
No, directing your attention to the first one, dated October 3.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
What did you do with it after you typed it?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I waited for the first one, Mr. McCarty.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
How do you know that?

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, maybe I shouldn't have said that I did it to him,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
but normally, when Frank arrived at Caw,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
he said, no, I need to get to the first one, I typed it,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
and I did it to the center.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I leave it on the first, the first one, to think.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
I would have seen so, and then it will somewhere come back to you with a file.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
So we'll do the best to meet in file, sometimes to discuss.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
And will my smile on the file?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
That's what we'll put on the file, the word file.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
See, I write on it the way it says.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
No, the C writes that on it.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Oh, no, I'll tell it to you as soon as.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
The hand's the tuning.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
The hand, the tuning.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So you remember that he handed you this one?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I'll tell you that.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I've been on having any internal recollection,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
the sounds that actually physically hand him the tape.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Let's do that all the time.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
No, it's kind of our head, but it's because I'm not at all attacking it.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Now, when he handed that one to you,

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
did he suggest to you that you make a file for these memorandums?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Nope.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
So if somebody did that, you know, just put him away.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
I'm sorry.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Frank said, didn't tell me to take a file.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
He just said, style.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
It was just style.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
That's time.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Without any directives.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
That's time.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
And you decided to style a new file, is that right?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Yes, it's a new subject.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
This is the first memorandum we have on it.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
So it wouldn't be any way to create it for you, a new file?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Get a new forward.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
And you put it in a forward smart as you authenticate it.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Okay.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
Now, when the second one came along, the one that is November 6th,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
that may give exactly a request for this statement,

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
and request in Secretary Stevens as the first one, is that correct?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Yes.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
And I assume for a while, excuse me, just one moment please.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Who's that?

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
I just wanted to talk to Mr. Churchill for one minute, please.

22:06.000 --> 22:13.000
Mr. Churchill, for one minute please.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Yes.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Yes.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yes.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yes.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yes.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Yes.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yes.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yes.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Yes.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Yes.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Yes.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Yes.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Yes.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Yes.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Now, again, Mr. Sanders, you asked Mr. Cohen this case,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
that's part of the memorandum to you.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
You don't do anything but type it and put it in the file, is that right?

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
I'll keep it being shared at the point of that statement.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Well, that's where this is directed to the senator.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
So, no, but the memorandum has a file.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Can you actually want to see what's going in?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh, but I thought I was just a little stupid about that.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
So, this was meant to the senator also, even if directed to the file?

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
I would say so, although I couldn't absolutely be a prosecutor.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm done.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
He threw it straight out.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
But he put it in a round going back, it'll hand it to you for file.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Well, he is, because it has lots of things on it.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
So, he said, with the hand, he told me that, he said,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
we'll send him away.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yes.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
And having handed it to you, you understood some way you would have filed it.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Of course.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Yes.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
And the file was indicated to you by the word Steven's I take,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
even the first phone, is that right?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Yes.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
Now, I am aware of what's being used for.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
Third, my hand, there's also indicated by Mr. Cohen, is that right?

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
Sixth, I do you have that, I do not use numbers,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
because it will confuse you.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
The one of November 17, 1953.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Sixth, I remember, I had a file.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I remember I had a file.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I don't believe I could tell you how stupid it was

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
to come and miscapacitated.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
And it's called a told us that he did.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Hello.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
If he has told us, so is that correct?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Yes.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
It seems that he did.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Right.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
And that again has the word Steven's meeting with Steven's,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
and so you knew where to put that one, is that right?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yes.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
From that word.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
Now, notice the next one, which is December 9, 1953.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
That is the memorandum for Mr. Cohen to send him a copy.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Is that also dictated to you?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Yes.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
And it is?

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
You always say Mr. Walsh, I'm a tax of all of these with a case,

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
but you did hear me say that I can't say absolutely.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I understand.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Sometimes I may have seen you, little bit memorandum.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
No.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
You got to go to the semester?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I have to mean a stone.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Cut.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Thank you.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Thank you.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
If that's not around the wheel at being the 7th inning,

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
I can get you.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
He says the five ends and we can be.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
You have just heard the chairman declare a brief recess.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
The ABC television network is bringing you the complete hearings

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
into the McCarthy Army controversy.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
No.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
It's going.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
From the month indicated that this will be a five minute recess,

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
the normal practice in the afternoon for the past week or so,

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
has been that there will be a ten minute recess during the afternoon period.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
However, this is another perhaps move to expedite the hearings,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
get them going just a little bit faster.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
There's the scene around the witness table now.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
This is Mary Gisco, the personal secretary to Senator McCarthy,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
just about in the middle of her examination.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
She has testified in direct examination of the 11 memos,

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
which form much of the counterchart to the Army's chart,

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
and the McCarthy case in this particular instance.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Senator McCarthy, chat with his personal secretary.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Mr. Duff.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
All right.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
All right.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
Yes, come on.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Here's the general milling around in the caucus room here,

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
as the committee goes into a brief five minute recess,

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
in order to take a little bit of a seven-thinning stretch of the afternoon.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
The McCarthy has come from the committee table to put on the chat

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
for the secretary, Mrs. Mary Gisco, for a moment.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Mr. Dullianna, Mr. Cohen, there by the witnesses,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
and the stand, and there is the committee table itself.

26:54.000 --> 27:00.000
Everyone on their feet, very grateful for this short recess.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
The afternoon session opened with...

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Mr. Roy Cohen, back on the witness stand,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
and then he introduced the records,

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
as much as he could at the present time,

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
the records of the work done by Mr. G. David Shine,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
with prior June November the 3rd,

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
after he was notified he would be inductively army prior to the induction,

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
and then after his actual induction into the armed forces.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Here, Senator McClellan, the ranking Democratic member of this committee,

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
standing with Mr. Gunner back, which means that we may soon be able to have Senator McClellan

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
with a very brief interview by Mr. Gunner back.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
It means that they are just about all set.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Let's go to the caucus room where Gunner back is,

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
with Senator McClellan, the ranking Democratic member of this committee.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Mr. Gunner back in the Senate caucus room,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
and here is Senator John McClellan, the Democratic office of the market.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Senator, you said this morning that this hearing is a barricot,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
and Senator Leif would respect to one thing, is that a crossroads,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
in which, easily, President is going to be followed,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
or Senator McClellan, I suppose, is that right?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I think that's absolutely correct.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
Question of confidential secret documents.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
Dealing with the security involving the security of this country,

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
either the President is right, the President is confidential,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
and I say the President, I mean he is agency.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
The Executive Branch of the government, the FBI, either has a right,

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
the class of time is confidential, and keep him in confidence,

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
or he does not have that right.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
That is an issue that I think has to be settled,

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
because if he does have that right,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
then if he does have that right,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
the committee cannot even subpoena it.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
And if a committee cannot subpoena it,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
then of course, the session of them

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
or getting the documents by self-proport,

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
to open a child, would be a violation of that secret.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
Well, I'm not concerned about the issue other than this.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
We're going to have investigating committees in the future.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
And we are concerned about it to this extent.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
Yes, when you give a statement to the FBI,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
it becomes public property.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
The people of the Marrow should know it.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
It's the become public property, and anybody may get it who wants it.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
If not, then we've got to protect the security system we now have.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Well, so far, this hearing has been concerned,

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
no, we're not going to move on for that,

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
so that's also a way because the senator has said that he will not respect

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
the presidential directive.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
But you may not get off at this particular hearing,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
but the issue is there, and this administration should resolve it.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
It has a responsibility.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
The President of the United States and the Attorney General

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
have a strong, strong, and portion of posture in their country.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
If they're right, the people are inside of the annoyed,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
and the position they've taken.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
If they're wrong, the area inside of the annoyed has a committee.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
So what do you say that the President has spoken out clearly?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Do you feel that he has?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I think so, but maybe not if he hasn't,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
but if he has any duty to do so, I think.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
No, senator, one other matter that you didn't pay any particular attention

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
to this morning, the senator suggested,

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Senator McCarty, that is.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
But one of the reasons the Democrats came back to this committee

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
was that they had talked to Mr. Stevens,

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
and were, I suppose, an effect rallying for this case.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
Well, I think he found to be an heir about my having talked to Mr. Stevens

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
because Mr. Stevens was the way at that time.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I came back on the committee.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
On the 26th of January, my understanding as Mr. Stevens was over

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
and the board, just where I thought I was going to correct it.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I didn't check that in as remarks.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I may say this that I had talked to Mr. Adams,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
and before I would come back on this committee,

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
I so advise Senator McCarty and advise and insubstance

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
of the conversation Mr. Adams had had with me

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
and I refused to go back on the committee

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
until I had told him that because I didn't look up on this thing

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
with any plagiarism at all, and I told him I thought

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
that it would likely explode sometime.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Well, did the Democrats come back to serve on this committee

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
because they knew that Army McCarty's struggle was developing?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
I don't.
