WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I think it's under my heart.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
It's entirely rather bad.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
There's no disposition on my part to embarrass anybody.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
And if it's misdisco, won't it for 20 minutes?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
No, it's fine.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
No, I know it's inspected.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I sure got that threatening.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
You need a dramatic.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Man, I say, I'll keep up with what I'm doing.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
This is fire produced.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Man, I said, I'll keep up with what I'm doing.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
This is fire produced.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
She may want to comb her hair, but some time I don't know.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
But I may say that we have had a rule in the committee that

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
witnesses get unreasonable warning before their call.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
I'm sure the committee will be going through tough to run anytime.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
But I'd like to give her a chance to have sufficient notice.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
When do you want her to produce?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
This is 30 minutes.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
That's your suggestion, rather than diary.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I think she'll be...

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I'll care about it.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
That's a good suggestion.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I thought she would introduce a rule.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Maybe it hasn't notified us.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
No, you were a very minute notice.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I'll get her on the floor myself.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Out here if they can get ready.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I'll take a take.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I'll take a take.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I'll take a take.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I'll take a take.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I'll take a take.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I'll take a take.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I'll take a take.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Here's the bail.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
It's level down.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I'll take a take.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
May I be in order?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Now Mr. Cohn in the document that you prepared.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
You stated there.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I said I'd take a take.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I think Mr. Cohn is with me on that take.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Mr. Stevens, the secretary of the Army.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
The question that you discontinue your investigation of Fort Monmouth.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm glad to have made it in our force.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
That is correct, business.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I said that's tough.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Now you have it before you decide.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Sure.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
I want to read from your testimony page 4404 of the record.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
Now Mr. Cohn in the allegation is made and one of the committee may consider it very serious allegation.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
The allegation being by human senate imitators that on that occasion November 6th, Mr. Stevens

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
made some remarks and made some statement about justice, this thing from further investigation of Fort Monmouth.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm going out to the Navy and Air Force.

02:51.000 --> 03:01.000
I want you to call as nearly as you can, this subcommittee precisely, but the secretary of the Army said on that occasion was respectful at 70.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Mr. Cohn, yes.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm putting from you, Mr. Cohn.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Of course I can't give you the exact words, Mr. Jankin.

03:13.000 --> 03:29.000
The substance laws that Mr. Stevens felt if we would look at communist infiltration in the Navy and the Air Force for the wire and give the Army a rest, that would be welcome.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
But is your testimony?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes sir.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And further.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
Further prior was made to that suggestion, Mr. Cohn.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
The reply of the chairman was a number of points.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
I remember one or two of them were that first of all we could not start an investigation.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
We had no facts whining such an investigation at that time.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
It is required before you start investigating someplace you have to have a preliminary investigation.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
So lay the groundwork.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
And that takes weeks and sometimes months.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
The second of all we did not even have the information on which to predicate that preliminary investigation.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
And the senator did not think that was feasible.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Stephen, on to explain that our next investigation was always set anyway.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
And that was not of the Navy or Air Force, but involved communist infiltration in the post-class.

04:27.000 --> 04:36.000
The presence of current communist parties members in the fence plants.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
And then again, I might say that on the question of following that up, Mr. Jenkins.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
On the question of information which we were lacking,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
that Mr. Adams did make a comment that there was no problem about that.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
That he could get us the information.

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
And further, the substance of what he said was that he could help us get information on the Navy and Air Force.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
And I say that the conversation changed when the senator mentioned that our next investigation was of communist infiltration in defense plants.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
Because Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams immediately said that we were to investigate communist in defense plants.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
That that might involve the defense department itself, the defense department personnel.

05:26.000 --> 05:39.000
And that would be very helpful to Mr. Stevens because it would remove the army as the sole subject of the committees and vestigeants on communist infiltration in the military.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Is that correct? Yes.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Then Mr. Kohn, didn't you undertake to make his phrase?

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
So what's the secretary? The guy or acquiescent was that she spread your investigation.

05:54.000 --> 06:06.000
So he grew not only the army, only here in the Air Force of defense plants and the secretary said that that would just some extent take the heat off.

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
Well, I can give the army a raise. Not quite sir. I don't think he was exactly crossing to have the army continue along with the Navy and the Air Force.

06:14.000 --> 06:28.000
One of the objects of the investigation. As I recall, the substance of what he said was, couldn't we just go in the Navy and the Air Force for a while and leave the army alone?

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
Mr. Chairman, what gets to the examination of Mr. Scolair?

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
Because this time, he has no question. That's Ms. Kohn. It may be that I was the type of me to act that question.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, then we'll begin on the 10 minute rule.

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
Whereby, each member of the committee has 10 minutes and council goes five to 10 minutes.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
And the chair of Christine Fritz in conformities, are we?

07:03.000 --> 07:12.000
When did you first come with the government? I thought when was the government sent it amongst the...

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
Let it be that I got out of law school in November of 1947 by the way of law.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
In November 1947. Yes.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Well, is your first position with the government?

07:25.000 --> 07:38.000
My first position with the government was law clerk, cash, forest stat operator in the office of the United States District Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

07:39.000 --> 07:48.000
A question about who I was appointed by John F. H. McGoey, the United States Attorney, now federal judge in New York,

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
the man who was the prosecutor of the 11th Supreme Communists leaders before Judge McTheney.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
Will you consider the government that he or with public integrity?

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
No, we're after the civil service. I don't think I took a civil service examination.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I don't know what kind of patient is taken fit in me, sir.

08:10.000 --> 08:19.000
I had known Mr. McGoey, I had known it Chief Assistant, Mr. Seipal, I went down and see them and asked for the job.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
And I got it. How did you in New York?

08:23.000 --> 08:34.000
Yes, I was very possible, sir, that I did get recommendations from the Democratic, it would have been the Democratic Organization of New York City.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
You are in the legislature, Democrat? Yes, I am. I was. I am a Republican.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
When did you first come to Washington, BC?

08:44.000 --> 08:52.000
I first came to Washington, spend a month in the summer of 1952.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Who appointed you to come to Washington in 1952?

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
I was appointed to come to Washington by the Honorable James P. McGranery,

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
the well-being Attorney General of the United States, sir, if I might say yes.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Another Democrat was did a great job in fighting communist infiltration in this country.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
And you, McGranery, is a personal friend of the chairman, and while he neglects, he's not a Republican,

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
he does recognize him as a very fine and successful attorney general with an auditor of under-orship.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Let me ask you how you got set in position.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
Well, I got it in this way, sir. I was on the way to Europe for a vacation after the second stream coming to trial in New York.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
And the vote was about 10 minutes out of the harbor just falling down the harbor, and I was called for the telephone.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
I don't think I knew that there was telephone on both. I was told the Attorney General of the United States was on the phone.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
I thought it was a friend of mine playing some kind of a joke, it was not.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, I was the Attorney General of McGranery, and my head not met.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
Now, he telephone me and asked me, told me he knew about the work I had done up in New York for the Department of Justice,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
and asked me if I would come to Washington to work with him.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
That was in July of 1952.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
Your name has been brought to his attention. I presume that this is a crazy employer of yours.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Has he seen how getting the grant you learned about you?

10:16.000 --> 10:27.000
Yes, well, I had done, I had, well, not if I had, but I was the specialist on the prosecution of Communists 5 and 4 verses,

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
so the Department of Justice of New York, which is the largest Department of Justice office in the country.

10:32.000 --> 10:42.000
And after the Rosenberg case and the Remington case and the Communist trial, I suppose that Judge McGranery knew that I had been specializing in this type of work,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
and might have heard some things about me from my experience.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
Did you remain in the employment of the government all through the duration of the Democratic administration?

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
I did, sir, I remained in the employment of the government all through the duration of the Democratic administration.

10:59.000 --> 11:06.000
I resigned the day I was appointed Chief Counsel for this committee, which was subsequent to the election of President Heissner.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
Yes, sir, it was in January of 19th to be finished.

11:12.000 --> 11:25.000
You testified something about the executive order, the Truman order, and then you referred to a presidential order April 27, 1953, which would be an Eisenhower order.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Yes, sir. Were you with the government at the time of that Truman order?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Yes, sir.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
First, it's completely, you can, but that's the way.

11:38.000 --> 11:52.000
Well, sir, the best word I've heard is the Reviews and Describes of what the word blackout, that order plays a blackout on loyalty and security information being made available to congressional committees.

11:52.000 --> 12:00.000
And in other words, put a seal of secrecy on these loyalty and security files of government employees.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
That's my understanding of the order. I might be inaccurate to some extent.

12:05.000 --> 12:16.000
You testified that the order issued by President Eisenhower on April 27, 1953, but it gave a somewhat clear hand to investigation.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Give me a lot of respect.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay, I'm an Eisenhower lawyer. Relax, but you call the blackout Truman order.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
In order to answer that properly, I would want to study both orders so I can give you more or less of a distinction.

12:28.000 --> 12:39.000
And I do know that the Eisenhower order provided for the re-examination, I believe, of all loyalty cases, loyalty and security cases.

12:39.000 --> 12:54.000
I believe, sir, that the Eisenhower order provided that the loyalty boards, they made up not of people from the same department in which the employee worked and who might be his friends, must from the outside or from other departments or agencies.

12:54.000 --> 13:02.000
And there are various other things in there which I believe, sir, were designed to make easier the detection of communist and security risks.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
You say you were in the government at the time of the Truman order?

13:06.000 --> 13:17.000
I was, but was the relationship between the executive branch of government and the investigating arms of Congress prior to this Truman order?

13:17.000 --> 13:26.000
Was there another order that had been issued prior to that and was just a tightening up for a relaxation of a prior order or is just a new order?

13:26.000 --> 13:49.000
So, sir, I can only assume that I assume that since the law of the necessity for that order meant that until that order came about, that the Congress and the committee did have clear access to loyalty and security information on the part of communist and subversives in government and that this order will take away some of that information from the Congress.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Do you know the date of the Truman order?

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
I don't know the exact date.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Do you know the year?

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
48, I believe, sir. I'm not sure.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
1948.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I believe so, sir. And I could be wrong.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
That's a collection of that.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
You don't recall whether or not that order was initiated during the course of the committee investigation of the so-called HIST situation.

14:13.000 --> 14:22.000
I think it was, sir. I tied that in in my mind with the reference with the red herring ring, more concerning the other hits investigation.

14:22.000 --> 14:31.000
I might be sharing the remembrance of the censored at the time when the chairman acting chairman of that committee, but I was unsure whether there had been some previous order.

14:32.000 --> 14:45.000
So since 1948 down to date, there was some kind of presidential order which exists between the legislative investigative bench of government and executive branch.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Yes.

14:47.000 --> 14:57.000
We're talking about two telephone conversations Mr. Cohn and I've got it down at the time that you testified about one of them and not the other.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
In September 16th and one of them was in September 20th.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Yes, sir. Do you recall which one you testified about?

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Well, sir, I believe they were both meetings.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Wisp Mr. Saisons, but which shine was discussed?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Is your meeting?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yes, sir.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And I think you testified about the one on September 16th.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I think you're right.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
You did not testify about the one on September 20th.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
No.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
When you tell us what occurred at the meeting, first of all, where was the meeting held as the chairman of the committee?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Who was that?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
It was this way.

15:26.000 --> 15:38.000
It was downstairs on the in the first floor, where this committee was having a hearing on an executive session hearing on communist infiltration in the army, dealing with literature.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
I remember just looking up at the day, it's now that Senator Potter was present during part of this meeting.

15:43.000 --> 15:54.000
Because I remember that Senator Potter was discussing plans for the investigation of Korean war atrocities, which Senator Potter presided at and held hearings about during subsequent months.

15:54.000 --> 16:03.000
That meeting was held on September 21st, and I had a conversation with Mr. Stevens about Dave Shine, which words of certain things on that date.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Who else was president of the overhead of the conversation?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I don't think anybody, sir.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
You and Mr. Stevens.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
Yes, Mr. Stevens, as I recall, was sitting down at the end of the table waiting for the session to begin, and he called me off.

16:14.000 --> 16:23.000
He told me that he was looking forward to using Dave Shine in the army on the intelligence matters and communist matters.

16:23.000 --> 16:30.000
He felt that Dave would be a very fine, efficient, and that he would be able to use his work.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
He asked me about this same definition of communism, which Dave had written, so that he's been talking to some people in the army about Dave,

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
and that he would like a copy of this definition of communism.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I tried to get one down in the committee room. I don't think we had one.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
And I called up Dave and told him that Mr. Stevens wanted a copy of that definition.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
Dave, there upon mail the copy to Mr. Stevens mentioning in the letter that they're going to request for a side promise.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I'm sending you a copy of that definition.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Start with the conversation that took place on that occasion.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
Another occasion did you suggest to Mr. Stevens anything about a commission?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Or Dave and Shine?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
I did not.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Did you suggest anything to him about where he might be located?

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Or the duties that he might have if he were inducted into the army?

17:18.000 --> 17:18.000


17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
Is the only thing of any equipment, but forever, that took place in that conversation,

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
as a matter that you have already related to the needless and about this definition of communism that Shine had worked out?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Yes, Mr. Stevens said he was planning to use Dave in some capacity,

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
and even talking to some people over in the army, mentioned this definition that he did not have a copy of it all over yet heard about it,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and could I get a copy too?

17:41.000 --> 17:49.000
So, have any subsequent time that you ever follow through and try to get Mr. Stevens to use Mr. Shine in an intelligence capacity?

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
So, the next thing that happened, I believe Mr. Shine will try to go about it,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
was the discussion he had with Mr. Stevens on September 29.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
The next discussion I had with Mr. Stevens was October 2nd, and Mr. Stevens offered,

18:00.000 --> 18:07.000
when Mr. Stevens went into some detail about the general situation concerning youth of communist literature and things of that kind,

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
and stated that he had determined to use Dave's shine to help him in these matters.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
My time has expired, and I have expired.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm advised under my thought.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Rest the call, get the...

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
I know you've been asked twice if you have been asked,

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
he don't mean that you and I are members of that party of treason for 20 years, do you?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Sir?

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
I certainly don't think that I am a member of a party that stands for treason, so I agree with you.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
That's all I...

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I did have an explanation to make this.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
I, in fairness to Senator McCarthy about that, sir, I know of the...

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
what you refer, I know the speeches which he's made along those lines,

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
and I do say this, sir, that there are a lot of people within our great party,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
so I feel and...

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I agree with you.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I just want more of your agreement, sir.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Well, yes, I agree with you with this qualification, sir.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
I agree with you with the qualification that there have been people in this party of ours,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
both of them.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Yes, sir, in both, you are very right, sir.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
There have been people in both parties who I believe serve as a political party,

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
and who have covered up some innocent portrayed.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Are you in any of some still in there doing that?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I've got enough trouble.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm in the job here, and I've got to not get into...

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
A question of political philosophy.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Let me ask you, then, let's go on.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Let's have a different case between three documents here, if we may.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Yes, sir.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
Where is the document original in this case of chronological events by the Army?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yes, sir.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
You remember what was issued in...

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Not sure what was issued.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I don't know if it was issued and published.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Yes, sir.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
About that, sir, when the committee determined to investigate the charges,

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
and the countercharges that were made by the elite of St. August,

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
by your side of the case, short-lawed to the chronological documents of the case in France,

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
but the committee requested both sides the file charges and specifications.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Yes, sir.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
You recall that.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
I just...

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
In response to that request, the Army did file its so-called charges and specifications.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Yes, sir.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
Following that, a statement was submitted, and the tag-aloud it is, it appears, I have.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
But, for force to be a member, that's not allowed, as soon as it's left,

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
statement submitted, I request the temporary subcommittee to have got one before you.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Ah, by some means, we can get it right away.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Yes, you may.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I have it.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
You may want to request it.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
I have it right now.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
This is the memo draft.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
Ah, and I wanted to confirm the year that there's been a thing in here,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
and I'd love to know it as well.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yes, sir.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Ah, it's a draft.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
It's not dated.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
The one I have not dated.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Do you have the date?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Yes, April 20, 1953.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Stand on it, sir.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
The storm storm is April 20.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I don't know, sir.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Ah!

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Just a fact, I need to.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I suppose that's the date with file.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I'm not sure.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Ah, is the guest, the Senator, Paul E. Martin.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Room 248, Senate Office Building, Washington 25, DC.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Yes, Senator Martin.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Yes, sir.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Are you out of that document before you have it?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I do, sir.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I must have determined that this is done.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
I should like to ask whether these charges and the counter charges.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
The charges of the armament, which the men have been responsible for,

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
some of the committed charges, and also those committed by some of them,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
of cartoom and miscar.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
If they had one day, a part of the official record in the suit,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
then they're still.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Only in the society has been testified to the Senate in the current under oath.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
So how many charges made by the Army were included in the proceedings of regional states?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Well, I know the statement of April 13,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
but it's not in corporate as part of the testimony.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I'm not moving, Mr. Chaplin, I'm not being in corporate.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
I don't think the charges of the Parliament are working to be shared.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
In these statements of April 13, I mean, though, I mean charges,

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
and the charges, those were official documents that I just heard from the State.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
You hear a second?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
I'm not.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
You hear a second?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yes, sir.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
I mean, I'll give a document that I give it to the President and the Senate,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
and it'll obviously be placed.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
They ought to come at the very same time.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
I thought they'll have a fair in someone for one thing you know that happened,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and overall, in danger to them,

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
they're working straight by sub-partners and amendment,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and let them appear in the van, or the government,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
or the government being statement by the chairman of the committee.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Is there a one with that understanding?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
You know what I'm saying?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I have.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I know.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
And I'm thinking of one to make certain that a part of the hearing is set.

22:59.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, these are the most, first part of the document,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
that you had before you went to.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
What?

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
A notification starts since we returned the countercharges

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
by the file and now part of the record of its committee.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
I read the first paragraph.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
This statement is being submitted on behalf of Frank Carter.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
It's yet it is the record of the Senate's firm subcommittee on investigation.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Well, I come to Chief Counsel,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
and myself as chairman of the subcommittee.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Is it being submitted in accordance with the request of your temporary subcommittee?

23:43.000 --> 23:52.000
The copy I have appears to have been signed by Senator McCarthy,

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
by him personally, and then as chairman, is that correct?

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
Ah, it's the signature appears in memiagrapants or well, it won't be.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
I think the fact is that he did not personally affix the signature to it.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
I know.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I was a second curious to visit Montier,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
but in one else, I just want to ask you this question.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Yes, sir.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
Well, is that first paragraph of this document state the truth?

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Well, it is valid on your behalf.

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
Surely, do you acknowledge it then as your document as well as the other's identified?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Surely.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
All right.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm going to call my authority or testimony.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
I believe the day you first testified, what is the date of that on page 39.79.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
I shall read from that late 27th of April, you go ahead.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
Yes sir.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
All right, sir. Why don't you go ahead?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
All right, I'll read from it.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I'll read from the secretary of finance, sir.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Question by Mr. Jenkins.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Cohn.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It is alleged by you.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
And I'm getting down now to those specific allegations.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
But the second day of the army and his counsel use him top of me.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
And nothing's in that effort to help a work of the McCarthy Committee,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
particularly at Bush Monmouth.

25:21.000 --> 25:28.000
And now I ask you to tell the members of this committee when the first over-backed was committed in that respect.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
Not even a man where, Mr. Cohn.

25:32.000 --> 25:42.000
Yes sir, I don't believe Mr. Jenkins that we have characterized any of these acts of tax on Mr. Stevens or Mr. Adams who are the youth.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
Of the adjectives both him proper on both or anything else.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
He has set forth what the facts are.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
I will do that now, sir, at your direction.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
I wish to follow your attention as I before I proceed to interrogate you.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Yes sir.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
But I'll ask the first before I proceed.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
Do you now or do you not?

26:07.000 --> 26:19.000
Turn the actions that you charge from first five to against Mr. Stevens on Mr. Cohns on Mr. Adams as him proper.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
Sir, I believe that that is a matter for the Committee to judge what I try to do here, Senator McClellan.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Just tell you what happened.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
And you're not willing to say that you're terming him proper.

26:31.000 --> 26:39.000
Sir, I am not willing to characterize or first judgment upon sort of speak the act of the Secretary of the Army and the Adams.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Why?

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
He's swamming your language to you then and let you tell us what you intended for us, how you intended for us to enforce this.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
Sure, you're not willing to say that it's him proper.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
I feel so that that is a matter for this Committee to judge.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
Sir, Mr. McClellan, you've acknowledged this as your document.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
I want to know what you meant by it if it didn't mean him proper.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Now then, number one, the Second Power Draft.

27:03.000 --> 27:15.000
We are submitting here with, but we consider to be federalist data concerning the and our FOIA attention to it, a PIMP.

27:15.000 --> 27:25.000
By two armist civilians, Mr. Robert C. Stevens and Mr. John D. Adams, to discredit the investigating committee,

27:25.000 --> 27:33.000
and to force a distant tenure in civil hearings exposing commoners in jailfacions in by departments.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Yes, sir.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
Do you state now on the oath that our division is through or false?

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
The State's attempted to discredit the Committee and the Fourth Office. Does this continue our hearing?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
That's just... that's just...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
You state now on the oath that it's true.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Yes, sir.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
What these two, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams, did attempt to do that?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Yes, sir.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
Now, are you willing to say whether that is not for or in person?

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Sir, perhaps it's a difference of terminology, but it's important to me.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
I want... I would you characterize it then, if you want me to say it.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
That's not what I think that's about the mildest term I can do.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Well, that's just a sentence, and I don't... if I can avoid it, I don't want it...

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I don't want the character I just at all. I want to tell what happened.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
But, worth I remember having been spoken in what act committed,

28:17.000 --> 28:24.000
and then leave it to the Committee to judge just what the legal or mild effects of what act might be.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
Well, you know, if anyone who wasn't regard and attention to what's going on, those being impossible,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
I just can't be without otherwise as they should.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Well, there's the only thing that's this.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
At this point, I have to say, certainly try to get us to stop the investigation.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
There is no doubt in its birth about that.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
They are not the first people who will try to do that.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
Most agencies, which are being investigated, don't want to be investigated.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
And they want the investigating Committee to stop.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
And I have... but they tried to get us to stop the institute.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Actually, there is no doubt in the earth about that.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
I'm not a stop for the weed, but for the right here.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jiskler is now in the room, and I would like to...

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
From the side, I'd like to listen to Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Smith, and...

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
So, you have any questions?

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
I'm a specialist coming to the stand, but I've taken this opportunity to return to our studios across the country

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
to permit our stations to identify themselves.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
This is ABC Television Network.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Cut! Shut your free beverages!

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Norm Plattening, but never since.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Never since in Body Orcees.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
So, chase them and enjoy the non-satting cut.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Your tape line will host.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Your waistline won't show it.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
In my mind.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Is this very difficult?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Yes.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Is this without the US investigation center of the McCarthy?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I am.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Mrs. Jiskler, you know what?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm very well.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I'm a little confused with you this morning.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
I don't believe you're close enough yet, Mrs. Jiskler.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Could you put your chair in a little bit?

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
And you are stuck in the cage, just under the McCarthy?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I am.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
Mrs. Jiskler, do you think this is a station or a pharmacy?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Sure.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Now, your office is waiting.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
What is the office number?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
428.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
428.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Mrs. Jiskler.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Yes.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I will ask you to examine eight miles.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
Now, before you visit, we'll continue on 11.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Get us memory number.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Yes.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Is it getting out of the lead with October 7th?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Is the date of the first quarter, does it not?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Yes.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Where did you get those memory numbers?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
They just go together.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
When did you assemble them?

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
And put them in that file in the jacket in which they...

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
...and now contain them.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
They were sitting here, and they were found.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
Was it put in there as they were defeated and tied?

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
See how the first 20 days are overclocked to be upgraded?

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Yes.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
And now, who was it that stated, Mrs. Jiskler?

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
The unit file is having big stages that particular memory number.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I said it.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
You said it was not.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I said it was not.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
And it's written in the letter.

31:37.000 --> 31:44.000
You have known to speak in the pen of recollection of the document of October 2nd, the first one you've been up before.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
No.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Do you have any independent recollection of any of those documents?

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
I don't know how.
