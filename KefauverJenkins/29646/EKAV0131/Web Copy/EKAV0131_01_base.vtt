00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Well, it might be the full of our big UC.

00:04.000 --> 00:14.000
All I would say is that I thought that the nation's office sometimes adults.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
I don't know how long ago it was I would say month ago.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
A picture of Secretary Steven and private staff.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
That's what I told him in the jacket.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I was saying.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Now, if you want to ask me whether or not Donald Gawley was also in that picture for any of the staff, I don't know for him.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
The year I will have a picture you saw, and that's the shine of all that's just because it is half-wise.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
It ain't good picture, was it this picture of a blue bar watch?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Just as you presented it here.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I don't know for I know that I'll remember.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Here's what I remember, Senator McCaw.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
I remember Secretary Steven and Mr. Shine standing next to private staff, standing next to each other, looking at each other.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I cannot say it's right here.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Whether Donald Gawley or anyone else was in that picture or not, and I know you don't want me to undertake more than I can take.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I know that I'm a staff member.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
My memory is that I've included Steven and Shine.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
That is my memory, and I cannot know about that.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I can't tell that to.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I don't know.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
He said, he said, what's your memory?

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
My memory is Steven and Shine, and my memory is that I don't know whether it was somebody you don't know you're a memory.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I mean, if you don't know it was him, you don't have my memory.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
No memory of that to.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Whether there are somebody else in it or not, I don't know.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Senator Connell.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Why did you see the photograph when it was sent to Washington from...

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
No, I didn't.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I didn't see the photograph.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
He just blown up the picture.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I already told you.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
It's another fact senator.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm not even sure I was blown up the picture.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't know for the first time.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
You're under pressure.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Senator Jackson.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
Mr. Connell, upon Wednesday to the seat, the picture we've heard you hear for the third time.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
If I was to now send a second with you, I'm referring to the picture that you gave to Mr. Jenkins, the Compton.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
I did not feel as though I was forced to be sent up to him.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Well, I mean, you requested that he presented an evidence that you're not.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yes.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, I replied that at the request that Mr. I told Mr. not to send a judge if I can explain this.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I did not suggest that he presented another.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
Mr. Jenkins asked me if there was a picture of Secretary Steven from Mr. Shine.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I said that there was, and of course there is.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
He asked me if I could undertake to get that and finish that.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
I was very happy to comply with that request that I had one of these questions.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm familiar with it.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
No, there was a original idea for this picture came from Mr. Jenkins.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I wouldn't even want to say that.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
So we were talking about the events of November 6th and November 7th.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I was just wondering if you were going to be able to explain it.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
When the fact of the picture came up, I don't remember what the writer had to remain.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Let me get the picture in you.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
And I'm going to suggest you put it in.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I'll let Mr. Jenkins go for me.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Let's get the picture in I would like to review that if they're hearing.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I hear you, you should have to hear it.

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, what would be the idea of your conference with Mr. Jenkins from the subject of the picture was to show

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
that a picture had been taken with Mr. Shine, Robert Shine and the Secretary of the Army alone.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
No, sir.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I don't know.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
You don't think Mr. Jaina, you have me for my office.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
I never used the word alone because I could not.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
My recollection was and my recollection was given a picture of Ducatary Steven and Robert Shine.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
That's what my recollection was for.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
That's what my recollection gave.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
And I could not have called and then let eternal broadly with famous as a thought,

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
whether Colonel Ovalon or not because I did not know.

04:11.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, I don't think it was important yesterday when Mr. Steven testified under oath that he had no recollection about having a patient alone and Mr. Jenkins asked.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And it became very material to this person.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
And it became very material to the question of issue whether this picture was taken alone or with someone else.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
And when it was brought up here in a hearing to which you were present,

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
that the question was being, what's the Mr. Steven's that this,

04:46.000 --> 04:55.000
do you recall that a picture had been taken with Mr. Shine alone and the Secretary couldn't answer the question.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
And then the picture was handed over to all the Shorna too.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, not all you think.

05:01.000 --> 05:14.000
In the interest of keeping the record straight so that there could be a dispute that you should have called attention to the fact that this picture might not be complete.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
So I think I was planning to take advantage of my library thesis for a young refundee or close.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
I did not touch the word alone. I did not attach any significance to it then.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
I don't think well, even here, I would be quite questioning about a picture of Secretary Steven and Friday Shine.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
If I was known that there were other persons on that picture,

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
if other people were known as there were other persons on the picture,

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
or if there was no internal flag, there would be a photo. I would have been blessed to comply with that.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
Now, some of the darkening and the intensity of trust in you say it is important to keeping the record straight.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
I might say, I think it is, since you are asking me, supposedly unemported,

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
whether or not Colonel Bradley is standing to the side while it's taken.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
It's taken on us. That is not to mean it is done.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
But don't you think that Mr. Jenkins very rightfully asked the question.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
Do you, Al Mr. Stevens, did you have a picture taken along with Friday Shine?

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
That I just just finished my question because the picture that has been handed to Mr. Jenkins shows the two of them together.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
It was the law that not a fair person presented.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
What about him?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
I just think President of the House of Mr. Jenkins,

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
be right under the record from the bottom of the page 433.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm going to use the word, so that is 10 minutes.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
And I can't really do that if that happens.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And the second one is to give you a chance.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Now, who gave you the picture?

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
The man with a red dress and that's the place.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
The person who I have a lot of time to prepare for this,

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
is my point of order was that the question asked does not contain the word alone.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
A light letter on the word was used.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
I think it's kind of silly what the record says from the Jackson surgery.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
The question asked by the answer to having a page 433 and how the...

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, I just wanted to ask, I have a question.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
The other members of this committee are wetteness, there's no question.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
They aren't asked.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
The older man of the record does not deal with development.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
He doesn't recognize me with the 10 minutes and 3 seconds.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
And we're not having any way of meeting questions.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
When did you receive the picture that you arranged to be turned over to Mr. Jenkins?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Before I answer that, do you like an answer to the other question?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Which he did not give me an opportunity.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Well, I am your senator from the principal.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
The senator is featured in the point.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I can't recall what.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
The one-one or the other is the person who will not have any time to react.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It's time.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
What?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
What's wrong with this?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
This is the assistant.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Sure, right.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
This is the assistant.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
If you have a question, take it along with the question.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Just tell me if anything is hard, but...

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Because the assistant, right, is the 90s movement.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Then, the story is true.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
That is the way it is.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
All right.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
The right side is pointing to the left.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
It's got a first question.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You don't have to do that.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Didn't know it's first?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I didn't.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Didn't know it's first.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
That's what you do, man.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
What's going on?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I think it's right.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I have a new interviewer.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I'm out.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
I'm out.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm out.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I'm out.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm in a business.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I have questions to meet the answer.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
I say it is.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I have my answers.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
My answer.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
My answer.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm in a business.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I've been told I ask you for no reason.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
I don't think anything else is beyond that is.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
I'm down at the Maguire field and the circumstances which I just got.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I assume that was the purpose of Mr. Jenkins' interrogation.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
And for I don't think the doctor actually is necessarily involved.

10:03.000 --> 10:14.000
By general driving standing to the side or not, the doctor made that there are Mr. Stevens and Mr. Stein looking at himself and taking each other and that's that.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I thought the doctor asked me to go forward.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I've become one of the two of our speakers.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I've never knew this before.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I did not receive this.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Who received this?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I don't know.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I can find out.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, how did you know about it?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
How do I know about the picture I knew about it in this way?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Mr. Jenkins made the request.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I've made a number of other requests.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
I made a list which I think contained some 47...

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
No.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Excuse me, Kelly.

10:39.000 --> 10:47.000
I looked at some 40 seven items which is popled out among various members of the staff.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I would say, two or three of them.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Then they go and they try to get the material.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
If Mr. Jenkins then comes trying to the picture and somebody wants to take you.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Somebody in the office will take you.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
If the picture of Stein and Stevens are still the officers, Mr. Jenkins, the picture will be sent up to the office.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
If Mr. Jenkins hides it, not see it.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Is there anything that picked you up?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Well, how did you know who is there to cut out in the part of the picture?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't know.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Then anybody who cut out part of the picture.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, if you know whether the original negative seems to be off the floor,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
or if it's off the floor, I should not.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm sure we can find that out.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Who in here, who in here is staff with no?

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Thanks, Tom Agnol, Jim Gillianna Magnol.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
We'll be very glad to take those and equally on that.

11:32.000 --> 11:39.000
You know who sent it over to the full study department or the Los Angeles.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
I've never been in the part of the department of my life, nor was I in the case.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
No, otherwise I know one on it.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm sorry, I would take it being more helpful to you.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm sorry.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I just got into part of the picture here.

11:56.000 --> 12:06.000
That was a rain for the insurance.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
The statutory fee, he wanted to go down to Florida to extend better holidays.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Shine, what about Andy?

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Andy wanted us to take the...

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
And after, whether it was rather impossible to get out of the plane and he...

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
Then he didn't get back in and he said, I want your people to take this plane and go to Florida.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
And I'm going to get back to Washington some other way.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
And I have to admit that without him following me on that day,

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Mrs. Steven would have done anything in charge of her to try to make us happy.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Because of course, that was the day when he was trying to get us to stop the hearings,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
which was scheduled, but to begin on the following truth.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
Mrs. Secretary Steven's plane went to Dick and went from Dick on to Boston.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Who would have thought it was better to try to do this plane in Fort Dick?

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
I don't know, but I imagine that was the rain for my Secretary of State.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
We have been sent to the bus talking to private Shine,

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
that prior to commencing certain hearings in Boston,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
we desire to obtain from private Shine information,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
that the investigation which we were about to open to in Fort Dick,

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
for that reason we went down there to see him and we talked to him about that and back along.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm not sure if it was better to find the tolerate of that,

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
but we are in the end for the entire time,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
collecting the books up from the East Bank.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Not only was that, but it seems better to be the least of us,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
but the Secretary of State.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
The Army or the British committees,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
the Marines, the Conor, the Minors,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
in the Army and the fighters who have been no wait to make it with the stock of its committee,

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
for all of us.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
So it's definitely great to send it to us.

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
He has been one of the people primarily responsible for the gathering of information,

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
the interviewing of witnesses and the conducting of interrogation,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
of witnesses in connection with this day and Saturday.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
He was interrogating witnesses over a period of,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
oh I would say, eight or nine months.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Are you going to continue with our very work for the inquiry in the dark?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
He continues that with that work up until the very day that he was drafted.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
I might say, there was a day prior to the time that he was drafted,

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
when Bill's life, when both, when Senator McCawding,

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
Mr. Carmichael Oil, necessarily absent from the theme of the interrogation and the mission,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
I'm just going to sign a sign of the English-Frenchable Member of the stock,

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
who's servicing us, with so much attention that the stock did not function

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
without relying upon the information which only fired a child out of the book.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Senator, as much as I don't happen to see one of those of us at the indispensable

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
man's area about anybody in this earth, I think everything goes along.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
If not a single one of us is here, the time began,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
and I don't think the private sign is what is always in respect,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
like if I say it's worth, he served the committee for almost a year

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
without receiving any type of information.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
He did enable and successful jobs which resulted in the saving of millions of dollars

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
that attacked players of this country into the ruling out of Communists.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
I think I can back that up in the beginning to bother him,

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
so I'm going to ask you to show me that question.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
So I would say he was not in the dismantle,

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
I would say that he was a valuable staff member who did excellent work

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
and had a violation of the first information that the private sign might be drafted into the moment first.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
I was there around the summer early course, and he was there at the point.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
I believe the data is in touch with the November the third,

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
and how many months do it be between summer and November third?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Well, but frankly, you're fired.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
You want to start with August, you're not in the former national team, you're not pretty much.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
I think the starting was continued to investigate on behalf of the committee.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
And what's been a friend's shelter on November 17th,

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
even though it was a part of the Northern Area in the summer,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
about he was to be called in the military worker.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
He's been consulted recently as a last two days,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
and there's a great deal of information he has,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
which we need, and we've got things perfectly properly,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
but they talk about the right time.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I know that's okay, you know, you know,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
who is going to be the other gay-owned committee to replace this.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
That's a good time.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Without an unlawful audience, gay-owned committee to replace him is an unsafe control.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I think that after history, we can have a hard time getting anyone out to come down to nothing,

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
but let advisory and vitality of the committee to spread its opposition to the investigation

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
with subversive individual issues in the department of the honor.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Would you think that would be a reasonable step in the late,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I think it would be a ridiculous step to make it through.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
If you do think it's just a step in making it strategy from the last seven seasons,

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
as far as I'm sure, I think it is talking without a service for the final time.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
I think it's a function without a service to the chief camp of law.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
I, the only thing I hope is that the services devoted by the hope of them,

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
have done some little bit to help them what I think is the reason I'm down here,

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
the very important work of it, committee, and getting touted in it,

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
and security rich out of the vital law plans and defense industry

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
and installations of this nation.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
You are to be promoted without a objective of FOIL and SPIRS,

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
on my number, are you much more assumed that I remember this committee?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I don't remember the part of this, I don't remember the stock,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
it's not, oh, we've emerged in the start of the year after you're achieving that claim,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
but I have no data that's it.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
You think that the police does function without the service to the private sector?

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
I think the committee's there to function without the service to the private sector,

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
or any one member of the staff now, whether it's in function,

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
as successfully as I hope it has, that might be another question.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
I always, you say this to Mr. Chairman, not to be a game,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
to be a service to the private sector, but he was, no he wasn't.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
What's that?

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
I might be a security secretary, when he came down here originally,

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
he was asked about financial arrangements, and he said he considers a 12-witch to serve,

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
he just leaves without some service, and devoted a good deal of time and money

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
to doing what he believes was valuable work and rooting out,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
coming into an infiltrated and this country,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
and he did that work for nothing, so I don't, and when he had anyone,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't know yet, he's not here to give point to you,

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
but for any other American, or any foreign buyers that would offer their compensation

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
to not on a full-time basis by hour, there by no-lot there,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
that the Senate internal and internal security testimony,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
which I think is with doing, blended work, has,

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
from time to time, used people such as Dave Shines as unpaid self,

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
people who they could get as a whole, their services, one nothing,

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
I believe that you, as I said, are far better than now in the military service,

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Dr. Shines, the committee should continue to use the law

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
for the full-time exchange, gives knowledge and is information I can serve,

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
he's done, very well, first it all, no, I would say this senator to watch out,

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
I would say that particularly at the beginning stage, is whenever possible,

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
in order to function effectively and get the benefit of information,

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
which only he had, I say, well, I don't have that information.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
I suppose he along had that information because he along worked on certain matters

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
when he was with the sub-committee and he along was known that there was good

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
possibility of his being valued in the military service,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
well, I said, and if I can give you some examples of that,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
or it's not the time to point it out, so I can give you many examples,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
that I would like to ask your commentations to show to you this.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
My wife, I have had her of this show committee,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
it's a particular time and so I'm not afraid with the talk,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
but it does seem very confusing to me that a man should,

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
a man, or any person should be employed on the sub-committee without compensation,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
whose services were almost indispensable, they called it the,

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
were taken away from this fact, then it might seriously affect her,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
jeopardize the work with the committee.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Do you think that that person, the result of private sharing of the conduct,

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
how's it having seriously jeopardized the work of the committee?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I can't evaluate that there.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
I think the thing that's seriously jeopardized the work of the committee is the fact that we've been out of business

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
for too much when we have 130 cases against communists in law plants,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
we can't do, but I thought we were here on that point Mr. Kohn,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
I think the American people have reached the point where they want action,

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
whether it's in the department of the Army or on the part of any congressional committee.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
And these crucial times we have not been,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
any, should not have any time,

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
is to use on any extreme use of security,

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
everybody wants to root out and expose these subversive elements

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
in the department of the Army or any other agency of the federal government.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
And I think the American people are going to demand action for it,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
and my only fear is that they've done and that they've done fair,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
that's what I'm saying.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
So I think the committee worked out the decision and can root out the time in it,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
whether I'm here or I shine here or anybody else,

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
the public interest will be served, and I think that's where all interested is.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
The chair is just to run a little beyond 1230 this morning,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
so perhaps we can conclude with Mr. Kohn,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
we have Phil, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Welton, Mr. McCarty,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
you've heard, and it's time.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Well, I tell the time, the question has come up

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
of the 130 people who are in the plant that's being delayed,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
getting them out of the plant.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Why don't we try them over as a committee to stop a lot of the other committees

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
that could hand with?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Oh, I can think of a lot of reasons for that,

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
and first of all, first of all, we have to develop the case.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
Our state is familiar with some and our state was already to proceed with those matters.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
We will also have to go on those,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
and the committee will advise when Mr. Steven's been missed to Adam,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
try to put us out of business.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
The only reason we're asking is, have you ever advised the committee,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
or is anybody advised the committee about these 130 people?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Oh, certainly, sir.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
If I might be specific on that, Senator Simon,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
and then, the way Senator McCarty,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
or the way Senator said, if I wanted to see,

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
they would be interested.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I heard Senator McCarty telephone some members of the committee,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
and I believe that Senator McCarty wrote a formal letter

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
to the members of the committee calling the attention of the existence of these cases

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
to the committee and the fact that he hasn't stopped from exposing

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
will you make a copy of that for the right person?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm sure we will have a letter.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Thank you.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Now let me ask you a question, Chuck.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Some of the findings.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
I might miss them.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
You also received a copy.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I thank you, Senator.

23:04.000 --> 23:12.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask that a list of all the people involved

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
in this picture be furnished from the beginning.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
I'd do it for the time and want to let me into account.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
MSF, we made a blog, the record, and then followed.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
I really think we've had to recover everything.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
So, what's that picture to praise that information?

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
Sure, I would like to also ask that the original film be made up by the committee record.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Certainly, very grateful.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, there have been a good many references to Mr. Adams,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
his possibly being the fourth main.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
I've been looking at the picture, and I can't tell from this.

23:52.000 --> 23:59.000
From the shoulder and the hand and the hand, which is about all that's there,

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
whether it is Miss Adams, but the average man knows about his hand.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
I think we might fill that up and answer that out if he was the fourth man and next to Charles Rallett.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Charles, after you, the resolution to be asked for that, Mr. Adams,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
then the whole time.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
Well, I imagine that he would be willing to be put on the open order to give the committee the truth.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
I don't know the answer to the question.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Now, let me get the...

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
make this point about the picture.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
You saw a picture in New York.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
You can't remember whether or not they were born to...

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It's not going to make it to like...

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I don't remember.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I don't want to look in.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
I think your lack of memory is understandable.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
I doubt if I would remember whether it was born to...

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
I remember, let me put it this way if I may, with no report, my channel brought it.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
I remember the filthy people in in the wine room who were important to me.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
I remember Secretary Stevens and private chai standing there smiling at each other.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
But you were asked what my luck yourself, my sister's meeting, for thick, for thick.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Yes, I was there, but there are a lot of things to take.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
And you care, I remember what it was to all of the four of one of my three.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
I was there.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
I can...

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
I don't want to meet.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
However, at the result of the suggestion of Mr. Jenkins, or as a result of your suggestion,

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
which I will wait for, Mr. Chai.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Mr. Chai was a pain for Mr. Chai, right?

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
But I don't even know if the pain was a pain.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
You must have thought.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
But you didn't see it when it was down here.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
No, I don't.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
No, I don't believe it.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
You did not see it.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
No, I don't believe it.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I did.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
Then the picture was taken somewhere and if there were more than two people in it,

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
somebody cut the picture, that's correct.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Yes, and I can...

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Here's what I'm badly off the planet as I'm actually.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
I had for all I took the very fully-ponsibility to live.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
And I want to make that clear as between myself and Mr. Jenkins.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
What I had for all was a picture of Mr. Stevens and Chai.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
I had ever seen that Colonel Brazé was standing to the side.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
I didn't remember.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I'm glad I know now.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
I'm glad that I know it's going to be made far to the right.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I sure will be.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm working now on the control.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
We'll be made far to the right.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
We then have to the picture to be sent down and undoubtedly anyone on this day for an analyst or the man down on the road.

26:22.000 --> 26:35.000
When he was asked for the picture of Stevens and Chai, if he saw someone standing for the side or it was not Stevens and Chai,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
probably David, what we have?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Now you're going to...

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
You're going to...

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
You're going to...

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Somebody's going to let us know.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
We're moving in the staff to picture down for the photographing role.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
And whether or not they did or did not trust the people in the picture of...

26:49.000 --> 26:57.000
Now, on the question of the whether or not it matters, the whether or not Colonel Brazé was in the picture,

26:57.000 --> 27:07.000
you used the word, you didn't think it mattered when I owed it, but you weren't referring to Mrs. Stevens' problem of trying to remember whether he had it.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
I've not had a picture taken along with Mr. Chai.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
I had a...

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I had a...

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
The Stevens problem to be he couldn't recognize Private Chai in that picture.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And that's what I was talking about.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
I was talking about, I couldn't quite understand on this to Stevens and I recognized Private Chai.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
Now you mentioned the question of Mr. Chai and working for nothing.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
You don't, anyway, for those eyes people who can't afford to work for nothing, if they want to be.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
So I take my phone and check every month and...

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
I'm not criticizing anybody who doesn't work for nothing.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
On the other hand, I don't criticize somebody who can afford to work for nothing and who could be paid,

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
because I don't want to be paid, it's a privilege to do this kind of work and I will do it for nothing.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
So I won't criticize either party.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
I would like to...

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
I would like to record the showman at all the money that was asked for by the Chairman of the Committee,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
would go before by the Senate.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Now just one other question.

28:08.000 --> 28:18.000
You mentioned it back to two thought there would be difficultly in getting people to come down to work for the Committee for nothing or for salary.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
That's all you use.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Right.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
The question is, I said that statement and I made it advisable.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Advisively.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
I can give you a certain response to your question, but one example.

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
Frank Caw, who's sitting close to you there, was head of security for the FBI in New York.

28:35.000 --> 28:43.000
Frank Caw made the case against the first string leaders of the Communist Party, the National Committee of the Communist Party.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
Frank Caw had 200 FBI agents working under him.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
I'm one of those, not I didn't know Mr. Caw well, but I'm one of those who went to him.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
And asked him and thanked him to come down with this Committee as executive director.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
He refused.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
I had everybody I knew, worked on him to get him to come down.

29:01.000 --> 29:08.000
And if the result of his coming down here is the type of smear and the type of life to which he's been subjected.

29:08.000 --> 29:16.000
And this hearing in Father's report, I certainly think that any good American is going to think twice before sticking his neck out in that way.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Well now I'd like to ask you another question.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
This is the call of the business administration.

29:24.000 --> 29:35.000
And it's had a lot of fine businessmen come down here to work since the new administration went into effect.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
The record of the Mr. Stevens was known before he came down.

29:42.000 --> 29:53.000
How do you think a businessman based on his, his deterrence is going to be interrupted in taking jobs in the Pentagon or another government agency?

29:53.000 --> 30:04.000
Do you believe that the same problems would supply with respect to Mr. Caw and Mr. Shine from the standpoint of the dissolval of the watching and service in these great days?

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
Will also apply as a result of the problems that have come up from Mr. Stevens.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
There is one in many of this, since he took this job.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
There is one very important distinction from Senator Simonton.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
We did not make the charges, the smear charges against Mr. Stevens.

30:20.000 --> 30:27.000
He made them against hot and high until no responsibility.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
And not regard.

30:30.000 --> 30:43.000
Well, I would like to say that I don't remember Mr. Stevens accusing any of the principles on the other side of Blackmail or Pope.

30:43.000 --> 30:50.000
Mr. Simonton, I beg your pardon, we did excuse him or Pope, but the best of my knowledge, he did not accuse him of Blackmail.

30:50.000 --> 31:04.000
In any case, I do think it's a two-way street. It may be difficult to punish Mr. Caw and Mr. Shine, but it isn't so as so that it will be difficult to get businessmen to come down to watching them, just like in charge of process perceived.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
Senator Simonton, all I can say to you on that, sir, is we did not initiate the smear charges.

31:10.000 --> 31:23.000
They were initiated by Mr. Stevens and by Mr. Adam and not by I never made publicly or flagged any statement in derogations of Mr. Stevens.

31:23.000 --> 31:34.000
And I never made any statement which could cause him to feel at a charge of the made against him or that he should have any reason to regret having come down to watching.

31:34.000 --> 31:41.000
And I might say this, I'm sorry I haven't much time left and I actually quite think you've answered it very well.

31:41.000 --> 32:02.000
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to suggest that everybody connected with his picture, since his last Mr. Shine, well, I'll still have a percentage by Mr. Jenkins, the Directorate of the picture, the someone before the committee and so on the whole, and he was exactly what his connection with the picture if any was.

32:02.000 --> 32:13.000
Mr. Chairman, I have a few down in the evening, I will be done with the country, I have a very suggestive speech, chase the picture down, then his thoughts can get all the facts available as to his other interested.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Mr. Chairman, I'll send a comment.

32:16.000 --> 32:31.000
Mr. Chairman, I might say that we will be very glad to do that from our end and I'm assuming that the statement will do us some here, because we don't want any question about the authenticity and we don't want any question about the fact that that is secretary Stevens,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
standing and smiling at private time.
