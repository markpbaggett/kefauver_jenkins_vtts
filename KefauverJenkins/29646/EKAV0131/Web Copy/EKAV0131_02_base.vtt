00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
Mr. Collins, last two would like it understood that all my life is at the same table I am not your counsel.

00:22.000 --> 00:36.000
If not a statement that has been made in this hearing was which I am in more of a plea agreement that the world of all of life may be, I am sure you have a great ability and maybe I would be fortunate if I had you as my counsel.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
I have no counsel here. Roy Connesty is speaking for Roy Conn to give the right by our no counsel and I feel the need of none sir.

00:43.000 --> 00:56.000
You know I am content that it should appear for my that I am not your counsel. I might say you are not going to get any feedback from me Mr. Welles.

00:56.000 --> 01:12.000
With someone hold up the what I owe the big picture so that this witness can see it.

01:12.000 --> 01:29.000
Mr. Conn you have spoken of that picture as representing Mr. Stevens smiling at shine. Do you look at it now with me.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
I would say so. I may say that. We have been to welcome microphone things.

01:35.000 --> 01:46.000
What's wrong with it? ABC radio network and its affiliated stations have been bringing you for the last dollar and 25 minutes on the scene coverage of the McCarthy Army.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
Direct from the Senate office building in Washington. The committee is expected to recess in just a few minutes now.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Roy Conn may submit a counsel as on the staff.

01:56.000 --> 02:09.000
It will resume here to 30 this afternoon we suggest you stay tuned to your ABC station ABC radio will bring you will be prepared to bring you again on the scene coverage of the hearings.

02:09.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, he and that. The program came to you from the Senate office building in Washington. This is ABC radio network.

02:20.000 --> 02:33.000
The staff. ABC. A.M. and F.M. join us on.

02:33.000 --> 02:46.000
The investigation subcommittee in prior a in the army McCarthy controversy. This broadcast came to you from Washington in cooperation with the American broadcasting company.

02:46.000 --> 03:02.000
You are tuned to WNYC. You leave our cities own station. We now join our WNYC FM audience for the regularly scheduled.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
And we're meeting a viewer. The Army for public.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
All right.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
All right. Now we'll have to look for a basement type.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
Get out.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
All right.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm sure I've got a rule I'm going to go on here and I've been through the written

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
laws and the calories and the choice of the best.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I will go through the rules.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Now I'm going to depart the standard of my private space specifically.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I will treat you on all.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
And please remember I'm not starting with you.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
They have you to present the whole case and changing the self-indications now.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
But only you can justify.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Because the roughly is in these specifications between your own knowledge.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
And you cannot justify correctly and completely if you're in some religious knowledge,

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
but also, so we can not have a time to look at.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
The charges and the charges are the standard from the following just to have.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
The impotard means we're taking them to the first instance before,

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
try to find the rules and adopt it into the army to get him a commission.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
And secondly, after he was elected into the army,

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
impotard means we're taking the killings properly to repeat.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
It does substantially prevent.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Now what?

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
We have got ourselves then to the first part before I was done with the inducted into the army.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
And we need to fail for a thought in the problem of means we're employed by time and amount of time.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I thought that they would be curious.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
I think you've checked the body of your unit.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
In response, this committee will not be told that they will not let us tell us how it happened.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
That they will not be used to one after every means by him.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Which means you will not be able to possibly be more correct.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
But now we know all of the one who will be able to have the body of your own,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
we need you to reiterate.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And you have a chance to refresh your memory with your body.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
And to put it on the body of the world,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
why is it better to need you to be taking the self-debateing practice that would you rather?

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, thanks, Mr. Chairman, that I have to write a place for you on all of the contacts

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
with Mr. O. to its son out of the car, please.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Yes, but I'm just trying to get now all this thing.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm going to tell you that we can all be worthy of our hands.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
You're a victim of a human problem.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Which is amazing.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
To you as a secretary of the Army, try to determine, try to shine on them, definitely not into the Army.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
If I am the one who will try to win the power of the Army, we just best get it.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
When I ask you to go to the Army, I will tell you the only one who's going to try to do it.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
But I will say that it was a reason one.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
There was a reason one.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Now that you're not going to lie to me that I'm not going to lie.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
You promise.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Because if there are reasons, you know what they are.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
If there are, no one will be able to do that.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
But I have to leave one as my recollection of it, Mr. Chairman.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I've been going to time you are not going to go to the Army.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
You're going to get a second to win the power of the Army.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Not now, that's correct.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I will try to do the government part.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I'll try to shine on you.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
I'll have to go time you will get the power of the Army.

07:05.000 --> 07:12.000
Can you really specifically, the time and the means and glory come in the power,

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
which you consider to give power to give you that power of the Army?

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
What is good of this Michael, Mr. Chairman, and the person you are,

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
my heart still will go though.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
I came here and touched the power of the great one on all of you's matters.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
I'm acting my number, I'm ready for the very number of unphotos of the Army,

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
but the mobility of you, return the code to your amount of personal,

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
which I have been subjected to since I have put the peer here,

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
the fact that frankly it is that it can lead to some of the memories

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
of the social time and on for starters, and I have added some other things that I would have to do.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
We first, my memory, will be stuck to the personal that I've already given,

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
and I still, the life of anyone that I've known has not been really recognized.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
Would it be a real world for the Secretary and the committee if you were to take the time

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
to write the novel for the weakest hell that we thought as one particular time,

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
because even though it's called a weak time, you are to bring many attention

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
to the bottom of our history, so we should look at the people.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Some of all the influences we use, I know I'm not going to discuss this situation

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
but what not now from the conversation about how to try and make it to the bottom.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Some of the early, especially the world of the time,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
are trying to make it to the top of the top.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
A trying to get into the bottom, maybe you can use those roles,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
trying to make it to the bottom, and to stop the visions of the job.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You are not trying to do it.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
You can be thinking about what you are doing, but you are not trying to do it.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
You are trying to make it to the bottom.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
You are trying to make it to the bottom.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
You're liberating that part that's proud of you and that you're talking about,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
to the vision of India.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, how much time and much you really asked for, I take it as a reason.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
We have the testimony of all the villains that so far is the fact that my contact

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
was done in part faith in regard to the charm and how the very lives of the recast

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
are taught by the smith of the time.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I'm like that.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And my time is expired, but I can't put all of the two out after

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
we come an extension of the time.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Okay.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Then you're going to talk about the smell of the snake.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm not quite aware of the state that this conversation that plays between you,

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Mr. Cole and Mr. Carthage will be coming.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
You say you are unable to recall anything specifically that Mr. Carthage will say at one

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
minute and where the conversation will go.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
I'll fill this up in a mile, just kind of a tellin' me.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
You're all supposed to be back there, the engagement made or the conference arranged for

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
by you or by you.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And who is it?

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
It's Boris and so far I was kind of my party's back.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, you name them.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
You've got a lot of people on the back.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
I would have to check and find out how well you've been initiated there.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And I hope you can just find it out.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
And who came just Mr. Carthage from outside?

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
I used to think running the recall anything that Mr. Carthage made have said

10:41.000 --> 10:48.000
already, he said anything regarding this matter of Mr. Shine at that time.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
But Mr. Cole, this goes to you about this.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Come with that heart.

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
And Mr. Carthage, make known to you at that time that he had in the other business with you.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Did he talk to you about anything else at that time?

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Well, we had a discussion about first and the first instance about the forthcoming

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
forth mom of the investigation center.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
But then he may have been initiated normally as part of the conversation.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
That's possible.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
You do not know.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
At least for the thing, he's worth his trust to strive for the matter of Mr. Shine.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
That's right.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
All right.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
Now, I want to go back to where I can do the yesterday because of the latest time and

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
the cause of the interruptions.

11:37.000 --> 11:47.000
I asked you yesterday and pointed out that you did have the power to grant Mr. Shine a direct

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
commission.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I did.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
But that you did not do.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I did not do that before.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
All right.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
Now, the challenge begins to be is that you did many of these things or did a number of

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
things.

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
Find the influence that the many to stop the investigation at Fort Mom.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
And as a part of that job, are you suspect you ate that job?

12:17.000 --> 12:24.000
The difference of occasions when you have been the guest of Mr. Shine, are you

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
have had him as your guest and having your picture made with him?

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
And those things have been pointed out as circumstances that might tend to cooperate

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
with the charge that you were undertaking the use of the influence that you were using.

12:43.000 --> 12:53.000
In order to induce Mr. Nakati and his staff not to pursue the investigation further.

12:54.000 --> 13:03.000
And as I recall, you did the team a bit and Mr. Shine's father is a fight for the New

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
York.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I thought you always saw a thing in the dinner.

13:07.000 --> 13:15.000
A formal dinner, I believe, given an honor of they dischined by his father.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Is that correct?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I don't know who was an author about 100th dinner.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Well, don't you now know who that is given by his father?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I'm pretty sure it was.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Are you accepting an invitation to that dinner and good luck here?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Find him a cart in by the hand.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
And you also have invited Mr. Shine to come to your office for lunch.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Is that correct?

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
I don't recall about a match.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
Well, as charged as may as I've you did, you say you did it?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I might have.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I don't recall about having fun with him.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
But I was.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.000
Well, if you include Mr. Shine as your guest at the time that you arranged for, send him a

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
cart in your staff to have the privileges of your club in New York.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Oh, yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
That was Mr. Shine included in that invitation.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
He was.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
And maybe he himself.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
He does.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
And he gets to participate in your own battalion.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
That's all I did.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
That's all I did.

14:14.000 --> 14:23.000
Now, if you need explanation, Mr. Secretary, why you did all these things except these invitations

14:23.000 --> 14:33.000
and have these associations under those circumstances, if you were not trying to influence the committee

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
in some action, you have to act.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
I would like to highlight the charge of this yet these things are being produced in evidence,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
telling you to suspect you with that charge.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
And if you have any explanation for what your own explanation, I think now is the time

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
to give it.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
Although I have, I, the fact of the matter is very simple.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
But I, the real and co-operation with Senator Convictman and the committee of the Congress,

15:07.000 --> 15:17.000
and I feel that it's my duty and I'm hoping to co-operate to the limited amount of dollars.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
And what I was hoping to do from the very first time I heard the Senator McCarthy was in New York

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
just in any matter affecting the Army and that date was first time before, the first time I heard it.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
I did those things which I could do in line of co-operating with Senator McCarthy,

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
to staff and his committee to the end of the week and get on with the business.

15:42.000 --> 15:53.000
And for now already, you are not in according these favors in the nature of invitations to lunch

15:53.000 --> 16:03.000
and taking on the lunch and accepting and tying invitations from them for the purpose of trying to develop such a close association

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
that you might have some influence over them to stop the investigation then on the way.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
No, sir, all of it, not.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Now, you were asked this moment about this picture.

16:16.000 --> 16:26.000
May I inquire whether it is, if it is not the custom and the practice, the almost universal support of I have observed,

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
that wherever you go, as Secretary of the Army, do any post that says,

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
what is there someone to take pictures on your life?

16:38.000 --> 16:48.000
There is a thing unusual about the picture taken on all the occasions that develop the picture that is in front of us, not what I know of.

16:48.000 --> 16:56.000
If you give any instructions at that time, do any of the thoughtful with respect to who's picture you should take when well or how?

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
I don't recall any questions, but if any, how many pictures were taken that day?

17:02.000 --> 17:12.000
I don't know that, sir. Did you give any instructions after limiting the number or did you undertake to have a larger number made than on any other occasion?

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
I didn't do anything of that kind. I was ill-assured and getting off the ground, I'm on the way to Washington.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I was very limited number of men.

17:19.000 --> 17:27.000
Why was it that you had testified to a third at that time? And that is being your displeasure of Mr. Orkall.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
How do you tell us that he was angry? Why? What?

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
After they understood you come to that conclusion if he did not talk to you about it personally.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
Well, I think sometimes you can tell by the column that it can't be, sir.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Well, I think you have to know that, sir.

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
I think you can, sir, take a great teller when a person is to put out of my utter anguish, it's about us to tell us.

17:57.000 --> 18:06.000
I think that may be true, but in court, when you say that he was angry, what evidence of anger did you observe?

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
Can you define it, describe it, what did you do before you were thinking of angry? I was so that he spoke.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
He was? I was so that he spoke.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
So, sir, I had been there talking to him for four years, he's the talk, he said, what do you mean?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Yes, sir, that's a reflection of it.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.000
That's it. Then you also had information from others who were hurt his conversations and remarks about.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
That's right. Did you get that information at the time?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
More than it is.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Or as it been, subject ones are them that you got that information.

18:39.000 --> 18:48.000
I got most of it at the time, I thought, I had other information, but what does it say that a man's angry enough

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
necessarily can cause him not convincing?

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
A man or an angry person does something to indicate to these angry people.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm trying to determine why evidence, physical evidence of anger.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
Did you observe, on that occasion, aside from what may have been reported to you by your supporters,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
the importance of whoever had been told?

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
What you say, I was outside, I was inside the lava star, I started to mccollum.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Where you even know his angry, why you were in lava, did not I?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
When you got out of the lava star, what happened?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I just thought it became aware of the fact that he was very angry.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Just going on the phone.

19:24.000 --> 19:33.000
I wonder if he would have expected that he would have done it, but repeat the statements that he knows that my uncle could talk me at the moment.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
I will not be able to say that I was out of the lava star, but I was able to say that I was in a moment,

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
I am afraid it's very unusual that I make no one there, I have to draw a letter to see.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
After you give us any further testimony now, you may have met with a specter of the A.S.

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
Before that may be important in this thing, it shows, well, go ahead, let's go ahead.

19:58.000 --> 20:09.000
As you know, when back in the days, in the headquarters there, I was resumed the discussion in the time room that we've been in before when I was around the floor as a doctor.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
And when we got my room and things on, I know it was continued to be apparent to me that,

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
I only spoke about how to hold proceedings.

20:22.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, I very well have worked, I know the statement which I outlined a non-whitch shirt, we've had some discussion about whether or not it was going to apology or explanation.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
I have been a lot of times up to get down.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Can you hear it?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
You can't have had it.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
I took the take of the free this far.

20:52.000 --> 21:03.000
We've had General Lee Williams, Mr. Lucas and yourself for a direct and cross-examination statement and General Smith.

21:03.000 --> 21:13.000
Hello, everyone. This is my assistant, a guest himself to the Allgation and the Special Cations there before the committee.

21:14.000 --> 21:24.000
Those are the Allgation of the Unplugged Armed Forces for attempting to secure a confidential treatment for a private time.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
Now the Allgation is tomorrow, this is in the former day.

21:30.000 --> 21:38.000
Are you ready now, Mr. Secretary, no mind to get a summary of the individual?

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
What in your judgment has been the Deputy Chief?

21:42.000 --> 21:53.000
For a while, all the Majority must be here, may budget committee have on five and four little bits of this thing that has come right with the judgment of your judgment tomorrow.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
I will be delighted to hear your judgment.

21:57.000 --> 22:11.000
I have a question about whether or not the witness I should express myself on that.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Will the Allgation do the role?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
How are the Majority's role?

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
You're delighted to see all the conduct and not both parties with 20 million special occasions.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
I have a question about how to do the work that I'm on out here.

22:28.000 --> 22:35.000
While I have some conclusions about the one number I have in mind, you will hear about it.

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
The only thing I can say about it is that we all have a little bit of what I'm interested in.

22:42.000 --> 23:04.000
If you recognize that both parties have in this hearing or this proceeding anything happened, which changes my view in respect to the in power of the measure for a day to shine, then so I would say nothing has happened to change that point of view.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
I'll send a text.

23:09.000 --> 23:18.000
I'll be pursuing the question suggested by Senator Durkett tonight.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
I have a number of questions that I hope will.

23:22.000 --> 23:30.000
Maybe just some light on the basic issues in this conversation.

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
The pictures such as the chapter 79, I will 18 of the United States to call, dealing with country.

23:38.000 --> 23:52.000
The state and the fact that any country who took the five under oath and will win and conquer the special states or subscribe any material matter, but she does not believe to be true.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
The only of them is the majority of the country and the majority of the country.

23:57.000 --> 24:04.000
The country has otherwise been specially provided by the law to find out more than $2,000 for the citizens, not more than five years.

24:04.000 --> 24:13.000
There are a number of allegations of statements concerning you, Mr. Stevens and I have played on material in a conversation.

24:14.000 --> 24:29.000
Another role of statement, the allegations that have been made on the old part of it, if all of us respond to all for making them do repeat them on the role and you deny the role of the former committee, then some of us are the only of us.

24:29.000 --> 24:37.000
This is a role of serious matter and I know that you all consider equally as right for these questions.

24:38.000 --> 24:47.000
The paragraph is marked in the number of 26 of the Senator McCarty, Mr. Colin, Mr. Todd, who is particular.

24:47.000 --> 25:06.000
The state said on August 11, 1933, the University used the suggestion of the South Committee investigating the making and the award and the federal establishment of Congress in the arms of the United States.

25:07.000 --> 25:35.000
The question is that statement 244, next question, paragraph 28, if you refer to that, on the same level of particular states that on August 11, 17, 1953, you refused your request that the South Committee should investigate the Navy and the Air Force.

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
Does that statement true or false? He clearly false.

25:41.000 --> 25:52.000
Mr. White, you are wrong to call it in the working of polls for Saturday, March 13, as stating, and I false.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
This was with reference to the first Army report.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
I told you, here is an unspeakable statement.

26:02.000 --> 26:12.000
I will simply leave now for the Army because they have failed at either Blackmailing a camp.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
End of poll, on the working of poll.

26:16.000 --> 26:25.000
Does that allocation of Blackmail, true or false, completely false?

26:25.000 --> 26:36.000
It has been alleged in a memorandum from point of heart in Senator McCarthy on the 9th of December, 1963.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
That was later released to the press.

26:40.000 --> 26:55.000
I told even though they, the Army, said that these deserve the commission, they did not give it to him because of the lack of wing press.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
End of poll. I'm reading from the memorandum.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
Why don't we have to name a memorandum that was released to the press from a 9th?

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Seeing it, 9th of December, each of my own questions.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Sit you. I'm sorry I want to unpage this.

27:12.000 --> 27:19.000
It's the memorandum 9th of December from Spine Card and Senator McCarthy, which was released to the press.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
That's what they say.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
A case like this.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It's not a case.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
What's a case in the room?

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
Boy, I'm in trouble. What's a case like this?

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
A number of all the memorandums were released to the press by the committee and this was from a memorandum that was released from.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
What are the many memorandums that were released?

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
Mr. Chairman, could I say that I have not those figures in there?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
I think the great many of them available, am I right?

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
I think it would be helpful to all of them with an experience we could have.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
How could you have them there?

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
I have no figures in the size I am now holding up and if they cannot be defeated,

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
the moment of the committee model can be sharp.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
I thought it would be a convenience to have them in the room or I might be able to always have a life like this.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
I think it's your priority to remember this.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
Most of the people who went to the field were the pretty movements on that.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It was personally expressed.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
That's the whole time it's all over the world.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
I feel the opening is back to the time.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
I think it's all over the world.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
There's a lot of people around here.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
You're right.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
You're doing well.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I know you can call out.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
You want to work from the field?

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
I was on the field.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I am.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
No, may I?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I think Mr. Wider and Mr. T.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Do you have any other questions?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Let's open one.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
There's a permit.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I don't want to take it out of my time.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
No, may I go there now?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
There's a permit.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
There's a permit.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I'm a list of memorandum.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
That's an offer by Mr. Wider.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
I'm a list Neither of us have any questions.

29:20.000 --> 29:29.000
I have never personally texted against the memorandum.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
I know we can't give them any thank you today.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
But I have put a warning of this ceremony.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
I know what this is.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I know what this ceremony is for.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
I have done the best of the way.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
It's making a statement.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
We have been off the internet.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
But I should not say.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
We should be following the line.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
We should be restrictions to act.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
We have been hurt.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
I want to carry that to all of us.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
I'm just praying that he was not all being built.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
I'm not in the middle of it.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
He was making it available.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
He was completely stupid.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
And I just don't know what this is.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I don't need a fact with Mr. Wider.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
But he has been being built.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
That's all.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And we have kept it a little bit.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
We'll have to lay our heads right in the middle of it.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
We have to have the memorandum alive.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
We bring you a life question.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I remember I had a release to the press by Senator McCarthy.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
And I believe Mr. Cole and Mr. Car, the press conference,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
shortly after the original Army charges.

30:43.000 --> 30:52.000
And the my assistant has checked him to the best of his ability.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
So I haven't checked him against his printed copy to his hands.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I want to get back to this question again.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Recording now.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
The memorandum of knife of December.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
It has been a life, but there is a memo random from Frank Paul

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
to Senator McCarthy on the knife of December 1953.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
That and I quote, even though they,

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
of the Army, are putting him for the understanding that that's not in there.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Even though they meaning the Army,

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
said he deserved the commission.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
They did not give it to him because of the left wing press.

31:35.000 --> 31:42.000
And the full memorandum of knife of December 1953.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
Did you ever know it makes the statement?

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
That's part of the sign deserves a commission.

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
Did you ever hear anyone in the Army make that statement?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
No.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
There's more than the allegation through our fault.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Next question.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
It has been a last,

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
confirming the Army report.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
That and I quote,

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
this is right quote, it is not a report.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
It is John Adams version of a situation.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
There has been issued a twisted, distorted, unsuverted,

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
written by a man who has a special interest in the situation.

32:35.000 --> 32:42.000
And a quote from a statement by Senator McCarthy in US News and World Report

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
of March 12, 1954.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
As far as you know, Mr. Secretary,

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
is that statement true or false?

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
False?

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
Mr. Whitefall, come.

33:01.000 --> 33:10.000
Is quoted in US News and World Report on March 19, 1954 as stating,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
and I quote,

33:12.000 --> 33:21.000
no improper influence was ever exerted by me on anyone else on behalf of John.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Thank you.
