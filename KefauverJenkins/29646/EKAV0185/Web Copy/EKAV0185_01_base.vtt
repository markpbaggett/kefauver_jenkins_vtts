00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Chair would like to begin the week if he begins this session by welcoming our guest to

00:07.000 --> 00:14.840
the committee room and advising our guests of a standing rule of this committee, which

00:14.840 --> 00:20.600
is that there ought to be no manifestations of approval or participle of any audible

00:20.600 --> 00:24.520
time that any time during the court of these hearings.

00:24.520 --> 00:31.640
We are in part and carry you, we want to conduct them in an atmosphere of seriousness

00:31.640 --> 00:36.600
and while welcome here is our guest because this is public business.

00:36.600 --> 00:41.360
The officers and the plain clothesmen and the audience have a standing instruction from

00:41.360 --> 00:46.840
the committee to politely escort from the room immediately.

00:46.840 --> 00:51.040
Anybody who violates the conditions under which you ask for that admonition, we are

00:51.040 --> 00:52.040
happy to have you here.

00:52.040 --> 01:00.920
We will begin this morning by announcing that the chair has received his reply from the

01:00.920 --> 01:07.440
Attorney General to the letter which is written.

01:07.440 --> 01:16.320
Some time ago in connection with the so-called two and a quarter page document and in the

01:16.320 --> 01:19.960
interest of time I shall not read.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.400
My letter of may sentence in its entirety is a little long but asked to include it in

01:24.400 --> 01:30.560
the record as an exhibit appropriately marked and I will read the significant passage.

01:30.560 --> 01:36.600
The purpose is that the particular you will recall that this dealt with the two and a quarter

01:36.600 --> 01:42.880
page document by the way has been returned and I will ask if the passed on to send a

01:42.880 --> 01:50.320
McCarthy address to his property and in which, so phrasing my letter, I ask the Attorney

01:50.320 --> 01:56.200
General whether his admonition against publishing or releasing the contents of that document

01:56.200 --> 02:03.720
and total tell for all persons and all paragraphs and the significant part of my letter after

02:03.720 --> 02:08.960
reviewing my previous interrogatory of the Attorney General with this.

02:08.960 --> 02:15.960
Would it be possible for you to authorize or clear for you as an exhibit before a subcommittee

02:15.960 --> 02:21.160
any of the paragraphs or questions of the enclosed two and a quarter page document.

02:21.160 --> 02:28.860
It has occurred to some members of the subcommittees of the facts that the two and a quarter

02:28.860 --> 02:33.640
page document may contain the names of some of those still under investigation or being

02:33.640 --> 02:38.640
used as informants could be the basis on which you requested the contents be not developed.

02:38.640 --> 02:43.640
Yes, so perhaps such names could be deleted in other portions of the document release.

02:43.640 --> 02:49.040
Will you please write me your reaction to this request and if you feel it is against the

02:49.040 --> 02:53.960
best security interests of the United States to permit any person at all of the two and

02:53.960 --> 02:58.320
a quarter page document to be used as an exhibit before a subcommittee.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.520
I am sure it will be helpful to us if he will give you a specific reason for making such

03:03.520 --> 03:04.520
a determination.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.520
We, at first, do not want to make public anything which it is deemed that we enjoy you

03:08.520 --> 03:11.680
to our national interest of the flow.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.200
But in our church which was in the current hearings, on the other hand, we would like

03:15.200 --> 03:20.440
to have available for our consideration every fact and document which can be included

03:20.440 --> 03:24.240
in our records without doing violence through the central security consideration.

03:24.240 --> 03:30.720
We would appreciate it if it was as soon as possible and I talked about the enclosures.

03:30.720 --> 03:35.720
I have here the reply from the Attorney General, my dear son.

03:35.720 --> 03:42.280
In reply to your letter of May 10, 1954 for the reasons that forth in my letter of May 6,

03:42.280 --> 03:47.000
it is my opinion that it would not be in the public interest to release the two and one

03:47.000 --> 03:52.720
fourth page document which it would be a copy of a letter or should release any part

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
thereof.

03:53.720 --> 03:58.360
As I pointed out the document is not so scientific and that it is no such letter was written

03:58.360 --> 03:59.880
by Mr. Jerry A.

03:59.880 --> 04:05.880
The portions of this document which were taken verbatim from the 15-page interdepartmental

04:05.880 --> 04:13.240
FBI Memorandum dated January 26, 1961 by an unidentified person or classified post confidential

04:13.240 --> 04:14.720
and the court.

04:14.720 --> 04:20.480
By law this means they must not be disclosed in the best interest of the national security

04:20.480 --> 04:21.480
and the court.

04:21.480 --> 04:28.840
Yes, these post confidential post classification of FBI records in Memorandum is not respected,

04:28.840 --> 04:33.160
but serious and irreparable harm will be done to the FBI.

04:33.160 --> 04:40.240
This principle applies with people first to the release of portions of the FBI Memorandum

04:40.240 --> 04:45.200
which are contained in the two and a quarter page document as well as to the Memorandum

04:45.200 --> 04:46.200
as well.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.840
The department has a little consideration of the present time possible violations of the

04:50.840 --> 04:54.720
criminal law of the result of the referral of the transcript of the hearings to the

04:54.720 --> 04:56.720
Department of the Subcommissions.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.520
The two and a quarter page document is involved in the classification of this time, might

05:01.520 --> 05:06.520
affect it virtually or even defeat the proper prosecution of the sentence is involved in

05:06.520 --> 05:08.240
its preparation and dissemination.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.720
This consideration confirms my original opinion that it would not be in the public interest

05:13.720 --> 05:17.480
to be classified as a document or any part of it at the present time since Shirley

05:17.480 --> 05:22.540
Herbick Brown, Illinois, Virginia, Virginia, and I asked that my letter in full, the

05:52.540 --> 06:02.820
don't think this committee is bound by any letter from the Attorney General, he says

06:02.820 --> 06:13.380
now that this is the letter document of what you may to the quarter page document contained

06:13.380 --> 06:20.380
in the case of the case.

06:20.380 --> 06:27.380
The second floor page is from the 15 page Memorandum.

06:27.380 --> 06:31.900
I think this is the chairman and I have not really asked for a ruling upon this this

06:31.900 --> 06:34.900
morning because I think this is gone with the testimony.

06:34.900 --> 06:42.300
I do think the committee should have an executive session and read the two and a quarter

06:42.300 --> 06:46.300
page document now and deal with the fact that it is established as having been taken

06:46.300 --> 06:49.300
for a bit and from a monthly I report.

06:49.300 --> 06:56.300
The final page is with the chairman that has faced an individual at the federal court

06:56.300 --> 07:06.300
of Labor Cards, more than four such for a direction spy even up to the time the trial of

07:06.300 --> 07:09.300
a parent's letter right close to it.

07:09.300 --> 07:13.300
Well, the subject of any further I wish the chairman would call and return the 15th.

07:13.300 --> 07:20.300
The Supreme Court is a committee and the chairman wants for people that should be made public.

07:20.300 --> 07:26.300
I think for people that should be made public, I'm going to put on a stone.

07:26.300 --> 07:31.300
The chairman of the first discussion means the decadence to me means that we have a fair

07:31.300 --> 07:32.300
manner for you.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.300
The letter and the opportunity desire to do it.

07:36.300 --> 07:43.300
The future has agreed to the time of time and I believe that the conclusion of our hearing

07:43.300 --> 07:52.300
from the president to the comedian to the scene is that the discussion with Mr. Adams and

07:52.300 --> 07:57.300
the general area of a kind of order for the election was as the reason he comes from the

07:57.300 --> 08:03.300
difficulty of finding out from Mr. Adams and Mr. Adams finding out that himself is

08:03.300 --> 08:09.300
directly the relationship with certain information which began to discuss it in earlier

08:09.300 --> 08:10.300
years.

08:10.300 --> 08:16.300
So the chairman recognized all of what he had at this time for that purpose, from the time

08:16.300 --> 08:21.300
and the chair would also like to announce that there was just some sense to him that he

08:21.300 --> 08:23.300
has attempted to remove the defunct committee.

08:23.300 --> 08:28.300
A letter from the White House on that said this to be assumed they've been made available

08:28.300 --> 08:29.300
to the president.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.300
One more topic with the Roosevelt.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.300
From that over to you.

08:31.300 --> 08:36.300
And otherwise, I've just enough topic for the committee members that it shows immediately

08:36.300 --> 08:43.300
to the president and the agency, I would be just to say to the president to talk so I

08:43.300 --> 08:44.300
could zoom in.

08:44.300 --> 08:48.300
The president may be available to the president and we'll be shortly.

09:18.300 --> 09:22.300
The secretary is a letter to the secretary of defense from the president of the United

09:22.300 --> 09:23.300
States.

09:23.300 --> 09:28.300
I see Mr. Chairman in the last minute.

09:28.300 --> 09:34.300
I've seen this document for the first time.

09:34.300 --> 09:43.300
They are respectfully to the committee that I'm thinking about this over the weekend.

09:43.300 --> 09:50.300
I've heard of the only two reasons why Mr. Adams, a member of the executive branch,

09:50.300 --> 09:53.300
would bring this matter up voluntarily.

09:53.300 --> 09:57.300
He's named up voluntarily in these hearings.

09:57.300 --> 10:03.300
The court would be calisthency, which is because he has been legally trained and has eminent counsel.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.300
I would doubt.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.300
The second would be that for whatever reason it was.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.300
Perhaps he wanted support.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.300
More probably.

10:13.300 --> 10:20.300
Based on my exact strength executive department, he had worked it out that if the name came

10:20.300 --> 10:25.300
in, the information with respect to the meeting would be available.

10:25.300 --> 10:33.300
And as much as all this committee is trying to do, is find the truth.

10:33.300 --> 10:43.300
I was very glad to cooperate with what I thought were the desires of the administration and

10:43.300 --> 10:49.300
bringing this information into the hearing voluntarily to get the truth of that meeting, which

10:49.300 --> 10:56.300
apparently, based on this Adam being there, was called in order to discuss those situations

10:56.300 --> 11:02.300
and those matters which are such great interest to this committee in attempting to find the truth.

11:03.300 --> 11:08.300
Not having had an opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to read this directive from the court.

11:08.300 --> 11:16.300
It's letter from the first United States for any further comments on this matter.

11:16.300 --> 11:28.300
On my part, I'd appreciate the opportunity of reading the letter and perhaps discussing it further this afternoon.

11:28.300 --> 11:37.300
Mr. Chairman, just by unanimous consent, that the copy of the letter also be inserted in the hearing

11:37.300 --> 11:41.300
to first point and mark this inappropriate exhibit number.

11:41.300 --> 11:47.300
Mr. Chairman, I point out that there is about a 10-page memorandum from the Attorney General attached to the president's letter

11:47.300 --> 11:49.300
and it also should be inserted.

11:49.300 --> 11:55.300
Chair Greek, and just the end-hand document, John, is okay.

11:56.300 --> 12:02.300
I'm debit number 20, and the letter with the attached pages to memorandum.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.300
Dr. Sonny McCartney?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.300
Do you wish me to read that?

12:15.300 --> 12:18.300
Under each whole memorandum, it's a pretty long memorandum.

12:18.300 --> 12:22.300
I think there's no objection.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.300
We might as well read the address.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.300
Do you have the copy of the letter that the other is for?

12:28.300 --> 12:29.300
Yes, sir.

12:29.300 --> 12:33.300
And then the test right after that will put the memorandum.

12:33.300 --> 12:43.300
This is a letter signed to write the out-of-the-hour address to the honorable for Secretary of Defense Washington DC, Mr. Secretary.

12:43.300 --> 12:50.300
It has long been recognized that it is to Congress in achieving its legislative services

12:50.300 --> 12:57.300
for every executive department or agency month upon the request of a congressional committee.

12:57.300 --> 13:03.300
Expeditiously furnish information relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee,

13:03.300 --> 13:10.300
with certain historical exceptions, some of which are pointed out in the attached memorandum from the Attorney General.

13:10.300 --> 13:16.300
This administration has been and will continue to be diligent in following this principle.

13:17.300 --> 13:23.300
However, it is essential to the successful working of our system that the person that trusted with power

13:23.300 --> 13:28.300
can any one of the three great branches of government shall not encroach upon the authority

13:28.300 --> 13:31.300
and fight it to the others.

13:31.300 --> 13:37.300
The ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the executive branch rests with the president.

13:37.300 --> 13:45.300
Within this constitutional framework, each branch should cooperate fully with each other for the common good.

13:45.300 --> 13:52.300
However, throughout our history, the president has whittled information whenever he found that what was thought was confidential

13:52.300 --> 14:01.300
or his disclosure would be incompatible with the public interest for jeopardized the safety of the nation.

14:01.300 --> 14:08.300
Because it is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the executive branch be in a position

14:08.300 --> 14:13.300
to be completely canvas in advising with each other on official matters,

14:13.300 --> 14:18.300
and because it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications

14:18.300 --> 14:23.300
or any document or reproductions concerning such advice be disclosed,

14:23.300 --> 14:32.300
you will instruct employees of your department that in all of their appearances before the federal committee of the Senate Committee on Government Operations,

14:32.300 --> 14:39.300
regarding the inquiry now before it, they are not too testify to any such conversations or communications

14:39.300 --> 14:43.300
or to produce any such document or reproductions.

14:43.300 --> 14:49.300
This principle must be maintained regardless of who would benefit by such disclosures.

14:49.300 --> 14:57.300
I direct this action, so as to maintain the proper separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of the government,

14:57.300 --> 15:01.300
in accordance with my responsibilities and duties under the Constitution.

15:01.300 --> 15:08.300
This separation is vital to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power by any branch of the government.

15:08.300 --> 15:16.300
By this action, I am not in any way restricting the testimony of such witnesses as to what occurred regarding any matter

15:16.300 --> 15:23.300
where the communication was directly between any of the principles in the controversy within the executive branch on the one hand

15:23.300 --> 15:27.300
and the member of the subcommittee or its staff on the other.

15:27.300 --> 15:38.300
Stimsterily, Dwight D. Eisenhower, to this letter, sir, is attached a 10-page memorandum from the Attorney General to the president.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.300
Thank you.

15:39.300 --> 15:45.300
And, of course, none of us has had an opportunity to read these memorandums, which is rather lengthy,

15:45.300 --> 15:52.300
and they could look at it and share notes just to begin with the line of precedence starting March 1792

15:52.300 --> 15:56.300
under the administration of President Washington.

15:56.300 --> 16:04.300
Include there's great many references down to history, including several under the administration of President Roosevelt,

16:04.300 --> 16:08.300
and ten cases under the administration of President Trump.

16:08.300 --> 16:18.300
And the chair believes, along with Senator Simon-Tonley, would want to have a little time to look over this memorandum and attach the gibbet before trying to make any quick snap judgments.

16:18.300 --> 16:24.300
The writer and eight Mr. Chairman, and the letter is dated May 17, 1954, which is today.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.300
Yes.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.300
No, two, one, three.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.300
You may have my documents in survey.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.300
If you try to, he will...

16:31.300 --> 16:39.300
Chair will then proceed with the ordinary ten-minute rule, and start with Mr. Jenkins, if you have further questions, Mr. S.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.300
Chairman, I have no further questions.

16:42.300 --> 16:48.300
Chair has one or two that he will ask at this time, may have some little later.

16:48.300 --> 16:55.300
You will recall, Mr. Adams, because you were in the room during this entire hearing,

16:55.300 --> 17:05.300
that a number of questions were asked Secretary Steve about a telephone call that he had with you, and you had with him,

17:05.300 --> 17:10.300
involving if the chair recalls correctly, two calls the same day.

17:10.300 --> 17:17.300
At this time, you were at the New York, or New Jersey, under the line, and Secretary Steven was here,

17:17.300 --> 17:24.300
and involving the status of General Lawman's command.

17:24.300 --> 17:32.300
And the Secretary at that time suggested that he was asking you, the chair has ever been asked a question. Do you point it forward?

17:32.300 --> 17:34.300
I have a private question, Mr. Chair.

17:34.300 --> 17:40.300
While the chair is asking you, what is the question, or is he asking you to interrupt him, what is the deal with this question?

17:40.300 --> 17:43.300
I am not going to chair the pose of the previous movement, yes.

17:43.300 --> 17:49.300
The chair is the pose of a temporary, and he is under the line to continue with his question, and during your time in a period,

17:49.300 --> 17:53.300
you may get back to that business, or some of the time in the neighborhood, and nobody has the question now.

17:54.300 --> 17:57.300
I was talking about Mr. Chair, I would like to ask the chair a question here.

17:57.300 --> 18:04.300
Chair is really, we see he wouldn't interrupt him in the middle of a question, and he is asking the what?

18:04.300 --> 18:09.300
When the chair is asking the question, would the chair's position direct the question, and would like to continue with that,

18:09.300 --> 18:11.300
and interrupt him, like you object to the question.

18:11.300 --> 18:15.300
When the chair is asking the question, I would like to ask the chair, and I would like to ask the chair,

18:15.300 --> 18:17.300
and I would like to have an appropriate time, Chair, recognize it.

18:18.300 --> 18:28.300
Before the interruption, will you read the question as far as I have got the case before?

18:29.300 --> 18:30.300
Thank you.

18:43.300 --> 18:48.300
Well, we'll recall Mr. Adam, since you were in the room during this entire hearing,

18:48.300 --> 18:52.300
that a number of questions were asked by Secretary Steven about a telephone call,

18:52.300 --> 18:57.300
that he had with you and you had the panel involving, if the chair recalls correctly,

18:57.300 --> 19:01.300
to call the same date, at which time you were in New York or New Jersey,

19:01.300 --> 19:06.300
at the New York or New Jersey, at the end of the land, and Secretary Steven was here,

19:06.300 --> 19:11.300
and involving the status of General Lawman's command, Mr. Adam's, I do serve,

19:11.300 --> 19:15.300
Central Month, is Secretary at that time suggesting?

19:16.300 --> 19:22.300
Well, we were unable to recall phone conversations in the ESC about,

19:22.300 --> 19:26.300
could you reconsider, we could picture it as deeply as possible,

19:26.300 --> 19:32.300
and make sure first of all of the original calls, I think, came from the Secretary to you.

19:32.300 --> 19:39.300
My recollection, sir, is that, on the afternoon of November 24th,

19:39.300 --> 19:44.300
I'm not sure whether it was the 24th, but the call around two different days,

19:44.300 --> 19:48.300
I was in my hotel room in the Commodore Hotel at the end of the day,

19:48.300 --> 19:55.300
and I had telephoned the Secretary for the purpose of reporting to him the occurrences of today,

19:55.300 --> 19:59.300
and during the course of the conversation he states to me,

19:59.300 --> 20:03.300
that a matter has come to his attention, which is dear to you,

20:03.300 --> 20:12.300
and that said, if it were true, it might be ground for him to have to leave General Lawman of this command.

20:12.300 --> 20:19.300
He did not detail it, but he pointed out to me that it was not him's turn,

20:19.300 --> 20:25.300
was the fact, and it would not relate us to the fact that General Lawman has been cooperated

20:25.300 --> 20:30.300
with the Secretary of the Immacate and this committee.

20:30.300 --> 20:36.300
He asked me to see if I could find the time to see General McCarthy and Francis out through,

20:36.300 --> 20:40.300
and I could make sure General McCarthy understands,

20:40.300 --> 20:44.300
and that gives the move to be necessary.

20:44.300 --> 20:49.300
That is, if the allegation is true, to be true, and if he found the necessary to take the act,

20:49.300 --> 20:56.300
that Senator McCarthy would understand, that his action was based on the fact that,

20:56.300 --> 21:05.300
that on facts is different from the fact that General Lawman had been cooperating with the committee.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.300
That is about the substance of the first conversation.

21:08.300 --> 21:15.300
He is very summary to say that what the Secretary had asked you to do was to discuss with the Senator the possibility

21:15.300 --> 21:22.300
that the threat, and a lot of my people moved in to determine the Secretary's reaction by the threat,

21:22.300 --> 21:24.300
that was the nature of the first call.

21:24.300 --> 21:29.300
That is correct. Now we will go to this for the second call, which I think are originated with you to the Secretary.

21:29.300 --> 21:34.300
Yes, sir. I might describe to you the intervening event, because I recall very good.

21:34.300 --> 21:38.300
Senator McCarthy made a radio broadcast, you tell me in broadcast that night,

21:38.300 --> 21:43.300
and I saw him after the broadcast, and I saw Mr. Com also.

21:43.300 --> 21:49.300
I don't recall that I mentioned this at that time, but I very well may have.

21:49.300 --> 21:52.300
I saw them the following morning.

21:52.300 --> 21:56.300
I saw Mr. Com before I saw Senator McCarthy.

21:56.300 --> 22:00.300
If I mention them as Mr. Com before I mention it, Mr. Com.

22:00.300 --> 22:06.300
The fact that the Secretary was thinking of radio, then a lot of them.

22:06.300 --> 22:11.300
I will point it out to him, that's a Secretary to call me, and he was disturbed about allegations,

22:11.300 --> 22:16.300
which is about his attention to that, mean, talk, Senator McCarthy.

22:16.300 --> 22:22.300
Mr. Com, to get to the violation of talk, Senator McCarthy about his first,

22:22.300 --> 22:28.300
which I did not do sometimes within the next half day.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.300
I talked, both in the next few hours.

22:31.300 --> 22:35.300
I thought that matter of the time, I saw Mr. C.

22:35.300 --> 22:42.300
that said, had he the allegations, and that he might find it necessary to be the officer,

22:42.300 --> 22:47.300
and that he had asked me to tell him about it, and to assure him that his decision

22:47.300 --> 22:55.300
released became necessary, so it was not me, because the fact that the officer had colloquially

22:55.300 --> 23:05.300
committed my recollection of our conversation here, that Senator McCarthy was a whistledist,

23:05.300 --> 23:11.300
a well-welded, well-welded, long-smitted, but in any case, that it's a Secretary's promise

23:11.300 --> 23:14.300
necessary to do that, he would understand.

23:14.300 --> 23:21.300
Later on in the day, we talked about the matters that together as lunch, I think, Senator McCarthy

23:21.300 --> 23:28.300
had been home, and at that time Senator McCarthy indicated from the looked up, indicated to me

23:28.300 --> 23:30.300
that he hoped that if Mr. C.

23:30.300 --> 23:30.300


23:30.300 --> 23:30.300


23:30.300 --> 23:31.300
C.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.300
C.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.300
C.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.300
C.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.300
C.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.300
C.

23:36.300 --> 23:37.300
C.

23:37.300 --> 23:37.300


23:37.300 --> 23:38.300
C.

23:38.300 --> 23:39.300
C.

23:39.300 --> 23:39.300


23:39.300 --> 23:40.300
C.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.300
C.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.300
C.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.300
C.

23:43.300 --> 23:43.300


23:43.300 --> 23:44.300
C.

23:44.300 --> 23:45.300
C.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.300
C.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.300
C.

23:47.300 --> 23:47.300


23:47.300 --> 23:48.300
C.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.300
C.

23:49.300 --> 23:49.300


23:49.300 --> 23:50.300
C.

23:50.300 --> 23:51.300
C.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.300
C.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.300
C.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.300
C.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.300
C.

23:55.300 --> 23:55.300


23:55.300 --> 23:57.300
appreciates the general law, and it has been friendly with the committee.

23:57.300 --> 24:06.300
Later in the day, in the middle of the afternoon, I was back in Mr. C.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.300
C.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.300
C.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.300
C.

24:09.300 --> 24:10.300
C.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.300
C.

24:11.300 --> 24:12.300
C.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.300
C.

24:13.300 --> 24:14.300
C.

24:14.300 --> 24:15.300
C.

24:15.300 --> 24:19.300
We cannot play anything, he might be forced into the position where he would have to make comment about it,

24:19.300 --> 24:25.780
and that he had asked for a whole ‑‑ that if, if we're necessary for the Secretary

24:25.780 --> 24:30.980
to do this, he could see further, until about the first of the year, by which time, probably,

24:30.980 --> 24:39.320
the investigation effort might have been over for five or six weeks or so, and that

24:39.320 --> 24:42.320
there will not be respectillation in the press.

24:42.320 --> 24:46.320
Now, recollection is, as Mr. Stevens stated, something to be effective.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.320
He couldn't comment.

24:48.320 --> 24:55.320
It might be that these things would be proved, and that they would be a serious nature,

24:55.320 --> 24:57.320
and that he would have to move.

24:57.320 --> 25:07.320
I, of course, did not relate that statement to Senator McCarthy, but the conversation was more or less

25:07.320 --> 25:08.320
up in the air.

25:08.320 --> 25:14.320
I think Senator McCarthy was left with the impression that I had advised Mr. Stevens of

25:14.320 --> 25:15.320
his reluctance to move.

25:15.320 --> 25:20.320
I think Senator McCarthy was left with the impression that I had advised Mr. Stevens of his

25:20.320 --> 25:21.320
reluctance to move.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.320
I'm very good conversation as I remember.

25:24.320 --> 25:29.320
You say Senator McCarthy and Mr. Cohn both heard your head of the conversation.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.320
They were in the room, sir.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.320
The room is not large.

25:33.320 --> 25:37.320
Until there were other things going on in the room, but there is no reason why they

25:37.320 --> 25:38.320
shouldn't have overheard all of it.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.320
I said I'd made no effort to confuse it.

25:40.320 --> 25:44.320
They knew you were calling Secretary Stevens at that time, and I met him.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.320
Yes, sir.

25:45.320 --> 25:52.320
And as a matter of fact, General Lawton was not running with, but most of

25:52.320 --> 25:53.320
he was not.

25:53.320 --> 25:58.320
And I believe there's still some men that's just one who are in law.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.320
I'll pass you into another topic.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.320
Do you want to ask me, or don't see the senator, Senator?

26:03.320 --> 26:06.320
Now, do you have a project or another topic?

26:06.320 --> 26:12.320
Do you know of your own personal knowledge, Mr. Adams, whether it's in fact, prior to

26:12.320 --> 26:19.320
time, we see you structure as little secrets at any time to which you would have been

26:19.320 --> 26:22.320
touched as they filled you in unanimous state armor.

26:22.320 --> 26:27.320
From my own personal knowledge, sir, I do not.

26:27.320 --> 26:32.320
I ask you this question that is counsel for the Army.

26:32.320 --> 26:35.320
In the event it develops.

26:35.320 --> 26:41.320
In checking the investigation, checking the Inspector General's report, you will study the

26:41.320 --> 26:42.320
facts.

26:42.320 --> 26:48.320
In the event it develops as deep private, and as a matter of fact, we see structural

26:48.320 --> 26:52.320
treatment as a member of the United States Army, which he was not in fact.

26:53.320 --> 26:57.320
Who is responsible for that fact?

26:57.320 --> 27:04.320
The Army officers who gave him the preferential treatment for the members of the committee staff

27:04.320 --> 27:06.320
have asked for it.

27:06.320 --> 27:10.320
Sir, you're asking me a question, and it's very difficult to answer.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.320
Sir, I'm just right down here at Ali, but you're the comforter of the Army.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.320
And you have to advise somebody on that.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.320
This is the one question with the two of the men in the debate.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.320
Now you're talking my line of truth.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.320
And now the question is ready again for you to show it.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.320
Do you eat the first one?

27:32.320 --> 27:37.320
In the event it develops through checking the investigation, checking the Inspector General's

27:37.320 --> 27:39.320
report, through a study of the facts.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.320
In the event that it develops as deep private, and the fact it develops as deep private,

27:41.320 --> 27:43.320
and the fact it develops as deep private, and the fact it develops as deep private,

27:43.320 --> 27:47.320
and the fact it receives preferential treatment as a member of the United States Army,

27:47.320 --> 27:51.320
to which he was not entitled, to whom it would be responsible for that fact.

27:51.320 --> 27:56.320
The Army officers who gave him the preferential treatment for the members of the committee staff

27:56.320 --> 27:58.320
have asked for it.

27:58.320 --> 28:05.320
Sir, I think the third answer is that the Army is responsible for it, ministering the Army.

28:05.320 --> 28:10.320
The ultimate responsibility is in the Secretary.

28:10.320 --> 28:16.320
The Supportment Command have responsibility delegated to them.

28:16.320 --> 28:21.320
And it would be necessary to determine who the need is responsible.

28:21.320 --> 28:28.320
It may be decided that there has been fault in my part in passing on information

28:28.320 --> 28:35.320
to the various echelons of command, and indicating that there was a desire for preferential treatment.

28:35.320 --> 28:38.320
He has been so fond of the idea that he would be involved.

28:38.320 --> 28:47.320
If it were to be determined that the Secretary had directed preferential treatment, he would be involved.

28:47.320 --> 28:55.320
If it were to be prepared for the Chairman, as they did not seem to allow any particular individual in the Army,

28:55.320 --> 29:00.320
to hold responsible for preferential treatment which may not have taken place,

29:01.320 --> 29:06.320
but it would establish if he can to a record that the gift of preferential treatment

29:06.320 --> 29:09.320
were actually according to the charge.

29:09.320 --> 29:16.320
It would be a responsibility if somebody was the Army just leaving it covered that incorrect.

29:16.320 --> 29:22.320
Yes, sir, I think it is correct, but it is fundamental in the government

29:22.320 --> 29:27.320
that where an individual has the authority, he also has responsibility.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.320
Thanks, sir.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.320
A record answer to the three answer.

29:29.320 --> 29:32.320
My time has expired, sending the phone.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.320
Thank you.

29:33.320 --> 29:40.320
As the latter will remember, I mean, we have this morning, the letter,

29:40.320 --> 29:48.320
we read this morning from the White House through the Secretary of Defense,

29:48.320 --> 29:56.320
according to my current interpretation of it, and I've only glassed that at once.

29:57.320 --> 30:03.320
You consider that you are now under direct orders.

30:03.320 --> 30:13.320
The new channels from the White House not to divulge any conversation that took place in the conference.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.320
I believe you say was held on January 21st when I say conference,

30:19.320 --> 30:27.320
I mean, referred to that meeting, attended, held, and Mr. Bownell was all-fus-appended

30:27.320 --> 30:36.320
by the Attorney General, Mr. Rodgers, and his presidential assistant, Mr. Sherwin Adams,

30:36.320 --> 30:39.320
and others.

30:39.320 --> 30:46.320
You consider now that you cannot give any information to this committee

30:46.320 --> 30:51.320
and view that directive with respect to what occurred there at that time.

30:51.320 --> 30:57.320
The head on the conversations that took place, I do so, and I saw this memorandum

30:57.320 --> 31:00.320
about 20 minutes before you did.

31:00.320 --> 31:08.320
I placed the interpretation on the audience at this time that I am now prohibited from speaking

31:08.320 --> 31:11.320
about the conference which I have had.

31:11.320 --> 31:16.320
As young you often give it to the phones.

31:16.320 --> 31:20.320
Saying what occurred in a conversation that took place,

31:20.320 --> 31:26.320
you are not prohibited from saying that a conference was held, are you?

31:26.320 --> 31:31.320
I am not telling, I don't think I am prohibited from saying that a conference has been said

31:31.320 --> 31:33.320
I have already stated that.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.320
You have already stated that.

31:34.320 --> 31:38.320
It was a conference regarding this conference that has been developed

31:38.320 --> 31:40.320
as a subject matter of it.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.320
Does it not?

31:41.320 --> 31:42.320
Yes, sir.

31:42.320 --> 31:52.320
Now, on that, I ask you this question and view that statement that the Adam was the action

31:52.320 --> 31:56.320
taken thereafter after that conference.

31:56.320 --> 32:06.320
He had taken on the faces of the independent decision and judgment of the Secretary of the Army,

32:06.320 --> 32:13.320
or was it taken as a result of the decision made at that conference?

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
Yes.

32:14.320 --> 32:20.320
Now, have I explained the index case?

32:26.320 --> 32:27.320
Questions?

32:27.320 --> 32:31.320
I have led to ask you this question and view that statement, Mr. Adams.

32:31.320 --> 32:35.320
Was the action taken thereafter after that conference?

32:35.320 --> 32:36.320
Yes.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.320
Token on the faces of the independent decision.
