00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
Ladies and gentlemen and friends of Tennessee, this is the first of monthly television programs

00:09.280 --> 00:15.720
that I will endeavor to bring you during this session of the Congress of the United States.

00:15.720 --> 00:21.680
I want to thank this station as for carrying these programs as a public service and thank

00:21.680 --> 00:24.000
you for your interest in them.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.120
We will endeavor to have with us distinguished leaders and government from time to time

00:30.120 --> 00:34.840
and we will appreciate any suggestions that you might make as to the subject matters to

00:34.840 --> 00:37.840
be covered in the various programs.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.480
Approximately the end of January we will have another program on what happens in the first

00:42.480 --> 00:46.440
part of this Congress and then at the end of each month thereafter.

00:46.440 --> 00:51.600
And again I want to thank this station and its ownership and managers and all of you

00:51.600 --> 00:56.240
for your help in making these programs successful.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.240
Today is the beginning of this session of the Congress.

01:00.240 --> 01:05.540
The House of Representatives are met on yesterday in elected John McCormick as Speaker of

01:05.540 --> 01:11.560
the House, Carl Albert from Oklahoma as the majority leader.

01:11.560 --> 01:17.240
Today we also had our caucus and on the Senate side which was very harmonious.

01:17.240 --> 01:24.240
The program for the session was discussed and I think we will have a very good democratic

01:24.240 --> 01:29.160
unity and working together on the Senate side.

01:29.160 --> 01:36.720
It's a great honor today to have one of the leaders of the House of Representatives with

01:36.720 --> 01:41.680
us on this program who is well known to people in Tennessee.

01:41.680 --> 01:45.800
He has Congressman Hale Boggs from the State of Louisiana.

01:45.800 --> 01:50.280
He has distinguished Congressman who is leadership in the House of Representatives has been

01:50.280 --> 01:54.040
pronounced for many many years.

01:54.040 --> 02:00.040
Before we're calling on Hale I want to say that he came to the House of Representatives

02:00.040 --> 02:07.560
about two years after Senator Gore and I, he first came in 1941.

02:07.560 --> 02:13.720
He served in the United States Navy as an officer to time out to be in the Navy and later

02:13.720 --> 02:18.200
to almost get elected as Governor of the State of Louisiana.

02:18.200 --> 02:24.800
Here's the new whip of the House of Representatives and it's good to see you have you with us

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
Congressman Hale Boggs.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.360
I asked this it's a pleasure to be with you.

02:29.360 --> 02:36.920
Our friendship goes back for many years and I might say to the people of Tennessee that

02:36.920 --> 02:39.640
knowing you has been a great inspiration to me.

02:39.640 --> 02:42.040
I've been to Tennessee many times.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.040
First thing and campaigning.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.840
I want to talk about some of those times.

02:45.840 --> 02:50.480
Every time we ask you to come down for some democratic occasion you're always very willing

02:50.480 --> 02:51.480
to do so.

02:51.480 --> 02:56.720
I remember one time you came down to Nashville to our big Democratic meeting, Hale and

02:56.720 --> 02:58.520
there an outstanding speech.

02:58.520 --> 03:03.920
When you were a nice I remember particularly going to Knoxville in 1956 when we had around

03:03.920 --> 03:08.960
up there when you were a candidate for Vice President of the United States.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.400
I had at least students in Rivers on that area.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.040
I got to see a lot of the country and enjoyed our travels around.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.040
I went to successful but it was a great experience anyway.

03:20.040 --> 03:24.240
Well, needless to say I just just applied for me to go to Tennessee.

03:24.240 --> 03:30.040
My last trip there was with the Speaker Rayburn and Charlotte before he had to leave here.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.040
You remember?

03:31.040 --> 03:32.040
Yes.

03:32.040 --> 03:37.480
The dedication in July of the bridge at the North City on the Tennessee River and we were

03:37.480 --> 03:40.080
down the Speaker Rayburn and you were very wonderful to come.

03:40.080 --> 03:45.160
That was his last trip to Tennessee and I think that he got more pleasure out of that

03:45.160 --> 03:49.600
trip than anything that's happened to him in a long time because you remember Hale,

03:49.600 --> 03:52.960
his relatives on both sides of the river all came to see him.

03:52.960 --> 03:58.200
Well, I went fishing really and asked this in a little way and he reminisced about his

03:58.200 --> 03:59.560
childhood in Tennessee.

03:59.560 --> 04:04.920
So, what you and the governor and the other people in Tennessee did for him that day I think

04:04.920 --> 04:05.920
was really magnificent.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.520
And I believe you called a lot of fish too, did we?

04:08.520 --> 04:09.520
Sure did.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.920
I mean when you came back you forgot to wrap up my package.

04:12.920 --> 04:18.000
Well, Hale, you just been elected as the whip of the House of Representatives.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.760
Have you got a whip with you?

04:19.760 --> 04:20.760
Not along.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
Yeah, but.

04:21.760 --> 04:28.000
Lastly, third in command, the Speaker of course of the House is Mr. McCormick, Massachusetts.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.200
He was holding good friend of ours and Carl Albert is the majority leader in the U of

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
the West.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.720
Next in rank as the whip.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.400
What is the, what are the duties of the whip?

04:38.400 --> 04:41.040
Of course, Percy Priest was the Joe Warren.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.040
I mean, a wonderful congressman.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.040
Percy Priest was whip for quite a long time.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.040
Well, what do you do?

04:46.040 --> 04:52.240
Well, the whip has a cellophonch, he's the assistant majority leader to begin with.

04:52.240 --> 04:59.480
This means that he has responsibility with the leader for the program in the House.

04:59.480 --> 05:05.800
In addition to that, he's the man that's relied upon to give the temper of the House.

05:05.800 --> 05:12.360
We have assistant whips who check each member on the Democratic side to ascertain his feelings

05:12.360 --> 05:14.440
and see whether they're going to vote right or not.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.520
They vote right or wrong.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.680
And this is quite helpful.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.000
We know at least to some extent how we stand on legislation.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.760
It's not an easy job.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
It's a rough job.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.760
I guess a lot of them are.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.200
They'll like to say how they stand on legislation as you well know.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.240
Yeah, and then you have to get all the members, Democratic members there to teach you that

05:35.240 --> 05:42.080
and the House, as you recall, many of the most important votes have done to call it by

05:42.080 --> 05:44.080
wherever they'll call it.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.520
They've called it teller and standing votes.

05:46.520 --> 05:51.680
And if our numbers are not there, we can lose without even knowing we're losing.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.680
That's right.

05:52.920 --> 05:58.200
Well, hey, during the last few days you've had several visits to the White House with

05:58.200 --> 06:04.960
the leadership of the Democratic Party and with the bipartisan leadership to get briefings

06:04.960 --> 06:10.280
on the state of the Union and the state of our defenses and on the legislative program.

06:10.280 --> 06:15.720
Will you tell us about your visits with the President and his advisors?

06:15.720 --> 06:23.880
Well, it's very difficult to talk about the legislative program without the comment

06:23.880 --> 06:29.840
to just one committee in the Congress in this session.

06:29.840 --> 06:35.720
Most of the legislation that we're confronted with involves taxes or variations of taxes

06:35.720 --> 06:40.000
like tariffs, social security.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.760
And all of these under the Constitution must originate in the House representatives,

06:44.760 --> 06:47.880
specifically in the Committee on Ways and Means.

06:47.880 --> 06:52.120
And on yesterday, the President added another one which also goes to the Ways and Means Committee

06:52.120 --> 06:55.040
named with a problem of debt limitation.

06:55.040 --> 07:00.640
So that all of the discussions have sent it to almost primarily upon the House Ways and

07:00.640 --> 07:03.000
Means Committee and its program.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.200
And upon the Senate Finance Committee, which is the Companion Committee and the Senate,

07:08.200 --> 07:14.360
the legislative matters as you know are involved taxes and I don't give a necessarily

07:14.360 --> 07:15.360
in priority.

07:15.360 --> 07:23.000
Rather, comprehensive tax revision program, the President is widely interested in stimulating

07:23.000 --> 07:26.840
more investment in American enterprises.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.680
You know there's been some conversation about this administration being addressed to business.

07:31.680 --> 07:37.520
And my opinion, nothing could be further from the truth.

07:37.520 --> 07:43.560
The President recognizes the vital connection between the prosperity and the function of

07:43.560 --> 07:44.560
the government.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.760
As a matter of fact, as you know from your own studies, a difference of employment of

07:48.760 --> 07:54.160
a million people means a difference in revenues of about three and a half billion dollars.

07:54.160 --> 07:59.120
So that if employment drops off by a million, our revenues decrease by three and a half

07:59.120 --> 08:05.160
billion dollars or if employment increases by a million, revenues increase by three and

08:05.160 --> 08:06.320
a half billion dollars.

08:06.320 --> 08:12.080
So one of the main concerns of the press and in his economic advisors has been this business

08:12.080 --> 08:15.080
of unemployment.

08:15.080 --> 08:21.680
Despite the fact that business, particularly in the third and fourth quarters of 1961,

08:21.680 --> 08:28.760
was at boom proportions, we still were running a rate of unemployment of over five percent,

08:28.760 --> 08:30.760
which is way too high.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.120
This brings us to a consideration of the tax program.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.000
Well now let's talk a little more about the tax program.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.080
And there is a recommendation that certain loopholes be closed such as excessive expense

08:42.080 --> 08:44.880
accounts and things of that sort with which were right.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.280
Save the treasury a lot of money.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.280
Right.

08:47.280 --> 08:53.320
And then the President recognizes that businesses got to employ more people, right, produce

08:53.320 --> 08:58.720
more and compete with more competitive markets such as the common market in Europe.

08:58.720 --> 09:03.800
So that there is a program for an investment incentive, just what is that.

09:03.800 --> 09:08.640
And I think it has merit, but you know more about it than I.

09:08.640 --> 09:17.240
Well this program would permit business establishments, both large and small, to obtain a tax credit

09:17.240 --> 09:24.240
of up to eight percent of the funds that they use to for expanding their plant equipment

09:24.240 --> 09:25.240
or improving their own plan.

09:25.240 --> 09:30.560
Now as you pointed out Senator, this is important for a variety of reasons.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.640
Number one, to increase the jobs in the United States.

09:33.640 --> 09:39.640
And number two, to put us in a competitive position with the common market countries,

09:39.640 --> 09:45.320
which incidentally is probably the second item of consideration on the President's program.

09:45.320 --> 09:50.080
Now the tax program of course is before the Ways and Means Committee, which you have

09:50.080 --> 09:51.080
seen your members.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.080
Yes.

09:52.080 --> 09:57.120
And then the giving the President broader powers and the connection with tariffs to negotiate

09:57.120 --> 10:03.080
so that we can make arrangements with the common market of Europe is the other matter

10:03.080 --> 10:04.280
we were going to discuss.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.280
Yes.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.600
I want to say in connection with the common market of Europe that of course I was in Paris

10:10.600 --> 10:15.600
this fall as you know as a member of the NATO parliamentarians conference and you were

10:15.600 --> 10:17.600
there also.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.200
And it has become a reality.

10:20.200 --> 10:28.600
There are lowering tariff barriers, restrictions on trade, talking about their common currency.

10:28.600 --> 10:34.520
Europe is important to us because we have a favorable trade balance there.

10:34.520 --> 10:39.600
Also if we don't trade with them, we can't work together militarily and politically.

10:39.600 --> 10:45.160
So I think from every viewpoint, our own personal opinion is we must work out and give the President

10:45.160 --> 10:50.960
some leeway and negotiating with the common market.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.000
That will be a very controversial issue before the Congress.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
How do you feel about it?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
How do you think it's going to go?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
And what are the reasons for us getting into this?

11:00.000 --> 11:06.920
Well that's just number one I should like to point out and I'm sure the people of Tennessee

11:06.920 --> 11:08.600
know this.

11:08.600 --> 11:15.120
That you probably have made the greatest contribution of any American towards a uniform

11:15.120 --> 11:17.640
occasion of Europe which is now a reality.

11:17.640 --> 11:21.040
I know that for many many years you wait towards this goal.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.520
From my Atlantic Union friends, I have a little pre-safety.

11:23.520 --> 11:31.920
Now to my way of thinking this is really one of the significant events of this century

11:31.920 --> 11:34.160
for a great variety of reasons.

11:34.160 --> 11:41.360
Number one, it presents the greatest problem that the communists have faced.

11:41.360 --> 11:46.400
They have operated on a theory as you know that the West was decadent that Europe would

11:46.400 --> 11:51.520
decline first and finally we would be isolated and we too would fall.

11:51.520 --> 11:57.560
Now with the vitality of Europe growing at a rate exceeding 8% of gross national products

11:57.560 --> 12:00.840
and a product, it's an absolute enigma to them.

12:00.840 --> 12:06.280
This requires all of the communist dogma so that politically this is the greatest thing

12:06.280 --> 12:10.680
that's happened to us as a nation to the whole West, to the whole West, non-communist

12:10.680 --> 12:11.680
world.

12:11.680 --> 12:16.400
But on from the economic point of view this is a vital type of competition that we're

12:16.400 --> 12:22.400
faced with, both in agricultural commodities and in manufactured articles so that if our

12:22.400 --> 12:29.000
government doesn't have the authority to negotiate with the common market and operate more

12:29.000 --> 12:33.480
less than the partnership arrangement, we could become great rivals.

12:33.480 --> 12:38.480
And if that happened then the Soviets would have succeeded in driving a wedge between us

12:38.480 --> 12:43.840
which would be a very dangerous thing for the West so that what the President is really

12:43.840 --> 12:51.120
saying is that the common market is something very vital to us politically and militarily

12:51.120 --> 12:52.760
and economically.

12:52.760 --> 12:57.400
But we on the other hand must recognize the fact that it's also a challenge.

12:57.400 --> 13:02.720
Therefore he starts to ask his members of Congress, give me the power to negotiate realistically

13:02.720 --> 13:03.720
with these people.

13:03.720 --> 13:07.480
I think when the American people understand this they will give the President that power.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.800
Well that's a good sum up and hey, oh we could go on here and talk about many things

13:11.800 --> 13:16.480
for a long long time but our time is up and I hope we can have you back with us.

13:16.480 --> 13:23.880
I want to thank you very much for appearing on these stations today and I wish you the

13:23.880 --> 13:27.440
very best luck as the new rep of the Democrats in the House of Representatives.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.440
Thank you, Senator.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.440
That's all for now.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.440
Thank you.
