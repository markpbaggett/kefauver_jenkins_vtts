WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
And first of all, I want to state this.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Do not state that two major requests you were photographed.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
That is not a public safety division, Mary, at this time.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
I want you to state all other circumstances under which you were photographed,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
and with whom you were photographed.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
You make me remember these.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
I was asked to come over and spend in a certain spot

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
next to Susan individual, sir.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
You asked to.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I was asked to go here, yes sir.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
I was not asked to go back.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
But as we saw the National Park, what did you do?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
I obeyed, sir.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I was told by you photograph.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
I was photographed with the Secretary of the Army, sir.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Mr. Susan.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Yes, sir.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Sarah.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
And Colonel Bradley was standing in the picture to sir.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Who's the photo-graph?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Air Force photographer, sir.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Do you know the name of the photographer?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I do not know.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I did not know that.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I have been responsible for that.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
What has been the thing that you do with respect to the photograph?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Are the dignity.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, after the photograph was taken, sir, as soon as I was able to,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
I went over to the Air Force photographer.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I believe there were at least two.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
And I quietly asked them if they would be good enough to not

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
to publish the photograph anywhere that I had proposed for,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
a final request.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
So, of course, I would like to have a copy of it.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
But I would appreciate it very much if they would not send it to any publications.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
What if it was not sent to any publications as far as you know?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
As far as I know, it wasn't sent.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I was given that it had been just for the draft.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Yes, sir. I believe it arrived at my office in New York through the mail.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I think there's no proof of that.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I understand it came from the Air Force photographer, sir.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
The one who took the picture.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Either from him or his office.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
I do, sir.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I'll ask you, Father and not,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
the photograph I have now handed you for inspection.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Either the one who sent to you by the photographer.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Yes, sir.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Look at this.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
What did you do with that photograph, Miss Cheyne?

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
I asked the office to have it framed and put it on the wall of my office.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
I hadn't even known a frame.

02:48.000 --> 03:00.000
And as you did, you donated and stayed for the amount that you used to be framed in which the photograph you have before you bought a frame that hung in your office.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
It looks like a frame, sir.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
When were the photographs taken from your office?

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
It was Thursday morning, sir, or possibly before that.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I've liked it, please.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Yes, sir.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
For you who have been in the photography, ask you and not do it, you always do.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
We had a agreement workshop.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
The photography was, I think, effective from the sitting and kneeling position.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Not to be subject to individuals, it committed so much for the insurance to the television people.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
So there were things that were very many complaints from photography.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
It's Bob, the son of the photograph, you're friends.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
And the old photography brand sure you don't want to go anywhere to get this thing.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
You want this up because you can't make a shine, and stay further about on Monday, live, please.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
You were in the office, being office number 101, as I recall, in this building.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
With Mr. Cole, perhaps Mr. Car and perhaps others, at which time are present?

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
And you are present, and at which time I was questioning Mr. Cole and others present,

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
with reference to the facts of their case, preparatory to presenting their case to the committee,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
where you are on such an occasion.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I'll open.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
Do not say what was said, please, but say whether or not on that occasion.

04:26.000 --> 04:38.000
I was told by both Mr. Cole and perhaps others and you, who requested the taking of that photograph?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I could make that yesterday, or was I told that?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yes, sir.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
Do you recall that in consequence of that information, which was departed to me at the time?

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
I made it clear, it's the further enough, the photograph was in existence.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yes, sir.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
And the poem that it was in your possession and hanging in your office in New York City?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yes, sir.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
And did I request the photograph to be furnished to be presented as evidence in the history of photography?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Yes, as evidence in this case.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
You did, sir.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
In consequence of that, part that you did was just all of the steps you took in complying with my request and getting that photograph to be.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
I got on a plastic concert.

05:24.000 --> 05:34.000
I went to the airport, got on the first plane I could, and went to New York to get the signature request, sir.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And did you bring it back to Washington?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yes, sir.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Do you believe it?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes, sir.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
I delivered it to Mr. George and Masters, a member of the staff.

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
Here's the photograph that you delivered to the gentleman and his name you have called the identical photograph now for years.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Well, why?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I took it from my office in New York, sir.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
It was wrapped in brown paper.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
And I did not open it between the time I left New York and the time I handed it to Mr. and Masters, sir.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
But even the photograph you have before you now have a one-year foot in the plane, can you all see it?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yes, sir.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
And is that the one that you delivered to the gentleman and his name you have called it?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Yes, sir.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
As you've seen the photograph, since then, until the day...

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
No, sir.

06:25.000 --> 06:33.000
As you see it, a photograph is here.

06:33.000 --> 06:44.000
The shine on our face to you, a photograph, for pulling to be a photograph of you and the secretary of the Army only.

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
And in title is the head of my choir, ASB4th, Diction of November 17th, 1953.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
And I will ask you, whether or not you have ever seen that particular photograph until now.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
Yes, sir.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
I've seen this published in newspapers, I believe, sir.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
Since the original was delivered to the Alphanjari Washington.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I have never seen this print, sir.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
I have seen copies of this in the newspaper.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Well, I have.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
Those were newspaper pictures of that photograph which have occurred in the last few days.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Right, sir.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Never seen it.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
But you've never seen it in the original I now hand you in the one that I offered as evidence in this case a few days ago.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Is that right, Mr. Shane?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Right, sir.

07:41.000 --> 07:49.000
Do you have any knowledge of any of the circumstances, like that?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
A little bit of the original photograph.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Who is the man of the era of his life as shown in that photograph?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
That's the little brother, sir.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Do you have any knowledge of the circumstances under which?

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I think the gun has been something about these special divisions in good and not.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
We have tried to distinguish the cast of the cast who must be hearing it to be interrupted by this ugly behavior on the part of the photograph.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
Now, there will be no more finding on the chair, no more running around in front of the woman's distance.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
We have asked you this courtyard decision camp, as you're assuring it, if you would live after the rules of the committee.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
You can go over and ask the amendment of the president of this room, so we have work.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
If the government is properly with us very well, this one is right for the agency to die.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
Now, on, as if it's not a good thing, government is right.

08:51.000 --> 09:06.000
The signs that you have been in knowledge of the circumstances under which the picture of Colonel Bradley was omitted or deleted are taken from the original photograph.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Only through reading the testimony, sir.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
You were not there when such a thing was done if it was that.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
No, sir.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
You have read the testimony you say.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I agree with all of us.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I don't read.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
That's the only basis of your knowledge.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
You did not do it yourself, because that we have what we understand, Mrs. Shai.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
You saw no one else did it.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
No further questions.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
The chair has no question yet this time.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
All that one question, Mr. Shai.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
So, that picture that has been made an exhibit in this testimony is a large one now before you.

09:58.000 --> 10:13.000
From your lecture, from your knowledge, can you say in such picture was ever taken of you and secondary demons except in the group picture which you have identified?

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't know if there are many pictures of the Air Force that I have read.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
This picture is the one that I received.

10:23.000 --> 10:41.000
That is a picture you received, but I'm asking the question if at any time, if you're an artist, if the Air Force or anyone else ever take a picture of you and secondary demons alone, I really wouldn't know this.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
So, I'm here.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Just one question.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Who was the photo-match delivered?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
The one that you brought down from New York?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I delivered it to Mr. Ambassador.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
How could you spell it, please?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
A-M-A-S-N-O-S.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
A-M-A-S-T-O-H.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Yes sir.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You said he was a member of this band.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes sir.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
And he asked, prior to the time you went to New York on one day to get the picture?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I went on Wednesday, sir.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Wednesday, how long ago?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Last Wednesday.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
A week ago yesterday.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
So they met for the hearings to be carried.

11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
And that was as a result of the conference that Mr. Jenkins has inspired a bot in Europe in the office in Room 101 of the Senate Office.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
That was meant to request Mr. Jenkins, sir.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
And who went with you on the trip?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Nobody there.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
You went along?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yes sir.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
And your picture was on the wall in your office in New York?

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
No sir, it was read about for any of you to bring back to Washington.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
How did it happen to be wrapped up to bring back?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I had called the office and asked them to have a read.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
And it's been on the wall?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It has been on my wallet.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
When did you take it off the wall?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
I really don't know what the best took it off the wall.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Your office staff, but they took it off as a result of your telephone call.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
I really don't know what they took it off.

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
Well, I mean, this picture been on your office wall when you were last in your office.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
How long ago was that?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
It was not in my wallet when I was last in New York.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
One with that.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
That was a week ago yesterday.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
No, sir, this was last week.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
I wanted to ask you the picture to be taken off your office wall.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Is that a week ago yesterday?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
When did I ask it?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
It would be taken off the wall.

12:57.000 --> 13:06.000
I don't want to spend time on a point of order, but what's the devil's difference?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
When the picture was taken off the wall?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
That's why we're here today.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm coming in line with you to make that statement.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
A lot of people are lying in these very little outlining lines.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
It's entirely relevant to view of the testimony previously given by Mr. Call.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Turn over to me.

13:24.000 --> 13:31.000
When did you ask it to be taken down from your office wall?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I'd always thought that.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, we have any idea.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
What's the connection with the procurement of the picture for introduction and evidence?

13:40.000 --> 13:48.000
You mean, sir, did I ask it to be taken off the wall immediately following Mr. Jackson's request that I produced the picture?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Yes, the answer is no, sir.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
Well, when one was taken down from the office wall, when did you ask to find out?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I have no idea, sir.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
I have been facing the camp board and going for three months or more.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
And I haven't been in my office during that period.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And I don't know where it was taken off the wall, sir.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
But you did request it to be taken off the wall.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I didn't request it to be taken off the wall.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
You did?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
No, sir.

14:19.000 --> 14:27.000
And when you came back, you delivered the necessary and absolute of the committee and it was wrapped up in brown paper.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Right, sir.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And that's the last you saw.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Right, sir.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
That's all.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
And the product.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I have no question.

14:37.000 --> 14:46.000
And if I'm just one question, John, you say a picture was taken of you and Colonel Bradley and Mr. Steven.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
No picture, sir.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Who else was in the picture?

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
I see only three people.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Well, it's not that we had had to have an accord of a force.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Do you have any remember who that was?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
No, I do not.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
I remember that they snapped several pictures.

15:12.000 --> 15:24.000
And I believe that this was one of the first ones they snapped after I could have made any of that fail over a single.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
So it would have to be this for perhaps a few minutes, but it's not a single picture.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Now you got to be that thick, you know.

15:43.000 --> 15:55.000
That's the afternoon hearing temporarily recessed for 15 seconds, 15 minutes.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
That's a short recess.

15:58.000 --> 16:06.000
As recessed 15 minutes for the members of the Senate subcommittee, the Senate subcommittee.

16:07.000 --> 16:18.000
That will also include Senator McCarthy who's here and such other senators may be in the committee room to go from the Senate office building to the Capitol across the Capitol Plaza.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
Go into the Senate and take a vote on some some deep witches before the Senate.

16:25.000 --> 16:35.000
I ask that that's one of the representatives here at the press table, one of the people from our Senate Radio Gallery to find out what that vote is for me.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Bob, are you finding out what that vote is?

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Fine, thanks.

16:40.000 --> 16:52.000
As you heard, private David Shine was testifying about this very sensational photograph you might say.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
At the time, the hearing was temporarily interrupted.

16:58.000 --> 17:20.000
If you heard during the testimony, that council Ray Jenkins submitted several photographs to the wetness, private shine, and unbottle you have seen pictures of these photographs published in various newspapers.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
One which originally was introduced in testimony last Monday by the McCarthy side of the controversy.

17:28.000 --> 17:40.000
Picture showing, apparently showing, the Secretary of the Army and private shine standing together at the Maguire Force Base near Fort Dix in New Jersey.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
It was a picture of just the two and presumably was presented.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
The implication was that it was a picture of the two of the two alone.

17:51.000 --> 18:02.000
The original photograph, however, which the Secretary of the Army produced the next day showed that there was one other person in the picture, Colonel Bradley of the Air Force Base.

18:02.000 --> 18:12.000
And a fourth person, a civilian whose coat sleeve in the part of a hat were showing over at one side of the picture.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
And from testimony, we've had apparently there were others around.

18:16.000 --> 18:34.000
As we've heard, Senator McCarty, Secretary Subcommittee Council Ray Conn, some testimony here the other day that Mrs. McCarty also was in that group.

18:34.000 --> 18:45.000
They stepped off the plane and were there for a few minutes and an Air Force photographer, an Air Force photographer was present.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
There's five of a shine set a few months ago.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
You think there were at least two Air Force, but a military photographer is there who took these pictures.

18:53.000 --> 19:08.000
The first picture, which Mr. Jenkins gave to Private Shine was obviously the original photograph and was so identified by Private Shine and was the one which is on Mr. Shine's office wall in New York City.

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
It was the photograph, a Secretary Stevens, a private shine, a Colonel Bradley and of this fourth and identified person at the edge of the photograph.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
That's the one that was framed and on Private Shine's office wall in New York City.

19:20.000 --> 19:28.000
The one he has just testified that he sent or had brought to Washington to be presented to the Subcommittee.

19:28.000 --> 19:40.000
The second picture, which Mr. Jenkins presented to Private Shine was the so-called cropped picture or what the Army testifies was the Doctor picture.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
This is the one which was introduced in evidence.

19:43.000 --> 19:58.000
At this point in the testimony, it's obvious that some place here at this end, the picture was blown up of the two people rather than of the entire group.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Questions along that line are due to follow the next.

20:01.000 --> 20:19.000
Mr. Roy Colm, the Subcommittee Council has also testified that he knew nothing about this so-called doctrine or cropping of the picture and suggested that if it were done, it was done by one of the members of the Subcommittee staff who was just assumed that they wanted the picture of the two alone and nothing else.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
The Army case, however, is that it was a deliberately doctor picture.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
So we're getting right into the meat of this particular one aspect of the overall controversy.

20:29.000 --> 20:37.000
This one controversy in the overall controversy.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
And when the committee returns, they're supposedly in 15 minutes, but it may be a little longer than that.

20:43.000 --> 20:52.000
When the committee returns to take up the test of the cost examination, again this afternoon, I'm not really going to hear more about this from Private Shine.

20:52.000 --> 21:12.000
I find out that the buzzer, and you may have heard that buzzer in the background just a few minutes before Senator Montgomery says, I find out that that buzzer calling for a vote over on the Senate floor was for a vote on the District of Columbia Public Works bill.

21:12.000 --> 21:28.000
And, incidentally, one other item here, Mr. Ray Jenkins, the Subcommittee Council has been talking to correspondence during this recess and made the comment that positively this hearing will last no more than two weeks.

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
And added to that in positive words, I mean that.

21:34.000 --> 21:47.000
Which means that if the hearing is to end in two weeks, it will have to do a lot of expediting of the various issues that are before it now.

21:47.000 --> 21:54.000
For only one major, only one major witness so far has been called to testify, Secretary of the Army Stevens.

21:54.000 --> 22:06.000
And, as you know, Mr. Stevens is not there, not through of Mr. Stevens as yet. He has simply stepped aside temporarily while Private Shine has testified on this one issue of the photograph.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
That doesn't mean when they finish with a testimony where they cost examining a Mr. Shine, that they'll be through with him.

22:12.000 --> 22:21.000
He'll probably step down. Mr. Stevens will come back to the stand or some other person perhaps will be called to the stand on some other aspect of this photograph controversy.

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
Mr. Stevens will be back later and then undoubtedly sometime later in the hearings, Mr. Shine. Private Shine will be called back.

22:29.000 --> 22:40.000
But now he is testifying only on this one particular point and there are many, many other points on which the members of the Subcommittee and Mr. Jenkins was questioning him.

22:40.000 --> 23:04.000
Now, while this investigation is temporarily in recess here in the caucus room in the Senate office building, this investigation into the hearings of the great McCarthy Army controversy, we will take you back to our studios for a few minutes.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
Until then, we return you now to our studios.

23:09.000 --> 23:17.000
Thank you.
