00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
So the table of chairman's position,

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
Kyver G. Davidshine in the uniform of the United States Army is coming back toward the

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
wetness chair moving for a languid land.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
Seemingly, one letter of concern about the wildlife that is pouring upon him here,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
and I believe that in a form everyone seems to be pretty much in the

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
requisitions now that we were going to have this hearing.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
After this recess, which was called, in order that the senators,

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
or members of the South Committee could go over to the Capitol Office to set up floor,

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
and hold on a little.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
And yours, Chairman, Mark now, wrapping the gammala,

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
will actually be double the principles of the paper,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
a little attention on our investigation conversation from our group,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
and third of a copy of what I have called,

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
hold is very agitatedly, showing him something that is waiting up within the space.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Keep moving forward, we'll go to the quick,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
as we run the battle as white as you here,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
the battle is very standard, Mark.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
You know, it's standard, Mark.

01:14.000 --> 01:23.000
There you come, now, and please.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
One of my three-fourth and fourth place.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
That will be briefly.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
I now raise the amount of aliens left, please.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Picture.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Picture of the Mr. Shine.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
And I thought that place was introduced in the other day.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
It was entirely different from the picture of the Army,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Mr. Stevens, with Adams,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
blew up on presenters as the complete picture.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
If so, the tremendous imposition of our Mr. James,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't know if the council I would like of this time.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I mean, let me explain to the gentleman,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm normally just looking at point of order,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I think the point of order, Mr. Rosemary,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
but I think the following questions I should make.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
I think of this time we should have presented

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
the complete picture sent to Mr. Shine.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
And they blow up with the Army,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
with Mr. McHarrie, with a lot of fireworks,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
and I'm curious that he's going to introduce

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
all the pictures of the craftsmanship we're now,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
with Mr. Shine, in fact, we do each 10 minutes,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
so we'll come back to send this time in here.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But all the information on the pictures,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
all the pictures, everything,

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
get out of the queue from the interview.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Send this time in here, if you can assume the weather went up,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
if you have a bad influence from our audience today,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
the picture, which I got worth of debt,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
does not have to testify, fight,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
and the Army, the half, was in that direction.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
So it may well be that we have a third picture here,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
and that is the reason I had to fight you.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I have no further questions to this time.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Mr. Miner, may I have a move?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Mr. Miner, may I have a move?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Mr. Chairman, it's really just a minute now.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Mr. Chairman, in point of order?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Mr. Chairman.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
If this develops that Mr. Erick Wells,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
from Mr. Adams, Mr. Ding,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
present a picture, a global picture,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
because not a blow of a picture,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
which is presenting talent,

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
then we have everyone involved in all the families we got from the government.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah, the charities and stuff,

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
we're going to get everybody in connection with that picture,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
and the other people who have been shouting right upon that test,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
we want to get this through, I think everybody does,

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
and nobody knows the answer to it at the moment.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Then the father had no questions,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
and the family team was left on that side,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
and it's the worst I can do.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Can't believe in the light, sir.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
He's on the way back from the road call.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Mr. Wells.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Mm-hmm.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
The women are struck.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
The women are struck.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Mm-hmm.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I'll be back.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
I'll be back.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I'll be back.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I have a chime.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
I've finally followed your attention, Wendy.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
When you were informed at 4.4,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
the people who were speaking to us,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
the mic was the mic,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
and we didn't get to hear anything.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
It's going out in the other ear, man.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
That's it, sir.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
And I have a habit of looking at a witness when I examine him,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
because he'd turn away from the microphone,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
but I hope I have to or that situation.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Mr. Shine, I noticed when you testified

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
that you heard that someone was coming on the plane to see you,

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
that you named the people coming to this order.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Members of the staff,

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
manager McCarthy, and secretary Steven,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
it's a good deal to suggest that you remember the order

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
in which you stated those that were arriving.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
But when you agree with me,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
let me find out if I tell you that you stated them in that order.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
No, sir.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I don't propose your order in sympathy.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Most of the people in the service.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
When you describe their arrival,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
you describe them in this order.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Senator, Mr. Patrick,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Mr. Cole, Mr. Todd,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
secretary Steven, and Mr. Adam.

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
You remember placing with your arrival in that order.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
I can't recall exactly the order I used to.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
If I suggest to you, sir,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
that you get a new in that order,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
would you agree with these that I was correct?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
No, sir.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
As you take forward and move now,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
is it, do they come to your mind in roughly that order?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Senator McCarthy,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Cole, Todd,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Steven, and Adam.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
No, sir.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
I have to be photographing.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
You made an all-request.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
The person that comes from here not to publish them is that right?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I did, sir.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
And you made a written request also that you not?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I don't recall how you made a written request, sir.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Would you say you need orders?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I would say I didn't, sir.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
If someone from the airport here with a letter signed by this witness

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
and connection with the questions I have now asking.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Mr. Rauch,

07:50.000 --> 07:58.000
I have before me a letter of David November 24, 1953 signed by G. David Shine,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
which was passed to me today and addressed the public information officer.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Is that the letter of that which you're making in a period?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It doesn't be that very glad to.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I judge it as just be very glad to.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Can I do that, Mr. Jones?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Can I do it, sir?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
It is proper that he should be here.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
How long have we got into that?

08:46.000 --> 09:07.000
Mr. Jellin, Mr. Cardi, I agree with Mr. Wells that you're putting evidence.

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
I think first, there should be a establish to sign the blood-arveled Mr. Shine, Mr. Cigarette.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Mr. Cigarette.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
Mr. Cigarette.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Mr. Cigarette.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Mr. Cigarette.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Mr. Cigarette.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
I show you a letter or what, or what, for what's to be a letter?

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
From the letter that is the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations,

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
reporting to be dated November 24, 1953.

10:18.000 --> 10:29.000
Carrying at the lower left hand corner of it, the initials GDS-4FP.

10:29.000 --> 10:38.000
And carrying on the right hand side, cordially yours, comma, and in pink, G-David Shine.

10:39.000 --> 10:47.000
And under the last pink flag of the typewritten word, G-David Shine.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Was that letter signed by you?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
The worst nurse was dictated by you.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Yes, sir.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
And was it sent on your behalf?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
The worst nurse?

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
May I read it to you and you watch with me, Mr. Shine?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
May I read it to you, sir?

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Oh, indeed you haven't.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
Public information officer with wire air force base, Trenton, and Jersey.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Yes, sir.

11:20.000 --> 11:27.000
Thank you very much for sending the pictures of Secretary Steven's criminal banaline and myself.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
If any of the other fault of rats which were taken have turned out satisfactorily.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
I would appreciate having those forward at the mean as well.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
I want to express my gratitude at this time for your cooperation,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
not leaving the pictures or any kind of predestatement.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
I will remember my promise to you that at that sometimes in the future it becomes possible

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
to allow publication of the pictures that my wire air force base will be given

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
credit for the photography.

11:57.000 --> 12:07.000
This is apparently by somebody in my office and it's dated November 24th, 1953.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
The first I have seen the actual letter although I recall having dictated that now.

12:14.000 --> 12:23.000
I apparently thank the Air Force for sending me the pictures for not printed.

12:24.000 --> 12:32.000
And in answer to the very request when I did ask them not the credit,

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
I told them that I would comply with the request and give the wire air force base

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
credit for the photography to further the picture with credit something I just remember.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I have a thought.

12:47.000 --> 13:03.000
I will make sure that if you and I both give them a plus now they all have to be pretty well satisfied.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Don't you think?

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Would you join me in giving them a thank you?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I already very contented.

13:11.000 --> 13:24.000
Now I wish to ask you on the basis of this letter if you were seeking to secure an exclusive print on your own behalf.

13:24.000 --> 13:35.000
I was seeking nothing very important for the retire person to take them when Secretary Steven asked me to stand with him.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I will not give you any more picture.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
But you asked them not to release the picture if you know I believe sir.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
And you asked them not to give out any kind of press statement.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I do believe sir.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
From which I think it fairly follows and I'm not charging you with anything sir.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
It fairly follows from the aftertaste you were seeking an exclusive or you not?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I will not sir.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
I said nothing to them about where else they should send the picture privately.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
I merely requested from them after the picture was taken.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
That they not publish it anywhere.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
I told them that I had asked to post for it because I was asked to by Secretary Steven.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
But I said nothing to them about where else they should send the picture.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Are you suggesting sir that it was repulsive to you to post for that picture?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
I'm not suggesting anything sir.

14:28.000 --> 14:36.000
I'm saying that at the time I may be required of the retire person to say not publish the picture anywhere.

14:36.000 --> 14:45.000
I have not seen the picture published anywhere and I appreciate very much the promise they made to me that they wouldn't send it to any publications.

14:45.000 --> 14:54.000
Are you suggesting sir that you were martyred by the Secretary of the Army to post for that picture?

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
I am saying sir that I was asked by the Secretary of the Army to stand next to him and be photographed.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Thank you.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Come on.

15:07.000 --> 15:14.000
That matter is not a proper selfie to me in clarity and I made it perfectly clear.

15:14.000 --> 15:22.000
But if Mr. Wells desires that his question and answer stand, I think it's...

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
I think it doesn't lie within my province to object to it.

15:29.000 --> 15:38.000
If she has no light on the photographs they're often busy, but they're not anyone as cut out of it.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
I have merely the mind council of that fact.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I've been trying to orchestrate a field there.

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
I think I will say inbound one more question.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
I will say that I will be photographed along this line.

15:54.000 --> 16:01.000
Did you ask Secretary Stevens permission to mount it on your wall and give us publicity to that extent?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I did not answer.

16:03.000 --> 16:11.000
Did you follow the hearings in this room by television?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Which area sir?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
We are in today. Have you been following them?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I have followed as many of them as I was in the front of the front.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
I will be following them one day when we have finally to do in this room about these pictures.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I believe I saw some of them here in service.

16:26.000 --> 16:35.000
Did you understand that I will, because then the spacious of this picture had in some ways in doctors?

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I don't know where it has been, sir.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
When you saw the picture of yourself and Stevens alone,

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
and the service Secretary Stevens discomforts when he was queried about them.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
Did you rush to a telephone and say to someone on the staff or anyone on the staff?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
That would not fair.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Mr. Chairman.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Can I have a final word?

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
I just want to know, I just want to make a fair with your chairman,

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
that if council is going to go beyond the authenticity of the picture,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I will have no choice but to like mine.

17:16.000 --> 17:25.000
I understood from Mr. Jenkins that if there were a strain beyond the authenticity of the picture,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
that objection would be raised.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Now whether you object, not, I frankly don't care.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
I think it's very clear that if we're going to go beyond the picture,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
I will do like mine.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Will you fire the repeaty question?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
The attention of council to the temporary hours is taken.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
I would be attention of the chair, and I think I have the question repeating.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Question.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
When you saw the picture of yourself and Stevens alone,

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
and I'm sure there are some temporary Stevens discomfort when he was queried about them,

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
did he watch the telephone and say something on the staff or anyone on the staff?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
That is not fair.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Mr. Chairman.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Mr. Jenkins.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
That question would go to the credibility of the witness.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
Is this position or lack of this position to reveal the facts?

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
I think I think it was part of the impact that the interests or credibility of the witness,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
might be shown.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I think it was a proper question.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I'm subject to one.

18:47.000 --> 18:56.000
That is whether or not he participated in the practice of any alleged deception

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
or having learned of it is such a thing existed.

19:01.000 --> 19:07.000
Whether or not he remained active or took any active steps to correct the false impression

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
of that purpose and that purpose alone, I think.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
Mr. Chairman, I think that I have the same idea as the relevant objective to only question

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
except I would like to mention the fact that the other day at the point of the private stream

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
was getting special consideration because he was allowed to use the telephone.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
A question will be rules in order, and I'd rather sign if you can be followed by questions.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
I believe I recall the question very well.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.000
When it was insinuated that members of the committee staff had doctored the picture

19:48.000 --> 19:55.000
and that this was a completely dissonous act, I was naturally very much interested in watching

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
the outcome of the proceeding over television.

19:59.000 --> 20:07.000
The own personal opinion was that the fact that Colonel Bradley, who had as many airport spaces

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
in the northeast and was standing to the side and was in the picture, in no way detracted

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
from the fact that the secretary had requested that I pose with him,

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
I didn't know what was going to happen in the hearing, I didn't know what the members of the staff

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
provided that to find to. I felt that they had all the facts.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
I had complained with Mr. Jenkins' request that I produced the picture.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
I have no direct contact with the staff during the hearing anyway,

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
and I certainly have been more than willing to cooperate in any way I can

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
and produce any and all information concerning the picture or anything else,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
and that is what I'm doing right now, sir.

20:52.000 --> 20:59.000
When you saw the picture from your wall published minus one third of the characters

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
who appeared on your wall, what by shock said?

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
I was not shocked where you surprised.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
When I saw this picture from me, sir, the picture that had hung on your wall

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
with three characters in it, when you saw it published in the papers with about two characters.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Are you shocked, sir?

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
I have not been shocked lately at anything of the newspapers in the country,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
how this year. Where you surprised?

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
I was not sure, I expect to be anything in the newspapers these days, sir.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Were you sad?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
What was that, sir, about what?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
About some missing criminal Bradley in your case.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I think I'm not really clear about the right in the morning.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
What happened?

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
How did anything that is clear about me be brought out here at this point?

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
It was not clear to you when you saw it in the picture,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
what had happened, what has happened?

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
As I said earlier, there's no testimony about the picture.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
When you recognized what you saw in the paper as two or three,

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
that's the picture that had hung on your wall, did you?

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
I did not see the papers there until the day following the hearing.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
But when you saw it, you recognized it as two or three,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
so what had hung on your wall, did you not?

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
As I recall, I believed that the first published both pictures

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
of the one of Secretary Stevens and myself,

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
which is a print taken apparently from a copy of a picture and it was,

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
plus the original which appeared on my wall in the office.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
You know now, Private Shine, how, Colonel Bradley,

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
one third of the characters in the play disappeared from the cast.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
By a rough, goodly low idea, sir.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
You haven't done it yet.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
By a doctor, then Private, wearing that proud uniform as you do,

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
I have quit you, sir, of anything wrong if there was anything wrong.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
Lieutenant, a council of time expires that the property we had now

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
has questions in time at the same moment, and in the cart.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Mr. Wester, Chairman, out of no questions,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I ask you this witness request.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I would like to have it as badly,

23:24.000 --> 23:33.000
whether or not the pictures Mr. Welch produced was actually the blow-off

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
of the picture that had been induced by an old David Ford.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
I prefer to be able to yield it out for the ten times,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
but I encourage you to pursue that by the time of another council do that.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Very well.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Mr. Shank,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
there's only one question.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Yes sir, there's one question.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Sir, name a question.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Uh, what is your rating of the play?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Private, Private, sir.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Thank you.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Mr. Shank,

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
Mr. Schein,

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
I show you another photograph,

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
which I believe all participants see is a blow-off,

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
shall we say, of a photograph in which the Secretary of the Army,

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
you, Private Schein, Colonel Bradley, are shown.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
And perhaps the arm,

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
are the arm, cold, or a fourth person,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
to the immediate ride of Colonel Bradley.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
I will ask one of these gentlemen to pass that blow-off photograph to you.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I can say it from here sir,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
ask you to examine it carefully.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
State Brother or not, you have ever seen that photograph before,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
are any duplicate of it,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
are the negative of it or the print of it.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I believe I saw that one on television sir.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
I've never seen any negative of print of it.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Is that the first time that you've ever seen it that is on television,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
during these proceedings?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
It is sir.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
And was that after you had delivered to the office of Mr. Kohn,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
the first photograph about which you were questioned today?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Yes sir.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
Do you see an arm or an arm, cold or sleeve,

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
of a fourth person in this photograph?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I do so.

25:32.000 --> 25:42.000
Do you understand that this photograph was introduced by a council by Mr. Stevens?

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
A Amnabian madam, do you understand that?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yes sir.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Either of themselves or through their attorney.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Yes sir.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Do you have any way, whatever, of accounting,

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
for this photograph that I'll show you?

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
Are you giving any factor facts to this committee that would shed in your light of money?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Both sir.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
Other than that, it is a photograph of the Secretary of the Army,

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
of Hugh Colonel Bradley, and a private son-forth person.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
May I see the other photograph sir?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
May I switch one?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
May I see the one that was on my wall?

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I thought before you.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Huh?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Want to get it back?

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
I will ask you to examine Mr. Shine,

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
the first photograph about which you were questioned,

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
and which was taken from your office in New York City,

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
and things whether or not there is shown in the effort party

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
or the arm of the fourth party.

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
No sir, there is no arm of another party in the photograph that hung on my wall

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
which was sent to me by the airport.

27:04.000 --> 27:11.000
Would you or not say that the two photographs are different?

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Or are you able to express any opinion on that, sir?

27:14.000 --> 27:22.000
I would say that they are a different trend as to whether they came from the same negative or not, sir.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
I do not know.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
May I see this one more close to Sir, and a look at the view.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
May I see this one more close to Sir, and a look at the view.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
I will be reading this.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Hold on a minute.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
My own personal opinion, sir.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
I ask you to hold this photograph. There is another question.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Mr. Shine, may I answer the last question?

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
My own personal opinion, sir.

28:13.000 --> 28:29.000
Is that the dark room of the airport stop it to pop the picture of Secretary Steven Simeon down to show just three individuals?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
May I ask you this question?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Yes sir.

28:35.000 --> 28:42.000
Will you examine both pictures to the immediate length of the secretary?

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Which would be the right side of the picture as you look at it?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Yes sir.

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
And the left side of the picture as the Secretary and you and Colonel Barney's family.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Yes sir.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
Do you know any differences back?

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
I know very little difference, sir, in the two pictures.

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
I cannot say that they are taken from the same negative possibly.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Examine particularly the in-state in the air.

29:14.000 --> 29:25.000
Yes sir, looks at this, they are taken from the same negative although the two photographers could have been standing close to each other. I don't know sir.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Mr. Shine, I have no further questions.

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
Well the chair was completely unable to follow this testimony because you were looking at the photographs from the rear as well.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
So I have no question.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Perhaps Senator McCullough?

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
I wonder if we could have these pictures presented up here where the rest of the committee can see them.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Mr. Chairman, you have point of order.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
No, I'm not in the table.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
You want this file to be...

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Mr. Chairman.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Should be B5, Mr. Chairman.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I'm in the chair.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Mr. Chairman.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Mr. McCullough.

30:03.000 --> 30:11.000
I yielded to counsel because I thought you wanted to develop this point on the assumption of how the average person can get through.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
I would like to do that.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
I have no objection to waiting until we go around the list to chair with the clerk.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
In the meantime, can I see full picture?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Yes.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I think we better go around probably.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
I don't think that's the agreement.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
We'll get down to your Sunday and the clock for our measure.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Mr. Chairman, if...

30:30.000 --> 30:39.000
If it will serve the convenience of the senator to pursue this particular line of question and I'm glad to let him do so at this time.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Without a section, I'm...

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
If any member of the committee...

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
The servings, the right.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Dr. Lillie.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
The go-round again if we need to.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Without a section, I'm a part of any committee member.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
We will now allocate 10 minutes and do...

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
10 of them are cartons.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
They chair. Here is no addiction.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
10 of them are cartons for 10 minutes.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Yes.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
Mr. Mr. Sain, I don't know if we should...

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
...try and make you an expert on photography, but...

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
...in looking at the pictures I find that...

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
...the picture with you, Mr. Jansson...

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
...is different in many details from the picture that Mr. Walsh admitted.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
He said, middle of that.

31:23.000 --> 31:28.000
And informed the committee that it was the same picture.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I assume this was...

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
He was not the same picture I assume.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
That was not the result of any...

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
...evil intent on the part of Mr. Walsh.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
I assume he was honestly mistaken.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
But you will know if you will look at...

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
...which in some way they will get both work out of this together.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
You will know that if you look at the picture...

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
...Mr. Sain...

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
The picture was just a minute.
