00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Many of you who have friends in that state, the great state of Alabama, the Honorable Senator

00:05.500 --> 00:06.500
John Spockman.

00:06.500 --> 00:13.000
So, Senator Spockman has agreed to informally answer our questions today, and without further

00:13.000 --> 00:17.800
ado, I'd like to hear the Chairman of an extremely important committee to all of the

00:17.800 --> 00:21.600
businessmen, not only of our state of Tennessee, but of the nation.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.800
He is the Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and as such, he will have a great

00:26.800 --> 00:31.800
deal to do with eating small and independent businesses throughout this country.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.800
Senator Spockman, can you tell me what plans you have as Chairman of the Small Business

00:36.800 --> 00:37.800
Committee?

00:37.800 --> 00:38.800
Well, yes.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.800
Our committee, as you know, has just recently been organized.

00:41.800 --> 00:49.280
In fact, we have only two meetings with the committee so far, and that has just been

00:49.280 --> 00:55.040
authorized our appropriation, so we're just ready to start operating so far.

00:55.040 --> 01:01.040
We haven't even employed a staff or have office space or any supplies, but we're getting

01:01.040 --> 01:04.200
organized just as fast as we can.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.960
The first thing we're going to do is to check in with the various government departments

01:07.960 --> 01:14.960
and agencies to find out the what extent the small business people of this country are

01:14.960 --> 01:21.880
sharing in the vast amount of business that the government does, and if they are not

01:21.880 --> 01:26.280
getting that fair share, then we want to find out ways and means to make it certain,

01:26.280 --> 01:28.880
making certain that they do get that fair share.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.520
That is the first thing on our program.

01:31.520 --> 01:37.800
As you may well imagine, there's great many ideas, come to us, things that we are going

01:37.800 --> 01:44.280
to do, and the program I'm sure will develop very rapidly, and I believe that a great

01:44.280 --> 01:46.280
job can be expected in the committee.

01:46.280 --> 01:51.600
Well, now, a set of the slides, when I believe there are several bills pending, which will

01:51.600 --> 01:52.600
affect small business.

01:52.600 --> 01:57.960
I wonder if you could briefly bring us up to date on what legislation is now pending,

01:57.960 --> 01:59.960
this might affect small business.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.960
Yes, there are several bills.

02:01.960 --> 02:08.000
Most of them, however, have been well together in the moves.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.440
If you remember, I mentioned about a couple of weeks ago, the President sent a message

02:13.440 --> 02:20.440
up to Congress recommending a rather comprehensive legislative program in behalf of small business.

02:20.440 --> 02:31.560
Following that message, Senator Milani, Senator Lucas, Senator Maybank and I joined in introducing

02:31.560 --> 02:37.760
a bill on that would cover all of the recommendations the President made.

02:37.760 --> 02:43.200
We've made these to establish a system of capital banks throughout the country, somewhat

02:43.200 --> 02:47.760
similar to our unknown banks or our farm credit banks.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.560
These will be privately owned banks.

02:49.560 --> 02:56.800
The stock will be subscribed by a private company, but for the purpose of making credit available

02:56.800 --> 03:02.560
to small business, credit in the line of $45,000 to something on the other hand.

03:02.560 --> 03:09.560
Perhaps more or less, in other words, in moderate, palimotor it amounts.

03:09.560 --> 03:16.560
Some of my hearings that were held back in the fall by the joint committee on the economic

03:16.560 --> 03:22.660
report, which Senator Milani is chairman, by the way, became a parent that probably

03:22.660 --> 03:29.660
the greatest need for our financing was concerned in the field of small business today, was

03:29.660 --> 03:36.900
the available credit to enable small businesses to operate our business and at times to make

03:36.900 --> 03:37.900
capital expansion.

03:37.900 --> 03:41.260
Now this would not be government money then, would it?

03:41.260 --> 03:47.380
No, the government would help start it just as it did the home loan banks and just as

03:47.380 --> 03:52.740
it did the farm credit banks and just as it did the federal deposit insurance corporation.

03:52.740 --> 03:59.140
But just as in the case of each one of those, this too would be privately owned and privately

03:59.140 --> 04:01.140
operated, but government supervised.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.940
Now what other items were in the bill?

04:03.940 --> 04:11.580
Oh, that was another provision that the RFC be allowed to make loans to small business

04:11.580 --> 04:16.660
on terms that are more liberal than those that are available at the present time.

04:16.660 --> 04:21.580
When I say more liberal, that really means the length of time over which the loans may

04:21.580 --> 04:22.580
be retained.

04:22.580 --> 04:26.940
Well, that is quite mainly RFC generally deals with millions doesn't it?

04:26.940 --> 04:33.780
Well, you know most people think that's true, but it would be surprising to look over a

04:33.780 --> 04:39.380
list of the loans that have been made, for instance in the state of Tennessee, to small

04:39.380 --> 04:46.420
businesses, loans that probably are run around $25,000 and $10,000 and $50,000.

04:46.420 --> 04:52.620
Only recently I obtained a list of such loans that have been made in the state of Alabama

04:52.620 --> 04:57.220
that I obtained a list of all of the loans that RFC has made in Alabama over the past several

04:57.220 --> 05:04.340
years, and I was all made to find the great, great hundreds of small business loans that

05:04.340 --> 05:05.340
have been made by RFC.

05:05.340 --> 05:10.420
Now RFC does a great proportion of its work in this small business.

05:10.420 --> 05:16.380
There are a few loans that have been made by RFC that catch the headlines, but the great

05:16.380 --> 05:19.620
massive loans that are made by RFC are in the small business.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.980
Now getting back to our build fund or what's next item that we have.

05:22.980 --> 05:23.980
Well, let's see.

05:23.980 --> 05:30.900
It's proposed to set up what we might call a small business coordinator or clearing house

05:30.900 --> 05:36.660
in the department of commerce.

05:36.660 --> 05:41.660
I believe those are the three essential parts.

05:41.660 --> 05:45.660
There are some other items, but I think those are the three most important that have been

05:45.660 --> 05:46.660
proposed.

05:46.660 --> 05:50.980
There is another proposal in which a good many of us are interested in that is not covered

05:50.980 --> 05:51.980
in this particular bill.

05:51.980 --> 05:58.860
It can't be because it's a matter involving taxation and of course under the Constitution

05:58.860 --> 06:01.060
that must originate in the house of representatives.

06:01.060 --> 06:06.100
But a good many of us feel that there must be a revision of the tax structure, so far,

06:06.100 --> 06:09.460
a small business is concerned to relieve the load a little bit.

06:09.460 --> 06:10.460
That's right.

06:10.460 --> 06:14.700
Now let's get to a subject of which you are the recognized authority and expert question

06:14.700 --> 06:15.700
of housing.

06:15.700 --> 06:21.020
It looks like we're not going to have any middle income group housing in this particular

06:21.020 --> 06:24.180
session of the second section of the 81st Congress.

06:24.180 --> 06:30.700
Only a few could tell us why and also tell us what are not you thinking the next session

06:30.700 --> 06:31.700
of Congress.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.340
Of course, we have the right kind of Congress.

06:34.340 --> 06:38.340
We can go ahead and get legislation on middle income group housing.

06:38.340 --> 06:44.660
Of course, the middle income housing proposal that our committee, the Banking and Courage

06:44.660 --> 06:50.700
Committee, reported to the Senate was defeated in the Senate by a very narrow margin, by

06:50.700 --> 06:51.700
the way.

06:51.700 --> 06:57.060
Later, likewise, it was defeated in the House of Representatives.

06:57.060 --> 07:03.580
I think it was defeated very largely because of misunderstanding and misinformation as to

07:03.580 --> 07:05.780
what the bill actually did.

07:05.780 --> 07:11.100
So many people believed as a result of the propaganda that was broadcast all over the

07:11.100 --> 07:14.660
country that this was a socialistic program.

07:14.660 --> 07:22.300
It was a program involving direct federal loans and federal subsidies and all that kind

07:22.300 --> 07:24.300
of stuff, none of which was true.

07:24.300 --> 07:28.100
I think that's generally recognized as being true.

07:28.100 --> 07:35.420
And certainly every time the bill comes up affecting housing, we feel the impact of this

07:35.420 --> 07:36.420
lobby.

07:36.420 --> 07:37.460
It's all right.

07:37.460 --> 07:38.460
It's a great thing.

07:38.460 --> 07:39.460
We are not going to have to do that.

07:39.460 --> 08:03.620
It's all right for us to pass law to spend billions of dollars just so we first kind

08:03.620 --> 08:06.620
of housing that they think of as a partnership.

08:06.620 --> 08:13.180
But if it's a type that they don't fully agree with, but if for everything they have in opposition

08:13.180 --> 08:14.180
to it.

08:14.180 --> 08:16.820
And that was certainly done in the case of the middle income housing.

08:16.820 --> 08:19.420
Now, what can we look for in the next time?

08:19.420 --> 08:26.900
Well, I certainly hope that the next Congress will give very serious attention to this program

08:26.900 --> 08:30.580
because I think it's one of the most hopeful programs it has ever been proposed in the

08:30.580 --> 08:31.580
field of housing.

08:31.580 --> 08:38.140
A lot of people don't realize how big this housing demand is and how big the program must

08:38.140 --> 08:45.300
be each year if we're just to keep up with our increase in population.

08:45.300 --> 08:51.540
And if we are to catch up with the tremendous drag that's developed as a result of the

08:51.540 --> 08:58.820
war years, you know, we need nearly a million and a half units a year in order to give

08:58.820 --> 09:01.180
us the number of housing.

09:01.180 --> 09:04.820
The number of houses or the housing units that they need each year.

09:04.820 --> 09:09.060
And yet the most that we've ever built in one year was last year when we built a million

09:09.060 --> 09:10.060
and twenty thousand.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.660
And that's just about keeps us not quite even.

09:13.660 --> 09:16.140
It just about keeps us even.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.500
It doesn't gain any only drag.

09:18.500 --> 09:22.020
Well, now let's turn our attention to the reorganization plans.

09:22.020 --> 09:25.220
There's been a lot of misinformation I know as well.

09:25.220 --> 09:32.220
The 21 plans by rejected only very recently and I believe there are still four more to

09:32.220 --> 09:38.220
come prior to the adjournment sometime in July as far as the deadline as to the dates are

09:38.220 --> 09:39.220
concerned.

09:39.220 --> 09:44.380
And I also believe that you were one of the three senators who voted for all of the

09:44.380 --> 09:50.180
reorganization plans that were sent up by President Truman to conserve the country's money

09:50.180 --> 09:53.220
in the operation of the executive branch of the government.

09:53.220 --> 09:58.220
Now could you briefly tell us I think probably that I'll listen to you more in order

09:58.220 --> 09:59.220
to reject it.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.220
I guess why they were rejected.

10:02.220 --> 10:10.020
Well, now I say this that I did vote for every single reorganization plan that upon which

10:10.020 --> 10:12.580
we had a wrong car vote in this Senate.

10:12.580 --> 10:16.620
You understand that a number of these plans went through without any runabouts and without

10:16.620 --> 10:17.620
any vote, yes, automatically.

10:17.620 --> 10:21.300
But I supported all of them.

10:21.300 --> 10:25.300
There were one or two that I frankly did not lie.

10:25.300 --> 10:30.900
But I became convinced that if we were going to have reorganization of government, if we

10:30.900 --> 10:38.180
were going to streamline this government and affection savings by reason of such efficient

10:38.180 --> 10:42.580
operation of the government, then we simply had to go down the line on these reorganization

10:42.580 --> 10:43.580
plans.

10:44.420 --> 10:52.580
And it happens practically every plan was contrary to the wishes of some particular groups.

10:52.580 --> 10:58.820
And one thing that's rather amusing to me was to see how the people generally, business

10:58.820 --> 11:04.740
people, bankers, manufacturers, everybody would come in and recommend the adoption of

11:04.740 --> 11:07.100
the approval commission reports.

11:07.100 --> 11:13.820
But when the individual plans would come in, why those groups adversely affected those

11:13.820 --> 11:19.100
who possibly were adversely affected, would come in and urge us to do everything we can

11:19.100 --> 11:21.100
to defeat that particular plan.

11:21.100 --> 11:27.140
Well, I decided in the beginning that if we were going to get started on that, we simply

11:27.140 --> 11:28.860
would not have any reorganization.

11:28.860 --> 11:33.700
And I won't tell you, I was scared pretty badly before we got a single plan planned.

11:33.700 --> 11:38.700
If you remember, I was five rejected before a single plan was approved.

11:38.700 --> 11:42.900
Now, I began to think we weren't going to have any reorganization at all.

11:42.900 --> 11:48.260
Fortunately, people began to check on themselves, members of the Senate began to say to

11:48.260 --> 11:55.020
how the saying could develop to say, reasoning that I should it to myself from the beginning.

11:55.020 --> 11:59.420
And other results, the others failed without too much difficulty.

11:59.420 --> 12:05.420
Well, generally speaking, the plans that were rejected to were those in which the chairman

12:05.420 --> 12:11.420
or the administrator of that particular department was given according to the outside interest

12:11.420 --> 12:14.420
at too much power, wasn't that generally the...

12:14.420 --> 12:19.420
Yes, but everyone of them was in every one of those that you referred to, within complete

12:19.420 --> 12:23.420
a call with the recommendation of the member reports.

12:23.420 --> 12:29.420
By the way, the very first one, the number one, plan number one, was one that had to do

12:29.420 --> 12:35.420
with the control of the United States, control of currency.

12:35.420 --> 12:40.420
And the national banks, all of the banks were opposed to it.

12:40.420 --> 12:45.420
And I remember the banking and currency committee on the rather insipity with the viewport

12:45.420 --> 12:47.420
of the banks on this kind of legislation.

12:47.420 --> 12:51.420
And I arrived at strong information to vote against that plan.

12:51.420 --> 12:57.420
But I went on and supported it simply because I felt that we are too reorganized

12:57.420 --> 13:00.420
and the way it starts was simply to start.

13:00.420 --> 13:03.420
Well, now one small question that will have to be read a brief.

13:03.420 --> 13:08.420
I'd like your comment on the visits of Frigley Lee to the European countries

13:08.420 --> 13:14.420
and his suggestions that we have seen to Russia's desire to recognize the Chinese comment.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.420
How do you feel about that?

13:16.420 --> 13:19.420
I was very glad to see Trigg Baleen make the trip.

13:19.420 --> 13:23.420
I felt considerable hope in the very fact that he was able to get into

13:23.420 --> 13:27.420
get behind the iron curtain and talk to Joe Stalin.

13:27.420 --> 13:29.420
I believe we'll have more of that.

13:29.420 --> 13:33.420
I'd like to see some high level conferences among the nations.

13:33.420 --> 13:37.420
Now, the fires that are admitting coming into China,

13:37.420 --> 13:39.420
told that Russia will come back in the United Nations.

13:39.420 --> 13:44.420
I would not want to do it until I had a firm commitment from Russia

13:44.420 --> 13:46.420
that she'd come back and play ball.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.420
Thank you very much, Senator John, Department of Alabama.

13:48.420 --> 13:52.420
Ladies and gentlemen, as the guest of your United States Senator,

13:52.420 --> 13:56.420
Mr. Pee-Pover, we have had Senator John Sparrow join us next week.

13:56.420 --> 13:59.420
Once again, you will hear your senators as the Pee-Pover.

13:59.420 --> 14:01.420
This is Washington. I will join you through your statement.

14:01.420 --> 14:04.420
Thank you very much.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.420
All right, Senator.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.420
Thank you.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.420
All right.
