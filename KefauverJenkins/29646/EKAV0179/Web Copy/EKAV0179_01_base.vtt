WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
But I'll say it for you that I failed to get that done.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
But now that it's got to be in the open,

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
we just as well have the whole story,

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
so that nobody can take on Regency,

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
that the junior senators from Illinois,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
departed from the street line.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Mr. Sturkson, may I say to you as a gentleman,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
but I'd like to believe it's another one.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
You and I are in total agreement.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
I have always thought the total story should be told.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
I think we should.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
May I sir sum up your testimony as gracefully as I can.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
You first heard that there was this question of the penis

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
and you as a lawyer and a senator knew that that was an agitating matter.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Is that right sir?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
That's correct.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
We have to have a word from you.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
And secondly, you heard this astonishing story,

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
a treasure by the chief counsel on Mr. Adam,

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
and that too was an agitating story.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes, but let's Mr. Walshwitch add for the testimony

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
that the two were couples,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
and that's my services where it's like to kill those offenders

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
if I could do them.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
And you have no exact tattoos.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I'll kill them, have you sir?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I didn't kill them as a matter of fact, my good sir.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, in the end, I got them suspended

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
along the rest so that we could have a meeting

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
of some members of the commission.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
So that's a whole matter, my good sir,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
to start to ask the team what all the equities

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
and the varieties were in the game.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Is there a question?

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, I have a point of order.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I could, I could, I could.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I would be a point of order.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I prefer the way Mr. Walsh is finished.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Mr. Walshwitch, the time has expired.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm sorry.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Could you stay here if you have no questions?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Uh, if you ask a more question,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I'll go around the table again if you do certain.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I don't.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Would you come back to me?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I might have one, but I don't.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I need to send you to my right, every question.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Can you come to?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
No question.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Can you send me to my left for any questions?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
From the McCartney, every question?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
No, no, no, no.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Mr. Walshwitch, I, I, I, I made a line with her.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Mr. Walshwitch, this game's so interesting,

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I wish that I'd been on the committee at this time.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
But I'd like to say that in its much of its time

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
to go from for whom I have great respect,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I've been very fine and sure throughout the respect

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
of its position, and the problems involved

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
and it's a first about it.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I think it earned me so much that the other members

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
of this club committee, who were interrogating

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
or questioned or did they give the world

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
you might throw a fond Mr. Adam,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
or also to work side of the position.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I heard about that.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
We've asked the Hedges Dwarven and the rest of it.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Have you heard a question, Mr. Walshwitch?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I did not, sir.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Will the committee, before going to chair,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
give me, chair unanimous consent

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
to ask one question of Mr. Eddler?

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
The good, that was great for you, Ed.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Mr. Eddler, you're the one who's telling me that,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
no, sir, I call on you alone.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
You call on you alone.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I call on you alone, sir, afternoon.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
I have a husband, on January 22nd.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I saw you in your office for about 39 years.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That's correct.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Now, from the time you were on the committee,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Mr. Walshwitch will be clear for you when you call on him.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I call on Senator.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I call on Senator Spannington on the night.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm trying to help Simon.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
You call on Senator Spannington.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I call on Senator Spannington.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I call on Senator Spannington.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
You may leave me.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
You have about 5.30 or 6.5 on January 19th.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I call on Senator Spannington.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm the local board of panelists.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I call on you as new on January 22nd.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Thank you.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
The chair would like to be sworn at this time,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
so I'm in the federal,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
who is sworn to be sworn right here, certified.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I call on Senator Spannington.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I may give you a few days, you know, people should.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I have a little problem.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm not being part of the board.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I'm not being part of the board.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I do.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
The chair didn't know he was going to have a lot of people

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
being a witness for way.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
He was probably might be seen in a letter

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
and the guest he didn't put on his television shirt.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
He was a guest.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
He was a guest.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Thank you.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
The chair would like to be the first of all a recap.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So the guest of his money,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
the conversation he had with Mr. Adams in his aftertons,

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
January 22nd.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Now the chair began by saying that he never attended

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
only his hearing, because the court man was in investigation,

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
because most of them took place during the congressional recess.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
When the chair was out in Falk, Dakota,

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
and following that on a speaking tour to the west coast.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Meeting his men says he did about him,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
and the papers, the medicale phones,

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
and the Frank Carr, one day stating that he saw

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
that the long-ha hearing was being held,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
and he was being interrogated, interrogated,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
by the press above them.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
He would like to get a daily telegraphic condensation

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
of synopsis of each day here.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Now we see those from that time on every day,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
but they took synopsis of what took place

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
after he's infected his hearing,

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
and they came here to held on the white man's face.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Other than that, I had only a newspaper reader.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I'm out of information about them,

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
and so when Mr. Adams came to my office at noon,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
and he's certainly asked to know,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
and I think it was on the 22nd of January,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
he did not have a very wide background

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
of what had taken place.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I did not think that Mr. Morgan was with him,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
and I'm happy to have Mr. Adams come from that.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
There is no reason he should be.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
If the Adams is an assault decotent,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I am an assault decotent.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
We have known each other for a long time.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
There would be no reason for him to bring anybody

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
to resolve my office, and he came to see me.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
If it is his first visit to my office,

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
and so far as I can recall about the fort man's investigation.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
And that occasion, the chair would say,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
that he opened the conversation by the sudden

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
substantially what the investigation has reported

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
in his discussion.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
The matter of the paintings that have been issued

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
for certain members of the loyal reports.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
The chair stated that his experience

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
as a member of investigating committees

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
dating back to the time when he served on the Dyes Committee

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
with Martin Dyes of Texas' chair.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
He had always done everything that he could

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
to try to maintain the strength

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
and the position of Congress to have

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
all of the available information for committees.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
He felt in fine always to be on the side

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
of a congressional committee in derving by a Stapini

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
or any other device to get all of the available information.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I have made that position very clear.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I have made it in a great many news statements.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I have made it in a great many speeches.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I have protested, for example, against you,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
so-called human executive orders.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Which I have felt funded the piece

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
from congressional committees which in my opinion

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
and the co-ordinates' branch of government

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
have their rights to nullify.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
I have stated that I was happy to find the relaxation

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
in that order which was made by President Eisenhower.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I was disappointed that the relaxation

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
was not more complete.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Because I believe that Congress and the people's representatives

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
are entitled to the facts that deal with corruption,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
whether they deal with subversion,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
or homosexuality, and the part of officials

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
in the executive branch of government.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
If the ad is funded out to me and he's the lawyer,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
and I am not, that members of the loyalty board

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
in his opinion had asserted that the quasi-judicial department

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
that he thought perhaps they should get some other treatment.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Then, I have now remembered

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
that the executive branch of the government,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
which I have written, no position,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
the pass upon that, has simply said

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
as far as he was concerned, he felt that he felt more possible

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
and productive to bring those people

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
before his congressional committee.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
He could see no reason why they should be included out.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
After discussing that at some point, Mr. Adam

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
before me, the discretion of cone and shine

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
and the fact that a great many efforts had been made

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
on Mr. Cone to try to get preferential treatment

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
for Mr. Shine in the United States.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Frankly, I felt a little bit uneasy

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
about the justice position of those topics

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
which admire your opinion were entirely unrelated.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
We didn't discuss them at any great length,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
but I do recall getting up from my desk

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
and walking to the outside door of the office with Mr. Adam

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
and saying this, that if I were running the United States Army,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
that would be no problem with me at all

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
after the second time a committee's death number fell me up.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I was telling him from that time on,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
I'm running, Army, you run your committee,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
and I wouldn't talk with him on this,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
one single additional time.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I pointed out further that speaking from myself

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
as a member of the committee,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Dave Shine was just another genre member.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
That I wasn't one just concerned what happened to Dave Shine.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
They said, put him, and I think I used this phrase,

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
and pay these pay-to-d duties for the rest of his natural life

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
as far as I was concerned if the Army itself

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
was a proper function to assign to him.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
I said, I hope that because he was a member of the committee,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
he would not be given any discriminatory treatment against him

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
and I was sure he was not.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Certainly as a member of the committee staff,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
he would not entitle to any preferential treatment

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
as far as I was concerned.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I said to myself that was true,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
for the other members of the committee,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
but I knew it was true as far as I was concerned.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I attended the meetings with Senator Dirkson,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
alluded to Senator McCrapson's office.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I said at that time, as Senator Dirkson said.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Certainly if a member of our staff was using him proper means,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
the service was here for a friend of him,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
preferential treatment in the United States Army,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I thought that was something our committee should not couple,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
and I think we should be asked to resign

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
as a member of the committee.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I said I didn't know whether it was true or not,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I had heard the allegation.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
At that meeting for the first time,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I heard some Senator McCrapson's advice

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
that he had written a letter to the United States Army,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
saying that he has requested that sign be given

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
just the regular treatment of any other

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
prospective draftee or draftee.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
I suggested that Senator McCrapson lead us to love

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
and accept the forms of the outside office,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
ask somebody in his office to find the letter,

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
because the little time to find it, he finally came in,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
and the McCrapson's letter, which is now in part of the letter.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
So I simply think that it is only right

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
that the chairman should state his part

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
in both of those two conversations,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
that he now submits himself to the usual line of questioning,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
and that's how so do you make that in the chat?

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Chairman, there's only one question of his desire as.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
In that conference with Mr. Adams,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
with respect to the subpoena,

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
the issue for members of the Lawyer to board,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
they do not, Mr. Adams,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
a meditator, or on any other occasion,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
raise the question with you

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
that there was any directive-other preceding

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
the issue and the service of his subpoena

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
on a member of the Lawyer to board.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm not sure that he did.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
He talked to me as a friend of Mr. Thomas F. Cotin

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and with the lawyer,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
giving me a opinion,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
and perhaps he mentioned that there were directives,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm not sure,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
but in developing to convince me at least

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
that these people saw a quasi-judicial position,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
and that consequently said not,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
but that they had come under the same concept

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
of the subpoena power which I had,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
and which I still had,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
and that is just the subpoena power of the United States Congress,

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
should be available to us to use almost all.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
There may be a question.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I don't know, I'm not a law.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
There are exceptions.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
It's very difficult for me to understand,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
by the way,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
any justifiable exception whatsoever,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
unless to exercise the subpoena power,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
but be to jeopardize the national security.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
As far as the cherries can share,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
he has never been able,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
during the 16 years that he has been

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
in the House of Representatives or in the Senate,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
to find any other valid reason

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
for denying that people's representatives in Congress

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
all of the time,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
regardless of who they may embark on.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Mr. President, Mr. Chairman,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
did you feel at the time that Mr. Adams

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
was enlisting or attempting to enlist in lists?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Your aid and your influence

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
has a United States Senator

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
in many about the disasters

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
out the width of no subpoena,

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
should be issued for members of the Law of the Board.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
That is just the purpose of his visit.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
If I recall correctly,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
and I may be wrong about this,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I think he mentioned that the reason,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
one reason he was concerned

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
is that he was immediate superior

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
to Secretary Stevens,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
was out of the country,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
that he said fallen upon him,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
that was a pretty serious responsibility,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
and he was naturally concerned

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
to see that these subpoenas were users

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
to fight it or de-fair it until some other time.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Mr. Chairman, if it isn't out of order,

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
I would like to ask one simple short question

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
to Senator Durton,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
while I'm on my feet.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Senator Durton,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I may be out of action.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Senator Durton, I will ask you whether or not,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
in your conference with Mr. Adams

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
and Mr. Morgan,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Mr. Adams raised the question

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
that there was existing

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
any presidential directive

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
prohibiting the issue

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
and such a subpoena

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
upon a member of the Law of the Board.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Yes, Mr. Durton, I know that we did just the matter

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
in very considerable ways.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
That question could have been raised,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
or all I know.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
You did not,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
uh,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
definitely recurred to me as most.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
No further questions, Mr. Chair?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Uh, Senator,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Senator Jackson has called

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
with the attention of the Chair

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
that he missed broken so,

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
uh, among the law,

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
and I wish the right to be corrected,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
and I'm referring to Mr. Tron,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
the member of the committee,

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I must, I must,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
the member of the committee's chair,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
and I will speak to him.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Thank you.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Senator McLean,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
you may entirely get the chair.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Both of them?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Senator Jackson?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
No questions.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Senator Jackson?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
No questions.

This is another issue because I was

15:57.100 --> 15:58.120

15:58.120 --> 15:59.700

I would like to make clear that we are

16:21.520 --> 16:23.520
calling the member to the loyalty board.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.520
Not only to discuss with...

17:06.720 --> 17:08.520
I do not recall that he did.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.920
I do not recall that it was a tale, just to find it was a penny.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.600
He says very frankly that's part of the explanation,

17:14.600 --> 17:17.120
it takes very long, because I said it was gone.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.320
I want to tell you my position right now.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.920
I believe in the subpoenaed part of the council...

17:21.920 --> 17:21.920


17:21.920 --> 17:22.920

17:22.920 --> 17:23.920
