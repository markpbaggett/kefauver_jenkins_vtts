00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
Chair, I would like to remind you that you are here as a welcome guest to this committee.

00:08.880 --> 00:14.680
And you enter the room with the understanding that you will comply with the committee rule,

00:14.680 --> 00:19.400
which is that all members of the audience are refrained from any manifestation of approval

00:19.400 --> 00:24.440
or disapproval in any audible manner at any time.

00:24.440 --> 00:30.920
The officers and charge of the committee room have standing orders to politely escort

00:30.920 --> 00:33.480
from the room immediately.

00:33.480 --> 00:40.280
Anyone who violates the terms of which you became a guest of the committee, I shall,

00:40.280 --> 00:43.360
develop these long procedures.

00:43.360 --> 00:49.720
Chair announced at the conclusion of the morning session that Senator Potter had his own

00:49.720 --> 00:52.560
request for us to be the next witness.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.560
He has been sworn and the chair will listen to him.

00:56.560 --> 01:01.800
Chair would like to suggest that if we are not interrupted before 3.30 by a quorum for

01:01.800 --> 01:06.240
all our roll calls, that if some members of the committee are counsel, will remind me at

01:06.240 --> 01:10.640
that time and will stand up for a seven-dending stretch and take a five-minute recess.

02:10.640 --> 02:17.640
I would like to thank the head of the committee for the invitation to introduce the president

02:17.640 --> 02:18.640
of the committee.

02:18.640 --> 02:24.640
Mr. Chairman, the morning session, Senator Durston and Senator Monk, related to the committee,

02:24.640 --> 02:31.640
we are conversations with Mr. Adams concerning the question of whether members of the Army's

02:31.640 --> 02:38.640
loyalty board to the committee.

02:38.640 --> 02:45.040
I ask the chairman to put on the roll to relate to the committee.

02:45.040 --> 02:52.040
My knowledge is that I was not contacted from Mr. Adams, whether I was contacted by Mr.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
Louis Beres.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.040
Get ready to counsel for the arms.

02:57.040 --> 03:05.600
Mr. Beres happens to be a close personal friend of mine in outstanding attorneys and a man

03:05.600 --> 03:13.440
who will be assumed as duties as deputy counsel in January of this year.

03:13.440 --> 03:17.040
Mr. Beres contacted me.

03:17.040 --> 03:21.040
I believe it was the evening of January 22nd.

03:21.040 --> 03:28.040
At least it was the same day I'd be that Mr. Adams contacted Senator Durston.

03:28.040 --> 03:39.040
I can't recall whether it was in my home or his home or what I do recall it was a social

03:39.040 --> 03:46.040
evening rather than a formal appointment that Mr. Beres had with me.

03:47.040 --> 03:54.040
He informed me that he had been instructed by the council, Mr. Adams, to contact me relating

03:54.040 --> 04:05.040
to the possibility of having the committee postponed the competing of the members of the Army

04:05.040 --> 04:07.040
loyalty board.

04:07.040 --> 04:15.040
I will recall telling Mr. Beres that my experience on various investigating committees for Congress

04:16.040 --> 04:29.040
that I felt that the challenging of the Congress to issue subpoena, you call what you say,

04:29.040 --> 04:33.040
is quite absolute.

04:33.040 --> 04:41.040
That I believe that the Army would have to produce the body.

04:42.040 --> 04:48.040
In other words, the people under the committee would have to be presented to the committee.

04:48.040 --> 04:57.040
But as questions were asked that were, that were in violation of an executive order.

04:57.040 --> 05:04.040
Then I felt that the witness had a right to issue a swing.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.040
I related that, information to Mr. Beres.

05:08.040 --> 05:15.040
The following day I believe we had our meeting and send the McCarthy's office of meeting Mr.

05:15.040 --> 05:19.040
Senator Durston sent him on to my self and send him a copy.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.040
Well, this whole question was the cup.

05:22.040 --> 05:28.040
I might relate that to meeting and send him a copy of all this.

05:29.040 --> 05:40.040
A lot of that time Mr. Beres also discussed with me that there have been a considerable

05:40.040 --> 05:51.040
effort to even form on the part of Mr. Cohen to secure a perpetual freedom for Mr.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.040
John.

05:55.040 --> 06:02.040
I am confident from the information that Mr. Beres gave me that he wasn't too familiar with

06:02.040 --> 06:03.040
the fact.

06:03.040 --> 06:13.040
And he related those facts to me as a general knowledge rather than an effort to present to me in any way.

06:13.040 --> 06:20.040
I'd also like to say that Mr. Beres, while a vote and good personal final mind,

06:20.040 --> 06:32.040
as never used is friendship, use my friendship in any way to intercede on behalf of the Army

06:32.040 --> 06:36.040
or anyone else.

06:36.040 --> 06:45.040
The following day at the meeting and send him a copy of all this, we call we can stop.

06:46.040 --> 06:54.040
The question of the charges that were brought up, my conversations with Mr.

06:54.040 --> 07:00.040
Beres and the conversations the other tendons had with Mr. Adam concerning Mr.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.040
Cohen and Mr. John.

07:03.040 --> 07:10.040
I remember at that meeting I'm sure that the other senders presence will agree, will test

07:11.040 --> 07:20.040
to this that I stated if the charges are true that Mr. Cohen didn't no longer serve the committee.

07:20.040 --> 07:28.040
I also stated that if the charges were not true, a wave in justice has been gone and those

07:28.040 --> 07:36.040
charges could also be removed from there, government's goal.

07:36.040 --> 07:41.040
That's an effort because it relates to that incident.

07:41.040 --> 07:52.040
The chairman would also like to test a pie on another aspect of this kind of working.

07:52.040 --> 08:00.040
A document which has been referred to several times in the force of a carry known as a powder

08:00.040 --> 08:01.040
letter.

08:01.040 --> 08:10.040
I hope some mind that I'll replace this proper perspective.

08:10.040 --> 08:15.040
I think it's well to say.

08:15.040 --> 08:20.040
I was standing many times in the past.

08:20.040 --> 08:27.040
This letter was written to the secretary of defense.

08:27.040 --> 08:40.040
One of us came to my attention many, many times from Beres' attention, where the Army had documents,

08:40.040 --> 08:53.040
documents, documents, and documents, the efforts on behalf of members of our staff to secure

08:53.040 --> 08:58.040
perfect equipment for Mr. Shawn.

08:58.040 --> 09:08.040
I had understood that this document will go to the news,

09:08.040 --> 09:15.040
but news to be submitted to other members of the Congress.

09:15.040 --> 09:21.040
The other members of Congress that I had knowledge of that were to receive this report,

09:21.040 --> 09:29.040
happened to be members on the other side of the other members of the North.

09:29.040 --> 09:34.040
I felt as a member of the majority,

09:34.040 --> 09:40.040
remember the committee who has the responsibility,

09:40.040 --> 09:46.040
who has the responsibility, who has the responsibility for our conduct,

09:46.040 --> 09:56.040
where it would be not only desirable, but it would be necessary,

09:56.040 --> 10:06.040
that the Republican members of the committee at least have the report as to the Democrat members.

10:06.040 --> 10:13.040
That was the reason for my letter to the Secretary of Defense.

10:13.040 --> 10:21.040
Mr. Chairman, I believe I have given all the pertin facts that I have pertinologist,

10:21.040 --> 10:27.040
and I have been sending my home participation in the controversy.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.040
However, there may be some other questions that the other members of the committee are comfortable

10:31.040 --> 10:37.040
to ask to question me on and I'd be happy if you could see their questions.

10:37.040 --> 10:43.040
Mr. Jenkins, I have no questions for that.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.040
The Chair has none.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.040
Senator McCollum, of course.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
Senator Jackson.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.040
Senator Jackson.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.040
Senator Dwightack.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.040
Senator Timingson.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.040
Mr. Welch.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.040
Senator McCarthy.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.040
Mr. Wendell.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.040
I think in turn, if we summed it up,

11:05.040 --> 11:13.040
it should be made clear now that the testimony over the past two weeks,

11:13.040 --> 11:17.040
with a sometimes indicated of that,

11:17.040 --> 11:21.040
the report was written because of letters from Senator Potter.

11:21.040 --> 11:34.040
It is now clear that people are tracking this letter that your letter did not shut off the writing of this report.

11:34.040 --> 11:40.040
You only asked for the report after you knew from a sizable number of courses.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.040
A certain newsman had it.

11:42.040 --> 11:46.040
A certain members of the Son of the House may have had it.

11:46.040 --> 11:52.040
And the only reason you asked for the report was not to have the report written,

11:52.040 --> 11:56.040
but to get the report because it was already being distributed.

11:56.040 --> 12:04.040
I asked the report that the majority of our committees could have the luxury report,

12:04.040 --> 12:08.040
before other members, the Congress and members of the press,

12:08.040 --> 12:12.040
would give it off without our evidence.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.040
And I asked this person,

12:14.040 --> 12:18.040
just to let the situation be served up into the far-jerk concern.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.040
When you asked for the report,

12:20.040 --> 12:26.040
you had reasonably used a certain newsman had already been given the report,

12:26.040 --> 12:30.040
and you were merely asking for what was already in existence.

12:30.040 --> 12:36.040
Because the sender knows that it was all of common knowledge.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.040
The bottom of that, before I wrote my letter,

12:38.040 --> 12:42.040
does that keep the report existing?

12:42.040 --> 12:46.040
And when we found that the report was 40-day-may,

12:46.040 --> 12:50.040
it was going out to the members of Congress.

12:50.040 --> 12:56.040
I thought that we had the duty to secure the report as well.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.040
And I wanted to reason that after.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.040
It was because my office had been kept busy answering letters about five-poher sets

13:04.040 --> 13:10.040
that the report writing off, and I've been keeping half my staff busy explaining that you did not do it.

13:10.040 --> 13:16.040
And I hope that this may suffer, so it will at least release my staff in part of their work.

13:16.040 --> 13:24.040
I felt that these were serious charges that will make.

13:24.040 --> 13:28.040
We should get to the floor to find out what the real charge is worth.

13:28.040 --> 13:32.040
But then the committee could act,

13:32.040 --> 13:37.040
and to see whether the charges were thorough or not,

13:37.040 --> 13:45.040
and we would have gone away with all this hassle that we're now confronted with in this area.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.040
Just one further question, Senator, in the last one.

13:48.040 --> 13:52.040
You were present at the meeting in my office by the way,

13:52.040 --> 13:56.040
from the 22nd or 23rd at the Colbert Gate.

13:56.040 --> 14:01.040
And I think we all agreed that if the charges were true,

14:01.040 --> 14:06.040
then of course my staff will guilty of misconduct.

14:06.040 --> 14:09.040
No, there's a sender said that.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.040
I think we all agreed to that.

14:13.040 --> 14:18.040
Did I give the senators a rundown, a resume,

14:18.040 --> 14:24.040
of the tremendous pressure that had been exerted upon me to try and get me to call off the hearings,

14:24.040 --> 14:29.040
the threats that they would administer Adams, Mr. Stevens,

14:29.040 --> 14:33.040
the issue reports charges against Mr. Cohn.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.040
At that time they had mentioned Mr. Carrier, that of the National Thought of Parents Life.

14:38.040 --> 14:42.040
At that time, as I recall, the emphasis of the strike that I told the senators of the fires,

14:42.040 --> 14:48.040
I was concerned we couldn't see threatened and blackmail out of this investigation

14:48.040 --> 14:54.040
because if we were, then we could be blackmail out of any investigation.

14:54.040 --> 15:01.040
I think the senators all agreed with me pretty much to stay from the very end.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.040
I will recall the sentence dated death.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.040
First time I heard the term, Hustle Jews, that they just stayed there.

15:09.040 --> 15:15.040
That time, that youthful, that the Army was moving by the China's Hustles,

15:15.040 --> 15:18.040
in order to call off the investigation.

15:18.040 --> 15:22.040
Well, man, man, say this is to keep the record clear and as far.

15:22.040 --> 15:26.040
I think they were using private China, I think I made that clear last time,

15:26.040 --> 15:31.040
to needle and heckle Roy Cohn.

15:31.040 --> 15:36.040
The worst hostage was not my word, that was Mr. Adams's word.

15:36.040 --> 15:41.040
I think I pointed out that the pressure on me, that nothing to do with Dave Syne,

15:41.040 --> 15:46.040
the pressure on me was that I did not take steps to call off the hearing.

15:46.040 --> 15:52.040
They would issue a report, charging Mr. Cohn with improper conduct,

15:52.040 --> 15:55.040
report with the mayor of the committee.

15:55.040 --> 16:00.040
In other words, I think it should have made sure the same that the pressure on Mr. Cohn

16:00.040 --> 16:03.040
was a constant meddling with him about his friend Syne,

16:03.040 --> 16:06.040
whom he got to come with a committee or worked for about a year for nothing.

16:06.040 --> 16:10.040
The pressure on me, or the, I use the word blackmail,

16:10.040 --> 16:14.040
advised that he was in connection with the threat,

16:14.040 --> 16:18.040
so they would issue a report if we continue to the hearing.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.040
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.040
Any other questions of Senator Potter?

16:26.040 --> 16:28.040
Senator Potter, you are on the floor.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
Thank you.

16:29.040 --> 16:35.040
And I think the chair had agreed to recognize Senator Simon in to discuss this point of order.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.040
I have to conclude, in the Senator Potter's testimony,

16:38.040 --> 16:41.040
so you recognize the Senator Simon in for that purpose now.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.040
I thank the chair.

16:42.040 --> 16:46.040
Mr. Adams, have you the written director?

16:46.040 --> 16:51.040
Is that you get bored with respect to why you cannot do this?

16:51.040 --> 16:53.040
Also, I have not.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.040
I do not succeed in getting it during the new hour.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.040
When do you think you will have it?

17:00.040 --> 17:05.040
I was present during the discussions in the new hour on the subject.

17:05.040 --> 17:09.040
I think Mr. Welch can tell you more about it than I can, sir.

17:09.040 --> 17:13.040
Mr. Chairman, did it proper for Mr. Welch to tell us about it?

17:13.040 --> 17:15.040
I presume so.

17:15.040 --> 17:19.040
Nobody objects why I'm comfortable with it.

17:19.040 --> 17:24.040
My opening and principle, how it is, the new hour is just long,

17:24.040 --> 17:28.040
and long enough that you will this kind of a favor, tick-bole,

17:28.040 --> 17:31.040
on the chart from the faces that exist.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.040
I cannot say more or less than this,

17:34.040 --> 17:41.040
and that is the situation that exists this morning still continues.

17:41.040 --> 17:45.040
That's that, the 230th of the Saturdays and the Senators.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.040
And I'm Mr. Welch.

17:46.040 --> 17:50.040
I'd like to ask you about what the law is, definitely to be free.

17:50.040 --> 17:55.040
Do you believe that you're justified in not giving the Pennsylvania to the committee?

17:55.040 --> 18:00.040
I am only relaying instructions that the Washington-Wethers may testify to,

18:00.040 --> 18:03.040
and I would like to make it clear to you, Senator,

18:03.040 --> 18:06.040
what we have on the discussion.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.040
We have an discussion,

18:09.040 --> 18:13.040
what you might call, intrasmural conferences,

18:13.040 --> 18:17.040
of the executive department on the highest level.

18:18.040 --> 18:22.040
And as of this form of this witness is instructed,

18:22.040 --> 18:27.040
that he should not develop those conferences beyond the point

18:27.040 --> 18:31.040
that he, to which he has all written, developed them in this room.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.040
For all there is to use those.

18:34.040 --> 18:38.040
These things were put in voluntarily by the witnesses.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.040
As I'll remember it, somebody asked him if he was second into man,

18:41.040 --> 18:44.040
and he said, I believe he was 30 seconds.

18:44.040 --> 18:49.040
And I know what point is kept to the high level, or middle level, or low level.

18:49.040 --> 18:53.040
I'd like to ask you at the meeting that you had today,

18:53.040 --> 18:57.040
was there any discussion of an executive order or a decree that was justified

18:57.040 --> 19:01.040
a position that you have allowed your counsel to take?

19:01.040 --> 19:04.040
There was not time for every client to ask you to meet me.

19:04.040 --> 19:08.040
Any serious discussion, but the answer to your question is to an executive order,

19:08.040 --> 19:11.040
the answer is in the negative.

19:11.040 --> 19:15.040
I'll be sharing your thinking to a logical conclusion.

19:15.040 --> 19:20.040
Does it mean that a chairman of this committee could refuse to discuss parts of conversations

19:20.040 --> 19:24.040
that he'd had with members of his staff which were unfavorable,

19:24.040 --> 19:29.040
and just give this committee parts of conversations which might be good for his court?

19:29.040 --> 19:32.040
But I have that right, please.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.040
I'll read it again, I'll shorten it for you.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.040
Trying to discuss some conclusions.

19:37.040 --> 19:42.040
Does it mean that a chairman of the committee could refuse to discuss parts of conversations

19:42.040 --> 19:47.040
that he'd had with members of his staff which were unfavorable to him the chairman

19:47.040 --> 19:52.040
and just give excerpts which might be good for his cause?

19:52.040 --> 19:56.040
Well, if I have to answer that, that would seem to be very unfair.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.040
Sir, Senator, could I say this to you?

19:59.040 --> 20:02.040
I am at the moment a bearer of messages.

20:02.040 --> 20:08.040
I am not a formulator of policies or executive rulings or orders or directives.

20:08.040 --> 20:14.040
And as of this moment, a discussion between you and me, I think will not be productive.

20:14.040 --> 20:21.040
I have said once before in this room that I am used to being a trial lawyer and developing facts in the court room,

20:21.040 --> 20:29.040
but this area, if you don't mind, I'm saying it's rendered and it seems to me a little beyond my depth.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.040
Mr. Welchip is beyond your depth.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.040
Figure out how far it is beyond my depth.

20:35.040 --> 20:41.040
I must say that regardless of whether we've had trial or experience or not,

20:41.040 --> 20:47.040
I think what we're all interested in here is to get the truth, the perspective, these conversations.

20:47.040 --> 20:51.040
Now, Mr. Chairman, could I say, when I have some presidential director of the law

20:51.040 --> 20:57.040
that allows the witness to refuse to give the chairman and the committee

20:57.040 --> 21:03.040
the details of a conversation among people which he voluntarily put into the record?

21:03.040 --> 21:08.040
I would respectfully request the chairman to instruct him to give those details.

21:08.040 --> 21:12.040
Mr. Chairman, could I say one more word in the senator?

21:12.040 --> 21:16.040
In respect of what you said a moment ago about my relation to you,

21:16.040 --> 21:20.040
it is not possible for us that you could be as much of an amateur as I am.

21:20.040 --> 21:24.040
I am the world's leading amateur, I should say, in this field.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.040
As is the second point of ordering the witness to answer,

21:28.040 --> 21:31.040
we're towards the end of an adjournment when the weekend is coming up.

21:31.040 --> 21:36.040
And I should say that with more time before the position in respect of this witness

21:36.040 --> 21:45.040
should be susceptible of clarification at the hands of people, wiser than Welchip.

21:45.040 --> 21:50.040
So if you don't, if the senator would not mind passing the thing for the moment

21:50.040 --> 21:55.040
that we have a weekend coming up and on Monday morning it would seem to be entirely proper for you to press that.

21:55.040 --> 22:00.040
I would sound as the courtesy if he didn't press it now, but I have only the right to say please.

22:00.040 --> 22:08.040
Mr. Chairman, I am beginning to fall for Mr. Welch too.

22:08.040 --> 22:14.040
Very well, Mr. President, till Monday morning, does an agreement to say Mr. Welch has done his time.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.040
Before the question you, Mr. Adams, again,

22:16.040 --> 22:22.040
is why we have the opportunity to return to our studio to cross the country to permit our safety to identify themselves.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.040
This is ABC Television Network.

22:31.040 --> 22:35.040
An important message from Senator Smatters about the Miami Dory.

22:35.040 --> 22:43.040
This picture ably shows what a two courageous citizens, honest politicians and just alert police agencies can do

22:43.040 --> 22:47.040
to rid their cities of ganglands in Troy.

22:47.040 --> 22:52.040
See the Miami Dory now at the time on Twitter, on Twitter.

22:52.040 --> 22:59.040
Modern House fatality calls for light refreshments, auto-peckty by the Carpennotase and the Dorgas, refreshed without filling.

22:59.040 --> 23:03.040
A full-sea lift will be advanced.

23:03.040 --> 23:10.040
Son on the call means like you said, why others should be accused of investigating in this area?

23:11.040 --> 23:23.040
For, if any matter relevant to developing the whole facts and truth is being withheld by someone else,

23:23.040 --> 23:31.040
or this witness is being instructed to withhold that information from this committee,

23:32.040 --> 23:43.040
I shall infest Mr. Cameron, that those witnesses be subpoenaed and bought here to tell what they know about it.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.040
I say that before.

23:46.040 --> 23:53.040
As I have repeated often, for me these charges are serious.

23:53.040 --> 24:00.040
And that there was someone higher than Mr. Adams and Mr. Stevens.

24:00.040 --> 24:11.040
That was directing their actions and if their actions are found to be wrong, this committee has a right to know.

24:11.040 --> 24:18.040
Even from the high level, what transpires?

24:18.040 --> 24:29.040
The calls, if the allegation is true, staff members of this committee and the chairman to be smeared, if that is true,

24:30.040 --> 24:36.040
we have a right to know who is invited and who advised and counseled that as he done.

24:36.040 --> 24:52.040
On the other hand, Mr. Stevens, if the charges are true, that this army was being pressured and threatened and intimidated in court,

24:53.040 --> 25:00.040
in to take in the action or the attempted action, the security attempted action,

25:00.040 --> 25:13.040
or the favorable assignment for the party involved and would be entrusted with hearings to put the army in a bad light,

25:13.040 --> 25:19.040
drive the secretary out of office, direct the army in the nature of the war against the army,

25:20.040 --> 25:28.040
then we entitled and all that and so far as I'm concerned, unless something can be shown to me some law.

25:28.040 --> 25:33.040
I don't know there's an executive order will suffice in my case.

25:33.040 --> 25:42.040
I'll ask the president of the United States to come, but ask who others who participated in it.

25:42.040 --> 25:49.040
Mr. Chairman, I think they are focused witnesses if their testimony is relevant to any issue,

25:49.040 --> 25:51.040
but it's now before this committee.

25:51.040 --> 25:55.040
Mr. Roosevelt, Senator Simonton, do you point out?

25:55.040 --> 26:04.040
Is it my understanding from Mr. Wells or Mr. Adam that we will not pursue this subject this afternoon,

26:04.040 --> 26:11.040
which incidentally, is perhaps the most important conference of all because it's far as much if not most of all,

26:11.040 --> 26:13.040
this business started.

26:13.040 --> 26:18.040
Is it my understanding that we will not pursue this matter this afternoon with the definite understanding

26:18.040 --> 26:25.040
that the position of whoever gave the order to Mr. Adam will be furnished and writing to the committee on Monday morning?

26:25.040 --> 26:28.040
I think it's fair to say that.

26:28.040 --> 26:32.040
There just wasn't time that that's lunch to do things.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.040
I just want to make the right of straight-off.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.040
I think that, Mr. Adam.

26:36.040 --> 26:41.040
Very well, Mr. Chair, so just now we proceed to a little bit out of order to the Chair's strangers,

26:41.040 --> 26:44.040
listen from his colleagues, support enough.

26:44.040 --> 26:50.040
Could I move out of order all these statements which can slow down the hearings in some time,

26:50.040 --> 26:53.040
but the Chair recognizes that the United States Senate,

26:53.040 --> 26:58.040
Chair of the Presiding Officer, doesn't have the authority to adjust.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.040
Could I say one more word?

27:01.040 --> 27:03.040
Chair, the point is, I think so.

27:03.040 --> 27:08.040
I don't want Senator Simonton to overestimate my authority or power.

27:08.040 --> 27:13.040
It seems to be normal to expect a written communication.

27:13.040 --> 27:18.040
If someone were to say no and all one is going to be at I can't control that,

27:18.040 --> 27:22.040
that my own deal is, sir, just that of an individual trial lawyer.

27:22.040 --> 27:26.040
It's not unreasonable to hold for a written statement.

27:26.040 --> 27:29.040
From Mr. Chairman, with all great difference to Mr. Welton,

27:29.040 --> 27:32.040
to the Chairman, we have a long mishearing.

27:32.040 --> 27:35.040
In this discussion, we've said a pass over the order,

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
which they said they'd get to say it the noon.

27:37.040 --> 27:41.040
Why then, we wouldn't have any discussion.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.040
We're speaking in order, Mr. Welton.

27:44.040 --> 27:48.040
I think the clock had gotten around to you to interrogate Mr. Adam.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.040
If you have questions just at this time.

27:50.040 --> 27:53.040
I'm Mr. Simpler.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.040
I think nothing at this pass.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.040
Senator McCarthy or Mr. Combe.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.040
You have 10 minutes.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.040
Just a few questions.

28:02.040 --> 28:07.040
Anybody feel any of them?

28:07.040 --> 28:12.040
Mr. Adams, I've been listening to your testimony.

28:12.040 --> 28:19.040
I have been especially interested in the threats that Mr. Combe made to you.

28:19.040 --> 28:31.040
Do I understand the threats consistent of threats to try and continue the investigation of Combe?

28:31.040 --> 28:39.040
No, I don't think he ever made a threat that he would try and continue the investigation of Combe.

28:39.040 --> 28:48.040
Senator McCarthy, I don't think he ever said that.

28:48.040 --> 28:52.040
Or any of the threats will fail.

28:52.040 --> 29:03.040
Well, as I have testified, it seemed to me that the culmination of the threats was the...

29:03.040 --> 29:04.040
People are...

29:04.040 --> 29:12.040
I say it seemed to me that the culmination of the threats was the...

29:12.040 --> 29:15.040
...law of the board of the Navy.

29:15.040 --> 29:18.040
But you've decided to describe the threats that Mr. Combe prepared to do.

29:18.040 --> 29:25.040
It seemed to me, Senator McCarthy, that the culmination of the threats was the law of the board of the Navy.

29:25.040 --> 29:32.040
Now, Mr. Adams, before the investigation of Combe and the Central Traitling Army as you know,

29:32.040 --> 29:37.040
where you conducted an investigation of Combe and the Central Traitling the government printing off.

29:37.040 --> 29:44.040
During that investigation, I state many numbers of times as I did during the investigation.

29:44.040 --> 29:48.040
I wonder if the target was one side of this little bit of the S-place.

29:48.040 --> 29:53.040
During the investigation of Combe and the Central Traitling the government printing off,

29:53.040 --> 30:00.040
I state many numbers of times as I did and you were there during the investigation of Combe and the Central Traitling the Army.

30:00.040 --> 30:04.040
While it was important to find the individual coming,

30:04.040 --> 30:08.040
although it was picked them up by the staff, but they were in the way to get them out of the secret positions,

30:08.040 --> 30:17.040
it was infinitely more important to find out who allows them to continue on in secret work.

30:17.040 --> 30:20.040
Now, let me ask you this.

30:20.040 --> 30:27.040
Were you not present any number of times when I made these states

30:27.040 --> 30:33.040
that we would ultimately have to call the loyalty board as the old,

30:33.040 --> 30:41.040
loyalty screening board and find out who was responsible for ordering return to secret radar work,

30:41.040 --> 30:44.040
a man with long communist records?

30:44.040 --> 30:47.040
Yes, I heard you made those statements.

30:47.040 --> 30:51.040
And that was long before any arguments that you and Mr. Cohen had with them.

30:51.040 --> 30:56.040
Yes, sir, and usually I have conversations with Mr. Cohen and Mr. Car,

30:56.040 --> 31:00.040
so the coincidences that were marked with the orders of the usually they were indicated to me

31:00.040 --> 31:03.040
that they were sure that the matter would not become issues.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.040
So, so that the, when you said a culmination with Mr. Cohen,

31:06.040 --> 31:08.040
the stress was that the man with the call of loyalty board?

31:08.040 --> 31:09.040
It seems so.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.040
We know a minute.

31:10.040 --> 31:15.040
We now know, don't we, that I made the statements, these are all a matter of record, just see.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.040
So I made the statements long before any arguments.

31:18.040 --> 31:21.040
The news Mr. Cohen, that we would have to call the loyalty board.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.040
You made that statement yesterday.

31:23.040 --> 31:28.040
So the then, that statement was not the result of an argument with the news right before?

31:28.040 --> 31:32.040
You mean that, all the data on the road?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.040
Yes.
