WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
It was possible that you might have followed me.

00:02.500 --> 00:05.500
They served in the school, but I was a man.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.500
The first of all, I'm going to sign the staff.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.500
You should write it down.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.500
Second, right.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.500
But I'm not here.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.500
That's fine.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.500
Uh.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.500
Going to the first of this meeting, I'm full of five occasions.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.500
I'm going to call the bus to button.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.500
A well-enacted baby child will be assigned to New York City.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
But his training was over.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.500
And, uh, outside of the center, south of the David's Chin,

00:37.500 --> 00:39.500
with a half of finished his training.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.500
The center, as I say, is the standard year 10 year by.

00:44.500 --> 00:48.500
He would like to have signed a sign to New York City, A.L.A.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
Now, so keep it not going.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.500
Why?

00:51.500 --> 00:53.500
He said keep the body for supposed to be as many bodies as he does.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.500
He's not going to do a five-time or so, Stephen.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.500
That's what I think they were.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.000
That's anything else you've English that you heard,

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
but I'm an...

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Attention.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Why?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
How's the way?

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
One, uh, quiet, and that was the correct.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.500
I was somewhat sensitive to this thing as this question about David Chin,

01:15.500 --> 01:18.500
being signed to New York City after his training.

01:18.500 --> 01:22.000
I don't know when it came up with, like, an question on me.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.500
Uh.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.500
By the...

01:26.500 --> 01:29.500
And finally, I signed on a card, be now.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.500
You, uh, wrote me a letter.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.500
By you think?

01:34.500 --> 01:36.500
He signed a sign.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.500
The one that I was just wrote must have checked, and ended the record.

01:39.500 --> 01:43.500
In which you, uh, I'll tell you this there.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.500
It's not the beginning.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.500
I told him to take a left hand, put on the warning.

01:48.500 --> 01:52.500
And, uh, I just want to remind you that letter.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.500
I'm the son of a...

01:54.500 --> 01:55.500
That's the particular.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.500
Follow.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.500
I'll ask you who they're not.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.500
You and some of them are quite different,

02:02.500 --> 02:05.500
but it's not the same as the last time you've got a baby shine.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.500
I love it.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.500
Um, something for the party is going to get back prepared if you have a right,

02:24.500 --> 02:26.500
and I don't like it at all.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.500
I believe you said the state that...

02:29.500 --> 02:31.500
...subject to November's 17th.

02:31.500 --> 02:35.500
You never had any conversation with Mr. Lycona with reference to Shine.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.500
That's what I call it.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.500
And so you might have conversation with the Senator who's on January 14th,

02:40.500 --> 02:42.500
to shake.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.500
For the next time.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.500
Did Mr. Frank Carr ever contact?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
You are in touch with you, Shine.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.500
Subsequent to you, there is a sudden hint of November.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.500
Just a sudden hint of November.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.500
I'll recall it a little later.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.500
Now Mr. Secretary, you stay in your paintings as I recall.

02:59.500 --> 03:06.500
That no-one else than 60,000 telephone calls were made to you.

03:06.500 --> 03:12.500
Our two years of violence, we weapons to favor resolve,

03:12.500 --> 03:15.500
cover into a treatment to baby shine.

03:15.500 --> 03:20.500
I cannot tell a phone call between the Sunday and the day of time.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.500
Follow the message you give in to maybe you mean your members would expect.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.500
Yes, sir.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.500
I...I...I...

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
...so about five weeks ago, both were well-opened.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.500
I'm sorry.

03:30.500 --> 03:35.500
You have a bizarre call, states that there were some magnitude personal contacts with you.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.500
Our members would give a response to their concerns today.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.500
That's correct, that's right.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.500
Making you total out of 84 contacts,

03:43.500 --> 03:46.500
even their impression of our telephone,

03:46.500 --> 03:48.500
we'd love to meet you in the eight position,

03:48.500 --> 03:51.500
our separate treatment for shiny left-for-ate.

03:51.500 --> 03:56.500
So I will say, Mr. Dijkens would love us to shine.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.500
We love us to shine, yet.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.500
My left-for-been-been is not all of them,

04:02.500 --> 04:06.500
but in the form of requests for means for the absences.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.500
I...

04:07.500 --> 04:10.500
...stune the duty-to-be things of that kind.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.500
I think a large number of them,

04:12.500 --> 04:15.500
or I know a large number of them, or for that first,

04:15.500 --> 04:18.500
but I would not want to say that every one of those 84 contacts

04:18.500 --> 04:21.500
in which the subject of shine was assessed well for,

04:21.500 --> 04:24.500
specific programs for three, most of my people.

04:24.500 --> 04:28.500
Only the occasion of the life conversation you have with the senior,

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
on 14th and January,

04:30.500 --> 04:33.500
you have sent many of us to pass them a human year,

04:33.500 --> 04:35.500
my things for perhaps a couple of weeks,

04:35.500 --> 04:36.500
is that correct?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.500
About three weeks, yes, sir.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.500
You really got a new period.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.500
Stay further in the month.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.500
You received the call.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.500
Our contact is personally

04:46.500 --> 04:51.500
with reference to any other soldier in the field that you're asking.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.500
In any comparable number of times,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
others are not.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.500
This period, please, I want to ask you this question.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
Did you see you?

05:11.500 --> 05:15.500
That these efforts and the gifts on the high Earth,

05:15.500 --> 05:19.500
this, that, on the hands of shine,

05:19.500 --> 05:24.500
were made by some of them at high Earth.

05:24.500 --> 05:28.500
Personally, individually,

05:28.500 --> 05:32.500
all of the United States Senator on the one hand,

05:32.500 --> 05:38.500
all of the favor made by him not only as a senator,

05:39.500 --> 05:43.500
but also as a member of the so-called

05:43.500 --> 05:46.500
my country investigating committee

05:46.500 --> 05:51.500
with all of it due to his powers, we'll say.

05:51.500 --> 05:55.500
Thought we were in question to respect to that?

05:55.500 --> 05:58.500
Well, my question was Mr. Jenkins,

05:58.500 --> 06:01.500
that Mr. Carl,

06:01.500 --> 06:04.500
my question will be written with reference to tell you

06:04.500 --> 06:05.500
what kind of a date to begin with.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.500
Yes, sir, I was going to be like that if I may.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.500
I just want to say my impression was that Mr. Carl

06:11.500 --> 06:14.500
was tremendously interested in Mr. Shawn

06:14.500 --> 06:18.500
and then having special treatment for Mr. Shawn.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.500
What do you do, Mr. Carl?

06:20.500 --> 06:23.500
How is Mr. Wright doing?

06:23.500 --> 06:25.500
In the duty,

06:25.500 --> 06:28.500
Mr. Carl occupying the powerful position

06:28.500 --> 06:32.500
that he did as chief counsel for this investigating committee.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.500
I may not be occupying the powerful position

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
that he did as chief counsel for this committee.

06:37.500 --> 06:42.500
Do you see that he's using his laws in the change?

06:42.500 --> 06:45.500
And for real, you're giving the rules of the Army

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
with reference to the treatment of the quality of the inductee

06:47.500 --> 06:48.500
or the acting.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.500
I do.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
Mr. Chairman.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.500
Mr. Chairman.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
My pleasure.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
Mr. President, Mr. Chairman,

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
I think sir,

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
that it may be well on you,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.500
Mr. President, Mr. Carl,

06:59.500 --> 07:02.500
I'm exerting that Mr. Allen was the Mr. Stevens,

07:02.500 --> 07:06.500
they have to produce the inspector general's report

07:06.500 --> 07:08.500
and the special consideration Mr. Shawn got.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
I'm curious, you know what?

07:09.500 --> 07:11.500
Special consideration you got?

07:11.500 --> 07:12.500
I may ask you, you know what?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
Now, maybe I may just accept that you did this.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.500
I've ordered Mr. Jenkins,

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
you don't mind any of this.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
I've been doing it by the end of my own mouth.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.500
Chairman, may I state that I am a copy of the close exam

07:20.500 --> 07:21.500
in the Whitney's account?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
You asked Mr. Senator to do a few questions,

07:23.500 --> 07:25.500
and I think first matters will be fair.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.500
I may be carrying my end,

07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
all members of the committee,

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
and the Council's above rise,

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
the Sunday rules that will be offering,

07:32.500 --> 07:35.500
of the count on which you proceed without a pillow.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.500
Say you want to be for a point of order,

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
and it's a little bit just right to give

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
a decumption of final thinking,

07:40.500 --> 07:43.500
if members of the committee or members of the council

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
can go into the end of the day,

07:45.500 --> 07:47.500
the question to be about that.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.500
Mr. Chairman, come on in, Mr. Counsel.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.500
I would like to, if I may,

07:52.500 --> 07:54.500
for the lecture, get some information from the chair.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.500
So we don't know if any of the members of the committee

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
are going to hear it though,

07:57.500 --> 07:59.500
after an effort to see how it happened.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.500
Now, do a final look at the problem,

08:01.500 --> 08:02.500
yes, Mr. Chairman.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.500
That's what I got to say.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.500
I'd like to know if any of the members of the committee

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
are going to work here,

08:06.500 --> 08:08.500
I see request for the trust committee over there.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.500
I'll ask the committee to follow some of my comments.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.500
The committee's going to be running out of the committee,

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
and they're going to be making sure that the committee

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
is having a good time.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.500
Thank you.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.500
You have a million to get your impressions

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
and opinions with regards to efforts

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
or pressure on our list of comments,

08:29.500 --> 08:33.500
but getting back to my previous question,

08:33.500 --> 08:35.500
with regards to some of your comments,

08:35.500 --> 08:37.500
and you will follow up, of course, in the end.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.500
I, if not asking too much,

08:40.500 --> 08:43.500
I would appreciate having a report of Mr. Taken.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.500
Councilor Taken, thank you.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.500
I don't mind if you need me, maybe.

08:48.500 --> 08:54.500
Do you consider that we as your colleagues,

08:54.500 --> 08:57.500
these conversations, these statements,

08:57.500 --> 09:01.500
you have the meeting on the part of our Senate of America,

09:01.500 --> 09:05.500
where I make that in the interest with respect to science,

09:05.500 --> 09:08.500
where I make that in the United States,

09:08.500 --> 09:10.500
personal individual,

09:10.500 --> 09:13.500
I am not a face-punder all the money.

09:13.500 --> 09:17.500
I am only a member of the hand-by-not-only United States Secretary,

09:17.500 --> 09:23.500
but I am chairman of the powerful investigating committee

09:23.500 --> 09:28.500
which he headed with all his judicial power

09:28.500 --> 09:33.500
in what capacity did you consider

09:33.500 --> 09:36.500
who was acting Mr. Stevens in these days,

09:36.500 --> 09:38.500
the press may have been mad at him.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.500
From what seconds at first,

09:41.500 --> 09:44.500
I thought that it was a...

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
You might say a sort of a personal thing in some way.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.500
That was the way it began.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.500
That is, it went along over a period of time

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
and continued to recur.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.500
And the chief counsel, Mr. Kong,

09:57.500 --> 10:01.500
I assure you, the reason was for you to be subject.

10:01.500 --> 10:05.500
I finally have no other course than to conclude

10:05.500 --> 10:08.500
that Mr. Kong's activities were with the knowledge and approval

10:08.500 --> 10:11.500
of the chairman of this committee.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.500
And I take it, did you?

10:14.500 --> 10:17.500
That these days, your close and pressures

10:17.500 --> 10:21.500
you have been taking were occurring simultaneously

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
through the investigation of this committee

10:23.500 --> 10:26.500
of a department of the Army to report my...

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
Yes sir?

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
Now, this is your second day.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.500
I will ask you whether or not in your opinion

10:32.500 --> 10:35.500
is to find high-potty anniversaries

10:35.500 --> 10:39.500
at considering any participation

10:39.500 --> 10:42.500
in this general pattern of the day.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.500
So, two interviews results.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.500
Injected to secure favors for David Shaq.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.500
I was told, Mr. Jenkins,

10:51.500 --> 10:55.500
that Mr. Kong's activity is in this connection,

10:55.500 --> 10:59.500
where extremely limited by comparison with Mr. Kong.

10:59.500 --> 11:05.500
I don't think that the nearly interesting subject

11:05.500 --> 11:10.500
was present the time when it came out.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
I don't think he did anything

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
through keeping them coming up.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
But by the same thought,

11:16.500 --> 11:19.500
in my particular first time contact with it,

11:19.500 --> 11:22.500
Mr. Kong would not have anything like this.

11:22.500 --> 11:26.500
I sure, I'm sorry, Mr. Kong.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.500
You would say generally that he was at your two position.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.500
I see one.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.500
Oh, I see.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.500
Mr. Stevens, I want to ask you this final question

11:36.500 --> 11:38.500
on direct examination.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.500
And you make him cite your counsel

11:41.500 --> 11:43.500
if you desire before you answer.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.500
Is there any other factors

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
or any other factors or circumstances?

11:49.500 --> 11:52.500
Against the board to the charge you have made against

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
the investigating committee.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.500
About which I have not asked you on direct examination

11:57.500 --> 12:00.500
that you now want to relate to this committee.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.500
Yes.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.500
I think Mr. Jenkins,

12:25.500 --> 12:30.500
I think that Mr. Adams has a great deal of information

12:30.500 --> 12:33.500
that will be prepared in which is related to many of them.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.500
Arioles employees will push either way

12:35.500 --> 12:37.500
or they can contact with it.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.500
I'm talking about matters that you need

12:39.500 --> 12:41.500
with him, your own personal knowledge.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.500
I think I've got a substantial call about sir.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.500
This is in the form of a statement.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.500
Councilor McRae.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
You appreciate the fight Mr. Adams with my position

12:54.500 --> 12:56.500
is there a peculiar of Mr. Stevens

12:56.500 --> 13:01.500
that my position is if you're on representing the committee.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
That is any neither army nor the senator

13:03.500 --> 13:06.500
or the senator or members of his family.

13:10.500 --> 13:17.500
And in a proper place of the value of your testimony,

13:17.500 --> 13:21.500
a proper evaluation act.

13:21.500 --> 13:26.500
A cost examination is proper so that the committee's attention

13:26.500 --> 13:30.500
may be called to any matter of the top of the sign out

13:30.500 --> 13:32.500
of the contract.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.500
You appreciate that.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.500
Yes sir.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.500
You further know that the Chinese have been prepared against you

13:39.500 --> 13:43.500
and Mr. Adams by some of the members of his family.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.500
Yes sir.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
You know what?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
You shall be gone.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.500
Yes sir.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.500
Mr. Stevens.

13:54.500 --> 14:15.500
You shall excuse a name against the foreigner

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
and the foreigner.

14:17.500 --> 14:24.500
Now I excuse you in making the power of the pre-legal,

14:24.500 --> 14:28.500
as you're in the mud, mud, and mud.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.500
You can even make mud aside.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.500
I remember this fact.

14:34.500 --> 14:38.500
You should not cover it in your opinion.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.500
To have due consideration.

14:42.500 --> 14:46.500
To the work in which they would shine with indistence,

14:46.500 --> 14:51.500
rule this committee, and to the work in which the committee was engaged.

14:51.500 --> 14:56.500
If I ride in your opinion, I think forward title of your election consideration.

14:56.500 --> 15:06.500
In short, it's going to call my third emergency or any number of its back.

15:06.500 --> 15:12.500
With reference, we will say to me who is not a financial man.

15:12.500 --> 15:16.500
Might be considered a new human extraordinary.

15:16.500 --> 15:24.500
And you might consider what unparalleled pressure was being brought to bear for me, that's correct?

15:24.500 --> 15:27.500
I'm a vice-chair that I didn't quite follow that purpose.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.500
All right.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.500
I'll do it again.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.500
I'm going to let Senator McCarthy and the members of his staff,

15:35.500 --> 15:41.500
could he even say a dozen calls for a man who was engaged in monocency work?

15:41.500 --> 15:46.500
A few stickers and I mean no reflection on a ditch sticker.

15:46.500 --> 15:54.500
Might not be considered a election number times for intercession on behalf of that particular individual.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.500
That's it.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.500
I still have a lower hand.

16:00.500 --> 16:09.500
That number calls and that number contacts were made by and on behalf of a man

16:09.500 --> 16:17.500
who had special training in the expedition of the Spionage and the Vimperation of Communism

16:17.500 --> 16:21.500
in the Army and other departments of the government.

16:21.500 --> 16:27.500
Whose work was a vital importance to the nation of the French and security?

16:27.500 --> 16:32.500
I mean, those circumstances Mr. Cingles is a novice hero for me.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.500
But the same number of calls for him for the letter in the sky

16:36.500 --> 16:40.500
if my aim were not to be considered ex-yodinate.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
I think it would be compared to straw now.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.500
And if I may, so I might as well back to your first question on the subject,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
because I'm not sure why.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
I misunderstood.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
It tends to me, if I'm quickly being raised,

16:51.500 --> 16:55.500
that I still be ex-yodinate for one man will not be ex-yodinate for another,

16:55.500 --> 16:58.500
but taking on the gaiic you work to maintain a malignment.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.500
Or they couldn't be a worker so I thought that was what I'm getting at.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.500
Now I miss my even rather last again, I need a source.

17:04.500 --> 17:08.500
I do not know if I'm your first costume giver dealing with this situation.

17:08.500 --> 17:13.500
You asked me a question about the whether or not this was proper

17:13.500 --> 17:18.500
to take your David Shines qualifications into account for something about it.

17:18.500 --> 17:24.500
I think the place and time to do that Mr. Jenkins was prior to his being drafted.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.500
Now, after he was drafted by selective service,

17:28.500 --> 17:31.500
which is a complete way in the common arm of the government.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.500
I think once they selected for this process have worked,

17:35.500 --> 17:39.500
but it was then he come in upon some of the powerful of his staff

17:39.500 --> 17:42.500
not to make the call, but as you refer to the to the army.

17:42.500 --> 17:46.500
Then here's your opinion that I choose the processes

17:46.500 --> 17:49.500
of the draft to have been fully completed, I should give you.

17:49.500 --> 17:53.500
And the subject is gaiic you're living in the army.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.500
That would be a good question to this politician to the character of work

17:57.500 --> 18:02.500
in which you engage the investigation of what's been on your other lines.

18:02.500 --> 18:08.500
But any effort on the part of this in your own is probably a very clear

18:08.500 --> 18:11.500
effort I mean, I could rely on it with all my might.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.500
And anyway, I have to work through the testing that we do with all the voices

18:15.500 --> 18:18.500
coming to the audience, the work of solidifications work,

18:18.500 --> 18:22.500
and it's a satin McCarthy, one of the call of the law attention.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.500
But I have no objection to it.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.500
But I do, Jack.

18:28.500 --> 18:33.500
I'll apply to the amount of attention that was devoted

18:33.500 --> 18:35.500
to Mr. Secretary Case.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.500
Mr. Secretary, he's not a fact.

18:38.500 --> 18:44.500
That you did make concessions today with shine with reference

18:44.500 --> 18:48.500
to these evidences, this pipe is et cetera.

18:49.500 --> 18:55.500
Mr. Jenkins, we bailed and our reason we bailed is because as I said on Friday,

18:55.500 --> 19:02.500
we did not want, I was not wanting army to begin the position of obstructing

19:02.500 --> 19:07.500
the work of a committee of Congress that at that time was engaged in investigating the army.

19:07.500 --> 19:11.500
And the war, since this conform to this committee's fire,

19:11.500 --> 19:17.500
has been tightened by selective service and have been adopted in the army or was involved with it.

19:18.500 --> 19:23.500
My position was that in the tightening of process, from the time he left his assignment

19:23.500 --> 19:31.500
and served the worst committee, I'm sure he became a hundred percent honest product.

19:31.500 --> 19:35.500
But it was reasonable during that change over our transition period.

19:35.500 --> 19:40.500
But he should be not available for come to be closed, and for come to be closed so long.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.500
And you did not put all this training, and you do it, Jack.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.500
Yes sir.

19:44.500 --> 19:49.500
And he was given an extra mailing, large number of paces and ease evidences, wasn't he?

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
That's correct.

19:50.500 --> 19:57.500
And Mr. Stevens got this because he was a consultant on a committee, attempting to end our

19:57.500 --> 20:00.500
tracking down the location of communism in the army, what that's right.

20:00.500 --> 20:05.500
That's right, now it's starting to last as a major chemist.

20:06.500 --> 20:15.500
I ask you now to give the Stevens version by the first investment.

20:15.500 --> 20:23.500
All the investigations by Senator McIntyre and his staff are for tomorrow.

20:25.500 --> 20:32.500
I want you in version of the work that was done by the Senator and his staff.

20:33.500 --> 20:40.500
The guy should work with me, the impartanth of the mere opinion, the most sensitive by our

20:40.500 --> 20:45.500
own lack of necessity by our religion to put them on.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.500
All right sir.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.500
From the Vietnam Hoganney panel, caucus room in the Senate office building in Washington,

20:52.500 --> 20:56.500
mutual has been bringing you special coverage of the congressional hearings in Senator Joseph

20:56.500 --> 20:57.500
on a condition.

20:57.500 --> 21:02.500
Sorry, I'm on October 8, 1953.

21:02.500 --> 21:08.500
I assume that I've worked with the unbiased powers of this committee, tired of silly,

21:08.500 --> 21:11.500
opening up those hearings.

21:11.500 --> 21:19.500
The army, it's out, how it was been carrying on, been by the Victoria work, as it was

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
in the last month.

21:50.500 --> 21:59.500
We, under the new criteria of the new administration, matters of the security, working on the

21:59.500 --> 22:03.500
cases, whether it's the mood, any possible questions.

22:03.500 --> 22:12.500
I ask you, prior to the panel, prior to the formal opening of the fourth month carrying

22:13.500 --> 22:21.500
the six suspensions from the Vietnam, prior to the security briefs.

22:21.500 --> 22:26.500
In other words, the two are in the video.

22:26.500 --> 22:32.500
We're not, but it's no question of the world involved by two, so one of the members is

22:32.500 --> 22:33.500
to receive it.

22:33.500 --> 22:39.500
The law to call information or because the person might talk too much if I think of that time,

22:39.500 --> 22:44.500
I don't know if I just, well, it was not, I would say, but for the sake of the force

22:44.500 --> 22:48.500
suspended, high, out of eight, maybe two security briefs.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.500
But for tomorrow, they might have been, for a month, they might have been, I'm sorry, and

22:52.500 --> 22:57.500
you're saying that the labor to come here as your self-report, the effort for you

22:57.500 --> 23:02.500
and you can see a not-that-a-remarkable committee, that's correct, that's right.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.500
She's not in the picture.

23:03.500 --> 23:08.500
How often you open up a panel here in the present, and you might have been, now follow her.

23:08.500 --> 23:13.500
They are until very far in the opening of the hearings and up to this time.

23:13.500 --> 23:19.500
As well as them, an additional, by-man, out of suspension.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.500
As you are, no, no.

23:21.500 --> 23:26.500
When my husband looks at me, no, sir, as you result, I might have been in the last

23:26.500 --> 23:31.500
this way, if I may, because I don't think you've done a lot of an external work for

23:31.500 --> 23:33.500
person, I might have been in the first place.

23:33.500 --> 23:38.500
So, he's going in, I think, maybe we're in powder to a year, so no, I can, when can you

23:38.500 --> 23:39.500
certainly find this right?

23:39.500 --> 23:44.500
But if you can't, I should get to know I choose for both, where you can, you know my question.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
But do I want to answer?

23:46.500 --> 23:51.500
He's saying you, the new procuring with suspension of six million.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.500
So, when you need calls to support Mama?

23:54.500 --> 23:55.500
That's right.

23:55.500 --> 24:02.500
Now, I think it's in this record, the fund and the labor for Mama feels the size of a labor

24:02.500 --> 24:07.500
institution, if not, as much of a process, but I'm a person who's a member of this

24:07.500 --> 24:10.500
tremendous company, the security relationship, that's right.

24:10.500 --> 24:16.500
And time is where we're going to be, again, the attorney can manage your Mama for

24:16.500 --> 24:17.500
other people's rights.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.500
I will.

24:20.500 --> 24:24.500
Well, if it's one of those rights, I guess, for a one-hour, so I'll write on it, sir.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.500
Go away.

24:25.500 --> 24:30.500
Now, you have to, for you, this is $16 million, is that correct?

24:30.500 --> 24:31.500
That's right.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.500
Now, we need to be interested in some of the rights, and we'll take you.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.500
That's right.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.500
We are.

24:36.500 --> 24:37.500
Now, we will.

24:37.500 --> 24:42.500
And of course, we have this timing, and when the time comes, we will get to the right.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.500
That's right.

24:43.500 --> 24:49.500
I need to look at the experience, to study those rules, both of you are still meeting state.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.500
Uh, Mr. Giants, I'm out of it.

24:52.500 --> 24:58.500
If you are still a good man, my story is about support Mama and I, but I want to go to that,

24:58.500 --> 25:00.500
first of my, I do it.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
I'm the other man.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.500
If you want to learn the details of everything, the world of cases, also have got no experience

25:05.500 --> 25:12.500
during their body with this simple question, where any of them or any of these states are

25:12.500 --> 25:16.500
in the brain, this week, out of the way, I can't answer that, but I can so well, because I will

25:16.500 --> 25:18.500
be co-hosted 25 before involved.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.500
So, I shall reiterate to stand at that final nine-hour.

25:21.500 --> 25:27.500
But 13 of those have been ruined so far, non-cumpling positions that will be placed

25:27.500 --> 25:32.500
by a fellow hard job for our failure and not for a hard time, but for the sure of not

25:32.500 --> 25:33.500
for a good one.

25:33.500 --> 25:40.500
Now, last night, I was here to the back of Mr. Dustball, no titles of, uh, a commissioned

25:40.500 --> 25:45.500
certain, as I'm pretty good at, to a 50-13 key.

25:45.500 --> 25:51.500
And so, we are, and we're going toward our non-cumpling positions, and we are going to
