00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
I'll wait for the dogs when they're not asking him what he is.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
My line for the dog has been lost.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
But I have to be no, but when I have to go back,

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
the dog has gone back on its day, but I think it's a part of the truth.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
I don't know what you're going to do with me.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
I just have to find a way to get out of here.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm going to get out of here.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
You know what I'm going to do with me.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
But don't you consider this a sexy whale with a clown?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Is it real?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Is it a little picture of a professional clown?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
It's a man.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
And I'm just about to be in a special position with him climbing up.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
One is co-comming with the clowns.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
There's a fucking broken person.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
And you can see that the little clowns can make me run about.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
They'll steal our food.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
How many?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I don't think I can answer that.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Let's go now.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I'll follow the command staff, but I don't have an afternoon of it now.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
At least for the body of, well, I'm just a function officer.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm a professional officer.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Now, for the public, it's a public education officer.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
But a person I'm just a person, I'm a poet.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
He is responsible.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
He's trying to get out of here.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
He's taking a lot of, he's fluctuating his social.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Well, the action original was the man in officer

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
of a particular installation.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
That goes, that is general law.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
General, general law has worked with your mind.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Was that correct?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
It'll make you make sure you're correct.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
You should come to make it by here, my little boy.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
But it's revealed by the first time he's a father's and then reveals

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
that in the Department of the Army,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
father's not a screening board.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
In that way, the installation was all about my own personal excuse.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm a personal, I feel like I'm out of one of the officers.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And the sole reason is that a government called a cop

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
and one will be the champion who will not be the subject

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
of the blade, but he quickly reveals the fact

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
that I'm a cop, a cop, a committee, are you?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
And I find that you're still a cop.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Not so, I don't know.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm trying to minimize the efforts of the community.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
I have some time to show how well I know what I'm going to go.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't know.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
This kind of work is a good work.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
I have one respect for my own fellow lawyers.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
But it was a very good work.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
A very good, a very good, a very good lawyer.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Now that's pretty much what the truth is.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
You're looking used to it.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
That's very good.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
That it was a great way to overcome your situation.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
That's right.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
All right.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Please.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Mr. Stevens, I believe that you have already figured

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
that you are subject to the Army.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
We're finally in just moving, moving out, some virtues.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Although without a little of a good question,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I feel like I'm a cop, a cop.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I got it.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
What's up?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I can speak with some of the most fascinating stuff

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
we've been waiting for.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I'm looking.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm not, I can say, the Senate of the Nazi Amphus Barrett,

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
a short investigation, a smooth about the somehow

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
expect the suspension of some people.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
But we have information about all of the people

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
and the action world is open, but they should be able to

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
have a good time.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
So what's up?

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm here with you because I'm not going to take an heavy

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
misdeed right now.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
You're going to be right.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm not going to take any of this.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
There's going to be a lot of money.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
All right.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
So what's the reason behind this?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I'm going to take a little bit of security regulations.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I don't know.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
All of these types of places for a phoenix, but under.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I know it is you.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I will believe you.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
You're going to be able to have a good time.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
You're going to be able to have a good time.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
That's it.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
But I'm going to have a good time.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
You're going to be able to have a good time.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Do you want me to answer?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I don't.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
I don't want you to know.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
You're going to be science.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
You'll be able to speak to me this Wednesday.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I think I'll throw it out now.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
I don't want it.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
It's very well.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I don't know if anyone has suggestions.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Any questions?

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Or do I have a call on my colleague as I see him?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And I'll see this place.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Who the heavens doesn't take company?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
They're well-expected.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
I've provided.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
There was certain expats.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Some of the places in which the assumptions are slight.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
They go back and go back to the court.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
And you will fail, though.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
From what I've done, it's not.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
You will have an impact.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
People will work.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But in the hands of my particular.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I am the new of the audience.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
In the discussion of communist struggle for peace,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
whatever you want in all of them.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
In the army, I am the old election worker.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
I'm a person that I have to ask the reporter

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
because it's around a long one.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm not sure I've got it.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
The speech is actually...

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
And you will say that you have a word out of my colleague.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm a person who will work.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I don't want the message to be good.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I'm doing my lesson.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm going to be taking the communist for real.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I'm going to be a warrior of power.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
In the hands of my younger brother,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I'm going to be a great friend.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
But I'm very great at this.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm going to secure the lesson.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Glory to the citizens.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I've got a power for no question about that.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
We are all in a court.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I'm asking for it.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And we are the only thing I would like

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
when the God of the Westerners, Mr. Jenkins,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
that's the...

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
In my opinion, some of the parties in vertical education

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
just school out to the police

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
and in certain number of places.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I would be lying so that in respect

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
with the overall situation

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
which is referred to in your country.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
But I think it will be in some of that

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
because we have not...

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
It's certainly the...

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
of lovely tactics.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
There's one way with this in vertical education.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I would like to talk to that bit a lot of hard, a lot of ways.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
We try to put them in a car.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
We can leave it here.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
You can vote for the conditions you can pay.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Well, whatever.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
It's time to record the old and executive discussion.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
The person's right, I'm sure.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Not with it.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
The person's right, not with it.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Not with it.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Not with it.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
But the company's question is over.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
It's not in the car.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
It gives them a round of...

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
of how we pay us the things past five.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And I feel that...

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Right along.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
It'sאק...

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I'd like to hear...

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
of...

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
the information...

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
and...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
an excitement would cause...

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
battle of force.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
It's just how I have to make things that can be questioned.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And this is something that you want to stop in, do you?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
What?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm not...

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
what do you want to work for?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm not...

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
what nutritious information is that I think you...

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
that's why I want to stop.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
You can learn to stop, but...

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Now, I want to tell you...

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
maybe against your needs,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
that you start to describe this committee...

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
and the importance of the work.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I'll be an hour to head for Stanker.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I'll ask you to meet the however...

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
to hear this morning on the dismiss ban.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
The only thing that's so pretty is for the seat.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I'll be done now.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
That's what I think about...

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
given them color for having extra battles...

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
to a certain extent, some of us places the first month.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Haven't you hear all the different standards...

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
morning, then the mall, and then the cars...

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
and so do we work?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
In the institutional form of money...

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I've told you that they work for that, but anyhow...

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm sorry, but you probably told us this...

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
how was it the opening?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
You probably seem like you lost a fine one hour...

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
so, when you know that...

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and Mr. Murrath, I...

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Mr. Steven...

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
the mall, for me, and me...

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
you know, Mr. Stanker, nice to meet you.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I'll have to six months...

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
to show you by April 21, no.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
How's the way you're going to go, though?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I'll go ahead with the money committee...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
if that's not correct.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
That's it.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Now, if you find food, you'll just find food...

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
for the human safety of those men.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I don't know what I can do about information...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
under people.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I mean, if you violate the collective...

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
of confidential information, I would throw a question in...

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
is that you're injured?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Yes, sir. I'll try to transfer it off...

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
and then find it.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't think I'd like to put it in.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Ma'am, be me.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Mr. Steven, as you understand...

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
when you understood that law...

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
but one of the things that's far from...

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
is this day coming to you...

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
whose work you were talking about...

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
was one of the key things that you shyed...

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
that the political body did not get hurt.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Did you understand that he was...

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
some modern-less guy on Hollywood's own?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
I know.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
But...

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
with the least weight...

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
passing on up right...

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I think I'm over here.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I'll be back over here.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
You can leave me alone.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Hello, the car has gone so...

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I might have heard of an orange car...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
and one so Mr. Tampon.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I hand you over.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Keep it inside.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
We are here in Calvary.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Come and get the coffee.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
It's got funny letters.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I will follow the question outside of the way.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
30.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
30.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
30.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
30.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
30.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
30.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
30.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Mr. Tampon has been trying to find a letter...

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
from which...

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
some stray students apparently had...

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
a private girl, a private child, on one occasion...

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
a copy of a pink letter, which is a private...

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
suppose if it was written.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Here it was now.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
This is 3-E...

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
well, a copy of a letter.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Maybe it was better.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I love a JP.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
He's a nice, private girl.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
He's an annual athlete in this thing.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Now, we're Mr. Steven.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
I love that.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I'm just saying, but from the telephone.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I love that.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm from a time, sending the E.U.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
a copy of the information of the...

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
which I hope you will find on this thing.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
If it's left for a patient,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
we'll see you in the early morning.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
And I wish to thank your brother and your people...

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
who were both responsible for our family years.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
She's going to challenge...

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
chief consultant...

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
federal investment fund committee...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
where your police is running up...

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Mr. Tampon, I'm just going to find a way.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
And one time, the committee will earn...

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
you will see...

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
the original of that letter together...

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
with an increased...

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
internal confirmation of cognizant by...

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
deepening the sound...

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
which I like about now...

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
and give me years to like now.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
What's up, think I will call this now?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Mr. Jenkins.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm not JP Steven's...

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
but Thomas Lowe's a girl.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
But thank you very much.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm not going to receive the letter because...

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
now we're having seen a copy of this...

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
a post contract.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And now I'm not going to call...

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
a law-tended or meeting...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
a post committee in a positive fashion...

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
on set, on the site, post 1943...

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
and no doubt...

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
very soon I'm not going to spoken over about this thing...

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
at that time.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
You do so right for the same...

14:04.000 --> 14:13.000
...

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I'm going to tell you the thing.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
The first time I've seen you...

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I'm going to...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
talk to you about...

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
the...

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
...

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
...

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
...

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
...

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
...

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
...

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
You know what?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
The proposal...

15:02.000 --> 15:02.000


15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
...

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
...

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
...

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
How do you rather...

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
...

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
...

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
