WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
Had a situation.

00:04.120 --> 00:07.120
Had Fort Momet.

00:07.120 --> 00:11.520
That's the biggest problem that I know they had.

00:11.520 --> 00:19.640
They did have at least two persons, a communist or extremely pro-communist whom they suspended

00:19.640 --> 00:22.800
in the New York area.

00:22.800 --> 00:28.000
Do you think comparable conditions existed in other army installations?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
I don't know.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.400
I've read pieces in the paper, but I don't know.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.200
I don't know except they do it.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.200
Your experience is official.

00:37.200 --> 00:44.280
FBI didn't you have an opportunity to contact work with the Department of the Army?

00:44.280 --> 00:51.280
Haven't you been aware of the activities of the Department in regard to this subversive

00:51.280 --> 00:52.280
program?

00:52.280 --> 01:01.280
Well, in my own personal experience with the FBI, I had very little contact with the Army

01:01.280 --> 01:05.480
intelligence agencies, personal contact with the Army intelligence agencies.

01:05.480 --> 01:10.840
We realize that the result of the prodding of the investigations subcommittee at Fort

01:10.840 --> 01:15.320
Momet, the Army probably has been accelerating its work there.

01:15.320 --> 01:22.240
Do you think that if the subcommittee were to withdraw entirely from its investigations

01:22.240 --> 01:29.920
there and in other army installations, there would be a tendency to coddle subversives

01:29.920 --> 01:33.240
and security risks within the Army?

01:33.240 --> 01:40.280
I don't think at this time the Army is going to coddle any security risks.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.040
No sir, I think there's enough attention that's been drawn to it.

01:43.040 --> 01:48.480
I think the Army will do a fast job of trying to get rid of communists.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.720
You can conceive of no reason why they should do otherwise, are you?

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
No sir.

01:53.720 --> 01:59.680
You think therefore you will conceive that the American people have no reason to be apprehensive

01:59.680 --> 02:04.400
about just the part of the Army for having your part on as a wife?

02:04.400 --> 02:08.320
Actively working within the Army?

02:08.320 --> 02:14.920
Well, I think that the American people might well be apprehensive about the questions of

02:14.920 --> 02:18.920
espionage at all times within the Army and without it.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.920
The communists are always vigilant.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.520
I think the American people should be vigilant also.

02:24.520 --> 02:30.840
Well, you also will conceive that Secretary Stevens as a patriotic of American ought to be

02:30.840 --> 02:36.360
interested in rooting out, exposing these subversive forces wherever they may be found within

02:36.360 --> 02:37.360
the Army?

02:37.360 --> 02:44.400
Yes sir, and I might say in regards that with the subcommittee there was never any question

02:44.400 --> 02:50.120
of Secretary Stevens, not being anxious to rid the Army of communists.

02:50.120 --> 02:55.320
The only trouble came when the subcommittee wanted to find out who was responsible for

02:55.320 --> 02:59.000
allowing the communists to be there.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.840
You think then at lower levels there was a tendency to cover up and protect those who

03:03.840 --> 03:08.400
had been too lenient and too tolerant in dealing with this particular problem?

03:08.400 --> 03:12.400
I think that has been, I don't know whether it's still exists.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.400
You don't know why I can't?

03:13.400 --> 03:16.000
I don't know whether it's still exists now, I think that has been.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
You think that has been?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yes.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.200
You think that in the future there will be a greater inclination to do an effective job?

03:23.200 --> 03:30.520
Well, yes sir, I think that's true of not only Army but the Navy and all executive branches

03:30.520 --> 03:32.640
or legislative branches.

03:32.640 --> 03:42.480
Whenever you have an expoze of some laxity, another agency that doesn't take advantage of finding

03:42.480 --> 03:46.160
out somebody else's faults, it's a software much at fault.

03:46.160 --> 03:51.600
Well, it's apparent that if we are building up a national, the fairness, the defense establishment

03:51.600 --> 03:57.160
that we must be absolutely certain that we do not have these subversive forces within

03:57.160 --> 04:00.520
our armed services, that's very apparent, is it not?

04:00.520 --> 04:01.520
Yes, sir.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.280
And I think that as a result of the investigation of this subcommittee, the Department of Defense

04:06.280 --> 04:12.920
and April revised many of its regulations concerning the communist threat.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.880
And we can look for a decided improvement in the future, handling this program.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.880
Oh, thanks so.

04:17.880 --> 04:24.520
From the standpoint of the top echelons and also from the security boards.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.320
I love, I love, of course, so yes sir.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.320
One more question.

04:27.320 --> 04:32.280
What do you think the Army could have done for David Cheyenne if the relations between

04:32.280 --> 04:37.280
the Army and the subcommittee at Fort Monmouth had been more agreeable?

04:37.280 --> 04:41.280
Could I have that question again, sir?

04:41.280 --> 04:45.280
I'm going to be quietly thinking.

04:45.280 --> 04:49.280
One more question.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.280
What do you think the Army could have done for David Cheyenne if the relations between the

04:53.280 --> 04:56.280
Army and the subcommittee at Fort Monmouth had been more agreeable?

04:57.280 --> 05:04.280
In other words, it's been pointed out that David Cheyenne was more or less of a hostage

05:04.280 --> 05:10.280
and that there may have been discrimination because of the lack of adequate response or vocal

05:10.280 --> 05:12.280
operation on the part of the staff of this committee.

05:12.280 --> 05:18.440
Now, what do you think the David Cheyenne, what treatment might he have expected if this

05:18.440 --> 05:20.440
relationship had been more agreeable?

05:21.440 --> 05:25.440
Well, I think that I don't complain about Cheyenne's treatment.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.440
You don't?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.440
Nothing.

05:27.440 --> 05:35.440
Well, you think then that David Cheyenne was not discriminated against and that while he may not

05:35.440 --> 05:40.440
have received any real preferential treatment because he's still in private, that you think

05:40.440 --> 05:47.440
that he got the part what he was entitled to, the same as any other enlisting or drafty entering the Army?

05:48.440 --> 05:53.440
Well, General Ryan has testified that he got no special privilege.

05:53.440 --> 05:57.440
I don't have any knowledge that he got less than special privilege.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.440
You don't think then that he should have received a commission or he should have served?

06:01.440 --> 06:04.440
I think he should have served less than the ordinary.

06:04.440 --> 06:10.440
He should have followed the irregular routine and qualified and if he were competent in every way,

06:10.440 --> 06:13.440
then he should have received a commission otherwise not.

06:14.440 --> 06:20.440
Yes, I think that the ordinary procedure is just right.

06:20.440 --> 06:27.440
But if you did have any interest, you made any contact with the Department of the Army to urge some preferential treatment.

06:27.440 --> 06:37.440
I say alleged preferential treatment for David Cheyenne, you feel that he was not discriminated against and that it's not just

06:37.440 --> 06:40.440
ifiable to say that he was held as a hostage.

06:40.440 --> 06:46.440
Well, the word hostage is Mr. Adams word.

06:46.440 --> 06:58.440
I think that they were trying to use Dave Cheyenne as they were trying to use other things to stop the hearing.

06:58.440 --> 07:06.440
Well, in other words, David Cheyenne has received about the same treatment that other young men entering the Army received.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.440
Yes, sir, I think so.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.440
That's all.

07:10.440 --> 07:14.440
Now, Senator McKity or Mr. Cogni, have ten minutes.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.440
I don't know any of the time that I have Mr. Cogni.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.440
Do you have any questions? No, sorry, I don't.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.440
Any questions?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.440
Mr. Welk or Mr. Jim Sary, you have ten minutes.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.440
Mr. Cawr,

07:27.440 --> 07:36.440
It's been said that sometime previous to the start of these hearings there was a loyalty oath circulated in your office.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
Is that correct?

07:37.440 --> 07:39.440
It's been said yet.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.440
Is that correct?

07:41.440 --> 07:43.440
Was there such an oath circulated?

07:43.440 --> 07:45.440
No, sir.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.440
I don't think so.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.440
Did you sign anything that anyone could call a loyalty oath?

07:49.440 --> 07:50.440
No, sir.

07:51.440 --> 07:57.440
Did you sign any form of paper that indicated your support of Mr. Cogni?

07:57.440 --> 07:58.440
No, sir.

07:58.440 --> 08:03.440
Do you acknowledge that anyone under your supervision sign is such a paper?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.440
No, sir.

08:05.440 --> 08:09.440
Is your testimony then, sir, that no such paper exists?

08:09.440 --> 08:10.440
No, sir.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.440
And never did exist.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.440
No, sir, my testimony is, there's not my testimony that no such paper exists.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.440
It's my testimony that no one acknowledge no such paper exists.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.440
Have you heard others talk about it?

08:20.440 --> 08:21.440
Yes, sir.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.440
I've seen it in the newspapers.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.440
Have you heard Mr. Giuliana talk about it?

08:25.440 --> 08:30.440
No, I don't think I have, although I won't say that I haven't.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.440
I've heard a lot of talk about it.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.440
Yes, sir.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.440
Which such a paper being the files of this committee?

08:36.440 --> 08:37.440
Seven committee?

08:37.440 --> 08:38.440
No, sir.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.440
In so far, do you personally know no such paper exists?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.440
Is that correct?

08:45.440 --> 08:47.440
I have never seen any such paper no sir.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.440
And you have not seen it.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.440
I have never been asked to sign it.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.440
No sir.

08:52.440 --> 08:57.440
Now Mr. Car, when you first came to this committee, it was in the middle of July.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.440
Yes, sir.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.440
And I take it that you must have met Mr. Shine about that time.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
Is that correct?

09:03.440 --> 09:15.440
I can't be sure of this, sir, but I don't believe that I saw Mr. Shine until sometime in August.

09:15.440 --> 09:20.440
I think around the time that we were holding the hearings on the government printing office.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.440
About when would that be?

09:22.440 --> 09:27.440
From 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, maybe last week in August.

09:27.440 --> 09:32.440
So, if you were on the job for about a month before you met him, is that correct?

09:32.440 --> 09:39.440
What the exception of this, the handshake, the handshake, I think that's about correct.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.440
Now I can't swear to that.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.440
I may have seen him before.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.440
Well, I do.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.440
That's the best, my right-best recollection of sometime in August.

09:47.440 --> 09:53.440
So, it was about the first or second week in August before you met him in connection with your duties as staff directors.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.440
That's what I'm getting at.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.440
Talked to 2nd or 3rd, yes.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.440
About the 2nd or 3rd week?

09:57.440 --> 09:58.440
Yes.

09:58.440 --> 10:06.440
You know what he was doing during the period from July 16 when you first came to this committee in the 2nd or 3rd week of August, Mr. Car?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.440
Yes, sir.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.440
Was he working for the subcommittee, sir?

10:11.440 --> 10:13.440
That's my understanding, yes, sir.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.440
And I take it, he was not working under your direction.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.440
No, sir.

10:17.440 --> 10:23.440
I also understood you to say this morning, Mr. Car, that Mr. Shine was a part-time consultant.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.440
Is that correct?

10:24.440 --> 10:25.440
That's correct.

10:25.440 --> 10:33.440
At the same time, he was acting as a part-time consultant for the subcommittee, he was also running a business, didn't you say?

10:33.440 --> 10:35.440
That's my understanding, yes.

10:35.440 --> 10:39.440
And that was a fairly substantial business, wasn't it?

10:39.440 --> 10:40.440
I understand it is.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.440
Evolving the affairs of several hotels, theaters, and...

10:44.440 --> 10:46.440
That's fine, I understand.

10:46.440 --> 10:53.440
And therefore, it follows those of not that not too much of his time was available for the subcommittee, is that correct?

10:53.440 --> 10:56.440
Well, I wouldn't say that.

10:57.440 --> 11:06.440
Well, would you say that he spent half of his time running this large business, and half of the time working for the subcommittee?

11:06.440 --> 11:07.440
No, sir, I couldn't say that.

11:07.440 --> 11:19.440
So you make any estimate as to what portion of this time were you running the affairs of the business, and what portion were you working for the subcommittee?

11:19.440 --> 11:25.440
I don't think the like could make any good estimate.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.440
No, sir.

11:26.440 --> 11:32.440
Is it fair to say, Mr. Carr, that you saw Mr. Shine infrequently?

11:32.440 --> 11:34.440
Yes.

11:34.440 --> 11:41.440
I think you have told us that whatever work Mr. Shine did came to you through Mr. Cohn.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.440
Yes, sir. Now, is that correct?

11:43.440 --> 11:44.440
Yes, sir.

11:45.440 --> 11:56.440
Now, I take it then that if Mr. Shine wrote any reports or memorandum, they would have been handed to Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn handed them to you.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.440
Is that correct?

11:57.440 --> 12:02.440
Not necessarily. Mr. Cohn might tell me about them. He might tell you about them.

12:02.440 --> 12:11.440
Well, just so we can get out of it a little quicker, did you ever see any memorandum that Mr. Cohn said had been written by Mr. Shine?

12:14.440 --> 12:19.440
Yes. When did you see the first such memorandum or report?

12:19.440 --> 12:23.440
I'd only call saying any report in the sub-sir, I think that you're using it.

12:23.440 --> 12:29.440
Well, some writing that would have it in some work for the subcommittee in the form of either a report or a memorandum.

12:30.440 --> 12:51.440
I believe I saw a memorandum from Mr. Shine during the period of late July, August, around there.

12:51.440 --> 12:55.440
That was something Mr. Cohn handed you for the files?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.440
No, I don't recall he handed me as I recall.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.440
Still, I told you about it.

12:58.440 --> 13:05.440
As I recall he said, here's a memorandum of Shine and I never saw it and all of a sudden he was saying that.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.440
He said, here's a memorandum of Shine and he told me something about it.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.440
I recall one of those.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.440
Did you ever have a occasion to refer to it again?

13:12.440 --> 13:13.440
No, sir.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.440
So you can tell us nothing about it?

13:15.440 --> 13:16.440
No, sir.

13:17.440 --> 13:28.440
When you first came to the subcommittee, did you with some time learn that Mr. Shine was being considered for a commission in the Army?

13:28.440 --> 13:31.440
Not when I first came with the subcommittee.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.440
Why did you first learn that back?

13:33.440 --> 13:38.440
I think it was sometime after I'd been with the committee a few weeks.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.440
A few weeks?

13:39.440 --> 13:40.440
I think maybe.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.440
I'm not sure.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.440
You'll talk with Mr. Cohn almost daily, I'd take it.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.440
When you first came with the subcommittee.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.440
Yes.

13:48.440 --> 13:54.440
And during that time he never told you about Mr. Shine's possible commission in the Army?

13:54.440 --> 13:55.440
Yes, sir.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.440
So he heard.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.440
He did.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.440
I heard about it.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.440
Yes, but you said it would be several weeks after you came.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.440
I'm trying to find out when you first learned that.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.440
Well, I can't say.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.440
I don't know when I first learned that.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.440
Well, you came to the subcommittee in the middle of July.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.440
That's right.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.440
Would you say you had heard of it before the end of July?

14:10.440 --> 14:11.440
I really couldn't say.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.440
I may have.

14:12.440 --> 14:17.440
I know that he was applying for a reserve commission.

14:17.440 --> 14:23.440
Well, did you not learn that General Reaver is supposed to have promised him such a commission?

14:23.440 --> 14:26.440
How long that's not during that period.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.440
When did you learn that first?

14:28.440 --> 14:30.440
Now sometime later.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.440
Well, that doesn't help me very much, Mr. Cohn.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.440
Give me at least a month if you can.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.440
I'm not sure that I can.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.440
I did learn it sometime later.

14:41.440 --> 14:46.440
Well, it would have been important to you as the staff director to learn what it's not

14:46.440 --> 14:52.440
that one of your, that your principal consultant was about ready to get a commission in the Army, wouldn't it?

14:52.440 --> 14:54.440
Yes, sir.

14:54.440 --> 14:59.440
You were counting on his services and running the affairs of the subcommittee, weren't you?

14:59.440 --> 15:02.440
Yes, sir, but I'm, I'm like, say, that, if I may.

15:03.440 --> 15:08.440
I might state that he was on what information I had, applying for a reserve commission.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.440
At that point, I didn't know what he was going in the Army or not.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.440
Well, it was important for you to know that, wasn't it?

15:14.440 --> 15:17.440
It might be, it's come important for me to know that.

15:17.440 --> 15:22.440
Well, you considered that his function wasn't important for the subcommittee, didn't you?

15:22.440 --> 15:23.440
Yes, I did.

15:23.440 --> 15:31.440
And therefore, you would like to know on what availability this man would have to the committee in the immediate future, wouldn't you?

15:32.440 --> 15:34.440
That's what I think I would.

15:34.440 --> 15:39.440
So you now say you didn't even inquire if you're whether or not you're going to get the commission soon?

15:39.440 --> 15:42.440
No, sir, I didn't inquire about the commission.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.440
You pay no attention to the matter, is that right?

15:45.440 --> 15:46.440
No.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.440
No, sir, I, well, then you must pay with all attention.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.440
I, well, I, well, we must be sure we're talking about the same thing.

15:51.440 --> 15:57.440
Well, let's be sure. I'm talking about the matter of a commission for one G David Chinen.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.440
Right. Now, what are you talking about?

15:58.440 --> 16:02.440
I'm talking about the matter of a reserve commission for one G David Chinen.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.440
All right. It's all an element in mind by putting a reserve to be.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.440
Right.

16:06.440 --> 16:10.440
Since it was a reserve commission, I, and at that time I had no great interest in it.

16:10.440 --> 16:14.440
I didn't know whether he was going in the army or not.

16:14.440 --> 16:19.440
Well, when did you learn that that commission would not be for a committee?

16:19.440 --> 16:26.440
I think the first time I, I learned that it would not be for a committee, was one Secretary Stevens,

16:26.440 --> 16:29.440
talked about it on October 2nd.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.440
All of that late date, that's when you first learned it would not be for a committee.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.440
I think so, it may have been.

16:35.440 --> 16:41.440
And then the matter was still open and active in so far as you, staff director, was concerned until that time.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.440
Well, who would you read that question for a question?

16:45.440 --> 16:49.440
I don't need to mention it.

16:49.440 --> 16:55.440
Then the matter was still open and active in so far as you, staff director, was concerned at that time.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.440
Could you explain the question to patients?

16:59.440 --> 17:02.440
Well, perhaps it's not a very clear question.

17:02.440 --> 17:09.440
I thought you testified that the first you learned that Mr. Shine was not going to get a commission, was as late as October 2nd.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.440
I, I, that's it.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.440
And it may have been.

17:12.440 --> 17:16.440
No, that prior to October 2nd, you must have thought he might still be going to get that commission.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
I might have, yes.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.440
Are you not very sure about it, Mr. Tarr?

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
No, I'm not.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.440
You could be mistaken.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.440
I could be mistaken.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.440
Could you be...

17:26.440 --> 17:29.440
...tamilitary pharmacist in Florida?

17:34.440 --> 17:40.440
It's like on the wall at the indicated speed, you said, well, take out custody of five minutes, seven, and he's checked. It's just time.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.440
There.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.440
Share a few things with him, but about the same.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.440
There.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.440
The audience is here now, as we've heard before, the recess.

17:51.440 --> 18:01.440
It's unnecessary to go through the routine of reminding you against the committee, rule against audible manifestations of approval or disapproval.

18:01.440 --> 18:07.440
Just summarize it by saying, like, Calvin Pooley's relationship to sin were a given.

18:07.440 --> 18:11.440
So I'm sure that you'll comply with that admonition.

18:11.440 --> 18:19.440
We had just concluded one go around, if I'm questioning, and I'll ask, uh, Council Proort, whether he has any other questions at this time.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.440
Mr. Proort has it.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.440
The chair had just a few questions.

18:24.440 --> 18:34.440
Mr. Carr, I was interested in your replies to the questions propounded by Senator Ducks, that you had after graduating from Brown University,

18:35.440 --> 18:41.440
gone to the law school specifically to become a member of the FBI.

18:41.440 --> 18:48.440
I might say one of the good things about these hearings, we're getting better and better with our staff, and we've never had the opportunity to do before I didn't know that.

18:48.440 --> 18:57.440
Let me ask you a question, a two-about-year work with the FBI, which you say, with which you say you were connected for 11 years.

18:58.440 --> 19:09.440
What were you doing in the FBI immediately before you came to the commission, so far, did you do not violate FBI regulations in discussing your duties and functions?

19:09.440 --> 19:20.440
I was a supervisor of the security matter section in the New York Field Division of the FBI engaged in the investigation of communist.

19:20.440 --> 19:26.440
And a supervisor, did you have men under you over whom you were in control?

19:26.440 --> 19:27.440
Yes, sir.

19:27.440 --> 19:31.440
About our large staff, did you have any of that permissible tell?

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
A very large number, sir.

19:33.440 --> 19:41.440
By that, you would say as large as your staff here, or considered larger, many times larger, many times larger.

19:42.440 --> 19:49.440
In the course of your experience with the FBI, do you take some of the in-training courses if the FBI has for its agents and its operatives?

19:49.440 --> 19:51.440
Yes, sir, that, several.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.440
That's what they call the FBI Academy?

19:54.440 --> 19:57.440
Yes, sir, at the Quantico Virginia.

19:57.440 --> 20:05.440
Once you try doing my 16 years down here has been my high pleasure and happy honor for the invited to 50 commencement of death.

20:06.440 --> 20:15.440
As the FBI Academy, I want to say that I think it is as good a demonstration of governmental intransions as a program as I have seen anywhere.

20:15.440 --> 20:28.440
As part of your instruction there, teaching you to become actress and meticulous and precise and the fact that in your work and in your procedures, yes, sir.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.440
You took that course on one occasion.

20:31.440 --> 20:42.440
Yes, sir, the original training course, and then approximately every year, 18 months, a re-training course here in Washington and in the Quantico Virginia.

20:42.440 --> 20:49.440
The chair is correct, I believe, and his recollection is enough that you came to our committee direct from the FBI Academy.

20:49.440 --> 20:53.440
Can you immediately recreate it in either the environment or the unemployment?

20:53.440 --> 20:55.440
That's correct, sir.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.440
I just want to ask just to relate to this train ride that we've learned so much about.

20:59.440 --> 21:15.440
I'm not sure that we can throw an additional light on that, but at any time, in that three and a half hour train ride, did you endeavor to put pressure on Mr. Adams in any way to induce him to do something favorable to Mr. Shine?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.440
No, sir, not at that time or any other.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.440
No, no, no, no.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.440
Your testimony is a red note time.

21:21.440 --> 21:32.440
Did you ever directly or indirectly contact Secretary Stevens or Mr. Adams, pressuring them to do something towards Shine which they would not have done?

21:32.440 --> 21:35.440
Had they been no such man in this world as Frank Carter?

21:35.440 --> 21:37.440
That's correct, sir.

21:37.440 --> 21:47.440
I think Mr. Adams specified that you had to talk to him about certain difficulties, which had a reason between your shop and his shop and the person he was going to do.

21:47.440 --> 21:53.440
And I suggested to him that perhaps he had testified to us.

21:53.440 --> 21:57.440
It was part of his Adams' podium business.

21:57.440 --> 22:07.440
If he keeps this cooperative program going, if he keeps the train on the track, if he keeps a workable arrangement between the members of his staff and the members of your staff, do you recall that testimony?

22:07.440 --> 22:09.440
Yes, sir, I think I do.

22:10.440 --> 22:20.440
I wondered if it would be a fair statement to say that on occasion and conversing with Adams, you considered it as part of your post-billage and the post-billage interest.

22:20.440 --> 22:27.440
Likewise, we try to keep the members of his shop and the members of your shop working together on this co-op of you fund.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.440
That's right, sir.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.440
You were interested in getting the investigation concluded.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.440
The thing is, the best possible result.

22:33.440 --> 22:46.440
To do that, you're major concern as I think it was to get these minor irritations behind you and out of the way and develop the maintain working relationships between the Army's science and the disinvestigation and the committee.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.440
Yes, sir.

22:47.440 --> 22:55.440
I maintain my relationship with Mr. Adams right up until the time of the original analogy of advance of this.

22:55.440 --> 22:59.440
They tell that paper was the very important thing.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.440
Yes, sir.

23:00.440 --> 23:04.440
Until that time, you continued to each of his own corner.

23:04.440 --> 23:11.440
They do what you could to keep this co-operative program contingent, I did from my corner, so yeah.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.440
They did your building, he did them his part today.

23:13.440 --> 23:24.440
When he was tough for you sometimes, but he was ultimately trying to do with the state who had the same thing that was laid down and followed by and become an open country person.

23:24.440 --> 23:28.440
I think that he was trying to put that on open country Earth, I think.

23:28.440 --> 23:33.440
I think I can prove my question, I'm going to be calling it here, can I?

23:33.440 --> 23:41.440
Mr. Carr, we were the remember on the move up over the second, when I, my time expired before.

23:41.440 --> 23:45.440
I want to read you, including Carr, about it.

23:45.440 --> 23:59.440
Now, cool, I think that you should know that Mr. Stevens was very helpful, and certainly indicated that he had no intention of allowing General Lutton to place his blackout of armed personnel.

23:59.440 --> 24:04.440
We, our possible contact, was this committee?

24:04.440 --> 24:06.440
Is that correct?

24:06.440 --> 24:08.440
Yes, that's what it says.

24:08.440 --> 24:15.440
That indicates to me that up to that time Mr. Stevens was called co-operating beautifully.

24:15.440 --> 24:18.440
Yes, sir, I had no trouble with this.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.440
Well, I'm about co-operating as Fort Marmel.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.440
Yes, sir, he cooperated.

24:23.440 --> 24:29.440
You were combined there, then, was against General Lutton, and then on against Mr. Stevens, was he by force?

24:29.440 --> 24:31.440
No, sir, not specifically.

24:31.440 --> 24:41.440
I would say, had I known these members of the government were going to become historic documents, I might have written them a little more carefully.

24:41.440 --> 24:56.440
This was intended to mean that Mr. Stevens had been helpful in removing what I termed a blackout order, preventing the staff from talking to personnel as Fort Marmel, as exactly, but who's blackout order was?

24:56.440 --> 25:03.440
Well, I don't know who's blackout order was, sir. I know that it was issued through General Lutton.

25:03.440 --> 25:08.440
Well, you referred to it as his blackout order, getting General Lutton, but he was right there.

25:08.440 --> 25:13.440
At that time, I considered it was this blackout order, who do you consider it was?

25:13.440 --> 25:20.440
At this point, I don't know, sir. I don't know who may have issued an order to General Lutton.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.440
Well, you have the information, sir.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.440
I have none.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.440
So, and was this issued to him?

25:24.440 --> 25:25.440
I have none, sir.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.440
Well, at that time, before you knew, I was General Lutton's order, what?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.440
The order was General Lutton.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.440
He went to the secretary and got corrected.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.440
Not correct.

25:34.440 --> 25:37.440
Well, let's go to the next one on page.

25:37.440 --> 25:41.440
Five, I believe, you're right, sir.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.440
About December 9, I don't think you are.

25:44.440 --> 25:49.440
Well, I might ask you about this, and the November 6th, all right?

25:50.440 --> 25:54.440
We've told our court paramedics.

25:54.440 --> 26:01.440
Steven said that if we got out everything, he would ask the resign,

26:01.440 --> 26:09.440
who will hurry that about out everything, as to bringing out everything at the court's,

26:09.440 --> 26:11.440
should I move this?

26:11.440 --> 26:13.440
Monmouth, is that correct?

26:13.440 --> 26:16.440
Well, this is my memorandum. I take this to mean, however.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.440
Well, you were present. You were present.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.440
Yes, yes sir. That's the conference.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.440
How I write and dictate the language. I take this to mean.

26:24.440 --> 26:31.440
I take this to mean that if we brought out everything that Mr. Cohen had related to him in his resume,

26:31.440 --> 26:33.440
concerning court mama.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.440
Were you present at the November 6th, once in your sense?

26:36.440 --> 26:40.440
You hear the resume that was at home gay, as I said.

26:40.440 --> 26:47.440
Then it referred to what Mr. Coleman said as the information they had in court development.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.440
Is that correct?

26:48.440 --> 26:49.440
Yes sir.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.440
What was it in it that made him think he'd lose his job?

26:52.440 --> 26:56.440
Well, I don't know what made him think he'd lose his job as we pointed out to him.

26:56.440 --> 27:04.440
I say we, son of a macaw, pointed out to him that there was nothing there that would make him lose his job,

27:04.440 --> 27:07.440
or that he should consider would make him lose his job.

27:07.440 --> 27:11.440
I am asked and I, if you have developed all that information and evidence that you're hearing.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.440
I'm on charge, I don't know.

27:13.440 --> 27:20.440
Was there developed as the subject of hearings on court mama, all of the information from the outline

27:20.440 --> 27:24.440
that's given the Secretary of State even by Mr. Cohen?

27:24.440 --> 27:26.440
Has it all been made public yet?

27:26.440 --> 27:30.440
Have you developed it in sworn testimony, whatever he related to in that day?

27:30.440 --> 27:36.440
Well, all that Mr., all that Mr. Tone outlined to him that day, I think,

27:36.440 --> 27:42.440
has been, and this is the long time now, I think it has been developed in sworn testimony.

27:42.440 --> 27:46.440
What I was trying to determine is anything else that should be developed in the hasn't been

27:46.440 --> 27:48.440
that Mike Paul's in the losing job.

27:48.440 --> 27:56.440
Otherwise, there's a bit in the withholding or a failure to develop whatever was out there in that day.

27:56.440 --> 28:05.440
No sir, if I follow your question, I don't believe that the Secretary, as the Secretary of the Army,

28:05.440 --> 28:07.440
needed to have this worry about his job.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.440
Maybe he didn't.

28:08.440 --> 28:16.440
What I'm trying to determine is whether it was the basic or whether he had in the basis for it or not,

28:16.440 --> 28:19.440
I'm trying to determine what follows their after.

28:19.440 --> 28:26.440
Have you developed in the investigational court mama, all that was outlined to the Secretary of State,

28:26.440 --> 28:29.440
or is there some more to be developed?

28:29.440 --> 28:33.440
But I might still have some impact upon his retaining his job.

28:33.440 --> 28:39.440
Well, whether it would have an impact on his retaining his job, I don't know what there is.

28:39.440 --> 28:45.440
Late one phase of it that has not been fully developed, which was called a was a test of that day.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.440
And that had more serious than the other that has been developed?

28:48.440 --> 28:51.440
No sir, I wouldn't say it was more serious, although I consider it serious.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.440
There still some work to be done there on the board, monmer garrings.

28:55.440 --> 29:01.440
Yes sir, I would say that there are two phases to an investigation of this type.

29:01.440 --> 29:12.440
The first phase and the very important one is to get rid of the communist or the subversive, the security risks found there to get rid of them.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.440
The second phase is to find out who is responsible for leaving them there.

29:15.440 --> 29:18.440
And in many cases, who is responsible for leaving them there.

29:18.440 --> 29:24.440
And in many cases, who is responsible for leaving them there to develop that, it might get his job.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.440
I don't think so.

29:25.440 --> 29:37.440
I think what he was referring to, I think he thought that if we had public hearings concerning just the amount of information that we did have public hearings on, that's not worried.

29:37.440 --> 29:43.440
Well, what you think he thought at that time has been developed at the moment.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.440
It's pretty hard for me to say what I think he thought.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.440
I'm saying you just say in what you thought he thought.

29:49.440 --> 29:58.440
Yes, I am trying to go along with this line of questioning.

29:58.440 --> 30:01.440
I think that the secretary was disturbed.

30:01.440 --> 30:12.440
That if public hearings develop showed as much as Mr. Cohn outlined to him that day, he was most concerned.

30:12.440 --> 30:18.440
Well, I don't have to discuss that. Have they up to date shown as much as Mr. Cohn outlined to him that day?

30:18.440 --> 30:27.440
I think generally speaking with the exception of the loyalty phase, well, what's that?

30:27.440 --> 30:34.440
Don't you regard that for the series if somebody is responsible and keeping commoners in there subversives and perfect them?

30:34.440 --> 30:36.440
Don't you regard that as a very serious job?

30:36.440 --> 30:38.440
I regard it very serious.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.440
Do you think that's being done now?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.440
I don't think that's being done right now.

30:43.440 --> 30:48.440
I depend on up until an hour and for the next three years.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.440
Well, I think it was being done.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.440
I don't know because you say we didn't get the loyalty phase for people here.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.440
You've got your preliminary investigation evidence.

30:57.440 --> 31:01.440
Yes, what it shows, you know what you think you've approved, no?

31:01.440 --> 31:05.440
I don't know so much about what we can prove from the loyalty phase,

31:05.440 --> 31:14.440
because the preliminary investigation is not developed to the point where I could say something conclusive about it,

31:14.440 --> 31:17.440
would have to have some of these people in to ask something for it.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.440
I'm done by just what Monmouth's not the loyalty phase.

31:20.440 --> 31:25.440
Well, then we're not talking about the same thing. I'm talking about the loyalty phase.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.440
Well, you're not investigating the loyalty phase yet, have you?

31:28.440 --> 31:29.440
Of course, probably.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.440
No, no.

31:31.440 --> 31:39.440
Now I've told you that on a December 9th, apparently judging from the one I've just referred to,

31:39.440 --> 31:45.440
the first one on October 2nd, everything was getting along pretty well at that time.

31:45.440 --> 31:50.440
But a month, three days, months, and seven days later,

31:50.440 --> 31:54.440
it seems that already begun to deteriorate, is that correct?

31:54.440 --> 31:56.440
Judging from this number.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.440
Two months later, I thought they had just two months later.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.440
Two months later, it would work.

32:02.440 --> 32:10.440
Unless you refer to a statement that you just filed on the oath that Mr. Adams made when he asked you,

32:10.440 --> 32:13.440
what's there in it for us?

32:13.440 --> 32:18.440
If he hadn't even given something for shine, just what do you mean to that?

32:18.440 --> 32:19.440
What did you...
