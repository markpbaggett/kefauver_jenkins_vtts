00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
So, the committee room with all members of the staff and that would include Mr. Shrine,

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
that you might express an interest without carrying it to such an aggressive point that

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
it can be construed as under-influencers on your phone.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Have you an opinion as to where the dividing line might be?

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Well, I think it's a possible and commendable, that one person has an interest in another.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.480
So, you believe that you could express an interest in the military future of the day in a

00:37.480 --> 00:41.000
charred and still not transgressed, the suffice.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Yes sir, and invite the charred that there have been under-influencers on your phone.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Yes sir, that's all Mr. Shrine, through the morning.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
And the Jackson, you have ten minutes.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
And the charred, I understand from the answer you gave in response to Senator Dirkson's

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
question, that you took notes in connection with all of these various meetings and get

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
together's notes.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
No, sir.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
No, sir.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
In other words, the only notes that you have are the notes that I've been transformed into

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
the form of memoranda, which is included in this document.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
That's correct, the only notes I have at this time.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Well, it's not actressen to say that your recollection would be better than parties on the

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
other side of this controversy, because you had taken notes at the time of these various

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
incidents.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, I agree with you, sir.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
I got the impression you say that you had notes on all of these other incidents that took

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
place that are not included in the memoranda, that most are out of the end of my recollection.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Pardon me?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I stand on my recollection.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
You stand on your recollection, sir, that you're not relying on notes, ma'am.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, I have a connection with the other conversations, not included in the memoranda.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, I have some notes of some time, Chester, throughout the course of these.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
But in so far, this dispute is concerned that we have been listening to for all these weeks.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
The notes taken, the memoranda and everything are contained in the document for all practical

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
purposes.

02:17.000 --> 02:32.000
Now, Mr. Carr, in your memorandum of December 9, 1953, in the first paragraph, you state

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
the Army is fine to use shine as a hostage, in substance at this, and find it the first

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
paragraph.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes, and I think you go on to say that John Adams refers to shine as a hostage or that

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
hostage whenever this name comes up.

02:51.000 --> 03:00.000
I wonder just how you're using the term hostage in your memorandum.

03:00.000 --> 03:09.000
The dictionary definition in part is that the state of a person given or kept as a pledge

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
pending the fulfillment of a teacher, the man, as a threat.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
That's Webster's definition.

03:16.000 --> 03:26.000
And Webster also defines hostage as the state of a guest, hence the state of a hostage treated

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
as a guest.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
As you use it, is it the former or the latter?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
You say the latter or the state of a guest?

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
This is Webster's two alternative definitions are not quite reconcilable.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Let me give you the latter.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Let me give the firm a point on the same question.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm asking you now, we use the word hostage in his memorandum.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
It's very simple.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Go ahead, Mr. President.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
The dictionary, Webster's dictionary has pretty good sort.

03:55.000 --> 04:05.000
State that it is the state of a person given or kept as a pledge pending the fulfillment of a future

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
demand, comma, as a threat.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
That's the first definition.

04:10.000 --> 04:18.000
And the second one is that it's the state of a guest, hence the state of a hostage treated as a guest.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Now how did you use the word hostage?

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, I think that I first used the word hostage from association with Mr. Adams.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
He first used the word hostage.

04:30.000 --> 04:39.000
I had in mind that, at Megalong Center, I had in mind that he had in mind that this was a person whom they could,

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
this was an object or person that they could hold over our head in order to put pressure on us.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
Well, in other words, you were using it in the sense of a threat.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I would say loosely in the sense of a threat, yes.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
Well, what did the Army threaten to do to try and if the hearings were not called off?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
What did they threaten to do with this?

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
What did the Army threaten to do with the shine if the hearings were not called off?

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, one thing that they threatened to do was to ship them overseas before he had finished his training.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
I should say the Army, Mr. Adams, may distance.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.000
Are you sure that when I wasn't quite certain in the previous testimony,

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
that Mr. Adams had definitely threatened to send them before he had finished basic training?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Well, that was the interpretation I've placed on.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I don't know what day he attended in the go.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
One was that first date when he threatened to send him overseas before finishing basic training.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
He was on the 14th of January.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Well, now how could you have in mind that threat when you didn't say I hadn't mind that threat?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Well, but just remember, Adam was written on December 9th and I asked,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
you used the word hostage in the first paragraph.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
That's right.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
And you gave the term threat to it from the dictionary and I've adopted the dictionary.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I said that I hadn't mind.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Well, what threat did you have in mind on December 9th when you used the word hostage?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I didn't say that I hadn't mind the threat on that date.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I used the word hostage as a word that Mr. Adams had used.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
And as a word that I meant to mean holding somebody overhead to use pressure on us.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Well, as I read the sentence, the second sentence in your December 9th memorandum,

06:30.000 --> 06:39.000
what I want to tell you, this is the sender McCarthy, is that I am getting fed up with the way the Army is trying to use shine as a hostage to pressure us to stop our hearings on the Army.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
What could they have done to shine at that time?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
But could they have done to shine?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, this is December 9th.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
He was getting his passes, wasn't he right along?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
May I?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yes, sir.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
The use of the word hostage goes back to Adam's use of the word hostage.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
I don't claim that musing me word hostage in this sentence or in any sentence in the dictionary sentence.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm using it as Mr. Adams uses it.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
As I thought he used it, I would say.

07:08.000 --> 07:20.000
As a means of dangling a little bit of pressure over us or indicating that he could do save it for him if we would save it for the Army.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
Well, then with reference to this December 9th memorandum of yours, Mr. Carr, when you used the word hostage,

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
you didn't have in mind then that the Army could do anything to hurt shine.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, I wouldn't say that I hadn't mind that you could do anything to hurt shine.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
Well, it was pretty fair with him up to that time, and he'd been getting extra passes more than he was normal drafts he was getting.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Yes, the Army had been saved with him at that time.

07:46.000 --> 07:55.000
Well, then as far as you knew at that time, you didn't know of anything that they were doing or contemplated doing that would come within the category of a threat.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
No, sir.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
Now, you also stayed in the memorandum down the next paragraph.

08:07.000 --> 08:17.000
That I just say I thought it wasn't fair for them to take it out on shine because we were investigating the Army or to keep using it to try to stop our investigation.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
Well, actually, if that time were they taking anything out on shine, I'm just reading these.

08:22.000 --> 08:31.000
No, that's a statement. That's a statement that I think at this point it's a little difficult for me to say exactly what I had in mind when this thing was dictated.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
I think that the statement you did read, which is in the second paragraph of this?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Yes, it's the next to the last sentence in the second paragraph.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Right.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
You see, you talk in terms of this was going on now.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
In other words, I did say I thought it wasn't fair for them to take it out on shine.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
You didn't have in mind that they were taking it out on shine.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, no, but you were calling my question.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
You know, just let me stop here in the memorandum.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Now on the next paragraph.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
You both just look like a statement.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
No time off.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I've been time off.

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
Now on the next paragraph, you say I'm convinced that they will keep right on trying to blackmail us as long as shine is in the Army.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
It's the memorandum of December 9th.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
It's about referring to all the time.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Let's on page 5 of the printed one.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Thank you very much.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I am convinced that they will keep right on trying to blackmail us as long as shine is in the Army.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
How do I understand that they were blackmailing you during this time?

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
This is a reference to the part of my testimony this morning where Adam said to me,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
what's the rennet for us if we do something for shine?

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
The use of the word blackmail here by me is sort of an extortion used to distort.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
The blackmail is a felony.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Why?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Can I...

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It's a sentence by a sentence.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
Before Senator Potter starts the question of witness, I'd like to ask the star.

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
Senator Durston, I'm explored with you two adjectives that have been used to describe you as a connection to this hearing.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
You want to be strong and the other silent.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
And I believe that under your oath you've made it that there's some reason to call you both strong and silent.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
I believe another adjective also has been applied to you in the past that hearing is not only strong and silent but a hungry man.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It's not only that it's a youngster.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
I'd like to thank you here to let your physical being stand in mute evidence that you are a times a hungry man.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Yes, I just...

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
How much of that does a hungry mean to food?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Yes, that's what I...

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I think that that Evan could speak for itself.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
Mr. Carp, what is the status...

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
What is your status within the committee staff organization?

11:19.000 --> 11:28.000
You receive orders from the Chief Council or the TVC boarders from you or both of you on a par and receive orders from me.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
I would say that we're more or less on a par if you wanted to make an organizational charter of the thing.

11:34.000 --> 11:44.000
We both receive orders from the chairman and members of the committee and we attempt to coordinate them between us and correlate the odd duties between us.

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
But certain investigations to be held, for example, with the Chief Council for you when our work went as a field.

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
And we're certain areas, certain things you should look for and you would take over from there is that essentially correct?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Well, what you say...

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
Not exactly, sir. The Chief Council works along with us in connection with our investigation.

12:07.000 --> 12:21.000
I feel that has the investigative arm, as you might say, that it is more or less of my function and the function of the investigators to do everything we can to see that the council

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
was going to present the case as it were in the hearings has what he needs.

12:27.000 --> 12:37.000
As the Chief Administrative Officer of the committee staff, you supervise the entire personnel or just the investigators.

12:37.000 --> 12:50.000
Well, all of the personnel on the staff, aside from the clerical, are really investigated. Some of them are lawyers but the monolegal work is as such.

12:50.000 --> 13:14.000
It is not too great. It is mostly investigated. I do supervise them. One question involving some more serious or needful, serious knowledge of the and more complete knowledge of legal aspects of a particular matter, it is always a turn of Mr. Cohn to be sure to check.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
What about the women members of the staff? They are careful.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

13:22.000 --> 13:38.000
Mr. Cohn, you have testified in the fact that there has been, during your FBI, worked that the customer procedures to make many memorandums.

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
I have recently mentioned that the committee has been instructed for this work here.

13:46.000 --> 13:59.000
When the informers were part of the board, no memorandum was made. That is correct. That is the senator's.

13:59.000 --> 14:15.000
I know that the memorandum that you have submitted here, is this a typical, is this typical of the subject matter of the memorandums that you would make as a staff director of the committee.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
I do not know about the typical. These are memorandums that I did not make.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
These are memorandums where no informer is mentioned. It is on a problem with the committee's confony work.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
There is no mask in this question. I will ask it as soon as I can.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
Other memorandums dealing with other general subjects. Is that correct?

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
Yes, sir. The memorandum that is submitted here are not all the memorandums that you have prepared.

14:46.000 --> 14:56.000
No, sir. Mr. Cohn, you heard Mr. Adam is testified.

14:56.000 --> 15:11.000
The training, the what to place, the payment of all the arrived from New York, from the courthouse to the whole palace, when Mr. Adam is trained in three times.

15:11.000 --> 15:22.000
I believe it is testified this morning that a discussion there in that all the arrived with Mr. Cohn, I believe it was the drive.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
Mr. Adam testified that it was part of an animated conversation. The youth waiver that it was by animated.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Yes, sir.

15:30.000 --> 15:40.000
But you? It's your testimony that the discussion during that all the more field trip concerned general law.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
Is that correct? In pension. They had a giant mention during the course of that conversation.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
As I said this morning, his name was mentioned in the at the luncheon. One should one, Mr. Adam said, let's talk about China.

15:55.000 --> 16:03.000
It's my recollection that his name was not mentioned at any point during the automobile ride.

16:03.000 --> 16:15.000
When Mr. Adam testified, he animated that there was a certain amount of friction between Mr. Cohn and Senator McCarty, the same time.

16:15.000 --> 16:24.000
He stated that after he had returned and talked with you about this automobile ride.

16:24.000 --> 16:34.000
When Mr. Adam stated that it was up soft in those streets, he didn't have to catch a cab and get to the depot on a hurry to take his train.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
He stated that we could have seen what happened to Senator McCarty.

16:41.000 --> 16:50.000
I'd like to propose to you from the testimony Mr. Adam's on that call. I'll be pointing directly.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Mr. Adam stated.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
Mr. Carcola, this is on 82592. Mr. Carcola me a few days later.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
He didn't think that I could feel family about the way I was put off the car.

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
Because he said, I should have been there to see the way in the McCarty. That's the car. That's a few blocks away.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Did you say that to Mr. Carcola?

17:13.000 --> 17:28.000
No sir, I didn't. I can see no reason why I would have said it since Senator McCarty and Mr. Cohn,

17:28.000 --> 17:36.000
appeared to be an agreement about this subject of possible reprisals against a person who had helped the committee.

17:36.000 --> 17:46.000
You heard Mr. Adam states that the main subject of conversation with Mr. Shine, you say that's not so.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Is it General Law?

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
He's the second, yes. I have no further questions.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Hello.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Thank you. And the timing didn't do you have to know.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Mr. Carcola, you're the executive director of the staff. Is that right?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Yes.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Could you tell me briefly what your functioning is in that capacity?

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
Yes sir. Briefly, I am the administrator of the office staff.

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
I supervise and follow the work of the investigators and the clerical force.

18:23.000 --> 18:32.000
I also, however, investigate myself as I understand and I know Mr. Cohn does.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
I think you want to change the way that sounds.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
Well, I also investigate myself and Mr. Cohn does.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
You get myself and around great. I am myself and this together.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Everybody wants to kind of say.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
You act as an investigator.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
You are a member of the Chief General of the department.

18:54.000 --> 19:03.000
And you came out of the FBI where you have a great desire for efficiency and office routine and ferric routine.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
The FBI does have great efficiency and office and ferric routine, yes sir.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
You assign all investigators to their particular job to the all of you.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Yes, I think he could say all of us get assigned.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
I know what the Chief Investigator is doing at any particular time in the General Way and assign a mission.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
And he carried out that mission under your supervision.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Yes sir, in a general way.

19:32.000 --> 19:42.000
Do the members of your staff as director today report back to you the results and accomplishments of their investigation periodically?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Yes sir.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
And they report that they make written reports or horrible reports or both.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
I hope they made an awful report.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Do you write a memorandum or do they write a memorandum for the files on the content that report?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Not in all cases, no.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Tell me a little about how they decide to use the side that it is.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
To be known or not to be done.

20:05.000 --> 20:14.000
Well, for instance, an investigator might tell me of a certain bit of information he has received.

20:14.000 --> 20:22.000
Which was a decisive bit of progress in some investigation he was carrying on.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Now, he might tell me what had happened up to that point.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
He might go back and write a memorandum through that point.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
He might go back and not write a memorandum.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
He might do additional work and subsequently write a memorandum.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
But generally, he would have a memorandum when the job was closed, wouldn't he?

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
The most cases he would get.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
Don't you think it's important to have written records of the results of any investigations in the file?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Yes sir, I think it's important.

20:54.000 --> 21:03.000
It's only important to have a record in the file, for example, a staff member might get sick or go and work on another job or go to another town.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
And it would be important to have worked from the leave of a record as possible, wouldn't it?

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Or in my.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Are you familiar with this?

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
Mymeas Grant document I have here called Senate permanent subcommittee on investigation, filing and administration.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Yes sir.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
Now, let me reach the paragraph on page 7.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
Let me reach the paragraph on page 7.

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
The results of all interviews and investigations should be made a matter of record for the appropriate investigative file,

21:39.000 --> 21:53.000
but the fairing memorandum or reports for that file, in most cases, the preparation of a memorandum by the staff member for these deficient to keep a case file record of the investigation being conducted.

21:54.000 --> 22:05.000
Well, on that basis it would seem to be a routine, when that's except an extraordinary case to have a file of any particular investigation.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Yes sir.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
Now, as I understand this morning, private shine does not report to you. Is that correct?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
No sir.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
To whom does it report?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Usually, for me.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It didn't report.

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
Usually, he reports to the senator, and as I said this morning, his work was coordinated with me through Mr. Cohn.

22:24.000 --> 22:35.000
Now, as administrative head of the staff, are you also in control of the files of the investigating subcommittee, the files themselves?

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
Technically, I assume you're right.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
If you want to file not in physical control, I'm not going to tell you.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I'm going to check it out under your supervision.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
Hello documents which relate to committee investigation placed in these files.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
No sir.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
If they're not in the files, where are they placed?

22:58.000 --> 23:13.000
Well, for instance, an investigator might receive information from a confidential informant, which information would be of value in connection with an executive or a public hearing, which might be conducted.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
The fact that he may have notes on that.

23:16.000 --> 23:39.000
The fact that the witness testified before the subcommittee and was asked a question, which the investigator had in his notes or had turned over on a separate paper to the council or the chairman, might not be be recorded in the files.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
That's one example.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
His notes on a pencil memorandum might be destroyed and undoubtedly would be destroyed.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Element leads you all to summarize the forths getting into the files or all the files that are getting into the files.

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
Or do you have, in effect, two sets of files, one that are two secrets to being the general files and one that are not two secrets?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
No sir.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
There's only one set of files.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
There's only one set of files.

24:02.000 --> 24:09.000
Is there any committee classification put on a material going into the files? In other words, some documents mark secret and some not.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
No sir.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
The sir is on the committee also have access to these files.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yes.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
Do the investigators on the staff have free access to the committee file?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yes.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
Do the secretary and clerk or assistant also have free access to the files?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
No sir. That is another matter.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
There is a girl that handles the file, the filing trick.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
She has access to the file.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
She files the material as it comes in. She takes part of the file room.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
She has access to them, of course, and physical access.

24:42.000 --> 24:50.000
The personnel of the medical personnel, aside from her, would have physical access, yes.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
But they are not supposed to and do not go down and look through the file.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
So is your secretary going to get a file?

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
So is she going down and looking through the file?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Well physically she should do it.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
The proper way to do it and the way I think she would do it would be going through the file.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
So she would be violating the regulation if she did it herself?

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I do not think she would be violating the regulation enough.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
In other words, any file clerk or any secretary will help to see the files they could.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
No, they would be violating the records she would not.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
My secretary will only find it.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
What would not be violating any regulation if she went down to get the file for me?

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
If she went down from an afternoon to file for the file, I understand.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
But she has access to the file for you.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Right. I do only investigate it and have access to.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Yes.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
The members of the staff, what are the committees that have access to the file of this committee?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
No.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
The members of the staff, the senders who are on the committee, have access to the file?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
No, sir.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
I have never known one that's so, uh, so the file.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
So the non-artisan council have access to the file?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Yes.

25:57.000 --> 26:05.000
Could I ask you to prepare a list for me, Mr. Clark, showing first and devolcategories?
