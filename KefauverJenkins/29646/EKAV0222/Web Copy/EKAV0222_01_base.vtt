WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Fail to act on, but presenting a situation of in-efficiency and mishandling on the part of the executive

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
which would come under the direct purview of this committee by the mandate of the Legislative Reorganization Act.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Thank you.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Thank you.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Thank you Chairman.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Well the most important thing is that we have been to provide information to the committee here that will not fall

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
towards the different departments.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Well to the FBI, we answered very, very simple.

00:33.000 --> 00:44.000
We know the positive, the possibly the, that all of the information that we have is available to the

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
departments in front.

00:46.000 --> 00:58.000
And there are no reasons to get information from the department's files and turn around and send it back to that department of the great waste of time.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a announcement here that I'm, may I talk to Senator Flanders in the floor of the senate.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
I pointed out to him that yesterday he made a speech attacking me.

01:13.000 --> 01:24.000
I pointed out that he had not, and those in the usual, courtesy of calling me to tell me he was right or attacked me.

01:24.000 --> 01:34.000
I pointed out that he had an effect on me, the statement that Senator Wisconsin was guilty of some wrongdoing

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
and I told him that I thought that the report should, the committee would be interested in getting the files under oath.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
And so I know that the Chair of the Republican Center is here and I have the data to take the oath from the head of information.

01:47.000 --> 01:59.000
I asked him whether he was going forward here and under oath tell us what he knew but this alleged wrongdoing, he felt that he had no information of any kind or nature except

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
funny as read in the daily news picture.

02:02.000 --> 02:19.000
And, however, I do think Mr. Chairman, when he or the facts of this, the facts was made during the hearing and I read just the wrong plan from a canopy that are zenith, meaning the facts.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
So, I'm glad to have been making trouble for his elder. It has a blast, and it's a troubling self.

02:25.000 --> 02:38.000
Was the committee plan to investigate the real issues at stake? I think if the Senator from Vermont knows any trouble in which the Senator Wisconsin has gotten, he should come over and re-taused the button.

02:38.000 --> 02:49.000
I think if you feel the committee needs his advice or to investigate what he calls to the real issues, he should give us that valuable advice.

02:49.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm not going to make the formal request with the Chairman to be called but I wish the Chair would call a Senator from Vermont and talk to him and see if he does have any information.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
If not, I think he should publicly admit that this was a smear manufactured out of the gold claw.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
And I would like to have the Chair consider going and be with Mr. Cron.

03:17.000 --> 03:40.000
One of the customs raised by Senator and Senator Nub, the committee is necessary to expose communist world that couldn't be done by the Department of the Law.

03:41.000 --> 03:55.000
The owner of the U.S. was very curious when you were working for the Department of Justice and the Office of the Justice in the case of communist infiltration of the U.N. to grant your aid.

03:55.000 --> 04:05.000
You tell us about obstacles that were placed in your way but difficultly you have had in getting that recombinant infiltration exposed.

04:05.000 --> 04:16.000
Yes, very briefly the situation there was we started off with one member of the Silomest Despite and with the Chairman.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
No, Senator Monis, the media from his work on the Un-American Activity Committee.

04:20.000 --> 04:29.000
The man named Irving Caclin, who developed the spite of the fact that the man had been named in the Communist spy, he ended up working in the Secretary of the United Nations.

04:29.000 --> 04:43.000
We called him in before a grand jury, one thing led to another and before too many, once went by it developed there was some 35 or 36.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
The government, the government, was working in fairly important positions in the Secretary of the United Nations.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
All of them being American citizens, many of them.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
Since the Dupre's unfortunate, the members, yes or I was one of those, it many of them had worked for the administration before they had gone with the Secretary of the United Nations.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
We presented the case to the grand jury, the grand jury was very properly incensed about it, prepared a present,

05:09.000 --> 05:19.000
so make public all of the facts concerned than the existence of this network of communists, American communists in the Secretary of the United Nations.

05:19.000 --> 05:28.000
They were attenced by certain people in the Justice Department to stop the issuance of that presentment.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
They succeeded temporarily, they failed ultimately in December of 1952.

05:36.000 --> 05:47.000
The presentment, the beginning of December, the presentment was finally issued and the public served and there was a brief congressional investigation.

05:47.000 --> 05:57.000
The only issue that was known, the only issue that was the case, I believe, was what I had to do with the case, not important enough to mention the issue.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
There was nothing to say or aware of the fact that the case was the case.

06:00.000 --> 06:11.000
The only issue that you can prevent, so that's not meant for a congressional committee having exposed the fact that the case was the day with the pre-yesary.

06:12.000 --> 06:27.000
Well, with regard to the first failure to investigation of the CIA and response to Mr. Jackson's question of what other investigation were conducting,

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
I think we should trust recast the facts and that case for the members of those.

06:33.000 --> 06:47.000
The Thunderstaffes of Kirk, we have the files of the member of the science about alleged, drummed, essential, frightened, corruption, dishonesty, and the CIA.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Some of the information came from the strikeup.

06:53.000 --> 07:17.000
After we had made a preliminary investigation, it was correct that we decided that I should have a meeting with two of the members of the White House staff, the applicants of the Attorney General, one of our highly elected officials, the elected branch, someone to find nice heart, as I am not the one who find nice heart.

07:18.000 --> 07:37.000
Here in a that time, I reported back to the staff that I was convinced, liable to fight out hate, justice, department, federal individual, and to the that time, it was not me and the public interest of all public hearings on the CIA.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, that's the decision here of the administrative.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Yes, I am.

07:45.000 --> 07:54.000
I just wondering whether we're going into another subject right now, I might say that as one member of the committee, I never heard about this meeting with the White House fan.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't know what the other member, you have no idea because you were not on the committee.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
You have had some of yourself looking around.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Well, now what is that?

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
You recall that you did have Mr. Donald's up while we were on the committee.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
When was this meeting?

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
I think it's after you left on a direct check to the shore.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I am reasonably certain it was.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Well, if we've been on the committee, we would have investigated it.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I'm going to be investigation dropped.

08:19.000 --> 08:29.000
I may have met some of the signings and made these suggestions that I contact the White House before we decide to have any public hearings.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
And it's just with the White House, whether or not we get complete cooperation from the White House.

08:35.000 --> 08:45.000
I don't think the meeting was actually held and left the committee.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
I can check the date from now.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
I don't think the meeting was held before you left the committee.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
So, you know, for the White House, as well as the Senate, you know, that the White House is not on the committee.

08:59.000 --> 09:17.000
But at the time, when the committee was considering investigating the central intelligence agency, my ass was not because of my conviction that it was one of the most sensitive agencies from the standpoint of our national security.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
As a poor, he went ahead with the investigation.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
He cleared the president's debt.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
And he said at that time that he would be glad to do it that way.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Microex, that's not the problem with the correct.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I think that's not the problem.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
I think maybe some of the judgments that the meeting actually was held before the Democrats left the committee.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
I thought, in the other facts, the deal was that the question we should make is clear.

09:43.000 --> 09:53.000
And I'll also leave the subject back in the first time that I left it like that.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Give me time, I have to.

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
Mr. Cohn, do you agree with me that?

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
Number one, the administration is certainly heading in the right direction to fire.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Getting rid of Congress is concerned.

10:13.000 --> 10:23.000
Number two, that the ridiculous, the complete waste of time, of these exchange of statements between the White House and the committee.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
There's no reason on Earth.

10:25.000 --> 10:33.000
There's not much of any Congress between the executive department and this committee, and so far, the force and conducts,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
but we all have to be heading the same way.

10:37.000 --> 10:48.000
There should be another extremely frickering, striking approach, less exposure that we should be getting the complete cooperation from the executive.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
And that should be flowing both ways as far as the time is going to come.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.000
And if the president is going to have enough time, then he's going to be accomplished because we serve us 50% for the country.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm sure that's it.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
And that's it up.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Now for the year time of the military, we'll reach that budget.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Thank you, Chair.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
Ordinarily, with the hot waves of waves, I would call attention to it, but not tonight.

11:19.000 --> 11:33.000
Mr. Cole, that is the exact number of calmness or subversives that are used today and needs defense plan.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
The exact number that is low-starred?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yes, sir.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I don't know.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
How luckily am I?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I can only tell you so what we know about.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
But not the hundred and thirty, is that right?

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
Uh, what's wrong? I'm going to try to take you to the right for you if I can't.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm in a hurry.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
I don't want the sun to go down how they're still in there if we can get them out.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm afraid we won't be able to work that well.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I've got a suggestion about it, sir.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
How many hours?

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I believe the figure is approximately 130.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I'm approximately 134.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
It's above our people, Mr. Welch.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I don't care you've told us who they are and how many plans are they?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
How many plans?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
How many plans?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Yes, sir. Just one minute.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Seven, three, four, five.

12:30.000 --> 12:37.000
I see sixteen on hand.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Sixteen counts.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
What are they, sir?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Uh, Senator McCarthy, we are off the city.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Is that all in her, sir?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Which is definitely if I'm going too far.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
I think I can give this.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
You can't go too far if you're in communist, Mr. Cohen.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
We are off the city, sir.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yes, sir.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Connected in New York, sir.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Who are you off the city for, as well?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Yes, sir.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Connected in New York, sir.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
I choose New York.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Well, New York, Quincy, Massachusetts.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Which Ferdinand, Massachusetts.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Buffalo, New York.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Dunperg, New York.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Another Buffalo, New York.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
We'll talk about Massachusetts.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Washington, Massachusetts.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Clinton, Massachusetts.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Clinton, Massachusetts.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Clinton, Massachusetts.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Washington, Massachusetts.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Mr. Cohen, you're not only frightened me.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
You make me ashamed when there are so many in Massachusetts.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
Now that, I'm, this is not a laughing matter, believe me.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Are you alarmed at that situation, Mr. Cohen?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yes, sir, I am.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Nothing could be more alarming.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Could it?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Certainly a very alarming thing.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Where do you not be farthest from those down?

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Give those names to the FBI and at least have those names, but under surveillance.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Mr. Professor Wells, both may be FBI.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I accept the first term.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Mr. Chairman.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
What's not the ridiculous Mr. Wells knows?

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
As I've told him a dozen times that the FBI has all this information.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
The defense plants have the information.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
The only thing we can do is to try and publicly expose these individuals

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
and hope that they'll be getting rid of them.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Then you know that with your love.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I do not know that.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Mr. Cohen, you need to tell us the J. Edgar Cooper

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
and the FBI know the names of these men and are doing nothing about them.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
No, sir. I mean to say...

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
You mean to tell us they're doing something about them?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yes, sir.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
What are they doing about them?

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Yes, what they do about them may not apply to defense department in the appropriate places.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
And so they put them under the surveillance.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Security, the appropriate security agencies involved.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
The FBI gives them full information.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
It is then up to them.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
The place where the information goes to decide whether or not they will act on the FBI information.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
All the FBI can do is give the information that power ends right there.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
They're not the FBI put these 130 men under surveillance.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
They force them down tomorrow.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
Sir, if there's need for surveillance in case of FBI and I do anything like that,

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
I can well assure you that Mr. John Edgar Hoover and his men know a lot better than I

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
and I might respectfully suggest, sir, and probably a lot of us,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
just who should be put under surveillance?

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I do not propose to tell the FBI how to run its shopping.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
And they do it. And they do it. Don't say Mr. Cohen.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
When the need arises, of course.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
And you tell them tonight, Mr. Cohen, that here is a case where the need has arisen

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
so that it can be done by sundown tomorrow night.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
No, sir. There is no need for my telling the FBI what to do about this or anything else.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Are you sure they know every one of them?

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
I would take an old find, sir. I think the FBI has complete information.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
The last two of you know, communist movement in this country,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
and that would include information about these people.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
That being told, Mr. Cohen, can you and I both rest easy tonight?

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Sir, it's like certainly agree with you, Mr. Welch,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
it is a very disturbing situation.

16:07.000 --> 16:14.000
Well, if the FBI has got a firm grasp on these 130 men, I'll go to sleep.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Do you assure me that, so?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Sir, I am sure that the FBI just does its job well,

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
so that it knows all about these people, that it has told the appropriate agencies about these people,

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
and that the failure to act goes elsewhere than they've been just in the hands of the FBI.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Just for the purposes of safety, for fear of something could be missed somewhere,

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
would you mind as a patriotic American citizen sending the 130 men over to the FBI tonight?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Let's be sure we're not taking any time.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
What's the mind that it's all about, sir?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
When you do it, sir?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
What's the most of you, sir?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
No, I don't want to yield that.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
I want to find out if he will do it, and if he won't, then you'll do it, sir.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
That's the term.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
That's the term.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And Mr. Cameron, if he won't, you'll do it.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
You will do it.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
You will have to question.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Will you help me answer?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I asked you to put the word there.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
All right, you have to know what I would do, and I want you to know.

17:05.000 --> 17:12.000
That the FBI has complete access to any files we have, any information we have at any time.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
The finally, Mr. Wells knows.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I'm sure you do, as well.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
That the FBI has no power toward anyone's fire.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
You know the example of the under-his-his.

17:23.000 --> 17:31.000
The FBI has fronted all of the information, and he still grows to be a tough man in the state of life.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
You know Mr. Wells for the FBI.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
So, it's all the information on the spy harried Dexter White.

17:37.000 --> 17:44.000
You know that despite that fact, Mr. Wells, despite the fact that the FBI had given all of the information,

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
and sent over reports day after day after day, harried Dexter White's the Communist spy,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
got to be top-sized real official.

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
So, let's not deceive the American people by blaming the FBI for a communist being in defense plan.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
The FBI has no power to get them out.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
We don't know at this time which ones under surveillance.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
We don't know how badly dead a reporter may be disturbed or may not be disturbed by this.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
We do know, however, that from the two-and-a-half-page memorandum of the other day,

18:18.000 --> 18:25.000
that someone in the FBI was very, very deeply disturbed about communists in the radar laboratory.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
So, let's not make a mistake, Mr. Roch, if we agree on this.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm trying to believe the American people to believe that the FBI can do anything beyond

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
get the information that's all they can do.

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
Well, Mr. Chairman, my confidence in the FBI is simply limited.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
And I think Mr. Colton confidence is similar. Is that right, sir?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Yes, sir, that is right.

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
And all I'm suggesting is that we just nudge him a little and be sure they're busy on these 130.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Would you mind helping nudge them?

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Sir, you do not have to nudge the FBI about this or about anything else.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Then they've got the whole 130, have they, Mr. Colton?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I am sure, the sir and the left.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, then what's all they excitement about if Jay Edgar Hoover is on the job chasing these 130 communists?

19:14.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, the common, Mr. World's all they excitement about is about the fact that even though Jay Edgar Hoover has information on communism, government and defense plans,

19:23.000 --> 19:31.000
and that even though he has forwarded that information time and time again to the appropriate age and speed and play.

19:31.000 --> 19:39.000
Some of those age and speed and play have failed to take action on the basis of reports submitted by Mr. Hoover.

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, then as the second line of defense let's send the 130 names to the Department of Defense tonight.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Would you mind doing that?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Whatever the committee directs on that, sir.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I always the committee would direct.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
Yet all the names be sent both to the FBI and to the Department of Defense with extreme suddenness.

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
If you have a welcome, Mr. Smith, this best is spirit, who has the intruders point of order here.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
But get my recollection of the resolution that Dr. Boba committee is correct.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
We have this.
