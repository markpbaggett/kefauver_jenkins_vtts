WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm still at the beach.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
I'm an attempt to bargain with us to trade off shortening or ending the hearings by

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
making some arrangements to do something for shine.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Mr. Carr, as an investigator and a former of the Iron Man, do you not regard such charges as that against

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
the one as very few?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
I certainly do.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
You think that these charges are not correctness.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I think they ought to be looked into.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I told you there was serious when you first asked.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
And if they are true, if they are true, they should be doubly, shouldn't they?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
I guess not.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
That's my fault about it.

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
But within some reference to this whole matter, as hopeless, waste of time,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
not for you to know.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
But for you to agree with me, that if these charges are true, they indicate that immediate

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
and prompt actions should be taken to correct the situation.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
It's not for me to say that, but I believe with you yet.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Thank you.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
Mr. Carr, when Senator Mangles carrying on a very extensive court examination of Mr. Adams,

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
it runs in my mind that it was all summed up by Mr. Adams in saying that,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
while there was no affirmative act on your part who indicated in honor,

01:27.000 --> 01:37.000
that you failed to speak up, you failed to protest, you failed to remonstrate, you sat silent.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
You feel that you had a duty under those circumstances to speak up and interject yourself in.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Any kind of conversation that may have existed at that time?

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
Well, in the first place, sir, I wouldn't have had any duty to speak up unless I thought there was something improper.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
In the second place, there was nothing improper that I observed.

02:01.000 --> 02:11.000
In the third place, I might say that it's not my duty to break into the conversation of the chairman of this committee

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
and the secretary of the Army until either side what they should do.

02:16.000 --> 02:26.000
I want to emphasize that I didn't see anything improper on the side of Mr. Cohn, son of a McCarthy and myself,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
in anything that we'd done.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
Now, recurring from over to that elevated train ride, when does that train leave Newark State?

02:36.000 --> 02:45.000
It's my recollection that it was sometime in the late afternoon, I would say probably 4'30 or 5'o'clock,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
we arrived down here around 8'o'clock, it's the day before Thanksgiving.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
So there's roughly about four hours, three and three quarter hours of travel time?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
A pocket, yes.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Did you sit in the same seat together?

02:58.000 --> 03:07.000
We traveled in a luxurious style, so we were in a club car, he had the chair next to mine and we looked at it.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Did you remain in the club car all the while or did you come into the washroom?

03:12.000 --> 03:24.000
No, we went into dinner and following dinner we stopped in what I think is probably the real club car, a smoking car.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
We smoked, I smoked the cigar, I don't remember what I was smoked to not.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
It was during that period that we talked about the Pentagon press.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
Did you in Conver the dinner hour with the conversation about the many business and incidental measures?

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
No sir, I don't say I'll get on more place on the dinner.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
During the dinner hour, I very vividly recall that we discussed our own background.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I recall Miss Adams explained his, I explained mine.

03:57.000 --> 04:06.000
We discussed our families and I recall his telling me about his baby that's made noise within the night.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
You sort of presented yourself to each other in the best possible light I think.

04:11.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, we had known each other for some time now, saying each other practically every day, at least talking to each other on the phone.

04:21.000 --> 04:30.000
But this was an opportunity to sit down and relax in an unofficial way.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Talk, yes sir.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
That's a good train on which to take a snooze, isn't it?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes sir.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Did you take your snooze and the thing you said?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
No, I didn't. I did read the paper though.

04:40.000 --> 04:49.000
Well, I've been wondering how much of that four hour period was devoted to these various affairs including one G David Schum.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
But enough of the train ride just caught.

04:52.000 --> 05:00.000
Mr. Carr, if a member of the Regress of the Committee team, if you'll procure something from the files, you would know about it wouldn't you?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Yes sir, what?

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
You've been with the committee roughly about 11 months haven't you?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
That's correct, yes.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
And taking out the time of this investigation we might say that was the 9.5 months test.

05:12.000 --> 05:31.000
Now then, in that 9.5 months period, how many members of the subcommittee actually came to the committee room to talk to you or someone else in authority?

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
And procure something from the committee file?

05:38.000 --> 05:47.000
I can't recall any member of the subcommittee coming to my office or the subcommittee offices to procure anything from the file.

05:47.000 --> 05:57.000
I believe that on one maybe two occasions for some regional rather an executive meeting of the committee was held in my office.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Some members of the subcommittee came to the office to ask for that.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Would you interpret that as either?

06:05.000 --> 06:14.000
And I think very importantly because it includes me you see that I have to take my full share of the responsibilities.

06:14.000 --> 06:25.000
Has either been too busy or being a little indifferent or having complete confidence in what the committee's have been doing?

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
I would say that it would be a combination of being too busy to personally come down there.

06:31.000 --> 06:46.000
I know that on many occasions, like I can say many occasions, on some occasions, members of the subcommittee have called me on me or other staff members on the phone and requested things.

06:47.000 --> 07:03.000
They've been sent to them. I know during the course of Senator Potter's investigation concerning the war of custody, but he was in contact with myself and Donald Donald on many occasions.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
May I say in behalf of Senator Potter, he did a magnificent job on that.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Are you in the custody picture with you at least?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I think so, Senator.

07:13.000 --> 07:23.000
Now then, what's your understanding of the reserve commission as distinguished from the Honourary Commission?

07:23.000 --> 07:34.000
My understanding is that our reserve is a reserve. He doesn't go into the army until they call him. He's held in reserve.

07:34.000 --> 07:47.000
So you believe that you were right in assuming that Mr. Shine, if he got a reserve commission, mine could not be called at some reasonably early days.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
I believe that's a big question. Yes. Or I didn't get much thought behind it.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Now he was an uncompensated consultant of the committee. Is that correct? Yes.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
He was there for no charge upon the committee funds that have been approved by both of the tenants.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I didn't see who's there for no, what's that?

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
I say, all his services were there for no charge upon the committee funds that have been approved on the tenants.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
I know sir. Perhaps the incidental phone call or something like that, but there was no charge in the committee.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
So wait for any reason, including induction in the United States Army, his services must be dispensed with.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
It would be possible for a car to secure some other investigator to take his foot.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Yes sir, an investigator was necessary because he could be done yet.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Yes sir.

08:46.000 --> 09:00.000
Senator Jackson. Mr. Carr, the last hour we were on the memorandum on page 5 December 9th.

09:00.000 --> 09:11.000
I was referring to the language that you used in the next the last paragraph, the preference to blackmail.

09:11.000 --> 09:21.000
Now do I understand that you did not intend to use the word blackmail in the usual sense of that word?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I intended to use the word blackmail, yes sir.

09:24.000 --> 09:36.000
I don't qualify it very much. I just tell you that sometimes I use words loosely.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
To me, I was thinking at this point of blackmail in one sense of its meaning.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
I think that the dictionary will show that one meaning of blackmail is to extort. That's what I was thinking.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, I'm too extorted to crime.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I can say that I can extort a crime, yes sir.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
So it was blackmail in a lawyer's sense of the term?

10:02.000 --> 10:11.000
I wasn't using it in a lawyer's sense. I was using it in a free sense. In a sense of which it was written, this was memorandum was written.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Were you using it in an FBI sense?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm actually framing it.

10:16.000 --> 10:26.000
I don't know that I was. However, I will tell you that I thought it was an extremely serious business.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
So that on December 9th the situation was serious.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It was to me, yes.

10:31.000 --> 10:40.000
As far as you were, because well, it's a German memorandum, but you were stating or giving your own state of mind on that date.

10:40.000 --> 10:51.000
Do you recall the testimony in the hearings that there was a feeling that this controversy of the Army didn't get serious until January 21st?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
That's right, I recall.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
You don't agree with that, according to this memorandum, do you?

10:56.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes, I agree with that. In the sense in which it was used here, I agree with that.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
I believe it's not really serious on the 21st or 22nd of January.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
I believe, however, that it was serious at this time, and I fly across the memorandum.

11:16.000 --> 11:26.000
But this was all released to the press in March after the chronological list of charges had been released by the Army, right?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
That's correct.

11:28.000 --> 11:37.000
So that the public was advised that there was blackmail going on as of December 9th at least, and that is still your opinion.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
There was blackmail attempted as of December 9th.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
In the sense of extort, yes, I believe that.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
So as far as you're concerned, the situation was serious prior to January 21st?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Yes, sir.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
And the relations with the Army are reversed.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
The situation, sir?

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Yes, but I say that's with reference to the Army.

12:03.000 --> 12:13.000
Now, if you'll refer to page 4, let's memorandum 7.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Now, about the third paragraph.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Excuse me, sir.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
Maybe it's not the same. I guess the same, but you have the same memorandum.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
memorandum.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
What?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Burntagga?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Well, there's paragraph. As you know.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
As you know, I have on many occasions been pretty cursed with Dave about the prompt submission of memorandum.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
However, in this current situation, view the change of plans I cannot criticize them.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
Well, now, what memo did he submit to you?

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
What memorandum did he submit to you?

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
As I said, I don't recall any specific one that he submitted to me.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
That's one of the things I was curt with him about that.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
So far, as you know, he's never submitted any memorandum to you.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Uh, as far as I know, he's never submitted any memorandum to me.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
See, as I read your sentence, I'm just looking at it literally.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't know what you had in mind.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
But as you know, I'm quoting you now.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
As you know, I have on many occasions been cursed with Dave about the prompt submission of memorandum.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Now, that statement would imply that he'd get it in, but he wasn't very prompt.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
No, it might imply that.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Well, there's been a reasonable implication.

13:33.000 --> 13:45.000
After reasonable implication, but I believe that I wrote this, having in mind that I wish he would submit more memorandum or memorandum, and I wish he would submit them properly.

13:45.000 --> 13:55.000
But all the time that you were staff director starting in July through this period of four dicks,

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
you never received any memorandum from him or a memorandum of any kind relating to his work.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
To your knowledge.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
I don't, I don't recall any of all I may have.

14:09.000 --> 14:23.000
Now, Mr. Car, as I recall, and I'm sure you heard the testimony, Mr. Adams testified that you have suggested to him

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
that he should get in touch with Mr. Solkowski.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Is that true?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
I heard the testimony, the statement is not true.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
So I'm afraid he was his statement.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
So he said that I suggested to him that he get in touch with George Sikowski.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
It is an error, yes sir.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
You never stated that.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
I don't recall ever stating that.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I can, I would tell you more.

14:54.000 --> 15:03.000
Well I'm trying to figure out why you would be suggesting to Mr. Adams that he should get in touch with Mr. Solkowski.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I didn't suggest to him.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
You never did.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
No sir.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
Well, is it partly correct or how does Mr. Solkowski come into this conversation?

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
The statement is not correct in any way.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
There is a situation which I have in mind that I believe he hadn't mind at the time.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
The situation was, this was around the first part of February.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
I recall that Mr. Adams recalled for me in a conversation with him.

15:40.000 --> 16:04.000
How helpful he and the secretary had believed Mr. Sikowski had been at the occasion of a lunch and meeting on November 17th when Mr. Sikowski had discussed with them the preparation of a press relief which I understand they didn't use.

16:04.000 --> 16:18.000
How does joint press conference, this is in relation to November 17th at the Merchants Club, when Secretary Stevenson and Senator McCarty gave a joint press conference.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
I just couldn't understand why someone outside the government would be in this.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
Is he in as sort of a friend of the court and trying to arbitrate?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
No sir.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
No sir. It didn't happen that way.

16:31.000 --> 16:46.000
As I stated, Mr. Adams recalled to me that Mr. Sikowski had been a helpful tool to the secretary and friendly to the secretary and to Mr. Adams at that time.

16:46.000 --> 16:53.000
That was around the first part of the February as I recall.

16:53.000 --> 17:16.000
I think he told me that I told him at that time, rather, that he suggested that maybe Mr. Sikowski could be helpful to him in connection with the, if I recall correctly, this letter that Secretary Stevenson publicly sent to Senator McCarty.

17:16.000 --> 17:24.000
So is your impression that Mr. Sikowski was quite friendly to the secretary and he was trying to help the secretary?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Did he come in? Is that correct?

17:26.000 --> 17:45.000
No, it's, I want to make this clear. Mr. Adams was of the opinion and I think correctly so, was of the opinion that at the time of November 17th Mr. Sikowski had been friendly to the secretary.

17:45.000 --> 17:53.000
I don't know whether that was his first meeting or not, but he thought that Mr. Sikowski had been friendly to the secretary.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Therefore he thought Mr. Sikowski might possibly have the assistance to him, might I say?

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
He's ironing out the differences between the Army and Senator McCarty and the staff.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yes, yes.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Or the Port Mom of Hearing basically.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
Well, over this November 13th, the press conference with Mr. Stevenson held.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
Yes, but it grew out of the Port Mom of Secretary.

18:20.000 --> 18:40.000
Now let me ask you whether the secretary, Mr. Steven or Mr. Adams, one of the investigation of Port Mom of Stop or the executive session of the hearing stop.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I think the one at Port Mom stopped.

18:43.000 --> 18:49.000
Well, what did they seem to be discussing the most?

18:49.000 --> 19:04.000
Were they talking about the executive sessions and the press releases after the executive sessions or were they insisting on stopping of the entire investigation as such?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
I think it's time to get started.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, I...

19:09.000 --> 19:23.000
I recall no time when Mr. Adams or Mr. Steven spoke to me about the press releases after the hearing.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
I recall that Mr. Adams attended many of the press conferences following the hearing.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
I know that Secretary Steven's attended at least a few.

19:32.000 --> 19:41.000
And no time that they say to me and I don't believe Mr. McCarty or Mr. Cohn, anything about the press releases.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
I think that they wanted the executive sessions of the subcommittee on Port Mom of Just Continued.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
I think they wanted the investigation to discontinue.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
They said so.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
I think it's just how they had to...

19:57.000 --> 20:08.000
Mr. Chairman referenced as a maid to the three-and-aubt climate philosophy hearings that was my privilege to serve as chairman.

20:08.000 --> 20:17.000
I would like to state that the work of the staff in preparation for the hearings was excellent.

20:17.000 --> 20:27.000
I think Mr. Cohn should have more of the credit to them.

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
And your comfort was greatly appreciated.

20:34.000 --> 20:46.000
I might also add that the Army and the Navy Air Force and the Department of State will fall on to more information for all of the most well.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
Mr. Carr and referring to your testimony this morning.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
I think you mentioned that they claimed just when...

20:56.000 --> 21:09.000
November the 17th when you and Senator McCarty or Mr. Cohn, Mr. Steven's and others went to Port 6.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
And you were met at the airport by...

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
...from the personnel at the camp there in private Chant.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
I made you state that you're testimony this morning.

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
And Mr. Steven said, in essence, well, this is a good time to have my picture taken with you today.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Is that correct? If not, I wish you would tell me.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
You're like a legend of what Mr. Steven said today.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
That's it in a suggestion.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Who? Who did you say that to?

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
It was my impression that he said it to Mr. Cohn as we were getting off the plane.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
You heard the testimony of Mr. Secretary Steven's and I think Mr. Adam and others.

21:48.000 --> 21:58.000
Who stated that testimony which is in contradiction to yours that no mention was made about having a picture taken with Mr. Cohn.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Is that correct? You'll further get...

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
I'm going to tell you something.

22:01.000 --> 22:08.000
Your policy is in your statement which is under always that Mr. Steven did make a statement stating that he would like to...

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
...just a good time to have his picture taken with you.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes, sir. And I think the proof is that a picture won't take.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
I don't know for the quick.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Your judgment.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
Before the next senator has an opportunity to question Mr. Carlett's return.

22:24.000 --> 22:35.000
Mr. Carlett, where are the committee files kept?

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
Most of the committee files are kept in room 160.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
And where are the others kept?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
The file room is room 160.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
On occasion files will be in my office if we're working.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Now would be the only other place beside the committee room.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Yes, sir.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Would that be temporary or permanent?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
In my office?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Yes.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
That would be temporary, yes.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
And the fact that you previously testified under certain circumstances,

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
all committee staff and critical help would be able to get out the files, wouldn't they?

23:16.000 --> 23:24.000
Well, I testified that physically the committee staff would be able to get out the files.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
I think that made it clear that critical employees are not supposed to go down and spend the time...

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Would you made it very clear that if...

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
...so you were secretary, somebody else in the secretary went down.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
The file clerk wasn't there.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
He'll let the agency not to be there. She'd go ahead and get the file.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
She could do that, yes.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
So the files are in effect available to every member of the committee under certain circumstances?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
That's correct.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
Now, Mr. Carr, do you know what clearance each of your staff members have that is each investigator,

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
each clinical helps to knock her for a fire clerk and so forth?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Yes, sir.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
What are those clearances? Let me put it through this way.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
Have they all got clearances from the Department of Defense and if so on what basis?

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
They have clearances varying degrees of clearance.

24:14.000 --> 24:24.000
One of them has top secret clearance on an 8-0 basis, which has never been retracted.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
Generally, they all have clearance up to and including secrecy.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Now, let's see.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
You say one staff member has a top secret clearance?

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
I recall that one staff member was given a top secret clearance.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I don't know that there was ever rescinded.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And all the others from the Department of Defense have a secret clearance?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Clearances through secret.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
The other clearance is off through secret, yes.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
And it really wouldn't make any difference where the one-hat top secret and all the rest had secret

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
or one-hat secret and all the rest had top secret if they all had access to the files, isn't that right?

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
I would say that it wouldn't make a great deal with different sort of secret or top secret.

25:08.000 --> 25:15.000
Now, have you any clearance from the Atomic Energy Commission and if so on what basis?

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
I don't know of any clearance from the Atomic Energy Commission.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
But you check into that and make it a matter of the record.

25:25.000 --> 25:37.000
Now, as you know, our budget, most of our budget, depending upon our estimate of enemy strength, and that is of course, has a lot to do with the Central Intelligence Agency estimates.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
Are we any clearance staff members in this committee, of this committee, from the Central Intelligence Agency?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Has it ever been asked for and if so on what basis?

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
I don't know of my own knowledge whether any clearance has ever been asked of Central Intelligence Agency.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
I think it would probably be useless to ask an agency for clearance to investigate it.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I did say it by investigating it.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Well, all to use it. It's talking this. I don't have to.

26:04.000 --> 26:11.000
In other words, as long as you brought the word up, it would be unfortunate if we had a subversive on our staff and he hadn't had clearance.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
And then the examiner and agency, and in that agency, he got information which made it possible for him to portray in a country.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
It would be unfortunate and it would be most unusual. We don't have any subversive on this.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Well, class kids was unusual, wasn't they?

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
So it was made. Certainly was.

26:27.000 --> 26:38.000
Now, let me ask another question. Have the staff members got clearance from the FBI and if so, and another clerical help and if so on what basis?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Drop.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Mr. Chairman.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Mr. Chairman, is the clerk here?

26:43.000 --> 26:53.000
No, I think it's point of personal privilege for my staff. Some of your colleagues talking about the possibility of subversive on our staff.

26:53.000 --> 27:00.000
The information is that he knows of some subversive on the staff he does not.

27:00.000 --> 27:08.000
If he knows of any subversive, then he should take this stand until it's above him. He owes the duty otherwise. He owes the duty to apologize.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
To the unmanned wasn't working day and night. To give her to come this.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
Well, Mr. McClown, his friend and Mr. McClown, Mr. Simonton. His friends.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Get your name straight.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Mr. Chairman.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Mr. Chairman.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
The staff member.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
The staff member.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
The point of personal privilege was to determine.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Thank you.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Mr. Chairman.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Mr. Solomonton, he was happy to see you.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Further?

27:35.000 --> 27:35.000


27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
Senator Solomonton knows of no subversive on the staff.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Then he should say so.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
If he has any evidence, then he subversive on my staff.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
Then he should be willing to take the oaths here until it's above him.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
I don't like these innuendos against these young men who have been working so hard and very little salaries.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
To dig out communists, without the help of the men like Senator Solomonton.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Mr. Chairman, I think that's right at first on the front of the security care window.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
He's just not here at the time of his mention.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
I remember him as well.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
I thank you for your time.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
Now let's see where we were, Mr. Carr.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I trust that does not come out of my time.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
It does not.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Thank you.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Getting back to the question of clearance from the federal Bureau of Investigations.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
You know a lot about those clearances.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
No, I don't.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Don't you?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
No.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
When you were at the FBI, you didn't know about clearance.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Yes, I know about clearance.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
But you said I know a lot about them, so I really don't.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
You know I don't much about them.

28:36.000 --> 28:46.000
I want to make it clear here that I was not in any section of the FBI, which handled the aids on matter.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I know that I know that.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
I'm as far as these people on this staff are under your administrative control.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yes, correct.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yes, they were.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
I have not had that.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
I was just having a procedure by May, and I'm trying to frame this question if you'd like to.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I won't be talking to them right now.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
I don't think Mr. Carr finished an answer to a previous question.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
I'm sure it's on the assignment.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
All right, so they go back and pick it up.

29:11.000 --> 29:21.000
Well, what I was leading up to was that I don't know the FBI giving any clearance on any individual.

29:22.000 --> 29:34.000
As I think Senator McCarthy has touched the slide, they have advised us from time to time that they have no directory information concerning members of the staff.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
If they have it fine, you've come time to time, if they have no directory information,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
ensuring any members of the staff.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
That's correct.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
That's correct.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Thank you for that.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Thank you, members.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I have a question.

29:45.000 --> 29:53.000
When I was in the executive branch of the government, the FBI would investigate people provided that you had not hired them.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
That is before they came with you.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Is that now stopped also?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Do you have to know?

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I don't know, that's correct.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
Does this include the clerical members too?

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Have the clerical members as synonymous with clerks?

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Have the clerks as a department of defense, for example?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Yes, sir.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
I'll be right.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
That's correct.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
One more.

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
The other is Chair and Fire of the Members and Committee of the Heavy, the roll of the roll of those is 25 minutes to five.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Mr. Chairman, I have four more questions.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
I'll be through.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm going to move forward.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Chair Rick, now is the new amendment to the one of the personal privilege.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
Chair Rick, now is the new amendment to the one of the personal privilege.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I will recognize it before we leave.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I'll then recognize it as a question.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
The other is the one of the personal privilege.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Chair Rick, and I send his time to the one more question.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
I will recognize you for the 20th personal privilege.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Now I emphasize I have no information.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I am simply asking for information.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
Now, Mr. Kahn, in the present rule for access to files of this committee,

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
temple form retirementers, who have not really reformed or hastened versus

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
or any security risk on this committee staff that might get on it.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
The science of the trade is country.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
By revealing the contents of a secret FBI document,

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
which he had found in the file, based to a possible enemy,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
it would be a relatively simple matter,

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
would have not for him to do that based on the way these files are handled.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Also, I don't, I don't, I don't, uh, deal with you.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
I don't know of any FBI secret documents or they contain enough files.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
There is no, there are no for ported secret documents to the FBI.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Confidence of documents in the file?

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
No sir, I don't know any FBI documents and awful.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
What would you say the two-and-a-quarter page document was?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
That was from the center of this office, sir.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
That was not in the file, that's correct.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
But if it weren't in the file, then it would be possible for somebody to get it under these rules.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Will it?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
We answered the question, and we're going to go to the right.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
The transfer question, and I already answered with the personal privilege.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
I was just having to write the answer in my half-one question.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
I do want to raise that point before we leave the staff to help.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
If he can, we can see it again.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
But I will raise it as brief as I can when I say that some of the assignments have been here,

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
by anyone that trying to smear their staff of young men,

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
who have been working to dig out communists,

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
and talking about what might happen if there were a subversive on the staff,

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
I would like to ask him now,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
even though he's not under rule.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Whether he has any information at all,

32:29.000 --> 32:36.000
or any kind, to justify this attempted smear against these 14 young men,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
who have done such an excellent job on covering communists.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
If he has no information, then he should be honest enough to tell us,

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
if he has information, he should take a stand and take the oath,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
as these young men are taking it.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
Now, we ask you, Senator, do you have any information

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
to indicate that there is anyone in my staff,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
who is subversive, as you have indicated in your questioning?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Any time I can answer the question,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
and as I have to recess the law,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
I will answer that question this way, Senator Cardi.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
In all the years that I have been in this government,

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
they saw the question.
