WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.140
The Foreign Service might do.

00:04.140 --> 00:06.420
When those matters were called to the attention of this committee,

00:06.420 --> 00:08.160
then in the direction, the committee called

00:08.160 --> 00:12.320
before General Walter Beagle Smith, the Undersecretary of State.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.760
When the situation was explained to General Smith,

00:14.760 --> 00:18.960
General Smith said that anything that smacks a retribution

00:18.960 --> 00:22.160
or a reprival against a person has been cooperating

00:22.160 --> 00:23.760
with the committee is wrong.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.840
And I believe that General Smith ordered a reinstatement

00:27.840 --> 00:30.880
of that employee who had testified before this committee.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.400
In behalf of the committee, Mr. Gohan,

00:32.400 --> 00:36.560
you also initiated an investigation of the voice of America.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.620
Yes, sir.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.800
Did you encounter any interference on the dedication

00:40.800 --> 00:42.600
or in the course of that investigation?

00:42.600 --> 00:45.640
Sir, on the end, I would say, insofar as our operations here

00:45.640 --> 00:47.360
in Washington are concerned and our dealings

00:47.360 --> 00:50.880
were tractor chants, who was the administrator during a good

00:50.880 --> 00:53.040
part of the investigation, no sir.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.360
We did not.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.920
Can it inspire?

00:55.920 --> 00:57.560
I need to get it.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.720
Mr. Gohan, I believe you graduated from law school

01:01.720 --> 01:04.440
at a very early age, 20?

01:04.440 --> 01:05.760
I was, I was 23.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.480
You had to wait a year before you could take the bar

01:08.480 --> 01:12.120
because of the law requirements fit in New York.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.680
Wasn't quite a year, sir, I believe it was.

01:14.680 --> 01:15.800
Well, I mean, 21.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.200
Yes, sir.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.280
When you got out of law school, you went to work

01:21.280 --> 01:22.960
in the District Attorney's Office?

01:22.960 --> 01:24.440
Yes, I did.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.840
And what year was that?

01:25.840 --> 01:27.760
47, in 47.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.560
Yes, sir.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.840
And you testified at some length with reference

01:32.840 --> 01:36.520
to your employment in the District Attorney's Office,

01:36.520 --> 01:39.920
which I believe was up until the summer of 52.

01:39.920 --> 01:40.680
That's right, sir.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.840
And then in the summer or early fall,

01:42.840 --> 01:44.840
you came down, you were watching them

01:44.840 --> 01:47.760
to work for Attorney General McGrann.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.280
Yes, sir.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.560
Now, have you had any other legal experience

01:51.560 --> 01:55.680
other than the experience with the federal government?

01:55.680 --> 01:56.880
Any private practice?

01:56.880 --> 01:57.360
Oh, yes, sir.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.760
I've engaged into a very limited extent in private practice,

02:01.760 --> 02:03.600
practically all the time since I've left law school.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.640
But as you probably know, sir, just about impossible

02:06.640 --> 02:08.160
to hold down a job like this.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.880
And a job I held down into the Department of Justice

02:10.880 --> 02:15.080
and have enough free time to both to private practice

02:15.080 --> 02:16.920
and gain any experience, which I would count,

02:16.920 --> 02:17.800
is really worthwhile.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.640
In other words, I would say I haven't been in court

02:20.640 --> 02:22.920
and I have an argument, a case in court,

02:22.920 --> 02:25.680
so I tried to privatize and court in some years.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.520
I think, as a matter of fact, I tried one privatization,

02:30.520 --> 02:33.880
I mean, this will court in New York just after I was admitted.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.400
And I think that's about it.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.120
Are you a member of a law firm now?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.960
Yes, I am.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.360
I read something in one of the magazine articles,

02:41.360 --> 02:43.880
which would indicate that your income from the firm

02:43.880 --> 02:46.640
for one year would be much greater than that,

02:46.640 --> 02:48.440
without mentioning the month.

02:48.440 --> 02:51.360
Much greater than that, which it received

02:51.360 --> 02:53.080
from the federal government.

02:53.080 --> 02:53.760
Is that correct?

02:53.760 --> 02:54.480
Is that correct?

02:54.480 --> 02:55.320
That is correct.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.480
So I would say this, if I may.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.440
I think my income from my private practice

03:00.440 --> 03:03.160
and the clients I have there is greater than the income

03:03.160 --> 03:06.680
I received here, and is probably a lot smaller

03:06.680 --> 03:09.120
than the income I could receive if I was voting full time

03:09.120 --> 03:11.760
to private practice, and probably a lot greater than it will be

03:11.760 --> 03:14.600
when I get finally get back to private practice.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.440
Well, I don't doubt that, sir.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.640
This is called.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.600
And I'm not trying any sort of cash.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.200
I'm going to tell you, if you're going to all year enable lawyer,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200
and I know that you can make a lot more offer,

03:23.200 --> 03:26.200
what I wanted to ask you was that you say

03:26.200 --> 03:27.600
that you've done very little private work,

03:27.600 --> 03:29.680
which your income from your private practice

03:29.680 --> 03:31.400
is much greater than that problem.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.680
Well, sir, I understood your question to be experienced.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.880
Maybe I heard it incorrectly, which I've received

03:35.880 --> 03:39.240
in what's in practice on the social.

03:39.240 --> 03:39.920
I have what I have.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.120
Well, I'm at full office and court process.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.360
I speak in the private practice.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.800
As far as court practice is concerned,

03:44.800 --> 03:48.640
or I tried this one case in the municipal court,

03:48.640 --> 03:52.640
it occurred to me, I, in the course of the six or seven years,

03:52.640 --> 03:53.560
I was in court.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.400
I'm one or two other occasions.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.000
The fault of what's practiced, I have a chance

03:58.000 --> 04:00.800
to do, does not involve appearance in court,

04:00.800 --> 04:04.400
and does not involve things which I would say would give me

04:04.400 --> 04:06.280
experience in the trial of cases

04:06.280 --> 04:08.280
or the arguments of appeal.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.480
It would involve things other than that, sir.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.400
Well, since you've been working for the committee,

04:12.400 --> 04:16.480
have you spent much time in your private practice?

04:16.480 --> 04:19.240
I went to your private, to live to your home private law firm.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.080
Sorry, little sir.

04:20.080 --> 04:20.720
Very little?

04:20.720 --> 04:21.560
Yes, sir.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.560
So that is under you, sir.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.360
Yes.

04:23.360 --> 04:23.920
What's the thing?

04:23.920 --> 04:24.880
I didn't know.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.800
I think the record should show at this time

04:26.800 --> 04:30.360
that the time we employed Mr. F Cohen,

04:30.360 --> 04:31.880
that I informed the committee that he

04:31.880 --> 04:33.480
was a member of the firm, the intent

04:33.480 --> 04:36.160
to continue his membership in the firm,

04:36.160 --> 04:39.600
and that he would have an income outside of his salary

04:39.600 --> 04:43.160
with the committee, instead of discerse very freely.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.640
And nothing mysterious about it.

04:45.640 --> 04:46.880
All of a sudden, you know that that's...

04:46.880 --> 04:48.400
Well, I'm a station, my family.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.400
I need nothing about it.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.880
I don't know that my colleagues...

04:50.880 --> 04:52.280
Well, I'll be clear, it's pretty surely

04:52.280 --> 04:53.680
an information right now, Senator.

04:53.680 --> 04:57.440
Yeah, but I don't recall anything being set about that.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.840
I'm a trade-backer, you'll take a minute.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.840
Does that mean you're meeting a first-time

04:59.840 --> 05:01.680
reappearsment to come on?

05:01.680 --> 05:03.640
You were putting that...

05:03.640 --> 05:05.480
That was a joke.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.080
Yeah.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.400
This thing, a full-time job, I was a little concerned

05:09.400 --> 05:10.600
when I read this article.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.960
Senator, I might say this to you, sir.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.960
Uh...

05:14.960 --> 05:17.960
Possibly, it's because of lack of qualifications

05:17.960 --> 05:19.600
and other things, but to do this job,

05:19.600 --> 05:22.000
I have to put in much more than full-time.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And as far as the time I could, I spend on this job,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.600
or that I spend on any job I've had in the...

05:26.600 --> 05:28.600
If you'll look at that, I'll talk to my forces,

05:28.600 --> 05:30.000
the people I worked for.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I think you'll find that some more of my many failings

05:32.000 --> 05:36.240
will not be the failure to put in a lot of extra hours

05:36.240 --> 05:39.240
of nightstand over weekends and doing my job for the government.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.120
Mr. Cohn, I have no doubts that you're a hard worker,

05:42.120 --> 05:44.120
and I'm not disagreeing with that at all.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.120
It's not only a hard worker, an able lawyer.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.120
I'd like to ask the sheriff for permission to fill in the minute.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.120
So I'll be meeting the...

05:52.120 --> 05:54.120
Mr. Cohn was confirmed,

05:54.120 --> 05:57.120
as soon as I can get those from the money room.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.120
If I may do that.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.120
Yes, there is the actual transcripts I'd like to have that.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.120
They have an inclusive, I think,

06:03.120 --> 06:05.120
and the representative, they give it a number.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.120
I want to see those for the first time.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.120
In the minutes and the transcripts.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.120
And then, the sending is there.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.120
The minister is telling the department

06:12.120 --> 06:13.120
that I can look at them first,

06:13.120 --> 06:14.120
which is presently honest.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.120
You're going to put things in the right place today,

06:16.120 --> 06:18.120
when I was in the right place.

06:18.120 --> 06:22.120
Now, I assume that your law firm is not having

06:22.120 --> 06:24.120
litigation with the federal government.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.120
Farmington, did your law firm have any litigation

06:26.120 --> 06:27.120
with the federal government?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.120
Not to mind, now, as I know.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.120
I certainly have not served any time since I've been

06:30.120 --> 06:31.120
with the federal government,

06:31.120 --> 06:33.120
had any litigation with the federal government

06:33.120 --> 06:35.120
or participated in any matter

06:35.120 --> 06:38.120
where there might be any conflict of interest.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.120
I have no doubt about humanistic calling.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.120
I'm saying that you being a member of the firm,

06:42.120 --> 06:44.120
I want to know what was a firm had in it.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.120
So I'm a member of the firm that's the fairly

06:46.120 --> 06:47.120
substantial practice.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.120
What is the name of the firm?

06:48.120 --> 06:49.120
The name of the firm.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.120
Thank you.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.120
Let him get to the district.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.120
His current C-U-R-R-I-N-Mahoney cone,

06:54.120 --> 06:57.120
which is me and Tim, as the I-N.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.120
One of my well-to-the-state senator's turn.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.120
The secretary, now he's the current,

07:01.120 --> 07:03.120
is the Republican County chairman of New York,

07:03.120 --> 07:06.120
and the secretary of state of the state of New York.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.120
Senator Mahoney is state senator from the state of New York,

07:09.120 --> 07:12.120
and the Democratic leader of the state

07:12.120 --> 07:13.120
senate of New York.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.120
I am who I am and Mr. Tim does the work.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.120
Sort of a bipartisan.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.120
Is it a firm?

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
I'm going to say bipartisan.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.120
I guess that's like the anti-interpolite thing.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.120
But someone's a Democrat or Republican.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.120
That's not making sense.

07:24.120 --> 07:47.120
Now, Mr. Cullen, you made reference to the document,

07:47.120 --> 07:50.120
which was introduced in record,

07:51.120 --> 07:53.120
from a Mr. Paul Kout.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.120
Yes sir.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.120
And I believe you stated that this was the document

07:57.120 --> 07:59.120
that started the investigation of the military.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.120
No sir.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.120
You didn't?

08:02.120 --> 08:03.120
No sir.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.120
This was one of a, I was trying to summarize,

08:05.120 --> 08:08.120
that Mr. Jenkins requested a number of things,

08:08.120 --> 08:10.120
which came out at the beginning of this investigation.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.120
That was one among a large number of items.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.120
I specify other items in addition to that.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.120
This was one of the memorandums that I watched submitted.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.120
I should make great with you about that.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.120
This was one that was...

08:21.120 --> 08:26.120
Well, it's my recall when I'll have to look at the transcript,

08:26.120 --> 08:32.120
but it was my recollection that the document given to you,

08:32.120 --> 08:36.120
which you stated, I believe, was in the regular files of the subcommittee,

08:36.120 --> 08:42.120
when some Mr. Kout and that it was the document that started the investigation

08:42.120 --> 08:43.120
of the army.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.120
No sir.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.120
First of all, it was not given to me.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.120
It was given to Mr. Shine.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.120
Second of all, he worked with Paul Crash on that.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.120
Second of all, sir, I don't believe I said that,

08:53.120 --> 08:54.120
that's not given to me.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.120
It's not of the investigation.

08:55.120 --> 08:58.120
There are a number of things, which contributed to the start of the investigation.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.120
And I believe I outlined both in probably too much detail.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.120
Well, I certainly agree with you, Senator.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.120
If you wanted to use this as a basis for some additional questioning,

09:07.120 --> 09:10.120
I certainly agree with you that that is one of the documents that was submitted

09:10.120 --> 09:12.120
and one of the documents we did consider.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.120
Well, what were the other principal documents?

09:14.120 --> 09:16.120
Oh, there were good numbers, sir.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.120
You want me to recite that?

09:18.120 --> 09:21.120
Just a first of all, I remember there was a record on Fort Monmouth.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.120
There was a record made by another...

09:23.120 --> 09:25.120
What do you mean a record on Fort Monmouth?

09:25.120 --> 09:27.120
Well, I was just trying to tell you a second.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.120
There was a record made by another group down in Congress.

09:30.120 --> 09:34.120
I don't think it was ever made public, although I'm not sure,

09:34.120 --> 09:39.120
concerning the disappearance of a large number of documents from the secret army radar laboratories

09:39.120 --> 09:40.120
at Fort Monmouth.

09:40.120 --> 09:44.120
That was made available to us at the very beginning, and we went into that and studied that.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.120
Other information was applied to us.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.120
We had...

09:48.120 --> 09:50.120
All in the committee file?

09:50.120 --> 09:51.120
I mean, sir.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.120
We've all been in the committee file.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.120
Yes, I'm sure it is.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.120
And that was from another committee in Congress?

09:57.120 --> 09:58.120
Yes, sir.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.120
I think it was.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.120
And when did you get that information around the same time, sir?

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
That February or March?

10:04.120 --> 10:05.120
Yes, sir.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
February or March, 1953?

10:06.120 --> 10:07.120
Yes, sir.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.120
That's my recollection.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
I have that same time.

10:09.120 --> 10:13.120
Now, you stated that this document referring to the crowd documents

10:13.120 --> 10:15.120
was in the regular file for the subcommittee.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.120
Room 101 of the subcommittee.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.120
By some words, sir.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.120
I'm sure it was.

10:19.120 --> 10:23.120
And if it might have been in one of the other rooms, the subcommittee keeps there.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.120
I can't swear it.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.120
I'm sure within the regular file of the subcommittee available.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.120
So I looked at the document.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.120
As I recall, you stated that...

10:34.120 --> 10:35.120
That...

10:36.120 --> 10:40.120
Is in the regular file of the subcommittee, this is from page 3902,

10:40.120 --> 10:42.120
and Room 101 of the subcommittee office is served.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.120
The subcommittee is in smart.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.120
Now, I looked over this file.

10:47.120 --> 10:53.120
And I don't see how any senator could possibly find it.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.120
It has no file number.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.120
And the house was...

10:57.120 --> 10:59.120
Any senator possibly knows this incident.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.120
By, I would say in this way, sir.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.120
One of the subcommittee's subcommittee's, say, user,

11:03.120 --> 11:07.120
had called me and asked me what preliminary investigations were underway.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.120
I'd come up here often, and I would have told you I would have mentioned this one.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.120
If he wanted to see the file on preliminary investigation,

11:14.120 --> 11:16.120
as a communist infiltration in the Army,

11:16.120 --> 11:18.120
this would have been in one of the several files

11:18.120 --> 11:20.120
and the doubly that would have been displayed to you, sir.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.120
Well, but isn't there a regular filing system?

11:22.120 --> 11:25.120
That has been in existence for some five or six years.

11:25.120 --> 11:29.120
I don't think anything has been in existence for five or six years.

11:29.120 --> 11:34.120
I think that the way of doing things was changed quite a bit

11:34.120 --> 11:37.120
after the reorganization of Congress in 1953.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.120
I know, sir, that I had...

11:39.120 --> 11:41.120
I would say the reorganization...

11:41.120 --> 11:43.120
The rework more senator Potter begins to...

11:43.120 --> 11:45.120
...to be doing my thinner-in-the-art studio to cost the country

11:45.120 --> 11:47.120
to permit our stations to identify themselves.

11:47.120 --> 11:50.120
Mr. O'on, this is ABC Television Network.

11:50.120 --> 11:55.120
This is about a park made by Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams against Jews.

11:55.120 --> 12:00.120
In fact, that new as Chief Comfor this committee,

12:00.120 --> 12:03.120
knew the investigating arm of the Senate,

12:03.120 --> 12:07.120
too, as a top-only army to...

12:07.120 --> 12:10.120
...in an effort to secure upright for treatment for a day's shock.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.120
You agree that that is the essence of the charge

12:13.120 --> 12:15.120
that were made against you?

12:15.120 --> 12:16.120
It's hard to answer that, sir.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.120
It certainly was the import of what was published in the newspapers

12:19.120 --> 12:22.120
and what, within some of these original documents, they released.

12:22.120 --> 12:26.120
When I heard the testimony, particularly the questioning on cross-examination,

12:26.120 --> 12:31.120
I was interested to note that neither one could give a single specific instance

12:31.120 --> 12:34.120
in which anything such as you suggest occurred,

12:34.120 --> 12:37.120
and I say under no such thing ever did occur.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.120
Well, I'm with the purpose of question,

12:40.120 --> 12:43.120
is to say the original charge is that were made.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
Yes, sir.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.120
That's what Chargy's work is.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.120
Would you consider that a serious charge?

12:51.120 --> 12:55.120
Oh, sir, I would certainly say any abuse of power on the cross of this committee,

12:55.120 --> 12:58.120
or any member of its staff, would certainly be a...

12:58.120 --> 13:02.120
...very serious matter, which should be dealt with by the committee.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.120
I don't say, sir, it's...

13:04.120 --> 13:08.120
Well, I'm not sure if it's dealt with by the committee in some way.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.120
Yes, sir.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.120
No, the follow-up question, not, sir.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.120
If those charges were approved...

13:13.120 --> 13:15.120
Yes, sir.

13:15.120 --> 13:20.120
Would you feel that your services as Chief Falmsville of the committee has been...

13:20.120 --> 13:21.120
...since these?

13:21.120 --> 13:22.120
Sure.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.120
Now, if what Chargy did at all...

13:25.120 --> 13:34.120
You'll bring with me that a non-consumable act has been committed by some members of the Army.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.120
So, once again, I've been trying to avoid characterizing.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.120
I certainly think that he left me directly.

13:40.120 --> 13:46.120
The act was the unconsumable, and I think it was unconsumable, and I think it is unconsumable.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.120
Yes, sir. Yes, the charges are not true.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.120
Yes, sir. But they made it.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.120
Yes, non-consumable act.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.120
Yes, sir.

13:52.120 --> 13:57.120
And that the persons responsible for that act...

13:57.120 --> 13:59.120
...should be...

13:59.120 --> 14:02.120
...gill group with me should no longer hold a position of public trust.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.120
So, that's a little high for me at the fair time.

14:05.120 --> 14:09.120
I don't know just what the ramifications behind the whole thing might be,

14:09.120 --> 14:13.120
and just what they were doing, and why they were doing it, and who told them to do it,

14:13.120 --> 14:18.120
and a lot of other things, which would enter into a judgment as to...

14:19.120 --> 14:22.120
...that, and I would rather not pass any kind of judgment on them.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
The reason I'm...

14:23.120 --> 14:26.120
...the reason I'm working along with climate phones, the fact that...

14:26.120 --> 14:30.120
...just as to me, when the charges were made, they were...

14:30.120 --> 14:33.120
...it was a serious shock. So, that's reason.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.120
Yes, sir, they're true.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.120
You ask committed a...

14:37.120 --> 14:40.120
...you take an unpopular advantage of your position with that committed.

14:40.120 --> 14:45.120
And in full, you are being aligned by people...

14:45.120 --> 14:52.120
...for purposes that the committee should have to know the reason for their position.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.120
Yes.

14:53.120 --> 15:00.120
Now, I understand the charges made by Mr. Seagal's and his wrath.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.120
And one of them was that you...

15:03.120 --> 15:05.120
...flected to elect the army.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.120
Yes.

15:06.120 --> 15:12.120
Now, Mr. Jenkins, there's examination of you, his fellow deaths very well, but I want...

15:12.120 --> 15:13.120
...the ones again.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.120
Does it...

15:14.120 --> 15:15.120
...to ask you?

15:15.120 --> 15:16.120
Did you...

15:16.120 --> 15:17.120
...flected to elect the army?

15:17.120 --> 15:21.120
No, sir. I testified about that conversation on January 14th, and I...

15:21.120 --> 15:22.120
...my statement...

15:22.120 --> 15:27.120
...not only did I not threaten directly army, but Mr. Adams never believed that for one minute.

15:27.120 --> 15:31.120
If he did, sir, he would not have called me up at my home weeks later.

15:31.120 --> 15:35.120
He would not have tried to continue with social relationship with me, and he would not have acted the way he did.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.120
Yes, sir, Cole, did you...

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
...flected to get Mr. Seagal's job?

15:39.120 --> 15:40.120
No, sir, and if I had to...

15:40.120 --> 15:43.120
...if I had done that, sir, Mr. Adams would not have acted the way he did.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.120
I'm sure.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.120
You were following Mr. Steven's...

15:50.120 --> 15:53.120
...and they both were Mr. Adams.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.120
From the same last...

15:55.120 --> 15:56.120
...left.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.120
Left, yes?

15:57.120 --> 15:59.120
Five of the time...

15:59.120 --> 16:01.120
...had received a commission.

16:01.120 --> 16:06.120
Or if he had received an assignment to the New York Army.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.120
Yes.

16:07.120 --> 16:12.120
I felt that their troubles with this committee would have seen.

16:12.120 --> 16:19.120
And I believe that they specify that they thought that the troubles committee would have seen.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.120
Now, I'd like to ask you...

16:21.120 --> 16:27.120
...if Mr. Steven's time had received an assignment to the New York area...

16:27.120 --> 16:33.120
...would that have made any difference to you or to the committee?

16:33.120 --> 16:39.120
And it's a program for investigating the foot momos.

16:39.120 --> 16:43.120
Okay, the answer to that, sir, in the record proves that it is no, sir.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.120
Second of all, Senator Potter, I might point out that as I recall, when Senator McCaw...

16:46.120 --> 16:51.120
...the interrogated Mr. Steven on this point, Mr. Steven said he did not think...

16:51.120 --> 16:53.120
...that the hearings would have stopped.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.120
And of course, they would not have.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
In any way.

16:56.120 --> 17:02.120
Now, when the statement issued by Senator McCawsey or, sir, Mr. Talk...

17:02.120 --> 17:10.120
...you state that Mr. Adams and Mr. Steven...

17:10.120 --> 17:15.120
...were using private time as a work of a phone...

17:15.120 --> 17:20.120
...that an effort to call off the investigation of foot momos.

17:20.120 --> 17:24.120
Now, do you testify to that defect today?

17:24.120 --> 17:25.120
Yes, sir.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.120
I think I told him direct examination.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.120
Senator Potter, some of the things that Mr. Adams did...

17:29.120 --> 17:33.120
...and said on this matter, for instance, that January 4th, these conversations...

17:33.120 --> 17:36.120
...on this all that seems matter.

17:36.120 --> 17:41.120
And some earlier conversations, I think it was certainly very clear to Mr. Carren.

17:41.120 --> 17:48.120
I think it was clear to me that Mr. Adams was trying to use that in some way.

17:48.120 --> 17:53.120
Well, with your reaction of that, Mr. Steven, Mr. Adams...

17:53.120 --> 17:59.120
...about the second time you called them, or they stopped with you, but...

17:59.120 --> 18:01.120
...now, Mr. Shind...

18:01.120 --> 18:04.120
...a assignment in the Army.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.120
Yes, sir.

18:05.120 --> 18:09.120
Okay, just as you, one of the private signs will serve as any other man...

18:09.120 --> 18:11.120
...I don't want him to stop the with you.

18:11.120 --> 18:15.120
For our investigation concerns, you can investigate the Army to do so.

18:15.120 --> 18:19.120
Now, what was your reaction again to a statement of action?

18:19.120 --> 18:23.120
Well, I suppose that would have ended that, sir, but there was...

18:23.120 --> 18:28.120
I might say there was never any request by us for any kind of preferential treatment for Shind.

18:28.120 --> 18:32.120
The only discussion we had with Mr. Steven's and Mr. Adams was about this...

18:32.120 --> 18:36.120
...arrangement to let him finish up some of his work...

18:36.120 --> 18:40.120
...on the question of using his services in the Army based on his qualifications.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.120
Mr. Steven was very kind about that, sir.

18:43.120 --> 18:47.120
Mr. Steven came forward on several occasions and said that he was making such arrangements...

18:47.120 --> 18:54.120
...because he felt that would be in the interest of the Army to use one...

18:54.120 --> 18:57.120
...like qualifications in this field, in this field.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.120
And that was said by Mr. Steven.

18:59.120 --> 19:05.120
Mr. Steven's fancy and direct executive, I'd have ever suggested to me or to anybody else...

19:05.120 --> 19:09.120
...that the arrangement about Shind finishing his committee work or anything like that...

19:09.120 --> 19:11.120
...was improper in any way.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.120
I suppose all he would have to do was just tell us that there was something wrong about it...

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
...and it shouldn't be done.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.120
Would that have been in the target?

19:18.120 --> 19:21.120
I think it would have much choice, sir. Mr. Steven's has done them...

19:21.120 --> 19:24.120
...no application to talk to me about that or about anything else.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.120
Now Mr. Cohen...

19:32.120 --> 19:37.120
You testified that when Mr. Adams comes back to you in a late room 101...

19:37.120 --> 19:43.120
...about an overseas assignment for Travis John.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.120
He tied that in with the hearings that fought months.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
Yes sir.

19:49.120 --> 19:57.120
Now is it your testimony that he was toying with you to using David Shind's assignments...

19:57.120 --> 20:03.120
...the threatening to send David Shind overseas unless what you call off the...

20:03.120 --> 20:06.120
I think he was trying to serve.

20:06.120 --> 20:12.120
I think that they could feel a fading on Mr. Adams's part of me and other people...

20:12.120 --> 20:14.120
...in connection with this whole matter.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.120
When he discussed that with you, did it...

20:16.120 --> 20:20.120
...was it a light vein or was he certain?

20:20.120 --> 20:26.120
Sir, I have to say that he was serious about that.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.120
I don't have to tell you, sir.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.120
It's very hard to make a picture of a relationship.

20:32.120 --> 20:37.120
It's just that over a long period of time between Mr. Adams and the staff of this committee...

20:37.120 --> 20:41.120
...we know him well, we were friends, good friends, we spent a lot of time together...

20:41.120 --> 20:45.120
...social eating and in every other way there was a good deal of fading.

20:45.120 --> 20:50.120
There was a good deal of joking and practical joking and I can give you a numerous examples...

20:50.120 --> 20:51.120
...going on back and forth.

20:51.120 --> 20:55.120
When you asked me about the January 14 conversation that did make an impression on me...

20:55.120 --> 20:59.120
...I thought it was unusual and I thought that Mr. Adams was serious.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.120
Time. Time is time.

21:05.120 --> 21:10.120
Mr. Cohen, I made a statement yesterday about the internal security of the United States.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.120
Yes, sir. We couldn't continue it because of lunch.

21:13.120 --> 21:18.120
I said that there were no courtative action which were available to any man in the service...

21:18.120 --> 21:21.120
...or in the services or any civilian in our federal government...

21:21.120 --> 21:27.120
...that he could take before coming to the Congress with respect to any graph, inefficiency or subversion.

21:27.120 --> 21:32.120
When she might feel or she might feel existed in their branches of the service or government...

21:32.120 --> 21:38.120
...I pointed out to take a just-go-around intermediate superior to persons higher in the chain of command...

21:38.120 --> 21:43.120
...that they could go to the investigating and intelligence departments of their branches...

21:43.120 --> 21:46.120
...like the Office of Special Investigations of the Air Force...

21:46.120 --> 21:50.120
...G2 of the Army, for the Office of Naval Intelligence.

21:50.120 --> 21:54.120
And I said further that if such a person was still dissatisfied...

21:54.120 --> 21:58.120
...well, feels that his whole branch of service was corrupt and no good.

21:58.120 --> 22:04.120
He could go to the Department of Justice or his investigative agency, the FBI, with his complaint.

22:04.120 --> 22:10.120
And finally, I said the Congress of the United States could be the court of last resort.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.120
Of course, the members of the Congress are also subject to the law of the land.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.120
I want to make clear that I was talking about a right to give information...

22:18.120 --> 22:23.120
...when we are talking about documents which have been classified secret or confidential.

22:23.120 --> 22:28.120
I want to emphasize that I feel that any service man at one for any federal employee...

22:28.120 --> 22:31.120
...has to be governed by the law of the land.

22:31.120 --> 22:35.120
Now Mr. Cohen, I want to ask you some questions...

22:35.120 --> 22:38.120
...about the internal security of the United States.

22:38.120 --> 22:42.120
And would you be good enough to answer them as much as you can, yes or no?

22:42.120 --> 22:45.120
Yes sir. Because as you know, my question time is limited.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.120
Yes sir.

22:46.120 --> 22:50.120
There are three principal committees in the Congress which deal with subversives.

22:50.120 --> 22:56.120
The government committee on operation, the Senate Internal Security Committee, the House on the American Affairs Committee...

22:56.120 --> 23:01.120
...and there is also the federal Bureau of Investigation dealing with the same problem. Is that correct?

23:01.120 --> 23:02.120
Yes sir.

23:02.120 --> 23:05.120
Now suppose the government employee and the executive branch of the government...

23:05.120 --> 23:08.120
...ha charge of a document stands top secret...

23:08.120 --> 23:12.120
...which he thought was not being given proper attention by his superior.

23:12.120 --> 23:17.120
Would you think it was right for him to give that document to the chairman of this committee?

23:17.120 --> 23:20.120
Sir, I hope at the beginning I could give you a yes or no answer...

23:20.120 --> 23:22.120
...but I've got to say right now that it's not even the netting.

23:22.120 --> 23:26.120
This rate is some very great issue in which I might not be too well qualified.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.120
I'll do your best to give me a yes or no...

23:28.120 --> 23:29.120
...because I only have ten minutes.

23:29.120 --> 23:33.120
I just can't answer it sir. I just can't give you this best picture...

23:33.120 --> 23:35.120
...and even what little I know about it by yes or no answer.

23:35.120 --> 23:38.120
I have to go into some detail and let me repeat the question.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.120
I got a reply.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.120
I'd like to repeat it if I may.

23:41.120 --> 23:45.120
I got to ask the poll of the government employee and the executive branch of the government...

23:45.120 --> 23:48.120
...ha charge of a document stands top secret...

23:48.120 --> 23:52.120
...which he thought was not being given proper attention by his superior.

23:52.120 --> 23:56.120
Would you think it was right for him to give that document to the chairman of this committee?

23:56.120 --> 23:59.120
It seems to me you could answer that pretty closely yes or no.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.120
Sir, can't it all. I'm much more on the speech.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.120
Then will you do that here?

24:03.120 --> 24:05.120
When you do this in order to help me with my questioning...

24:05.120 --> 24:09.120
...will you get up a file for the record and we can take it up later.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.120
How my next question is to Cohen.

24:11.120 --> 24:17.120
Would it be right for this gentleman to give it to the chairman of the Internal Security Committee?

24:17.120 --> 24:19.120
Sir, maybe I can answer these questions this way.

24:19.120 --> 24:24.120
I think it would be right for that gentleman to act in accordance with his own.

24:24.120 --> 24:28.120
So the constitution of this country, for his god, to protect this country...

24:28.120 --> 24:31.120
...against all enemies far and emblematic.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.120
I think that would be a decision which he would have to make.

24:33.120 --> 24:37.120
And if he were going to report some instance of failure to act particularly...

24:37.120 --> 24:43.120
...where it involves protection of our communists or a spy, aister...

24:43.120 --> 24:48.120
...we have to see an awful lot before I could condemn him for going to the chairman of the...

24:48.120 --> 24:52.120
...duly elected chairman of a committee of the Congress of the United States of America...

24:52.120 --> 24:54.120
...which is in business for that purpose.

24:54.120 --> 24:58.120
Now, Mr. Cohen, with all due respect to you, I didn't talk about a spy.

24:58.120 --> 25:01.120
I said of a document stamped top secret.

25:01.120 --> 25:04.120
Do you think about what?

25:04.120 --> 25:07.120
Suppose a government employee, the executive branch of the government...

25:07.120 --> 25:10.120
...had charge of a document, stamped top secret...

25:10.120 --> 25:13.120
...which he thought was not being given proper attention by his superior.

25:13.120 --> 25:17.120
Would you think it was right for him to give that document to the chairman of the committee?

25:17.120 --> 25:21.120
I regret very much that at times and I cannot possibly answer that question...

25:21.120 --> 25:23.120
...covering the vast field which is as yes or no.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.120
But may we proceed?

25:24.120 --> 25:25.120
Shall we?

25:25.120 --> 25:27.120
Would it be right to give it to the chairman of the Internal Security Committee?

25:27.120 --> 25:29.120
Is your answer the same on that?

25:29.120 --> 25:30.120
My answer is the same, sir.

25:30.120 --> 25:33.120
Sometimes I would be very happy to tell you what I think about all of these things...

25:33.120 --> 25:36.120
...I might be wrong about a lot of them. It's a long story.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.120
I can't guarantee you that I know anything.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.120
Would you answer the same on that you can't answer the same?

25:41.120 --> 25:46.120
Would you respect to the rights of giving it to the chairman of the Un-American Activities Committee?

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
Yes.

25:47.120 --> 25:52.120
Your answer then would be the same with respect to giving a top secret document to any committee chairman.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.120
Is that true?

25:53.120 --> 25:57.120
My answer would have to be, sir, in order to get the picture accurate.

25:57.120 --> 26:01.120
We would have to go into specifics and see just what we are talking about...

26:01.120 --> 26:06.120
...what type of a case and just what the practical situation has been in the government of the United States...

26:06.120 --> 26:10.120
...over the past few years, because I have known it both from the executive end...

26:10.120 --> 26:11.120
...from the legislative standpoint.

26:11.120 --> 26:16.120
Mr. Cohen, have you ever heard of a former congressman named Vito Marc Antonio from your state?

26:16.120 --> 26:17.120
Have I heard of him?

26:17.120 --> 26:18.120
Yes.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.120
Or yes?

26:19.120 --> 26:23.120
His Vito Marc Antonio has been chairman or a member of the House on American Activities Committee.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.120
Would it be all right for you to give him this top secret information?

26:26.120 --> 26:28.120
We don't mark Antonio.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.120
I wouldn't give him the right time, sir.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.120
I think it's on him.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.120
No, sir.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.120
Now, as the chairman of one of these committees were unavailable...

26:35.120 --> 26:40.120
...do you think a government employee could give this top secret document to a member of the committee staff?
