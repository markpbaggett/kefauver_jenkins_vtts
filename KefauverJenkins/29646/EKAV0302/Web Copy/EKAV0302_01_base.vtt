00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
You're up to date now.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.200
I'm sure.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.000
You're up to date now.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm sure.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
You're up to date now.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
I'm sure.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
All right, good luck.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Once again, ladies and gentlemen,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
they are very nice to bring you the D-3 reports

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
from your Center for Dopsies and Dopsies.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
D-3 reports are dropped to the other public service

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
in the station for D-3.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
You can better inform that you're acting

00:31.000 --> 00:32.500
as a new government,

00:32.500 --> 00:34.000
as a government officer.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
If you've voted also out for every new state

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
of justice,

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
but here now,

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
you can be a new president.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Thank you, Charlie,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
and how do you do friends and centers, please?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
This was an ominous speech in Washington,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
and a decision was made affecting the security forces

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
of the district.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
The situation was not new.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
We were in a conflict in the same situation in 1931,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
and I'm sure you were what it's like to start your path.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
In 1936, when Mr. Lee and his father

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
took the office,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
the same situation was conducted

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
in 1937 in the act of his nation's Germany

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
and Hitler-Late-Generated Spanish Civil War.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
And in 1939,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
when the Nazis disresorted cities and promises

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
and stormed the detective's defective.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
The situation was not entirely unliked,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
1948, when the detective's back to the office

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
began overrun.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
That time, by the Soviet Union.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
No, the situation was nothing new.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
But for the first time, the challenge was met.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
The glove was called.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
The division of the United States

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
and of the United Nations' organization

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
was made clear.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
We courageously and forthrightfully

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
took affirmative action

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
and if the First Force War

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
took military invasion and the butt.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
And as this broadcast is made,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
it might appear that the Soviet Union

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
had understood our position sufficiently.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
The whiphole in its further age

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
was a North Korean aggression.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Senator, this is probably the most important issue

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
you have discussed in nearly a year

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
and a half of these reports.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm taking the name of these reports

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
and nearly all our questions to this test.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Well, I think that's the final proper challenge.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I want the far as I can

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
to give the people back home a true picture

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
of what has happened.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
The name is very sweet, Senator.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
It's doing that in fact,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
a shooting war with Russia

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
by taking the time stand

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
in the section of the South of the South for you.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Yes, of course we do.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
And the normal and natural secret to things

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
is we pick up our guns

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
and go to the aid of the nation

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
which is being assaulted by allies

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
to the Soviet Union

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
and violation of treaties

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
which we have entered into.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
We might well expect the Soviet Union

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
to retaliate against us

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
and against our friends.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
How then, Senator?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Can we just fire our positions

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
if this incident is charged

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
with that self-prepared rule?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, our position is just

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
fired in two conditions.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
In the first place,

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
as I pointed out earlier,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
the democracies have always waited

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
until a migration action

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
is well underway before doing anything about it.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Figuratively, our people have not

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
been eager to take up a position

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
until the enemy reached the end of the time.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
The dictators know this

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
and count on our test assistant's papers.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
They give them adequate time

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
to seize much territory

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
and to consolidate their gains.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Think about positions

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
before taking the attack

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
against the stronger democracy.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
If we had nipped the aggression

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
in the blood in Manchuria in 1931,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
I would probably have been

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
no pro-Fobber in 1941.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
If we had taken up the challenge

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
of Italy and Ethiopia in 1936,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
it is very likely that Italy

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
would have dropped her hand

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
of the Italian German Act.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Staying to do that,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
we could have entered the age

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
we could have entered the axis

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
in 1937 in Germany

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
and Italian claims.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
A lot of states.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
More in point, perhaps,

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
was the German invasion

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
of Czechoslovakia in 1939

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
after the Munich Congress.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
If the United States and England

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
had come to the rescue

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
of the Czechoslovakia,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
there would have been no D.J. in London.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
We permitted the Soviet Union

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
to double up Czechoslovakia

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
in 1948 once again.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
And now, why would not the Kremlin

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
have believed we had tended

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
to permit her to take

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
overall weak nations

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
before getting together

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
and standing together?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
In other words,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
as a solid,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
we are to defer Russian

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
instructions and bring

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
up all the communist

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
aggression.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
We must act to stop them

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
in the beginning

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
to cause aggression,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
or breed aggression.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
We should never forget that

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
the mere absence

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
of the shooting law

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
is not peace.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
We have not been at peace

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
for the Soviet Union

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
for many, many months now.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
But this is the first violation

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
of the United Nations' speech.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
In our opinion,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
we are smart to believe

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
no doubt in the evil minds

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
of the men of the Kremlin

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
that we intend to

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
back up our promises.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
This is the

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
standard of aggression

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
and violation of the UN

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
charge.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Otherwise, we would

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
profit our position

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
of world leadership.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Some arise,

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
we were just

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
fired in the effort

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
to speak about World War 3.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I just made it begin.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
We mentioned the second

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
justification.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Well, it's this.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
If war is inevitable,

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
there's nothing

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
will do the Kremlin,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
but to shoot it out

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
with the democracy.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
The mission is to place it

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
against.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
We have a farmer basis

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
in Japan, in Alaska,

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
and on the stop specific

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
hours.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
And Korea is geographically

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
located towards the

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
vulnerable to attacks

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
from our naval forces.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
We say it perfectly

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
that this action was

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
twice the cause of

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
some of the withdrawal

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
at the Dresden policy.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
But if it does not,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
the democracies are in good

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
strategic positions.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Fight the war

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
in the strategy strong.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Your idea, then,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
is that our whole nation

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
is going to be

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
in a situation

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
where we are at the end.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Is that our whole

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
action may give the

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Kremlin's power

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
to consider.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
It convinced them that

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
we mean this.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Secondly, we are wrong

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
in that assumption.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
And this is the best

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
place to fight a war

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
with war people

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
to fight.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Exactly that.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
And furthermore,

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
that the

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
fighting worked more by

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
letting the get-tired

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
with one thing up

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
through another,

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
and finally we are

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
divided and not in

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
as good as the

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
discuses family

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
we are now.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Now, what action on

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
the part of the world

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
is that we are in

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
time.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Is that a bad

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
situation?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Well, we have

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
gone along the 38th

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
parallel into the

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
states of the

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
movement.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
I doubt that the

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
communists will

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
surrender our

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
given.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
But if they will make a

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
strategic withdrawal,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
behind that line,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
for the purpose of

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
re-gripping their

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
forces, in order to

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
save their

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
places, I think

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
the crisis will

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
have been.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Where's another

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
question, Senator?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
You mentioned

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
maintaining the integrity

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
of the United Nations

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
action of the

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Union Security

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Council, as far as

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
before, we could

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
have said the

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
military is doubt

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
for re-gripping.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, technically

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
speaking, that's right.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Of course, the

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Soviet Union is

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
withdrawn from the

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
security council over

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
the speeding of the

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
delegates from

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
national camps.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
That about you

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
relieved yourself of

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
the privilege of the

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
people in the action of

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
the Security Council.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
That's a matter of fact,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
the intention of the

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
stand-for-sistered

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
conference, when the

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
UN daughter was

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
approved, has

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
never been put into

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
action.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
The political

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
43 was adopted to

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
take care of

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
situations such as this.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
But no military staff

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
committee,

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
and no international

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
police force,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
wherever it

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
establishes, as

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
was in action.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
This was never

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
done because of

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Russian opposition.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
The attack in

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Correa was

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
tied as a

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
congressional action, but

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
it had been

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
necessary to

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
put our truth

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
in the ship

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
after the

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
forces of the

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
UN Security Council.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
There was no

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
time for delay, and

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
we were forced to

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
take the responsibility

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
of the

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
security council

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
resolution.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
But that's all

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
members of the

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
council to use all

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
possible means.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Because the North

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Correa invaders

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
to withdraw

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
behind the

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
foreign line of steps.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Council later

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
authorized all UN

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
number nations to act

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
individually to

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
process the

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
questions.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Our effectiveness

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
is expectedness

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
will have been

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
well, to be

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
expected as long.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
And let me say

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
for the more that, if

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
the UN is not

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
taken up this

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
position, the

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
government will

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
have

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
dismissed

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
an

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
asylum.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
The United

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Nations

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
organization will

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Russia lose space

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
for the people

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
and satellites to

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
back down.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Well, there are two

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
things to remember about

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
that too.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
The Kremlin is

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
operating through the

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
North Correa

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
army.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Not through

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
our own

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
military forces.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Just as a

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
test call might be

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
thrust out out of

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
mouth.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
The Kremlin is

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
responsible for

08:35.000 --> 08:35.000


08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
military forces.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
This news will be told

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
to the people just

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
away to someone once

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
to tell

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
them not at all

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
if they were.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
I see no danger in this

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
district.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
That will be the

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
reaction

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
to nations

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
that can't

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
treat them.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Our firm

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
position will give

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
full encourage to all

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
the

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
nations lying

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
outside the

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
armed forces.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
All the ways

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
can stand to Iran,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
to Burla.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
To the

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
country.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
We have to

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
think about keeping

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
this peace.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Then we'll hear what

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
was the reaction of

09:07.000 --> 09:07.000


09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
better

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
disfigure the

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
status of that.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Well, I

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
think that the

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
President with

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
wills ensure

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
a demonstration that we

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
intended to keep the

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
peace, even if it's

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
not fighting

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Russia to

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
deserve.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
It was

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
heralded in

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Washington

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
and relational.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
The only

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
criticism I have

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
heard

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
are seen

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
in the

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
streets of

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
China.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Let me ask you a

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
question, Charlie, you were

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
down in

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Tennessee when

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
that's attacking, what was

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
the reaction in

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Tennessee.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Well, I was

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
saying that

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
everybody was very

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
concerned about this, and

09:44.000 --> 09:44.000


09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
saying to

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
think that the

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
President

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
was

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
concerned about the

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
war.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
The

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
way

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
moved

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
him ever before, I

09:55.000 --> 09:55.000


09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
in his

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
generation, the

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
long-range

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
situation.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Well, I'm glad

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
to hear that, Charlie.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I have

10:02.000 --> 10:02.000


10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
bin for my

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
distance point that

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
the general public has

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
not made it which is

10:06.000 --> 10:06.000


10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
concrete, and I

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
am in actual relations

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
leaders, more

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
hopeless.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
You and I have

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
pre-created practice

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
in the government

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
of your act and

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
accession.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
You

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
know that I have

10:17.000 --> 10:17.000


10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
human.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
The leadership in

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
it, effort must come

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
from the American

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
people.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
And so far, the

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
American people

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
have not spoken out

10:25.000 --> 10:25.000


10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
of the

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
war.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I am

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
curious, you

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
said it much

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
on the

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
terms of

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
the war.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yes, Charlie.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
After all, all along,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
there's some

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
evidence that this might

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
provoke the world into

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
another war.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
I have been doing my

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
utmost to warn the

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
nations of the other

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
necessity of

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
uniting the other

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
species.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
My time still

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
remains.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Every

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
thinking person

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
has been going

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
along for five

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
years with

10:57.000 --> 10:57.000


10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Neil fallen

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
in politics.

10:59.000 --> 10:59.000


10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
narrative following one

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
policy and great

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Britain following

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
another.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
We are

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
weakening our nation

11:05.000 --> 11:05.000


11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
defense strengthen

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
all the species.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
And we could have

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
used that time better to

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
unify the entire

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
free world

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
against the coming

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
minutes.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
The

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
hierosality

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
and the

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
resolution have been

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
passed.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
The

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
mission has been

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
granted.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
You think

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
the criminal is

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
not an

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
individual.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I have no

11:26.000 --> 11:26.000


11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
knowing.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
But every

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
lesson of history and every

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
reasonable assumption we

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
can draw from the fact.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
It leads me

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
to the conclusion that

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Russia would have

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
done nothing to the most

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
such an

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
effort it has been

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
in practice.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Any

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
aggressive movement by the

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
country will cause

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
people outside of the

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
iron

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
territory to get

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
together.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
No

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
literally

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
economically

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
and

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
there are

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
not all these

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
elements

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
elements that

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
are

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
part of the world.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Do you think

11:56.000 --> 11:56.000


11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
community that

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
needs to be

11:59.000 --> 11:59.000


11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
house is

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
most

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
favourable for

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
consideration.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Well frankly, I

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
don't know

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Charlie, but I was

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
certain

12:07.000 --> 12:07.000


12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
full soul.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
At least

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
maybe those who have

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
come to make the

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
history of the

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
European

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
methods in the

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
future.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
If

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
you look around for

12:17.000 --> 12:17.000


12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
and

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
has

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
plenty of

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
countries

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
that are

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
in the

12:24.000 --> 12:24.000


12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
have the

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
country.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Since that time,

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
any time

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
the

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
country has been

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
satisfied.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
It is always

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
worth.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
On the other

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
hand, anytime

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Europeans

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
have come to make

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
cities,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
alliances,

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
so on, as

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
kind of

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
side as always

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
clear.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
But we need now

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
its courage to

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
fly the American

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
idea of

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
federations

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
before we can

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
and it's global

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
world.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
We can't

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
even get

12:53.000 --> 12:53.000


12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
bad by

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
the

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
sun.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
So we can't

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
expect

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
that

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
everyone during the

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
reign of our

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
laws.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Then, throughout

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
this

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
movement, it is

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
fed

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
our laws.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
That's part of the

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
world that is

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
free and

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
much

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
cheap and

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
sweet and

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
more expensive

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
and

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
much

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
expensive.

13:26.000 --> 13:26.000


13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
a

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
lot of

13:29.000 --> 13:29.000


13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
that are

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
very expensive.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
We have

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
a lot of

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
things that

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
are

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
very expensive.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
We Stack

13:37.000 --> 13:37.000


13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Times

13:39.000 --> 13:39.000


13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Times.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
We

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
have

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
a lot of things

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
that are

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
very expensive.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
We

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
have
