00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Regardless of a presidential to rupture or otherwise, and compels the testify with respect to the action in reviewing as administrative officer what was done by an interior vote.

00:14.000 --> 00:29.000
Do you have an opinion on that Mr. Gone? Yes, sir. Would you recite your opinion to the committee? My opinion, sir, is that the entire set up in the National Interest with the required, that they be summoned and required to answer.

00:29.000 --> 00:46.000
I have to answer questions along these lines, and that they are role-be-teams, that administrative officer, and not that of a judge operating under a rule of law which do not exist for loyal people.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
I think that is the chairman of that. That is all for the moment. That is just a welcome.

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
Before the next question is asked by the senators, and while we have the opportunity to vote. Mr. Cone, I would like to revert to our second.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Truthful.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Interrogation? What second?

01:06.000 --> 01:16.000
To go back to the question that we have passed over, and you were correct, it should have committee and I will just repeat it for the record.

01:16.000 --> 01:29.000
On meat suppress. On March 14, 1954, you answered a question of Mr. Bell by six.

01:29.000 --> 01:52.000
The only great struggle we had with the Army about time when he was down at Fort Dick was pursuant to our arrangements that after his training was over, at the end of the day and over weekend, when he was doing no training, he would instead of recreational activities to vote himself to committee work.

01:52.000 --> 02:03.000
The only purpose of any communication we had with the Army while he was at Fort Dick in the post is that statement of yours through or fall.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
So that's the only word I might want to change as well to ask the discussions about the foot, six matter.

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
The only discussions we had about his training down at Fort Dick's was in connection with finishing up the subcommittee work.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Well, but is not as I read it directly from the transcript.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
You mean on my meat, what I said? Yes, I mean as I read it.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Yes, with the amendment I suggest it's money, it's exactly correct.

02:29.000 --> 02:42.000
You do want to amend instead of while I have it here, the voting itself to committee work, and that was the only purpose of any communication we had with the Army.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Now, when he won't change the wire, say while he was at to about.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I think I could do it.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
While he was about Fort Dick? No, sir.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Now, when he was at and put in about.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
So, the busy, where you had with the Army of Bob Fort Dick?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Yes, sir.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, what's wrong with while he was at Fort Dick?

03:03.000 --> 03:14.000
Well, because there was discussion, probably during that period of time about his assignment after basic training.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
And having the next discussion would make what I said here inaccurate too.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
So, you're modifying the answers to Mr. Bell as you have indicated.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Namely, you strike out while he was at and insert about.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I think that was good.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
That statement then would be true as modified.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yes, sir.

03:40.000 --> 03:49.000
And so your answer as to the statement that is modified by you is that the statement is true.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yes, sir.

03:57.000 --> 04:06.000
Namely, for the last call around, I put to you the question and I stated again that I don't believe we quite finish it.

04:06.000 --> 04:16.000
It is the statement that you made on the press on March 14th and answered to Jack Bell that you never used by super-tid language in your dealing with the Army officials.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Is that true or false?

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
In my opinion, Senator, the statement that I use by super-tid-ever has seen my images for.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
As I've explained, as many times I can, I think the language I use is the same as anybody else uses it.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
I might be an occasional word which I would not want to repeat on television.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Some of all words then would be my super-tid, wasn't it?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
It's awfully hard to say.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
What to me might not be by super-tid, so a very sensitive call might be by super-tid.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
What to me might be by super-tid to somebody else who uses more of the person I do might be?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, it might be by super-tid.

04:54.000 --> 05:05.000
Why does the behavior of the recipient of the language would you say that the behavior would indicate actions and agreement in the language?

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
Or would you say that the behavior indicated a rather aroused reaction of a statement?

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Although I would say that Mr. Adams never seemed overly shocked at any kind of circumstances.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, I'll box the language used in the presence of Colonel Foulou and others.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Did he appear to be as real-born to it?

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
You mean about the incident at Fort Monmouth?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
The now famous incident.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
You mean about the left-community fin and the key bus?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
That's right.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
And my dear access to...

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I had access by pretty quick, your favorite CFP icon.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Well, that now states there might be a difference.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
I would not regard any of that as by super-tid or obscene language.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Would you say that it was strong and rather inflated language?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Well, let me.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Maybe a lot of what I've said is inflated, sir.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
I know that might be strong, but I don't regard it as by super-tid.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Well, obscene.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
You described it as sort of animated...

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Sure.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
...conversations.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Fine.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
No obscene language should I use?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Well, sure.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I don't know if anything is intensified to it in this room, which I would call out to you, right?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
No.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I thought some of it you didn't want on television.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Did I set up a month at that station?

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, I mean, in court of all these transactions, I had understood this from your previous testimony,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and some of you wouldn't want to be seen on television.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I think that's right.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
I think that's right.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
What I got at heart was that falling.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I might be over-cortured, then, it's there, but I...

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I would want to use that.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm telling you.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Next question, Mr. Cohn.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
In Mr. Adam's testimony, on May 12th, at 826-06, he has a record.

06:49.000 --> 06:58.000
He stated that you, Mr. Cohn, said that when you heard that David Stein was liable to be sent overseas,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
and I told,

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Steven is blue as Secretary of the Army and the force.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Did you or did you not make that statement?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
No, sir.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm sure I did not make that statement.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
Is Mr. Adam testimony under oath that you did make that statement true or is it false?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Mr. Adam is mistaken, sir.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Now, what I mean is that the sentence down, I mean, that's why we're here.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm trying to pinpoint these different conventions.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Is Mr. Adam testimony what he made under oath that you didn't make that statement?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Is that statement true or is it false?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Mr. Adam is mistaken, sir.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
You said when you used the word false, the connection with the Secretary's statute,

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
you're injecting elements of willfulness in ten, and things along those lines from a legal standpoint in which I can't pay it.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Well, I'm not asking you a question to give his state of mind.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
That would be for a jury.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yes, it is a side in the court.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
So, all that we're trying to get here is the testimony.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
And as you know, this testimony goes out for him as the owner's lawyer.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
We have no responsibility to determine whether any statement is made.

08:07.000 --> 08:16.000
For three medicated with intent or the dime to willfully tell the folks that's not our responsibility, yes sir.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
Now, Mr. Adam testimony under oath that you did make that statement is a true or false.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
I will say, sir, I did not make this statement that your Adam is mistaken if he said I did.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
So, what you're saying, man, is that you don't not want to say that it's true or do you want to say that it's false?

08:35.000 --> 08:43.000
Sir, I'm saying that when I am being put in a position of testing judgment on another human being's state of mind and worse in conduct,

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
that I can build it, tell you what happened and what my memory is.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
The last call I am.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
And tell you, sir, that I believe the administration that that was not said.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
And I believe that that's a perfectly proper and appropriate answer to me to make.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, it's kind of hard for us that every time we get some flitching testimony with the court,

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
we're going to find the witness when they're up against the statement made by the other side.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
I put these questions to the other principles and they answered a lot of them through or false.

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
Now, it means that if the opposite party to those interpretations are going to say, well, I won't say it's true.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I won't say it's false. I'll say that he was mistaken.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
So, at least there's nowhere and there's no direct answer.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't want the lawyer, that is exactly the situation.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
No, sir. I think you asked me on that point, possibly from people on the other side,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
for a little bit of a careless, with some of those answers.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
That's their responsibility. And if they have anyone to get some.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
And I will not take the responsibility, no matter what my feelings about Mr. Adams or anyone else might be,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
of being careless and testimony I give here.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
I will tell you, sir, Mr. Adams is mistaken. That was not said.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Whether it's testimony is false and willfully false,

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
there's something which this committee will have to judge and will have to be judged elsewhere.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Well, I gave you some previous questions and you answered them through or false.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Why did this thing, sir?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I don't believe you had me saying the word full.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
I can tell you what happened. I can tell you, it's Mr. Adams or Mr. Steven,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
might be mistaken about something.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
And I think you have a sure if I might respectfully suggest they very explain answer here.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
But my testimony is I did not say it.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I cannot be more direct than that.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Well, I think the explain answer would be whether it is true or false.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
And that's a matter for the record.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Mr. Adams went on to say, under oath,

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
had you also stated at that time when you heard that David Shine was liable to be sent overseas,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
that and I told,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
will arrest the Army, end of the foe.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Did you or did you not make the safe note?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
He didn't make it.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, if Mr. Adams kept the money under oath,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
if you did make that statement true or false,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
if the Adam's testimony under oath that I made that statement is wrong,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
it is mistaken, sir, it did not happen.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Period.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Well, well, I'm sorry, Jackson, perhaps the trouble is it.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
I tried cases and courtrooms, I know that an answer such as that would be an improper one for a witness to give.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
You mean it's improper for a witness to say one or a statement made by another person?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
In their presence is true or false?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yes, sir, I think it would be up to you.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
What time?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
What time of a courtrooms would that take place?

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
Well, sir, I guess maybe in those, perhaps, humble classrooms in which I tried some cases.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
So a witness gives a statement of what happened and the jury decides whether the testimony,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
which testimony is true and which testimony is false.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
So a witness does not undertake to make that decision.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
A witness does not make the decision to jury judge, but the witness can say whether a certain statement is true or whether it's false.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Right, sir.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I think you know the witness and it's for the jury to decide.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
I am telling you as plainly as I can, sir, I did not make that statement.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
When you go further and ask me, the reason is to Adam's mind in life of the Prajiri Statute,

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
and tell you whether or not he is committing Prajiri and deliberately and willfully making a false statement.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
That's there is something which I don't believe I should be called upon to do here.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
Well, you know that I'm not asking you to decide and here is good lawyer, whether Mr. Adam committing Prajiri.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm merely asking from you the testimony it's for a jury to decide is committing Prajiri.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yes, sir.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
And you do not want to answer it one way or the other, two or four.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
I want to answer very definitely, sir, that I did not make the statement.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Well, then if you did not make the statement, the statement falls.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
To the north, there are two possibilities.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Or either there is a deliberate lie.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
Well, Mr. Adam is mistaken in error in what he told his committee.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
It is not for me to decide which might be the case there.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
You do not want to, in other words, I'll say anything you want me to, sir.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
No, you're the one that's answering these questions.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I'm not asking you to say anything but what is the truth?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
The truth, sir, I did not make the statement.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I did not make the statement, then it falls.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
That's if Mr. Adam testified under oath that he did make the statement, that statement must be false, isn't it?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
That might very well be your conclusion, sir, and I might very well agree with you.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
What other conclusion?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You might, you might well agree with me.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Yes, sir.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
You want a personal opinion from me, I would get that.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh, I wanted your testimony.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
My testimony is I did not make the statement.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, I think the number is a bit short, sir.

13:36.000 --> 13:43.000
Mr. Claw, you were quoted on March 14th, and I quote.

13:43.000 --> 13:52.000
Throughout the patterns was that we wanted and everybody wanted, and I wanted,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
but was coming to him, meaning, shot.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Nothing more, nothing less.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
And I did not believe that he or anybody else on the committee used any kind of pressure

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
to get the army to bring this to fall.

14:07.000 --> 14:17.000
Is this statement that you never use any kind of pressure on the army with reference to special treatment for a private David Shrine, who or fall?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I'm sorry.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
It is my answer.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
That's what I did not use.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Pressure in my opinion, sir, and the statement is true statement.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
My statement is your answer, then, is that it's the true statement.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
My answer is my statement is they true statement.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I read the countertops.

14:34.000 --> 14:49.000
Mr. Claw, I wish to invite your attention to the statement of Secretary of Army, Seabem, and on page 22 of his statement.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
It is it.

14:53.000 --> 15:01.000
And on the fine memorandum, I remember the 17th fall for May's public March 12th by 100 in the morning.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
States, there was that testimony in New York that I again suggest the committee to ask for the Canadian airport.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
This is not true.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Oh, no.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
You just have to find on the roll that this is true, that correct?

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
And then, reporting to the next page, Mr. Claw, and to the second paragraph, we say,

15:21.000 --> 15:33.000
it is a thing to be to me, that this serious charge that I pledge to the chairman of this committee to investigate the Navy and the Air Force was kept secret so long.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Why should it only come to life?

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
Four months later, on the day after the Army's finalized the war event became public.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Yes sir.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Now why was that so?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
That was so for the three of us.

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams were trying so very hard to find to get it to stop the investigation.

15:51.000 --> 15:58.000
There was this suggestion made that we give some attention to the Navy and the Air Force and leave the Army alone for a while.

15:58.000 --> 16:08.000
If you were to slide out with the mass-made public, sir, we have had other investigations that have been other instances in which people who were being investigated wanted us to stop and look elsewhere.

16:08.000 --> 16:26.000
The thing was not that unusual, and I might say, sir, I did not feel, and I assume Senator McCrossy did not feel, that we had a run for help and thought yelling publicly and had a congressional investigation because Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams wanted us to go someplace else without the thing.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
We have to call on us at the time.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
At the time, this statement was made by the secretary.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
Did you consider that to be made in a serious way and to do so?

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
Yes, I think he was serious. He wanted us to just move away from his apartment and fill in any of the efforts.

16:42.000 --> 16:56.000
Well, if you did take it seriously, don't you think that the putting major charge for our statement to be made by the secretary of the Army?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I have a strange thing to mention.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
We didn't say that it didn't shock you a little bit.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
It did not shock me particularly, sir.

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
I wonder if that takes some time to deal on a flight of Ludwig's media report on why?

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
It's a matter of time, and it doesn't matter if that's the case.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
It doesn't matter if that's the case, and it doesn't matter if that's the case.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
We have to have the only reason I have to decide if that's the case.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Showing you some television and make sure that I crack the corner of the room.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Tell them I can get a sign of the connection to the counter-hack.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Some of the rest of the security is washed out.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Okay, and the file.

17:37.000 --> 17:54.000
And the only person, the only person that knew about this job made by the secretary of the Army.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
That's a, it should grab through the airport from the Navy.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
So you're self and send them a car to the military car?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
No sir.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
There were others.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Did any other members of the committee have this information?

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
I don't know that.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
Did you, for your plan, did you bring it to the attention of other members of the committee?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It was not my plan for nothing.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I did not.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Did you think this was information that the committee should have?

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, sir, I'm sure that the chairman of the committee would have given it to his colleagues.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
It was not on my level to go to the members of the committee and give them that information.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Well, that is not the case.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
At least I reported this conversation to the member of the committee.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
I know I reported the account of the administration of the government from my apartment.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
And I, I think I reported the other conversation.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
And let my members, in a statement, I believe the first I heard about it was the meeting near office at the time that they were supposed to come off.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
Now I'm, at the center as any battered to the conch, or I'd be glad to have it, but that's why I'm disappointed.

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
I wouldn't argue with the senator when I passed and I had a feeling that information at the time or at the port of the conversation of the senator Adams and my partner.

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
But if, if your memory is to the country, well, I'll try to find my area.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
The more that the point I'm trying to establish is that if that's the time of the meeting of the nation,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
if you considered a serious patient, you said it to him.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I would, I would do my part.

19:35.000 --> 19:46.000
I think it's a, it's a probable point to have a secretary, one branch of the government, trying to undermine the,

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
the armed, the air force and maybe his, his calling service.

19:52.000 --> 20:04.000
And the only thing that has at its point, me, as one member of the committee, that if you didn't consider that a secretary has been in the serious state,

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
that it is bringing to the, it wasn't boss of the pension of the commission.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I don't think it was my application. There's those.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't know.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Any time.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
I'm sorry, my one member of the committee would agree to you.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
But all of you, my man, I would say, this chairman, I have to leave the street story, but I will still have time.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
The senator wants to take a lot of time.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
And therefore I'd be glad to deal with it for whatever it got.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
The senator just as you said, you're expecting a ten minute, he said, I'm expecting his now and there's after it. That's all that.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
We have to help him.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
That would be satisfaction to me, that's all I was glad to know for the yield and I can leave the senator's in his first case.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
I have to send his voice, I can temper him and ask him to be next to him.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I recognize the senator's voice.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I have to hand it over to him.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
I have to hand it over to him.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
And the senator's in the second case, he can be there after.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
I have to send her if he could do it in five minutes. I appreciate it.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I think I can do it in two minutes.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I am very well.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
And then I will be glad to yield back to the senator, the other time, to the day.

21:04.000 --> 21:18.000
Well, for the term, I left the room as I told it to, I was and I called Mr. President Dayton and asked him what's the position of the Pentagon Laws in regards to receiving this information.

21:18.000 --> 21:26.000
He said that they would be glad to accept the information.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
He indicated that they wanted the information.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
He said he had no objection at all.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
He was having an official report of President take down everything to the side of the frame.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
The material returned over to him.

21:40.000 --> 21:55.000
He said that the apparently from this understanding he said last night, he wasn't aware of the requirements that the name was not the public nor that they were official.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
He said that they were official report of President.

21:58.000 --> 22:06.000
And I'm willing to take Mr. Seaton's word for that. I think he's the right truthful individual.

22:06.000 --> 22:19.000
He talked to Mr. Driscoll with more news. Mr. Driscoll tells me that he said he was called back within a half an hour until her father and not say what his President had called back.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
Mr. Seaton indicated that the right was not here on this family of the Congress.

22:27.000 --> 22:34.000
There are some threats in the mind of the other I would be available and view of the hearing.

22:34.000 --> 22:47.000
At the present time, the position of the defense department, I think, can be said of roughly and I said I have not been taken to too many television sets to make sure that I'm properly quoting.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
I think their position is roughly this.

22:51.000 --> 23:13.000
Number one, they want some names of any individual with a subverse of record, a record of counted activity that was working in defense plan that they will move promptly using the machinery which they have available.

23:13.000 --> 23:34.000
There's a fact in only one question that may hold this up temporarily and I'm sure that we worked out Mr. Seaton pointed out that when I told him that we have this committee rule that we cannot make the name of any individual accused of wrongdoing public.

23:34.000 --> 23:48.000
Unless an until, he is allowed to appear in public and deny the accusation and gives his version of the story.

23:48.000 --> 24:17.000
When I pointed out Mr. Seaton that out of 130 people, even though their records in the case that they all have been active and communist work, the law of averages would indicate that certainly a few of them might be able to prove their innocence and that's why this committee has unanimously adopted a rule that the names of people not to be made public until they have a chance to appear personally in a public session.

24:17.000 --> 24:36.000
He tells it in theory he would certainly agree with that but there was some question, his mind as a father and not that might highly handle the defense department in proceeding to investigate, expose the people.

24:36.000 --> 25:03.000
I might say that Mr. Seaton and I had a completely friendly conversation. The only question is can they abide by our rule to keep all these names fixed at the same time perform their function of getting rid of these particular individuals.

25:03.000 --> 25:17.000
We agreed before I came back up here to do the trial and worked that out. Later this afternoon it was impossible. Mr. Seaton said he expected to call me back to the next 10 or 15 minutes.

25:17.000 --> 25:27.000
I say, do I understand that they still have a lot of problems now about receiving these 135 names?

25:27.000 --> 25:37.000
I think the only problem that I can do is that the matter of making a public is the person who is inviting me to come to the room.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
I told him I could not give them names. Why do they have to make a public?

25:42.000 --> 25:52.000
I don't know. I told him that we have the rules but I have a chairman who cannot make any names in public until they appear in the rules.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
The therefore I could not give them names unless they would treat themselves not to make a name public.

25:59.000 --> 26:11.000
He said there was some fuss about being able to follow that rule without paying their hands and I can see they have some problems on them.

26:11.000 --> 26:21.000
Senator why don't you suggest when they call back in 10 minutes that Mr. Seaton is certainly a very able newspaper man.

26:21.000 --> 26:30.000
What I know of the best is very capable public information man might not be wise to suggest to him.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
I know you want to be fair. Thank you.

26:34.000 --> 26:47.000
I have to defend someone up here and explain when he has an opportunity to do it before millions of Americans citizens explain why all this delay in receiving 135 names.

26:47.000 --> 26:54.000
I don't know of a better opportunity for my I think when I stand in the Pentagon if there are a lot of people watching this.

26:54.000 --> 27:01.000
I think in turn is to first week when I should say that when he talked to my office at 10 30 this morning.

27:01.000 --> 27:11.000
Well my secretary and whom I got asked of Tom told me that she was assured that she would receive a return call with a half an hour.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
So she would know whether or not someone coming from the Pentagon received the information during the new hour.

27:17.000 --> 27:27.000
Mr. Seaton said that the record not his understanding of the conversation that he did not know when I would be free when I was available.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
And I am willing to accept that explanation.

27:31.000 --> 27:44.000
I just sincerely hope that my friends in the Pentagon can work out some stuff and whereby this information will be received by them and acted upon at the very earliest opportunity.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
Also, I think that the chairman is a little more than two minutes.

27:50.000 --> 28:04.000
We are very much determined that I have some fairly hope that within the next 24 hours this committee will need permission.

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
The chairman of the Permanence and Vets Committee will proceed to hold hearings in the evening and Saturday.

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
So we can put these individuals on the stand and bring out the facts.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
It's just too dangerous for situations to have existing I believe.

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
And it's shared by how much time and the Senate and the Constitution should be.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Will the Secretary hear while we'll find out the live?

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
I will be glad to have him.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I'll be back after the meeting.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
The Secretary will be here in a minute.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
The chairman is coming.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
The Secretary is coming.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
The Secretary of Parliament is coming from the House of the Legion.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
There are only three minutes left.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
If you will hold until he is through, I'd appreciate it.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
Before Senator Simington starts questioning, let's return to our studio to cross the street.

28:58.000 --> 29:06.000
I'd recommend that we have a formal implementation since the Secretary's seat and find out what this is all about.

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
Now, the next thing is that I'd like to ask the witness back on his charges.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
And the question of loyal leaders to me become a very important matter.

29:18.000 --> 29:28.000
I believe our greatest heritage is that we have a government of law and not a men.

29:28.000 --> 29:42.000
Mr. Cohn, I'd like to ask, understand you agree that the names of informants in your files, the committee files, or a top secret that you will not reveal.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Is that correct?

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
I don't believe that the names of informants should be revealed, sir.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
When you say, will not, it's a question of whether or not I would have paid direction to this committee and I would have paid any direction.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I would certainly have paid any direction which is carried to you.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Do you not believe they should be revealed?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
No, sir.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
You agreed that no power on Earth would get you to reveal the names of informants unless you would call the do so by the committee?

30:06.000 --> 30:14.000
I would certainly be in a sorry uncomfortable position, sir, if I were ordered by this committee.

30:14.000 --> 30:22.000
I can't believe the committee of a widow out of me to make public names of loyal people who have furnished information on Communists.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I didn't say make money.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I said reveal the names of the committee.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
Any person who are committee informants or I would reveal those names to the committee.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Yes, sir.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Do you plan a majority board of the committee?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yes, sir.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
If you had informants that you would reveal that name, you would have said a majority board of the committee and I should have asked you to do it.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Yes, sir. If I were committee informants.

30:42.000 --> 30:50.000
Suppose that one of the committee assistants in his own on his judgment decided that the name of informants has classified secret material.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
Should be said either to the attorney general or the one of the judges on this committee.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And he did so.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
But do you think he was justified in doing so, sir?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Yes, sir.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
I didn't get that.

31:02.000 --> 31:14.000
Suppose that one of the committee assistants against the wishes or instructions of the committee and his own on his judgment decided that the name of informants has classified secret material.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
Should be said either to the attorney general or the one of the judges on this committee.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
And this, sir, will you think he was justified in doing so?

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Can you say that very well?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Yes, sir.
