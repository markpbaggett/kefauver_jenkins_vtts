00:00.000 --> 00:07.880
In the interest of the perpetuity of a three-tucked area, that's all our

00:07.880 --> 00:11.360
defancy. Thank you for those treasin' on partisan remarks.

00:11.360 --> 00:28.560
Well, Mr. Charment, I just barely want to make this brief comment.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.480
Senator Jackson, before you start, can I make an insertion in the record?

00:33.480 --> 00:38.480
I would like to insert in the record if I may.

00:38.480 --> 00:46.480
Next up, from Public Law, 513-81, Congress, chapter 185, second session,

00:46.480 --> 00:52.480
provided section three, nothing in this act shall prohibit the furnishing upon lawful demand

00:52.480 --> 00:56.480
of information to any regularly constituted committee of the Senate, or House of Representatives

00:56.480 --> 01:02.480
of the United States of America, or joint committee thereof approved May 13, 19, 50, and

01:02.480 --> 01:06.480
one other insertion, if I may, insert this because of the question that I've been asked

01:06.480 --> 01:13.480
about our rights to get information. This title 18 United States Code Amidated Chapter

01:13.480 --> 01:20.480
37 has been urged as censorship section 798, disclosure of classified information.

01:20.480 --> 01:24.480
Nothing in this section shall prohibit the furnishing upon lawful demand of any

01:24.480 --> 01:28.480
information to any regularly constituted committee of the Senate or House of Representatives

01:28.480 --> 01:32.480
of the United States of America, or joint committee thereof.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.480
That of October 31, 19, 50, seems to be an extra jurisdiction in the record of the two

01:37.480 --> 01:40.480
statutory prohibited for the next questioning again, but it turned to our students

01:40.480 --> 01:42.480
and the property service number time ejection.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.480
Mr. Charment, now I think it's very regrettable that the last day of the hearings that we're

01:47.480 --> 01:53.480
getting into some partisan matters that have no place in these hearings, we on this side

01:53.480 --> 02:00.480
have not bought them up, and if you want to take a look at the record in these hearings,

02:00.480 --> 02:04.480
it's rather revealing.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.480
Not the Democrats who have been making the attack on the Eisenhower administration.

02:08.480 --> 02:12.480
I'll give you a chapter in verse. Give you the record.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.480
On page 4742, one of the principals here, not a Democrat.

02:18.480 --> 02:23.480
The charge that the CIA administered by the President of the Republican administration is

02:23.480 --> 02:25.480
infiltrated with Communists.

02:25.480 --> 02:30.480
The 135 Communists in defense plans you can find out on page 4814.

02:30.480 --> 02:37.480
On page 4815 of these hearings is further reference to the fact that it would do no good to turn

02:37.480 --> 02:44.480
over 135 Communists to Charles Wilson, the Republican who administers the defense department

02:44.480 --> 02:46.480
and former head of General Motors.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.480
And on page 4743 are they hearing?

02:49.480 --> 02:51.480
Charles, the dark comic bomb plan.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.480
Sorry, I'm so excited with coming.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.480
And we can go on down the hydrogen bomb plan.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.480
The fact on the Attorney General leaves the fact that nothing made by Democrats.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.480
What you mentioned was nothing when you were a criminal.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.480
I'm referring to the U.S. as something that I can directly declare.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.480
At all.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.480
Mr. Charment, there's a question I think in connection to the well.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.480
I think that's a fact.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.480
I just want to make sure that I have not made any effect on the President.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.480
I didn't declare that was a question or not.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.480
I consider the question to be German.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.480
No, I consider the question to be German.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.480
The point of point of point is that he heard what I was using.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.480
He used it to use it up on the point of personal privilege.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.480
If that's not a question.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.480
Turn on the phone to the right.

03:23.480 --> 03:30.480
Mr. Drakens can talk to him when I said and find some special meaning to that I have a right to comment on.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.480
If you have a point of personal privilege, if that's not all.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.480
Okay, but follow that, son.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.480
I have a point of personal privilege.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.480
It's a free CC.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.480
We do what to do with that.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.480
I want to ask one question.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.480
I have a point of personal privilege.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.480
I want to ask your question.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.480
You have a point of personal privilege, who's the time I turn to ask, who's the CC?

03:45.480 --> 03:48.480
It's why I give the year the time I go around, and I give about house.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.480
The one thing I want to part off, you have my personal privilege and I say,

03:52.480 --> 03:54.480
I want to send it to Mr. Drakens because I want to stake it in the name.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.480
I want to ask you no questions.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.480
My reason I point of personal privilege.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
Listen to your mistakes.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.480
Now ask it.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.480
I don't give away the answer to the German mistake.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.480
Money burns everything.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.480
I want to answer it after I raise the point of personal privilege.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.480
I ask you to say and be thinking about it.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.480
Okay, good.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.480
That is your say, but I advise that you think it's not for personal privilege.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.480
I think you want to correct the record I was advising him to announce that it will take

04:12.480 --> 04:13.480
you that he wouldn't justify.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.480
If you'll read you'll remember, I'm...

04:15.480 --> 04:16.480
Turn on your engine.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.480
Send him a copy.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.480
20 minutes of privilege.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.480
I want to reverse myself on that right hand to the customer first.

04:27.480 --> 04:31.480
I'm wondering, Macphal, I'm reading your monochrome calls.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
Okay.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.480
I'm going to give you express.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.480
Great surprise.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.480
That's the only say that I'm recorded but I'm never a social pride.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.480
You get off.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.480
But within that gang.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.480
Without anybody with you.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.480
We all at Stephen's did when he was with that gang was agreed to give us information.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.480
I can't see any other interpretation.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.480
You place the pun left.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.480
You want to testify.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.480
You...

04:54.480 --> 04:55.480
I'll testify.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.480
Not testify.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.480
Now where would you tell me these?

04:57.480 --> 04:59.480
If you did, if you did, that should be in the records center.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.480
If you did, that should be in the records center.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.480
Which which call?

05:03.480 --> 05:05.480
I don't know you have them all before you.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.480
I've got one of them in here just a minute.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.480
Well, I make the point how I let myself...

05:10.480 --> 05:13.480
You check and see if there's some place where the call on advice is...

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
That's it.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.480
Yeah.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.480
You got that from me.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.480
It should be in records.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.480
Mr. Director.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.480
You...

05:20.480 --> 05:22.480
In effect, maybe, the site was rather confusing.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.480
I don't know how I'd been frustrated.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.480
Being in social service.

05:26.480 --> 05:30.480
You and I know that we in here have this situation.

05:31.480 --> 05:36.480
And that every communist we dug out so far with one exception...

05:36.480 --> 05:40.480
Was brought in long before President Eisenhower took over.

05:40.480 --> 05:47.480
You know Senator Jackson, last year, but we're not for the Democrats on this committee.

05:47.480 --> 05:51.480
When it was not today, we had been looking for investigation.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.480
We've been investigating communists.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.480
I think it should be clear beyond words.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.480
I'm sure it is the public.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.480
That there is no one as unhappy.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.480
As my Democrat friends up here, when there is...

06:05.480 --> 06:09.480
The person possibility of ending the investigation.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.480
And Senator Jackson, I say that these monitored calls...

06:13.480 --> 06:16.480
And I often say I don't like this type of ease dropping.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.480
But here they have served the valuable purpose.

06:19.480 --> 06:26.480
They have shown that Senator signing was called by Steven only once.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.480
The aftermath of Senator signing can call Steven every time.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.480
Talked about the advice of my legal friend, meeting crackluckers.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.480
When signings on two days before the charge of her issues.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.480
The rest of the Steven's two days before the charge of her issues.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.480
Said there's really nothing to this.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.480
We find that two signings in the same. Don't put me in a box.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.480
I can call this thing off. We can block this.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.480
By block this.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.480
Senator signings can put a med only one thing.

06:55.480 --> 07:02.480
Namely block the exposure of those communists whom we inherited.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.480
From your administration, Senator Jackson.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.480
And now I hope you realize that also has done quite a thing.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.480
Senator, why is the decision struck, Mr. Wilson, the Secretary of Defense,

07:12.480 --> 07:16.480
so Mr. Steven, that you do not turn over the names of these communists in the defense?

07:16.480 --> 07:18.480
I do not disclose Mr. Wilson.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.480
The names have been offered. They have been offered.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.480
Under the conditions of this committee, get them.

07:24.480 --> 07:32.480
I call the meeting of this committee the other night to get permission to turn the names over under the conditions.

07:32.480 --> 07:38.480
Which the Secretary of Defense said he would want if there were to be turned over.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.480
I had that meeting over in Mark Trice's office.

07:42.480 --> 07:46.480
Not a single Democrat showed up.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.480
I had a meeting with the press after it.

07:48.480 --> 07:53.480
At that time, I think I was too generous. I said that I felt that you were just busy tied up.

07:53.480 --> 08:01.480
Since that I have learned the subject signing and the position that I could not call a meeting of my investigating committee.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.480
Because it was non-existent, file list committee was in effect.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.480
In any event, the Democrats did not show up.

08:07.480 --> 08:15.480
You were notified the meeting was for the purpose of getting your permission to turn the names over to Mr. Wilson.

08:15.480 --> 08:20.480
Without the application of the rules, which our committee applies,

08:20.480 --> 08:26.480
the name will be made public unless an until amount appears in executive sessions.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.480
I repeat, some good actions.

08:28.480 --> 08:32.480
When the Democrats were not there, we decided we should not do business with us.

08:32.480 --> 08:36.480
Noted to correct the records, I can say it's our second Macaronist concern.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.480
The meeting in Mark Trice's office, as the chair was leaving,

08:39.480 --> 08:42.480
he met Senator Macaron on the floor of the Senate.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.480
At which time he said he was heading to Mark Trice's office.

08:45.480 --> 08:49.480
Senator Macaron had every intention of attending the meeting that was detained on the floor.

08:49.480 --> 08:52.480
I would not have come to you.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.480
You never got there.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.480
I'm coming to you.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.480
I left the Senate floor and down on the subway,

08:58.480 --> 09:03.480
just as we left it, I met Senator Jackson, who had been over at the other office,

09:03.480 --> 09:06.480
where the meeting was originally scheduled for the five sub-s.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.480
And he said, where is the meeting?

09:08.480 --> 09:13.480
And I said, it has been abandoned because none of the Democrats came fairly enough.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.480
Some of them were at the other place.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.480
Senator Jackson said he was on his way over with the meeting.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
I used to have that right?

09:18.480 --> 09:19.480
Senator Jackson, that's correct.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.480
That's correct.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.480
Let's go, Mark.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.480
Let's get the records, Mark.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.480
Let's go.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.480
Mark, let's wait.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.480
You know that a rap off the package, you know, the proper denial of this fall's hood.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.480
I went to the meeting and there was nobody there, and he said everybody had left.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.480
I then went back and fall Senator Jackson, and he said he would come over.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.480
And by the time he got over, we went back and there was nobody there at all.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.480
I went to the meeting twice for your personal information.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.480
Let's get this records and make sure it's free.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.480
Before Republican was voted, Mark places office.

09:48.480 --> 09:54.480
Until after the Senate adjourned, the clerk of the Senate told me that he informed everyone

09:54.480 --> 10:00.480
of the senators that the meeting would be in Mark's office for the convenience of the senators.

10:00.480 --> 10:05.480
And I would have sent her a signings and a question when I get through here too, if I may have your attention.

10:05.480 --> 10:10.480
Then I came over to 357 for some of the staffs of the president.

10:11.480 --> 10:15.480
And I asked whether or not any of the senators had shown up there.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.480
I was informed they had not.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.480
Now I would like to ask you Senator Simonton.

10:20.480 --> 10:28.480
Did you or did you not make the statement that you would not come to the meeting because you felt that I had no authority to call the meeting?

10:28.480 --> 10:35.480
I said that I would do exactly what Senator McFellon thought was right.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.480
He was on the floor and we were discussing whether we would or would not go.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.480
As I remember, he then left the floor and I called Senator Jackson.

10:44.480 --> 10:49.480
At no time do I remember making a distinct statement that I would not go.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.480
Both my colleagues, I'm the junior member of this committee had gone.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.480
Believe me, I would have been there.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.480
There was discussion among us because you were trying to run an end run of the version.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.480
I say end run of the version of the 1,620.

11:01.480 --> 11:06.480
By trying to get us, by trying to get us, let me answer the question please.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.480
I wish you were.

11:07.480 --> 11:23.480
The idea was that you wanted to discuss whether or not you proceeded with any plans, whether you would be allowed to proceed by this committee with any plans in order to go ahead with the fence to plot an investigation.

11:24.480 --> 11:29.480
One of the establishments, one of the principles of the established when this committee started,

11:29.480 --> 11:33.480
was that we weren't going to have investigations until a hearing was over.

11:33.480 --> 11:39.480
And therefore it was decided as I remember it, that you should not have any further investigations.

11:39.480 --> 11:46.480
Not until now that I have the faintest idea that you intended to turn over any 133 names to the committee.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.480
And I'll answer you this way.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.480
I thought it was wrong to go to the meeting.

11:49.480 --> 11:54.480
I went to the meeting and everybody had gone, but I did not go to the door.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
Where did you go?

11:55.480 --> 11:59.480
I went right to the outside of the office and was told that nobody was there.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.480
I then went back and pulled up Senator Jackson.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.480
Now I think I've discussed this long enough.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.480
I'll say this.

12:05.480 --> 12:09.480
I'd like you to use it and tell me, or did anybody else tell me,

12:09.480 --> 12:13.480
in this divergence number, whatever it was, 1,027 or something,

12:13.480 --> 12:18.480
you didn't tell me at that time that you had the slightest intention of giving up any name.

12:18.480 --> 12:22.480
You said you wanted a hearing in order to start investigations on the side

12:22.480 --> 12:24.480
and to create a version from these hearings.

12:24.480 --> 12:28.480
You know, I'd like to say this as long as you've asked the question.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.480
You've grown up and the record will prove so many divergence.

12:32.480 --> 12:38.480
In spite of the fact that now you and your Republican colleagues are falling these hearings off without hearing what this is,

12:38.480 --> 12:40.480
you can help us get the truth.

12:40.480 --> 12:45.480
You've put in so many divergence that in a long time ago the hearing grew stop.

12:45.480 --> 12:50.480
A few of yourself had not deliberately filed a call to black on so many questions that came up

12:50.480 --> 12:54.480
and put us in the channels which had nothing to do with the original charges.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.480
I think you realize that better than anybody else.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.480
Do I understand, in some way, that the reason you did not come to the meeting was because

13:00.480 --> 13:05.480
you thought I was going to ask for permission to hold hearing to expose coming to some intelligence?

13:05.480 --> 13:08.480
I told you that I discussed with my colleagues going to the meeting.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.480
Would you just find out I would have been glad to go to the meeting?

13:10.480 --> 13:13.480
There was a discussion among us whether you, and as I remember,

13:13.480 --> 13:17.480
you thought the matter up now and it comes back to me as I thought.

13:17.480 --> 13:21.480
So a considerable discussion among the Democrats would have ever took committees.

13:21.480 --> 13:26.480
And it is much of you very graciously offered to leave this committee as chairman,

13:26.480 --> 13:28.480
while he's hairy to discuss what you've done to the Army,

13:28.480 --> 13:33.480
who was being conducted, who wanted whether you had the right to have a meeting

13:33.480 --> 13:36.480
of the committee because you had resigned as chairman.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.480
And I believe Senator McCollum will verify that that was discussed with the Republican leaders.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.480
So, to call him, can I have a witness attention?

13:43.480 --> 13:47.480
And I think that was the discussion.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.480
Chair believes in the meeting.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.480
I think if we just get this meeting pretty well,

13:52.480 --> 13:54.480
I told you about this.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.480
I told him about the undercover, Senator McCollum.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.480
Mr. Chairman, I was honoured.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.480
Miss Anderson was sending number one about the place of the meeting.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.480
I didn't know there was any misunderstanding about the purpose of it,

14:04.480 --> 14:07.480
so that's the meeting was called.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.480
And we did discuss the possibility of changing the rules

14:10.480 --> 14:13.480
as far as turning over the 130 names of concerns.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.480
That there was no Democratic representation there,

14:16.480 --> 14:20.480
and I'm prepared to believe it's because of an honest misunderstanding about place of concern.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.480
Mr. Welfz.

14:22.480 --> 14:27.480
Could I remind the committee that I came, Mr. St. Claire,

14:27.480 --> 14:31.480
and I came this morning hoping we might ask an occasional question?

14:31.480 --> 14:33.480
Yes.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.480
You're going to get to you very shortly.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.480
Mr. Dickson, I have my own head.

14:37.480 --> 14:40.480
Mr. Chairman, I have not finished my statement.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.480
We still entertain that hope.

14:43.480 --> 14:50.480
But I would like to say to you for myself that I'm almost numb with what I have heard.

14:50.480 --> 14:55.480
It is so far removed from what we're trying to try here.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.480
And I beg of you, sir.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.480
Can we not tell you the questions that we would like to ask?

15:02.480 --> 15:06.480
And then if somebody wants to practice politics for two weeks in this room,

15:06.480 --> 15:08.480
then go right with them.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.480
Mr. Chairman.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.480
Mr. Chairman.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.480
I have eight points.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.480
Thank you.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.480
May I have my friends and friends?

15:15.480 --> 15:16.480
No, I have two minutes.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.480
I'm just going to make your statement.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.480
Very straight.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.480
I'll do it.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.480
And I take the point of personal privilege.

15:21.480 --> 15:26.480
I think Mr. Simings and his demonstrators here have been informed of great service in the last ten minutes.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.480
He's unscredited to the Great American jury.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.480
How on set is he as a judge on this dramatic?

15:34.480 --> 15:38.480
He has told us now that he did discuss further now.

15:38.480 --> 15:43.480
They should come to a meeting because he was afraid of an end run, the end run.

15:43.480 --> 15:49.480
As he now testifies what I was going to start to expose communists in defense plan.

15:49.480 --> 15:53.480
I had made that public statement.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.480
I said I want to do that in the evening on Saturdays.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.480
And we find out that he thought that was so serious.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.480
We discussed that in these Democrats' friends.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.480
Now what their decision was, I don't know, but I know they didn't come to the meeting.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.480
We stayed in the meeting, my Republican.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.480
I didn't interrupt you.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.480
I'm a very proper thing to discuss whether you can have two committees.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.480
Let's look at one chair.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.480
Don't you think it is?

16:16.480 --> 16:18.480
Give me the courtesy.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.480
I gave you a big glad.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.480
I don't want to get too.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
I'm going to have to let you out.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.480
I think you deserve it.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.480
Here we go.

16:23.480 --> 16:29.980
Now as I started to save President Ruff, my Republican friends and I stayed in Mark's

16:29.980 --> 16:35.480
office until I considered a period of time after the Senate had reached that.

16:35.480 --> 16:39.480
They clerk told you, you have admitted now you knew the meeting was being held.

16:39.480 --> 16:49.480
You have now in effect told us the reason you didn't come was because you were afraid I was going to ask for permission to hold hearings for exposed communists.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.480
I may say that I have sex.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.480
If we don't interrupt, I have sex.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.480
I have sex in that.

16:55.480 --> 16:59.480
I can sex with three, five, seven, maybe my Democrat friends might have come here.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.480
I find they did not.

17:01.480 --> 17:07.480
And Mr. Simon, the thing that bothers me now is how much disruption.

17:07.480 --> 17:13.480
How much you would find a total block to deny any exposure of communists in the future.

17:13.480 --> 17:18.480
Mr. Clifford, you, you and so have the IL have been very successful.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.480
Now you have said over and over just as a final remark, Senator.

17:22.480 --> 17:28.480
You said over and over that you don't want the hearing ended until we get after each truth.

17:28.480 --> 17:33.480
Now I don't believe that our American jury is too much impressed.

17:33.480 --> 17:46.480
When they flee, Senator Simon, considering there, refusing, refusing to take the oath as I have done, as my Republican colleagues have done, as Mr. Cymus or Cone has done,

17:46.480 --> 17:48.480
to take the oath and tell us.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.480
It's a very simple thing.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.480
It shouldn't take you any more than half an hour.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
Tell us what happens.

17:54.480 --> 18:01.480
How come you've got the demified advisor to under-truck the Republican Secretary of the Army?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.480
You just want steps you took.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
Now, it shouldn't take you long to do that.

18:05.480 --> 18:10.480
And for your own good son of a curfew, if I may advise you, although you've not asked for the advice,

18:10.480 --> 18:13.480
you just better take this then before we close these hearings.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.480
Senator, I have a letter here in the family.

18:15.480 --> 18:20.480
If you will sign this letter and I will read it to you again, to be sure.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.480
I think it's just too long to read.

18:22.480 --> 18:29.480
But any time that you would like to sign this letter, we'll go over and see the Vice President set this committee up.

18:29.480 --> 18:34.480
And you and I, and then you testify before a committee was expected to charge against you.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.480
And I will testify before a committee was expected to be out of the gates against you.

18:38.480 --> 18:44.480
But now that the chairman, I've made this a statement several times, and I knew that we go on with the hearings.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.480
I accept your advice. We'll continue to be here.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.480
I'm here to accept your offer.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.480
Now, you've made an offer, I intend to accept this.

18:50.480 --> 18:54.480
You have asked that I sign a letter, which can contain the false statements.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.480
I will not sign that, but Mr. Recymington.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.480
I will sign any kind of a document.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.480
I'll bring you go before any committee.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.480
The Senate decides to set up.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.480
Answer any questions.

19:08.480 --> 19:17.480
About my background from the time I was born, up until the 16th day of June 1954, I will do that.

19:17.480 --> 19:26.480
I will do that not because I think a senator is required to, but I will do it in order to get you understand and try and get the truth you talk about, senator.

19:26.480 --> 19:31.480
So if you want to, if you want to do that, you can take the stand. I'll set down right now.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.480
I know that I will not sign the letter with the false statements.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.480
Very simple.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.480
In the right, Mr.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.480
I'm the doing sign and I'll just don't pull that at the time.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.480
Don't pull that only thing on the letter.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.480
I'm a little better.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.480
It is, senator.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.480
Got my signature on it.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.480
You have a document with false statements in it.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.480
I will not sign that, but that's true.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.480
I don't...

19:52.480 --> 19:53.480
You are not pulling anyone out.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.480
You're not pulling anyone with the sign.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.480
You're not pulling anyone.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.480
I have offered to go before any committee.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.480
Do anything you ask.

20:01.480 --> 20:06.480
If I can just get you to come down here and take the oath so we can get the answers to some questions.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.480
You're not pulling anyone at all.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.480
They're sure of that.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.480
Let me tell you something.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.480
Be careful, you just...

20:12.480 --> 20:15.480
We are not a people amount of looking to you for six weeks.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.480
You're not pulling anyone either.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.480
Turn the platter.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.480
Turn the light on.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.480
I'm just going to take it now.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.480
Mr. Chairman, do I have my time, my time?

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
My time?

20:24.480 --> 20:30.480
First, I would like to associate myself with a statement made by Mr. Welk.

20:31.480 --> 20:39.480
He spent the last half and a personality like his and partisan politics.

20:39.480 --> 20:47.480
Now, we spent the 36th day of this period.

20:47.480 --> 20:56.480
And if we as senators can't conduct a hearing, the vital parties that have been made.

20:56.480 --> 21:02.480
And do it with dignity and do it with partisan and personality questions.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.480
Oh, that should be the case.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.480
All right.

21:07.480 --> 21:13.480
We've got a lot of business to attend.

21:13.480 --> 21:24.480
The President has gone on the air to have the people to support him in his legislative program.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.480
I'm a member of nine committees.

21:26.480 --> 21:31.480
And I think I'm a member of every kind of worship committee in the past.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.480
And the chairman of the committee that's now holding here.

21:34.480 --> 21:41.480
And hearing, I've been held the President's hand without any means.

21:41.480 --> 21:48.480
So if we're going to fill our promise to the American people.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.480
I'm putting through the program and it's a good program.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.480
That the President has an unseated.

21:55.480 --> 22:05.480
I say we must then should stop the personality questions that take place in the Syrian room.

22:05.480 --> 22:15.480
We should rise up a partisanship and endeavor to seek out the facts about the chip flow where they're made.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.480
Now, that's the 36th day of this year.

22:18.480 --> 22:28.480
As the day go on, the work of the Senate becomes more and more acute.

22:28.480 --> 22:33.480
You've talked about other witnesses being called.

22:33.480 --> 22:37.480
I would thank you to get by a check in the transcript.

22:37.480 --> 22:42.480
The release half will cost me two thirds of the time it's been taken up.

22:42.480 --> 22:47.480
And matter that has nothing to do with a present conversation.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.480
This morning has been a good exam.

22:50.480 --> 22:57.480
Now, I consider hope that we can at least continue for today.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.480
We remove our partisan conflict in the Syrian.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.480
We remove our personality questions from the Syrian.

23:04.480 --> 23:11.480
And allow Mr. Welk to Mr. Sinfar to continue to conclude.

23:11.480 --> 23:16.480
There's an examination for the work.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.480
Can I have a minute?

23:18.480 --> 23:24.480
Channel and I was in Europe at the time of the so-called chicken lunch.

23:24.480 --> 23:30.480
And I have here some papers that I had not seen before that were brought to me.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.480
The headline is, steaming mad.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.480
Steven seeks a showdown with Icon.

23:35.480 --> 23:40.480
What he has to be sacrificed for the sake of future politics.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.480
The neme article on his paper reads,

23:42.480 --> 23:46.480
Army Secretary Robert Steven sought a showdown with President Eisenhower today.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.480
And whether he is to be sacrificed to send a Joseph Armacardi,

23:50.480 --> 23:53.480
quote, for the sake of future politics, quote,

23:53.480 --> 23:58.480
a high administration source revealed that Mr. Steven feels the White House has failed to give an adequate backing

23:58.480 --> 24:01.480
and is fused with a Wisconsin Republican.

24:01.480 --> 24:06.480
The said that there's not one to resign, the source said, but he has determined that the Secretary, I beg your pardon.

24:06.480 --> 24:14.480
I have to find out how far the administration will go to support his stand against Senator McCarthy's unwired abuse in folks of Army officers.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.480
But I can read on in this.

24:16.480 --> 24:23.480
I might say that it's coming from a newspaper which I think we'll agree has no communist leading.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.480
The meeting for the strip tower chain.

24:26.480 --> 24:39.480
Now here is Mr. Steven statement that he gave following, yes, into following statement on.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.480
February the 26th, I believe it is.

24:42.480 --> 24:48.480
Yesterday, when the explosion of the luncheon meeting between the Republican members of the Senate,

24:48.480 --> 24:55.480
permanent subcommittee on investigation and myself, a memorandum of understanding was issued to the press.

24:55.480 --> 25:02.480
Because the purpose and meaning of that memorandum have been misinterpreted, I wish at this time to make certain things clear.

25:02.480 --> 25:10.480
I did not at that meeting and have not receded at any time for many of the principles upon which I stand.

25:10.480 --> 25:15.480
As a civilian head of a body of the most loyal, able, and efficient men and women that I know,

25:15.480 --> 25:22.480
I have certain obligations to Army Commission enlisted and civilian personnel.

25:22.480 --> 25:30.480
These duties include the upholding of their rights in circumstances where they are unable to protect those rights.

25:30.480 --> 25:37.480
I shall never exceed to the abuse of Army personnel under any circumstances, including committee hearing.

25:37.480 --> 25:42.480
I shall never exceed to them being ground beaten or humiliated.

25:43.480 --> 25:59.480
I do not intend to allow them to be deprived of the long established practice that they have the advice of counsel when the matter under consideration is one of a central interest to me as Secretary, as was the case with General's Wicker.

25:59.480 --> 26:11.480
From assurances which I have received from members of the subcommittee, I am confident, and I might add at that point, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. Steven saw five members of the subcommittee on the day in question.

26:12.480 --> 26:19.480
I also try to get hold of Mr. Rogers. I could not, I left for you, truly you are the next day.

26:19.480 --> 26:30.480
I repeat, Mr. Steven statement, from assurances which I have received from members of the subcommittee, I am confident that they will not permit such conditions to develop in the future.

26:30.480 --> 26:38.480
In the light of those assurances, although I did not propose a cancellation of the hearings, I exceeded so it.

26:38.480 --> 26:44.480
If it had not been for those assurances, I would never have entered into any agreement whatsoever.

26:44.480 --> 26:59.480
I want to make it perfectly clear that soon should such abuses occur in any quota in the future, I shall once again take all steps and my disposal to protect the rights of individuals in this department.

26:59.480 --> 27:15.480
Now, Mr. Chairman, I do not believe that based on the testimony of the Secretary of the Army and the news stories that is fair to say that the Democrats are the ones who are responsible for this crap between the executive branch of the government and the legislative branch of the government.

27:15.480 --> 27:24.480
I would like to just say one more word if I may. Senator McCarthy, I did not intend to bring this up, but I think I will now.

27:25.480 --> 27:39.480
You have in your remarks, constantly inferred or implied, that the Democratic members of this committee were for some reason blocking communism.

27:39.480 --> 27:45.480
Let me ask you, what could I get out of blocking communism? A country that has been wonderful to me.

27:46.480 --> 27:57.480
I have only two sons. One slut through the mud of Europe, with General Bradley, and ended up in a Pacific, rose to the rank of corporal.

27:57.480 --> 28:06.480
He's barely started his life, the only start in business last year. The other was a Marine, a younger, and he hasn't yet been able to start his business career.

28:07.480 --> 28:16.480
What would it be for me? What would it be for me to have anything to do with communism? What would it be for a great senator? And he is a great senator.

28:16.480 --> 28:31.480
We all know it was just on my right. I've had my troubles as true, but he has done more far more than you and I ever did. He left his oldest son, God bless him in North Africa forever.

28:31.480 --> 28:38.480
What have we got? What is the margin of two total communists?

28:38.480 --> 28:41.480
I don't think so.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.480
We've got a person right here.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.480
We've got a person who is not.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.480
No, it's no question. It's just an observation.

28:50.480 --> 29:12.480
The senator McCarthy, my first question to you can be answered yes or no. Do you think you can pull your mind back to the facts of this case and discuss them with me for a moment or for ten minutes?

29:13.480 --> 29:15.480
My mind is on the fence.

29:15.480 --> 29:20.480
The first thing I want to deal with you is what about is this.

29:20.480 --> 29:29.480
I gathered from your testimony that you didn't know Dave Stein until Mr. Cohn brought him to the committee.

29:29.480 --> 29:35.480
That's right, right? And I take it you did not know his parents until that time or later.

29:35.480 --> 29:41.480
I do gather from the evidence that sometimes you did come to know Dave's parents.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.480
Right, their names are watched.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.480
Mr. Mrs. Stein.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.480
Yes, their first name.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.480
Myer is a father and the mother's name is...

29:50.480 --> 29:53.480
First, not to him, or just a father's name.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.480
The mother's name is Kyliger.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.480
And they live where?

29:57.480 --> 30:00.480
They live in...

30:00.480 --> 30:03.480
...where's their criminal police?

30:03.480 --> 30:05.480
Whoever's in New York.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.480
And they have a summer place up there?

30:08.480 --> 30:10.480
I think those are permanent pool, I don't know.

30:10.480 --> 30:14.480
They have a summer place on the lake or is that pool on the lake?

30:14.480 --> 30:17.480
It's not on the lake, it's fairly close to lake.

30:17.480 --> 30:22.480
And they have an apartment or at some time did have an apartment in New York, is that right?

30:22.480 --> 30:25.480
The last time I met them, they still had an apartment in New York.

30:25.480 --> 30:28.480
And you have occasionally been there guests in their homes?

30:28.480 --> 30:29.480
Yes, I do.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.480
When would you say it was the first time you went to gasp?

30:31.480 --> 30:35.480
The mystery is a Stein, a father and mother of Dave Stein.

30:35.480 --> 30:40.480
I couldn't give you the date.

30:40.480 --> 30:43.480
I know there's one of the other centers on the committee.

30:43.480 --> 30:46.480
I just didn't know you had any of these names.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.480
I don't know.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.480
One of the other centers of the committee and I were in New York.

30:49.480 --> 30:54.480
We had trouble getting a room with the World War.

30:55.480 --> 31:00.480
Mr. Torre and Mr. Shion said they shine apartments in this vacant house.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.480
I think that's the first time I wasn't there.

31:02.480 --> 31:06.480
And approximately what was that there?

31:06.480 --> 31:09.480
I think...

31:09.480 --> 31:10.480
Oh, let's see.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.480
What hearing was that?

31:12.480 --> 31:15.480
Voice of America.

31:15.480 --> 31:19.480
It was in the voice of America hearing, I think that would be February or March.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.480
Yes.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.480
And what next for you there, guests?

31:23.480 --> 31:25.480
I couldn't give you any dates.

31:25.480 --> 31:29.480
I've been in there apart from I think because...

31:29.480 --> 31:32.480
One is just a guest three or four times.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.480
Something like that.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.480
Agedally overnight?

31:34.480 --> 31:36.480
Yes, we've been.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.480
Agedally at dinner?

31:37.480 --> 31:40.480
I think I had dinner once with them.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.480
Was that the dinner parties there?

31:42.480 --> 31:45.480
There were other people at the dinner.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.480
And where you at one time there?

31:47.480 --> 31:48.480
Yes.

31:49.480 --> 31:55.480
What the press reported as the West Coral Lake Hand, Mr. Mr. Shion?

32:03.480 --> 32:06.480
Oh, you're the friend of their home in Gloversville.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.480
That's right.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.480
I was at their home...

32:09.480 --> 32:12.480
May I see a physicist, Greg?

32:12.480 --> 32:14.480
Senator Joseph R. Amarty, I think, chairman of the Senate,

32:14.480 --> 32:17.480
and the Cremlet investigation subcommittee,

32:17.480 --> 32:20.480
and Roy Cohn at New York City, Chief Counsel of the Group,

32:20.480 --> 32:24.480
are spending a few days with two David Shiong at the West Coral Lake Hand,

32:24.480 --> 32:29.480
Mr. Mrs. J. Meyer Shiong, that being used for the second of 1953.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.480
Is that correct, Senator?

32:30.480 --> 32:33.480
I don't think it's all our home with you.
