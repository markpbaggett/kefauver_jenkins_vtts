00:00.000 --> 00:12.760
I think some of the proceedings in the hearings have disgusted the public, because the condom

00:12.760 --> 00:16.040
of some of us who have participated in it.

00:16.040 --> 00:20.480
I say that regretfully.

00:20.480 --> 00:28.480
Because I think there are no people who leave and have a right to expect the United States

00:28.480 --> 00:37.960
Senate and its committees to conduct the proceedings of this government, with dignity, with salinity

00:37.960 --> 00:46.160
and in a spirit of service to country rather than as a show and as an attempt to ridicule

00:46.160 --> 00:47.160
and smear.

00:47.160 --> 00:53.360
I seriously regret many things that have happened in the course of these hearings.

00:53.360 --> 00:59.360
I could answer you quite positionally.

00:59.360 --> 01:09.480
I could very well say that instead of having a famous memo of understanding that it has

01:09.480 --> 01:14.640
turned out to be an infamous memo of misunderstanding.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.640
I do not know what transpired.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.440
I am not particularly concerned.

01:21.440 --> 01:27.960
Although a member of the committee I was not invited to participate, backward is surely

01:27.960 --> 01:35.040
a partisan action and the party responsible and the members of that party who conducted

01:35.040 --> 01:39.520
the proceedings in that fashion, so I have to take the responsibility.

01:39.520 --> 01:48.880
From the chairman I can say to you this morning that you have testified eloquently, eloquently,

01:48.880 --> 01:56.480
and I can express to the empenets, to the lack of capacity, obvious administration and

01:56.480 --> 02:03.160
the Republican Party to conduct their affairs of government without turmoil and harrying.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.160
I do not know what happened.

02:04.160 --> 02:10.800
I do not know whether anyone was deceived or not, but I do know that they for suffer,

02:10.800 --> 02:14.400
those lunch and sourd on the stomach of the Second Day of the Army.

02:44.400 --> 02:50.320
I have heard when the members of the Democratic members went on on this committee, we were

02:50.320 --> 02:56.640
up as a committee in Falta, all the desires of a situation that obviously led to this tragic

02:56.640 --> 02:57.640
situation.

02:57.640 --> 03:02.480
I cannot do no more shut the office with this.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.560
I did not send Mr. Adams on this, Mr. Stingham.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.560
They came to me.

03:09.560 --> 03:14.560
They did not come to me with the advice and the counsel of Mr. Tvart-Flipper.

03:14.560 --> 03:20.200
They came to me with the advice and the counsel and upon the instruction that I understand

03:20.200 --> 03:21.200
it.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.920
Mr. Bill Rogers who is next to the highest legal authority in this government today and

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
under this administration.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.920
What are we to do as Democrats?

03:29.920 --> 03:36.640
We are not invited to participate until a round of the gaps between the Republicans.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.040
One you seek our advice.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.280
I gave the best advice I know.

03:41.280 --> 03:47.100
I immediately told Mr. Adams to go to the Republican members of this committee and with

03:47.100 --> 03:52.400
respect to the story that he related to me, I thought in my would not touch it unless

03:52.400 --> 03:54.240
he gave it to me and invited.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.200
I can do no more than that, Mr. Chairman, to have him.

03:57.200 --> 04:02.200
I have tried throughout the course of these hearings to try to keep some on track.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.480
Try to keep up here relevant testimony.

04:05.480 --> 04:11.580
Try to keep up the extraneous matters and do a dignified job and find these hearings

04:11.580 --> 04:16.560
to a conclusion by getting all of the testimony that was present at the relevant so that we

04:16.560 --> 04:20.920
might have a benefit of it when we only take the performance of the duties of writing

04:20.920 --> 04:21.920
a report.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.840
Mr. Chairman, I say to you now that these hearings are concluded today and I know you're

04:26.840 --> 04:32.320
going to conclude them without the testimony of the three witnesses whom I urge this committee

04:32.320 --> 04:36.920
to summon subpoena, Mr. Clifford, Mr. Shine and General Lawton.

04:36.920 --> 04:42.140
Then just what it will not be complete, these hearings will not be done and there are

04:42.140 --> 04:47.640
important testimony as I quote, so I call and public information on the issues involved

04:47.640 --> 04:51.120
to be far of a focus to us.

04:51.120 --> 04:55.920
I hope Mr. Chairman that we can end these hearings.

04:55.920 --> 05:05.300
In a spirit of real Americanism not only partisan issues but partisan issues have been

05:05.300 --> 05:06.300
injected.

05:06.300 --> 05:13.000
I think wrongfully so but they hear and may I say to you that the power is I am concerned.

05:13.000 --> 05:23.000
I am a Democrat but I place the security in the whole part of my country above any part.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Mr. Chairman.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.340
I was not a question but I don't think that was a question so I was a question that

05:28.340 --> 05:30.880
will be sent to that to his next amendment.

05:30.880 --> 05:39.120
I would like to comment on this and do the part that the plaintiff and McClellan was

05:39.120 --> 05:40.120
directing.

05:40.120 --> 05:45.520
I know some of these remarks, George starts me as not of me, George, my party.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.020
The judge doesn't like others to meet up part of an issue after he's sent 10 minutes

05:49.020 --> 05:56.020
of the press.

05:56.020 --> 06:01.020
I am not so much impressed with Mr. McClellan.

06:01.020 --> 06:08.020
I am very highly inclined to hear that all the other should be out here.

06:08.020 --> 06:10.020
I agree with you on that.

06:10.020 --> 06:15.020
I think the American people should know when you talk about the conduct of the press.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.020
I think they should be reminded again.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.020
Mr. Stevens.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.020
Let me finish.

06:18.020 --> 06:19.020
I didn't interrupt you, Senator.

06:19.020 --> 06:22.020
You were a visit by him.

06:22.020 --> 06:29.020
We know that the Montagritte calls show that the Republican Secretary of the Army Bob Stevens

06:29.020 --> 06:33.020
was repeatedly calling Mr. Simon that there's nothing to this.

06:33.020 --> 06:36.020
I want to get out of there and want to testify.

06:36.020 --> 06:41.020
We know that Mr. Simon can have you, Senator McClellan, who advised me not to do that.

06:41.020 --> 06:44.020
You were referring to your daughter?

06:45.020 --> 06:47.020
I wonder if I didn't interrupt you.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.020
Let me finish this.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.020
I'm not finishing.

06:49.020 --> 06:51.020
You'll have all the time, I assume you want.

06:51.020 --> 06:53.020
I think we're making these wine up to each other.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.020
I just want to crack such a plan.

06:55.020 --> 07:02.020
For example, I want to hear Montagritte calls refer to your Republican colleague as that gang.

07:02.020 --> 07:05.020
The refer to the infamous agreement made.

07:05.020 --> 07:10.020
The only agreement made was that the American people.

07:15.020 --> 07:18.020
The entitled to get information about communists.

07:18.020 --> 07:21.020
I don't think there's anything infamous about the rats.

07:21.020 --> 07:24.020
I think it's the sort of agreement that had been made and they sent her from Missouri,

07:24.020 --> 07:25.020
rather than Arkansas.

07:25.020 --> 07:30.020
And it said that they were only called back after they were to row.

07:30.020 --> 07:33.020
Now, Senator, you are slightly in error on that.

07:33.020 --> 07:38.020
The Montagritte calls about which the U.U.N. or Senator McClellan will testify.

07:38.020 --> 07:43.020
The Montagritte calls about which the U.U.N. or Senator McClellan will testify.

07:43.020 --> 07:46.020
The Montagritte calls U.N. or Senator Simon.

07:46.020 --> 07:56.020
The Montagritte calls show that the quarrel was the result of the urging by Senator Simon.

07:56.020 --> 08:00.020
And what urging it was in the part of Clark Clifford, we don't know.

08:00.020 --> 08:07.020
Now, Senator McClellan, if you are as sincere as you try to make yourself up to me,

08:07.020 --> 08:12.020
and I assume most likely you are, then I think you should take Simon.

08:12.020 --> 08:19.020
I'm sending him to the Woodshed, talk to him, and say an hour's to you, let you and I go on to stand.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.020
Let's go under oath. Let's show that when we are telling the television audience

08:23.020 --> 08:29.020
that we want all the facts laid in the table, say that we are going to do that ourselves.

08:29.020 --> 08:34.020
Otherwise, if they're hearing in, was the picture being made very clear,

08:34.020 --> 08:41.020
that a very innocent secretary of the Army was jolting and shoving into this fight

08:41.020 --> 08:46.020
by the U.E. Gould, House, through the top advisor of the Democratic Party,

08:46.020 --> 08:51.020
I may say, John, that your party is going to suffer and bleed very, very much because of it.

08:51.020 --> 08:55.020
The American people are not going to be fooled. We've got a pretty intelligent jury.

08:55.020 --> 09:02.020
I think some of us here are making a mistake of assuming that because a farmer may live on the back 40 acres,

09:02.020 --> 09:08.020
the mistake of assuming that he does not know just as well what's going on here as any son of her at this table.

09:08.020 --> 09:13.020
Did I have a... Did I have a minute of my own time?

09:13.020 --> 09:16.020
I'm having a fire, I'm having a time.

09:16.020 --> 09:19.020
I'm having a time.

09:22.020 --> 09:25.020
Thank you, but she could time up without any reference.

09:25.020 --> 09:28.020
So, this time, Amy, you would heal the time in the tunnel, but still, you'd have your phone get in there.

09:28.020 --> 09:30.020
I'll only take a minute, then.

09:31.020 --> 09:36.020
Richard, and I have no more announcements for utterances to make and no Christmas.

09:36.020 --> 09:42.020
And I intend to do my campaigning after the hungwishes again and to get out on the hustlings.

09:42.020 --> 09:46.020
I would much prefer to do it there than to inject it into this procedure.

09:46.020 --> 09:50.020
But I do believe that all the time I could call for at least one of the links.

09:53.020 --> 09:58.020
From the time of the March manifesto, from 1933 is 85 years.

09:59.020 --> 10:05.020
But in the period since 1933, more progress has been made by communist infiltration.

10:05.020 --> 10:12.020
Then in all the 85 years, at the Bay of the Tomarts, part of that manifesto in 1848.

10:12.020 --> 10:17.020
And the problem that it gives today has been provoked and they separated as a matter of fact.

10:17.020 --> 10:22.020
Body, infiltration, was the birthplace of this law and communist in government.

10:22.020 --> 10:27.020
And we have been struggling and vigorously added to our paruces and to get them out of government.

10:28.020 --> 10:34.020
And each of these said to the everlasting credit of the Eisenhower administration that that work is going forward on every problem.

10:34.020 --> 10:36.020
Had any infiltration not implemented?

10:36.020 --> 10:42.020
Had there been this vigilant here for a very public administration, certainly would not have the bittering shot.
