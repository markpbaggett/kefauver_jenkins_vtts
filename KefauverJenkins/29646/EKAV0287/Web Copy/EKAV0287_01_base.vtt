WEBVTT

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
in the field for instance, with the sound of the music.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Have they still been in the field for a few years in the field for?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Well, I suppose that's all part of the job.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
You mentioned the fact that I've been that natural along with the other members of the

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
colleagues through these chamber of commerce, and I just passed that there for

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
the first time in the field.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
How does that affect you?

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
You've learned in Washington, I heard a great deal of comments about the first

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
professional music and I have found to be about what is development is going to be

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
and what are one of the few things that is going to happen.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
That's the way we regularly do this, and the information in Washington

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
will be the fact that the air engineering development center is the main

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
aspect of that formal scenario and the environment of general craft art.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I think that's one of the great deals that I've got in this air engineering

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
development center among these 50 years and 51 years.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
It'll be a bit of a good night's job.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Oh, that's right, and probably what do you think is happening with this

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
research and development?

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
The benefit of these industry is that these industries are very good.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
This is starting to make the city of New York, as well as nearly 20,000

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
people.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I think the city of New York is making it great.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And it's going to take me an hour to make it into the city of New York.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
It's going to take me six years, so it's going to be like, you hear what I said?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
What I certainly was, this is the thing that's all important to the

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Edison Institute of Science in New York every year.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
This is just another death travel on the part of the planet.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
It's part of the Edison Institute of Science and Science, and it's part of the

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Edison Institute of Science.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
It should be noted to begin with that the Edison packaging is maybe a charge

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
of energy and energy and energy.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
If I am involved with the allocation, the allocation makes the

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
paid by the QBA, or it's most of the first steps.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Another word they want to make is electric power and

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
streamers, which is positive navigation, such as control and

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
everything else, the QBA does not just electric power, but also

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
power.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
And I think the demand is there, and the QBA is pushing great

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
damage, destruction of that stream power, and so on, and

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
navigation before the situation falls.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
How did it do?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Well, the same damage causes electricity to the

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
flow from the farm to the star accounting, for example,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
because it's been floating in the flood from the low,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
and the low, and the low, and it's just a bit of a...

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Same damage raises the level of the late-to-mid-nabigation

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
basically, the maximum of Japanese, also finishes electrical

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
energy and electricity as per the experience.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
The original QBA act required the QBA to set up the system

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
of allocating the false disease dams that could clean the

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
electric power, let the flow of the navigation, and the

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
QBA to divide such a mess, which was reviewed by the four

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
engineers in the federal power commission, and they agreed to

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
use the QBA system of allocations as fair and as sharp

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
as efficient amounts of electricity, electrical

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
operations.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
These two agencies, though, probably might have used them

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
to utilize the different allocations that the QBA used to

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
move through with the QBA system of allocations.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Maybe the argument that the primary benefit of the QBA is

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
the lack of power is concerned with the balance of the power

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
and the cost of the QBA system.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
It cannot be justified as only the QBA's archies

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
to move the benefit from the touches on the navigation

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
of the QBA.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Congress requires the QBA to repay all the false allocations

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
of power production in the 40 years period at the QBA

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
and the head of the QBA is just a few of the times.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
If the 800 million dollar investment is coming up,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
it's made a QBA as a full-of-the-load, then the power

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
is going to be a huge part of the QBA.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I don't think it is very minded person that arched

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
of the QBA system.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Our job is to have navigation and buttons rolled as zero.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
As a matter of fact, purely flexible and navigation

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
dams throughout the United States,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
feedbacks, nothing is settled.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
The whole point is a subtle expense.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
In the presence of the whole high river line,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
any other river where they have buttons rolled

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
as well as the water line.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
The access of the United States

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
has been in our position to make the size of the feedback.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
So it's a good common sense to build an absolutely

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
safe and generalization of electricity

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
and that part of the dam is just a electrical person

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
who is using a power plant.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
So if you just say,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I saw in the newspaper,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
you can't pronounce it as a seminar,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
you'll be working in a state.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
It's a very estimated,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
a TBA reservoir.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It can save the city of Stadley-Broadwood.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
41,000,000,000 dollars in smart,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
90,000,000 cents.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Well, I think that's right.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
When I live in the city of Chattanooga,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
and I know a whole lot of us have buttons rolled

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
as well as buttons rolled as the Chattanooga

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
always had.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And you actually have some significant buttons

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
for TVDs.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And actually, Chattanooga is the largest

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
multi-dimensional TVB system

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
that benefits the request ofå£­.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
All of them, many other buttons

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
are all of them,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
and other citizens have the long,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
hundred-year-old.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
We used to have a terrible damage

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
in the buttons down there in the government.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
But the TBA saves us from every

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
high water.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And the TBA dams above Chattanooga

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
have minimized the things

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
with the multi-detectable

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
which is detected

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
that even the highest blood

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
are not used.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
The point I'm making is that most of the value

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
of the buttons rolled goes to people.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You witness these damage in the midst of the

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
difficult development.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
The TBA dams did not fall back

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
on an average of nearly

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
41,000 square miles every year.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Also, a lot of people have been

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
steadfast in the TBA,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
such as those people.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
On the whole power of the TBA

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
and the Heavens,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
the All-Indian and the other places.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
If these people,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
and not TBA,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
and all the entire consumers

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
have been efficient.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Therefore, I don't think it can be said

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
that justification of the entire consumers

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
is pretty much the most vulnerable

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
and the most sensitive.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
That's the purpose of TBA benefits.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
All the mid-top directly

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
and the definition of justice navigation itself.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
The TBA, even if the limitations

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
and its electric needs

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
should be free.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
What do you want?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
One of the benefits that have

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
joined the topic of benefits

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
that on its power

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
after the TBA

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
and on its shows

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
topic of benefits

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
that the report says

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
that private power people

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
as far as all soldiers

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
and not-power operations

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
should be effective

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
in the work in parts

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
for people planning to be

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
very wildlife and fishing

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
and so on.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And I'm putting now

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
our rendered almost free of charge

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
and the smalls is made up

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
by donations from the rest of the United States

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
that's been in this position.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Actually, these 30-30s

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
are provided from the features

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
not almost free of charge.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
But once these services are made

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
available by the system,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
the corporation is counting

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
50 years funds.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
There are no letters to these services

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
and the weather view of the service

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
because it's also a feature.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
But I'm sure even the first time

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
that this house is made

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
out of high-lobby

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
you can see the weather view

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
of service by this

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
and this and this and this and this and this.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
And if you have a decent

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
30-30 days you can say

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
that it's big if you use

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
this in the country

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
or you use this in the country

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
or you use this in the country

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
or you use this in the country

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
or you use this in the country

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
or you use this in the country.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Well, matter of fact,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Mr. President,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
this is pretty nice photo-colon.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
You've just got a job

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
to do this during this

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
30-30 years.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
But I tend to say right after

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
it's prolonged as an outrageous start

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
such as the

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
made by the head of the

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
electric system

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
and it's used

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
in some of these notes.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
There is clearly

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
a significant need

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
by the 19-30s

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
for the speed of the development.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I recently was sitting

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
on the seat

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
and I was a national income tax.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Now we pay a little bit more

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
in terms of that.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
If you have proven

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
that the economic situation

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
is extremely terrible

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
and the economic situation

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
is very terrible.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
But I think

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
all the lives out

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
of the electric system

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
is very different.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
There is another matter

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
as BlackHit

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
and that's just

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
before the longest thing was

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
that the situation

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
on the field

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
is not as good as

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
the state's

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
state of nature.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
It's just a bit

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
easy to make

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
as well as the climate

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
in the region.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, I try to read

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
a whole lot about

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
that number of problems

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
but right now the bill

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
is lying more

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
than the government.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I think that's

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
the reason

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
that the government

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
has been

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
in the middle of the

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
process.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
At the very

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
time that you had

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
four engineers

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
that was

10:49.000 --> 10:49.000


10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
some of the

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
technical

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
navigations

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
took

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
100 years

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
of long range

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
so they do, of course,

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
double-dance

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
that is generating

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
electricity.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Just recently, however,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
after the test of the

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
energy

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
and the positive

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
navigation

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
in the context,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
the president

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
of the

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
TVA

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
is currently

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
in the context

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
of it.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It is the

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
yes TVA

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
tell what they

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
would actually do

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
with the development

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
of the

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
living with the next.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Then also, we find

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
a great

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
element in favor of the

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
development

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
in the state

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
matters,

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
energy

11:29.000 --> 11:29.000


11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
and the

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
other things

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
in the

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
state

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
matters,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
energy

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
measures

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
are active

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
and thanks

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
for all the

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
old arguments

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
about

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
high-dance

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
taking too much

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
to spot

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
them land

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
out of the

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
structure.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
So this reason, some

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
of the members

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
have been

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
not politically

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
inspired

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
for the

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
facilities

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
and as they

11:56.000 --> 11:56.000


11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
have to build

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
the resources

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
on the wall.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Anything you have,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
any time you have

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
a project,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
you people are going

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
to be in the TVA.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
From the land

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
of the

12:07.000 --> 12:07.000


12:07.000 --> 12:07.000


12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
field

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
and I think

12:09.000 --> 12:09.000


12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
TVA.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
So now I give up

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
to wonderful overall

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
project to be

12:15.000 --> 12:15.000


12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
pattern.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
As a matter of fact,

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
the whole thing

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
about the

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
common areas

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
and water

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
power,

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
flowing water

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
is

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
quite

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
interesting

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
and nothing

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
has

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
been

12:30.000 --> 12:30.000


12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
in the

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
question for all the

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
seals and

12:34.000 --> 12:42.500
water

12:42.500 --> 12:43.000
and water.

12:43.000 --> 12:52.000
Yes, the water

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
and water.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I know

12:56.000 --> 12:58.160
this from

12:58.160 --> 13:01.000
speaking

13:01.000 --> 13:01.000


13:02.000 --> 13:07.300
with

13:07.300 --> 13:09.300
information

13:09.300 --> 13:12.800
and

13:12.800 --> 13:17.000
ParmCharles

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
in future

13:19.000 --> 13:26.000
and

13:26.000 --> 13:29.400
with

13:29.400 --> 13:36.400
information

13:36.400 --> 13:39.400
and

13:39.400 --> 13:46.400
with

13:46.400 --> 13:50.400
information

13:50.400 --> 13:57.400
and

13:57.400 --> 14:07.400
information

14:07.400 --> 14:07.400


14:07.400 --> 14:16.400
with

14:16.400 --> 14:24.400
information

14:24.400 --> 14:26.400
and

14:26.400 --> 14:29.400
information
