00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
The police are in need, speaking from your center for the first time this winter.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
During the week, snow and fire picked up the ground on the safe path.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
The week was invented by the Center for Keyfollow.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Monday delivered a full dress speech on the center floor,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
as the fort over the Atlantic Union residents.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
The university included my effort to fill the state of the nation.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Wednesday was back in Washington with the local housing bill.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
The remainder of the week's Center for Keyfollow was participated in the debate

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
on the proposal regarding natural gas, which was resumed in an increase in consumers' gas rates and fast.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
Friday he addressed the National Federation of private schools associated with the state.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
But the people of Tennessee and Femme don't issue the National Education to Washington.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Here at Wednesday, on the Center for Keyfollow.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
Well, thank you, Charlie. We did have a very busy week and much has occurred in the country and the community.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
It's a much bigger time for the side, not these little visits.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Overview our fireway with any questions, and thanks for the food.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Senator, there was much big news in Washington during the week.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
They have the most sensational and positive and most vital.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Inferring the charges of climate connections in the state department,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
as that investigation is coming along.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, thank you for watching this video.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
The Witthpunson has decided to keep this week for a tennis par on relation to sub-competition.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Charging mediums for all of you from the state department is being announced,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
coming into the coming of the state department.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Most of the name centers in the country has mentioned things that are originally announced before the House of corporations.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
In the hideous company, they have previously been investigated.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
He thinks there are 57 sub-competition security risks in the state department.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
The investigation has shown so far that some of those suspected centers in the state department are not and never have been.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Senator, what are your own decisions from the charge centers?

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, that's a difficult answer that the state is adhering.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
The truth is not all that is in the data yet, and they cannot know just what proof centers in the market will be able to produce.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Just by all means, they are all tied to those accused and that they have the system in the market.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
There's no evidence that the drug force to use the system, that's our mind, the rest on the issue, or the justify the aftertaste.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
With the lack of weight, you see what happens before anyone can be justified and drunk as a conclusion, for 61 way or the other.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
Of course, if they are a bad security risk in the state department or in any other branch of the government,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
we want to see them found out and kicked out and assume it was a better.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
At the same time, at the best, situations that have a territory and wrongly of Americans that are accused of facts,

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
and the headlines, they are over the radio and discussed all over the country with the charge centers.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
At this time, when we have seen convictions in our force on charges of treason, among the first and the second,

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
it is difficult for those leaders to now and attempt to correct use to ever restore people's confidence in them.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
It is time that they understood that they were wrongdoing.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
I remember one occasion, a person with a few, the UnAmerican Act, which made a developed that is entirely in the state.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
It had already been some days ago that this person is still suffering from the effects that have been charged with this again.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Both of these situations are dangerous to our national security.

03:49.000 --> 03:58.000
I will discuss the many following this subject and getting at the bottom of this whole thing, but I'm engaging in a witch witch hunt on one side or in a white wash on the other.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm sure that the committee under the chairman should have passed the first message.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Hello!

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I might say Charlie and Madison have gotten into this investigation.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
We must have seen, at the United States Department, all the way down the street with them many times, on that regard,

04:18.000 --> 04:30.000
and have them as part of the policy and handling foreign affairs, but we must assume that they are loyal and that they want to have loyal and flowy working for them and do what they want to get all the communist out.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
So I think it is an easy way to turn it to the attitude and to the state department that one of the departments should have taken up this,

04:38.000 --> 04:47.000
and I think it would be a big department to give them a chance to correct any errors and any further than they did in the rest of the day to talk about it on the Senate floor.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, thank you, Senator. Now, housing was in the news during the week also. What happened to affect this in the United States?

04:54.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, if a vision was worth, what would have made housing available for persons in the middle of any of the coming projects, was distributed by five votes on the floor of the fence?

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
I did all I could to think about that as a best vision, because there is a remaining gap in our housing needs.

05:09.000 --> 05:18.000
To much of our presence, housing program has gone far into its buildings and apartment buildings, just a lot of the reach to the average fund.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
Some clearance program is getting the work as expected from now, and we need to slow the streets by providing housing for another anytime soon.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Our labelled with the task that the understanding does contain some good provisions.

05:31.000 --> 05:40.000
As a news, the FAP program will not be ensuring mortgages on private homes and the small loans to cover repairs and food.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
Another provision would make possible the rest of the long-term loan loan to substance who are unable to obtain private finance.

05:48.000 --> 05:57.000
Well, that will certainly be welcome news in some parts of Tennessee, and may it place it, but it is said that it is unable to buy a fund under the gui bill of rights.

05:57.000 --> 06:10.000
Yes, it will be a very tough task for substance, but it is made clear in the bill that they must make it sure that they cannot secure private finance before they are eligible to obtain the benefits of housing provisions.

06:10.000 --> 06:28.000
Then another section on the bill will help educational institutions to construct housing facilities for students and members of the faculty with long-term, low-cost loans, and we all know about the need for home-to-part students and members of the faculty and many of the schools and the kind of things.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
So much that it has in real center.

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
You know, we are witnessing a reversal of coal here in Washington. It used to be that it measured the gas in the house and killed in the city. Now the reversing industry is still there.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, that's almost the right journey, but not the quiet power.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Recent events, certainly far out of great deal of that statement, however.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
We have to build a misfinity to give home room and a vote for the residents of the District of Columbus.

06:56.000 --> 07:05.000
That bill is all bottled up in the house. It has a large stockage resolution because the people are greater void than the election of the president.

07:05.000 --> 07:14.000
I think this is much too much to satisfy a system all over the United States. At this resolution, if you know it's been killed in the house of the president.

07:14.000 --> 07:25.000
And another instance I recall is the bill providing for federal aid to education, which is passed and is financed by large majority, but it's been taken hold in the House of Education's committee.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
And I bet the education bill you mentioned within the news during the week 2, what happened to it?

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
Well, most unfortunate news is that the Senate passed federal aid to education bills, died in the house committee on labor and education.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
A great controversy developed over there over the way the aid program to be administered.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
The bill was sent into the room and it has left it to the state themselves to prepare how the use funds for the education bill is spending.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
But the fight in the house was concerned with the question of providing aid for religious food.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
The fight was better than the vote, so by marking a one-third of the committee's health issues.

08:02.000 --> 08:12.000
That's a shame. Only in one vote in one house of time, the bench facility in the Tennessee is having better teachers and better facilities. But I guess that's the message.

08:12.000 --> 08:23.000
Well, Sally, I will sometime explain the fact that such a project is a new, ever-one-of-the-bodies place for most of them, needs aid in the education of folks.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
Our children were tough with the consequences, and that's some means to be found to settle the aid to your argument to change the situation.

08:31.000 --> 08:42.000
That's where it is, and an important issue, I'm impressed you admit. But somehow it does appear we define ways and means to provide the best possible education for the use of our country.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Well, there is a bit of energy during the recent, and it's finally used to provide an energy to use.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
I refer to the senator, Edward Johnson, the principal of the license, Louis Actors and Actors, which year are we asking to that to vote?

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
The president of the guy, who is just a few six lives, has been a special and most highly-spoken.

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
It may be argued that an instrument of the population that is used in the basement is reflecting on their moral behaviors.

09:36.000 --> 09:48.000
If they were subjected to an equal amount of swear-up, it may be argued also that people who are in the public eye, who seem properly careful, but are pretty careful, probably used to the murder.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, the party are about to face the use of the British, slightly skeptical and erotic, and most of the folks are confused.

09:54.000 --> 10:02.000
And the reason behind the use of swear-up, not as far as I am as an unethical, is because of the dangerous news personality.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
It may affect the knowledge of our young people.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
From that standpoint, at some point there is no evidence that the purpose of the purpose is to be.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
On the other hand, this is the Southern Regimentation of I base its use.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
MIPM, which is probably as far as the issue of my citizenship might be filed, and actually a bit of a privilege of earning a living.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
So doing it and not doing something regulated by that actress, you'll live this belief otherwise.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
There is one thing that regulates this type of music I actually see, which regulates my thanks to being termed by the individual's power.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
And the regulates the power that lies, because it actually is an actress who is here in those pictures.

10:39.000 --> 10:47.000
I didn't rate up the bill, the bill is subject to hearings, and I guess it will be, and there will be some fireworks to be forthcoming.

10:47.000 --> 10:57.000
So I'm supposed to say that our time has drawn sharp, but I didn't want you to say a word about lending your guns on the hate department over the species

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
during the wake, it came with an open season on the hate department or I like.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
So I thought it didn't end in terms of these jumping on as departments probably, kind of it all because other people are doing so.

11:10.000 --> 11:19.000
And I just like to jump on official government, because I know that they do have a very hard time, and sometimes they're officially not appreciated.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
But the matter of the season still is very vital, and the State Department has such a little imagination.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
The last thing I would not be doing last-born duty or last-time body is the attention of the American people to this situation.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
The official to the State Department don't seem to realize that the American people are far ahead of them and they're thinking about the heat.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
If our people are spoken with no truth, then it can turn into no harm.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
I would be much more sure to hear what it is that it's all they're doing in the week.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
However, the weather convention on the floor of the park is over.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
It can be approached in this attitude.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
We don't know what can be done, but we have pretty much going to the time and talk about it this time now.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
There's a glad abuting and there's not the answers to our problems, which is great no further time in finding out that's fine.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
First of all, it is my opinion that the calling of the convention on the street people to the North Atlantic region is the next logical, struck-and-out task to keep.

12:17.000 --> 12:31.000
We're certainly going to have to have some children to work on and to create the imagination of the street people of the North Atlantic after the Marshall's plan was spoken this time in the 1960s.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
This opinion is shared by four of my colleagues and four of them do the illustrations as much more should be done immediately,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
and it is now being done by the State Department.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's got to have a team file all.

12:43.000 --> 12:54.000
I said it in about 10 seconds here, I wanted you to tell us what it is to take the way you're regarding your resolution to investigate the crime.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
There you are. I've been working out after having passed the judiciary committee by the unanimous vote.

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
Automaticly goes to the rules that is administration committee with a lot to the money out of the system,

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
and the following out of the industry, in this case, we have $400,000.

13:13.000 --> 13:25.000
We went down to the committee to get our money and we went into a huge mistake to make the right decision for the Congress committee to finish sending the necessary instructions and not to do this.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
We made a year thinking that this needs to be successful.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
We are looking after it.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
We need to get more out.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
We need to get out.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm on the floor now.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I'm on the floor now.
