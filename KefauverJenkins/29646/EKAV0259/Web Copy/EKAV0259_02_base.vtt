00:00.000 --> 00:13.840
I have a first time at Mr. Shine and Mr. Steven had had a conversation concerning what

00:13.840 --> 00:17.840
Mr. Steven was going to do with Mr. Shine.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.720
There was relations between unit charcoals of first species.

00:21.720 --> 00:31.280
The only thing of significance occurred between October 21 and November 6, where it's within

00:31.280 --> 00:33.280
your personal knowledge.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.760
Not that I can hardly call it.

00:35.760 --> 00:42.520
Clearly you were present on the evening of the meeting in the security of the office

00:42.520 --> 00:43.520
in the Pentagon.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.520
Yes, November 6.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.520
Yes, sir.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.520
Yes.

00:46.520 --> 00:56.520
On that occasion, what were the general circuits of conversation?

00:56.520 --> 01:05.320
And though they've been going in very early, but may I speak state they were?

01:05.320 --> 01:06.320
Yes.

01:06.320 --> 01:12.560
Well, it's been testified as to who was present.

01:12.560 --> 01:18.640
Then Mr. Coleman and I arrived in the West Center of McCoffee.

01:18.640 --> 01:24.880
I recall that the secretary asked Mr. Coleman where Mr. Shine was.

01:24.880 --> 01:32.000
Mr. Coleman said that Mr. Shine felt that since he was not crowded in the army, it would

01:32.000 --> 01:36.920
be a little unusual for him to be having lunch with the secretary.

01:36.920 --> 01:41.880
And every guard I know that there was a six-place set at the table.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.520
There was an office table about this size.

01:44.520 --> 01:50.320
There was a six-place set there and I assumed after that conversation that it was Mr. Shine

01:50.320 --> 01:55.520
and the army followed us who he had died.

01:55.520 --> 02:05.000
About the time we set down to the at the table, the secretary asked for a resume of the

02:05.000 --> 02:11.200
evidence that had been developed concerning during the course of our Fort Marathon investigation.

02:11.200 --> 02:21.160
Mr. Coleman took the floor, I would say, for several moments and gave a resume of all the

02:21.160 --> 02:27.040
evidence that had been collected during the weeks of our investigation.

02:27.040 --> 02:33.440
Mr. Stevens was listening very intently.

02:33.440 --> 02:42.400
Then Mr. Coleman said his resume, Mr. Stevens asked how long the public hearings could be expected

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
to run.

02:43.400 --> 02:50.360
I might note here that Senator McCoffee on I think the preceding day, November 5, had made

02:50.360 --> 02:56.960
an announcement to the effect that the hearing public hearings on Mama's would begin on the

02:56.960 --> 03:00.760
following Thursday, I think, 12th of November.

03:00.760 --> 03:08.200
Senator McCoffee, or Mr. Coleman, told the secretary that the hearings could be expected

03:08.200 --> 03:12.240
to run for approximately six weeks.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.440
The secretary was very upset about this.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.680
At least he appeared to be.

03:17.680 --> 03:22.680
He said that this was impossible, that if the hearings lasted anywhere near that length

03:22.680 --> 03:25.840
of time, that he would have to resign.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.640
He said that he had been the secretary of the Army for some ten months at that time,

03:30.640 --> 03:37.640
and that the people would not understand his not having taken action soon.

03:37.640 --> 03:45.000
He asked if there was some way that the subcommittee could help take the pressure off of he and

03:45.000 --> 03:50.840
himself and the Army by holding hearings on other investigations.

03:50.840 --> 03:55.160
And I recall that there was an answer made to that question.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.560
I don't recall whether it was Mr. Coleman or Mr. McCoffee.

03:58.560 --> 04:05.240
Senator McCoffee, but the answer was that we were not ready to hold hearings on any other

04:05.240 --> 04:06.240
investigation.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.640
We were ready to hold hearings on the Army.

04:08.640 --> 04:14.560
Senator McCoffee made it very clear that there would be no whitewashing of this Army

04:14.560 --> 04:15.560
situation.

04:15.560 --> 04:21.640
He told the secretary that he personally should not be worried.

04:21.640 --> 04:27.280
He didn't think he didn't agree with the secretary because he had been in there ten months.

04:27.280 --> 04:31.320
He should be held responsible in the public side.

04:31.320 --> 04:40.120
He said that nothing has been done so far in the investigation, which was aimed at or

04:40.120 --> 04:43.240
had helped the secretary personally.

04:43.240 --> 04:50.840
He said that the secretary had been trying to assist the subcommittee that he himself

04:50.840 --> 04:53.600
and made public statements throughout effect.

04:53.600 --> 04:58.560
He said however that he couldn't whitewash the situation by not having hearings.

04:58.560 --> 05:10.840
There then followed a suggestion by the secretary that the defense department proper, the air force

05:10.840 --> 05:16.920
and the Navy also had security situations which were there looking into by the subcommittee.

05:16.920 --> 05:24.400
At that point Mr. Haddon nodded and said that he would be able to furnish the subcommittee

05:24.400 --> 05:26.440
with information on that.

05:26.440 --> 05:30.800
The secretary seemed to affirm this.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.880
He nodded his head and acted like it.

05:33.880 --> 05:39.480
Like he said, the suspect might be the answer to the problem.

05:39.480 --> 05:45.440
The next point that came up and I'm not exactly sure of the order of this, but the next point

05:45.440 --> 05:56.040
that came up that I recall was a statement by Mr. Colm that we were planning to investigate

05:56.040 --> 06:03.280
and eventually hold hearings on communist and defense industry.

06:03.280 --> 06:13.040
The meeting was left with a understanding that we would not stop the fourth moment hearing

06:13.040 --> 06:17.920
that we would have public hearings, but that in order to take some of the pressure off

06:17.920 --> 06:25.480
of the Army and Secretary Stevens personally, we would hold some public hearings on communist

06:25.480 --> 06:28.400
infiltration of defense plans also.

06:28.400 --> 06:38.400
That's about the fire call was Mr. Scott Keaton, who was involved in this meeting.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.400
Yes sir, what?

06:42.400 --> 06:52.200
During the talks of the meeting, either Senator McCockey or perhaps Mr. Colm stated that

06:52.200 --> 07:02.840
Mr. Shiner has been working on some of this work and the secretary then volunteered.

07:02.840 --> 07:11.840
The suggestion that Mr. Shiner might be made available to work weekend on committee business.

07:11.840 --> 07:16.440
He said that it's necessary that he even worked evening on it.

07:16.440 --> 07:25.120
Any time that he was not in training, this was sent by the secretary and at that point

07:25.120 --> 07:31.560
he was happy to do anything he could to keep us from having immediate hearings on the

07:31.560 --> 07:32.560
office.

07:32.560 --> 07:38.080
Mr. Barrett, did you make any statements with reference to Shiner?

07:38.080 --> 07:40.080
No, sir, I didn't.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.080
I don't recall it.

07:42.080 --> 07:50.920
Well, you've been a star in this proceeding as the sound stolen man.

07:50.920 --> 07:59.120
Well, did you make any statement of any character at this larger medium than when was six?

07:59.120 --> 08:07.640
Well, sir, I might say that that's one of the more appreciative appellations that's been

08:07.640 --> 08:09.920
passed over me and they passed a few months.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.920
I don't object to that.

08:11.920 --> 08:19.920
At the conference of November 6th, I, of course, took part in the greeting.

08:19.920 --> 08:29.320
I took some minor part in the discussion when Mr. Colm was describing the results or giving

08:29.320 --> 08:33.160
it resume of the investigation that had been conducted.

08:33.160 --> 08:35.920
I took part in the meeting.

08:35.920 --> 08:39.920
I think I collected him on one occasion.

08:39.920 --> 08:46.240
Generally speaking, it was pretty hard to get a word in.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.240
We could all understand this, though.

08:48.240 --> 08:53.240
Well, it wasn't only Mr. Colm at that point.

08:53.240 --> 09:00.240
Well, Mr. Colm sent him to November 6th.

09:00.240 --> 09:11.520
Did you have any conversations with Secretary Stevens with reference to the jargons of

09:11.520 --> 09:14.520
the Senate for crossing his fair?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.520
Hi, yes, sir.

09:16.520 --> 09:30.960
Well, on November 16th, I saw the Secretary on November 16th, I was going to pick up Mr.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.440
Colm and go to the airport.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.360
We were flying to New York.

09:35.360 --> 09:40.080
He asked me, or I suggested, that I would pick him up at the Pentagon on the way to the

09:40.080 --> 09:41.080
airport.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.080
I had no appointment with Secretary Stevens.

09:43.080 --> 09:48.080
No, for the friction of clarity, this was the meeting that followed through November

09:48.080 --> 09:51.080
13th, press conference of Secretary Stevens.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.080
Yes, that was correct.

09:52.080 --> 09:56.080
And that was the purpose of the meeting.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.080
I understand it, Washington.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.080
You did not go with Mr. Colm to the Pentagon.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.080
No, I didn't.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.080
You had no appointment with Secretary Stevens, don't you?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.080
No, sir.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.080
I had no appointment with no intention of saying.

10:12.080 --> 10:16.600
And when I arrived, I merely went to pick up Mr. Colm to proceed to the airport.

10:16.600 --> 10:22.680
When I arrived, the Secretary, Secretary, at least the receptionist announced that I

10:22.680 --> 10:28.120
had arrived, the Secretary was very gracious and ordered that I be ushered in.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.120
I went in.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.720
There were the usual greetings.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.720
Secretary is very courteous.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.560
I sat down with him.

10:35.560 --> 10:41.180
They had a time we've been discussing the November 13th, press conference of Secretary

10:41.180 --> 10:42.180
Stevens.

10:42.180 --> 10:52.320
At the point that I, when I had arrived, the Secretary was stating that he was very disturbed

10:52.320 --> 10:57.880
that the conference had been misinterpreted by some of the press presence.

10:57.880 --> 11:07.680
He was very disturbed that the misinterpretation could cause any anxiety or any disturbance

11:07.680 --> 11:10.920
on the part of Senator McCoff.

11:10.920 --> 11:19.440
He said that he had not intended to say that there was no espionage at Fort Mommaid.

11:19.440 --> 11:24.320
He merely intended to say that he knew of no espionage at Fort Mommaid.

11:24.320 --> 11:31.640
He said he hadn't meant to front Senator McCoffee and that he was most anxious to do whatever

11:31.640 --> 11:36.680
he could to straighten the matter out with Senator McCoffee.

11:36.680 --> 11:40.440
He said he'd fly up to New York that night and have dinner with the Senator.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.200
So he'd come up and have breakfast.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.680
He said he'd have lunch the next day.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.080
It was very anxious to see the Senator.

11:46.080 --> 11:53.280
Mr. Colm said that he would be saying the Senator that afternoon in New York, and that

11:53.280 --> 11:57.920
he would have been contacted with as a result of the meeting.

11:57.920 --> 12:04.600
Secretary Steven did come to New York the following day and met with Mr. McCoffee.

12:04.600 --> 12:10.560
In all the following day, in all of them, the 17th, the World Classiness, the Marchance

12:10.560 --> 12:12.080
Club in New York City.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.080
I had a doubt.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.080
Yes, I was.

12:14.080 --> 12:20.960
What if anything were stated by even Mr. Steven from the stadiums as the Marchance Club meeting

12:20.960 --> 12:30.720
with reference to the possibility of your committee investigating the other services?

12:30.720 --> 12:34.560
I have no personal knowledge of any of that conversation.

12:34.560 --> 12:44.960
I'll know them for 24 while I'll ask you if Mr. Adams made any additional suggestions

12:44.960 --> 12:51.560
in the youth with reference to stopping your investigation of the Army.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
Yes, sir.

12:52.560 --> 12:58.160
On the 17th, however, I think you might have gone ahead of us off of that.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.760
On the 17th, you can hear the making of the state.

13:00.760 --> 13:05.360
By the way, while we're on the 17th, I might say, serve one point.

13:05.360 --> 13:15.360
I could do a 1117 that was in the arrangement made that the senator and his staff would go

13:15.360 --> 13:21.960
to Fort Marmot and then proceed to Boston in the secondary frame.

13:21.960 --> 13:28.960
I recall that when we arrived at Fort Marmot, I was given what they were talking about.

13:28.960 --> 13:34.200
I recall that when we arrived, that actually was McGuire F. Fort Bay, Subdication II, Fort

13:34.200 --> 13:35.200
Dicks.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.800
When we arrived and were getting up the plane, I heard the secretary say something to the

13:39.800 --> 13:44.200
effect of now with the good time to get that picture with Bay.

13:44.200 --> 13:49.200
There was a general round of handshakes and introductions.

13:49.200 --> 13:55.200
Mr. Shine was there, General Ryan was there, two channels, that please.

13:55.200 --> 13:59.200
One is General Bradley and one was Colonel Barrow.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.200
There were some other officers and were some men there, there were some partners there.

14:05.200 --> 14:12.200
After the introduction, I recall the secretary's motion to Shine.

14:12.200 --> 14:19.200
I didn't hear him say anything, but they came and stood together against the plane.

14:19.200 --> 14:23.200
The photographers made ready to take pictures.

14:23.200 --> 14:29.200
I recall that I tried to get out of the picture.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.200
I saw it was coming, I tried to get out of the picture.

14:33.200 --> 14:40.200
I recall that General Bradley was standing in the area.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.200
That's about all of that happened there.

14:43.200 --> 14:52.040
I do recall that evening, that evening when we were dining at one of the officers at Fort

14:52.040 --> 14:57.040
at the moment, we were talking about it.

14:57.040 --> 15:03.040
Senator McCartney told Mr. Shine in front of the two channels, Colonel Bradley in front of the bell,

15:03.040 --> 15:14.040
that he wanted him to spend all of his free time when he was not in training working on the committee reports.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.040
That's about all of that conversation.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.040
The events of November 17th as I recall.

15:21.040 --> 15:31.040
Now when was the next occasion on which even Mr. Adams will set his fingers against this?

15:31.040 --> 15:34.040
You're hearing the conclusion.

15:34.040 --> 15:41.040
Well, the next that I know of, sir, was on the 24th of November.

15:41.040 --> 15:48.040
I had lunch with Mr. Adams and Mr. Cohn.

15:48.040 --> 15:54.040
I had apparently been some discussion that I was not in on.

15:54.040 --> 16:05.040
But at that point, during some point during the luncheon, Mr. Adams brought up the subject of General Law

16:05.040 --> 16:09.040
and was possible removal from his command at Fort Momman.

16:09.040 --> 16:26.040
And he was very anxious to get what he turned some good word from Senator McCartney concerning his attitude on a removal of General Law from Fort Momman.

16:26.040 --> 16:36.040
Mr. Adams said to Mr. Cohn that if you can give me some good word on the Law in the situation,

16:36.040 --> 16:41.040
maybe I can give you some good word on whether or not Shine will be available this weekend.

16:41.040 --> 16:45.040
I think it was the fact. I'm sure it was the Thanksgiving weekend.

16:45.040 --> 16:54.040
I recall that Mr. Cohn was a little annoyed at this for what he tried and the reason that

16:54.040 --> 17:03.040
he didn't like Mr. Adams tying up the Law in situation with the shines availability over the weekend.

17:03.040 --> 17:15.040
He said that the secretary had made an arrangement whereby the father shines with the available non-training hours

17:15.040 --> 17:21.040
and that he didn't like Mr. Adams in detecting himself into the situation.

17:21.040 --> 17:27.040
There was a little discussion about that. Nothing unpleasant and we left.

17:27.040 --> 17:42.040
The reason for this was thanks to the first occasion on which Mr. Adams thought of this question of favor to Shine in consideration of

17:42.040 --> 17:49.040
the situation. You were taking steps to stop the investigation.

17:49.040 --> 17:54.040
Yes, I think that's the first one that I know of.

17:54.040 --> 18:06.040
I think that on October 8th or 9th when we were talking about stopping the hearings.

18:06.040 --> 18:19.040
Mr. Adams may have said that the secretary was going to do something with Shine and that should be some sort of an inducement to us.

18:19.040 --> 18:28.040
But that is the October 8th conversation or that matter is not exactly clear.

18:28.040 --> 18:37.040
Do you tell us committee that Mr. Adams is commencing around November 24th?

18:37.040 --> 18:50.040
You trying to shine his face to gain his desire. Is that the circumstances of what you mean?

18:50.040 --> 19:09.040
I think that Mr. Adams was aware of the fact that throughout the entire period of association beginning back in early October that Mr. Shine was going to be in the Army,

19:09.040 --> 19:22.040
and that he had come from our subcommittee. I think he was aware of that fact. I think he was smart enough to keep up in the back with mine at all times.

19:22.040 --> 19:29.040
I think that he was using it wherever he could.

19:29.040 --> 19:39.040
Now, have you stated the substance and significance of November 24th and so far they have laid for your charges or hastic issues?

19:39.040 --> 19:40.040
As I now recall.

19:40.040 --> 19:48.040
And when I say your charges, I'm of course referring to the Senate from a conscience.

19:48.040 --> 19:58.040
What occurred on November 25th Mr. Carr that relates to the matters which were now discussed?

19:58.040 --> 20:06.040
Well, on November 25th Mr. Adams and I missed our plane connection from Newark to Washington.

20:06.040 --> 20:09.040
Those are the holiday traffic I believe.

20:09.040 --> 20:15.040
And we took a train from the Newark depot to Washington.

20:15.040 --> 20:23.040
Now, I would like to clear up at this point one part of Mr. Adams' testimony.

20:23.040 --> 20:35.040
He is implied that perhaps the entire train trip was consumed. The time of the train trip was consumed with a conversation about Dave Shine.

20:35.040 --> 20:41.040
I say that isn't so. I can recall several things we talked about on that train trip.

20:41.040 --> 20:48.040
We talked about General War. We talked about the Fourth Momut investigation.

20:48.040 --> 20:57.040
We talked about Mr. Adams' background. I recall and tell him about his early use in the West.

20:57.040 --> 21:04.040
We talked about my background. We talked about the FBI. We talked about Mr. Adams' baby.

21:04.040 --> 21:08.040
He was given him trouble at night. We talked about my three children.

21:08.040 --> 21:14.040
We talked about a press agent who was hired by the Pentagon. We talked about several things.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.040
We talked about Shine also.

21:17.040 --> 21:25.040
Was he suggesting lead on that train trip with weapons to the nation of the Fourth Momut appearance?

21:25.040 --> 21:32.040
Yes, yes there was. I believe and I am such a correction of this, but I believe I'm right.

21:32.040 --> 21:38.040
This period of time, November 24th and November 25th.

21:38.040 --> 21:49.040
These were the first open hearings on the Fourth Momut situation. They were held in New York.

21:49.040 --> 21:56.040
Now Mr. Adams, and I don't say that there's anything wrong in his warning to stop the hearing.

21:56.040 --> 22:04.040
Mr. Adams on the train ride suggested that since we had held numerous executive sessions on Fourth Momut,

22:04.040 --> 22:09.040
and since we had now held one or two public hearings on Fourth Momut,

22:09.040 --> 22:17.040
it would be a good time to drop the hearing. The Army now was ready to handle the Army with handle the situation.

22:17.040 --> 22:23.040
That was the substance of the conversation concerning termination of the hearing.

22:24.040 --> 22:28.040
Do you know what's the other shine circuit key?

22:28.040 --> 22:34.040
Yes sir, but I think it would relate better to follows in sequence.

22:34.040 --> 22:39.040
The conversation we had concerning General Law and Pilot Fuser.

22:39.040 --> 22:45.040
There were all the other circuit key. There's been a considerable tension.

22:45.040 --> 22:52.040
I don't mean to interrupt you, but on this train ride I think it's important that I discuss some of the subjects of the train.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.040
I think Mr. Adams has made it to a real point.

22:57.040 --> 23:12.040
I'd like to say that on this train ride Mr. Adams has me, for my opinion, of what Senator McCarthy's real reaction would be to the removal of General Law from his post-The Fourth Momut.

23:13.040 --> 23:22.040
Mr. Adams said that he thought that perhaps I would be able to get from a real insight into what the Senator would actually do.

23:22.040 --> 23:32.040
I recall coming him that the Senator would probably take the position, that he couldn't do anything about the proposed removal if it were done.

23:32.040 --> 23:40.040
However, I knew that Senator McCarthy would not sit back and not make some statements concerning this.

23:40.040 --> 24:00.040
The word I used was glass because of the removal of a man who had throughout the investigation shown that he was anxious to help the subcommittee and a man who had a reputation for wanting to get rid of Communist of what the Momut.

24:00.040 --> 24:09.040
Also on the train ride, well I think I mentioned the fact we talked about a Pentagon press agent.

24:10.040 --> 24:21.040
Following this conversation about General Law, Mr. Adams turned into private shine.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.040
Turned into the conversation to private shine.

24:24.040 --> 24:51.040
The substance of his conversation on that matter was that since the Senator and Mr. Cohn were feeling the way they did about General Lawton and the Army would undoubtedly not take any stand at that moment on General Lawton because of Senator McCarthy's expected attitude,

24:51.040 --> 25:06.040
it might be a good thing if they could be a little nicer to him and he could be a little nicer to private shine.

25:06.040 --> 25:12.040
Now, what he meant about being a little nicer, I can only guess.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.040
How did you prove true?

25:14.040 --> 25:18.040
Well, I thought that he was still in a little pocket.

25:19.040 --> 25:29.040
Would he often have, shall we say, got a tent that had a tea place in the form of small favors?

25:29.040 --> 25:37.040
I frankly thought that this was an instance of dangling favors concerning shine.

25:37.040 --> 25:45.040
Now, have you stated the substance of your conversation with Mr. Adams?

25:45.040 --> 25:47.040
I'll move in the twenty-fatt.

25:47.040 --> 25:53.040
Yes, with the exception of one thing that I overlook.

25:53.040 --> 26:00.040
And that is concerning on the conversation about General Lawton.

26:00.040 --> 26:11.040
Mr. Adams made it very clear to me that he thought and had thought for some time that General Lawton had made a big mistake.

26:12.040 --> 26:16.040
He said that General Lawton was warning all over Senator McCarthy.

26:16.040 --> 26:23.040
He said that he acts like Senator McCarthy is more important than the Army.

26:23.040 --> 26:27.040
He said that this was embarrassing to the Army, it was embarrassing to Mr. Stevens.

26:27.040 --> 26:37.040
He said that Senator that the General had been attending the executive sessions on the moment in New York.

26:38.040 --> 26:49.040
And that looked right for the General to be tripsing into the executive sessions behind the Senator and more or less rubber stamping everything that Senator did or said.

26:49.040 --> 26:55.040
He said this was embarrassing to the Army, and that Lawton seemed to forget who he was working for.

26:55.040 --> 27:02.040
Did you report that conversation that you just related concerning General Lawton to Senator McCarthy?

27:02.040 --> 27:04.040
Yes, I did.

27:05.040 --> 27:16.040
Now in 1880, have you stated the subject in certain over in the twenty-five train run in so far it relates to your charges?

27:16.040 --> 27:19.040
Yes, sir, I think I have.

27:19.040 --> 27:22.040
Before Mr. Prud moves on to the next subject, Mr. Constitucer, I turn to Lawton.

27:22.040 --> 27:29.040
The Duma television network is bringing to you through its facilities the Army McCarthy Subcommittee hearings.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.040
We pause now for station identification.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.040
This is the Duma television network.

27:37.040 --> 27:42.040
WABD, channel five, serving the office in public affairs.

27:42.040 --> 27:45.040
Law of charge, head of the...

27:45.040 --> 27:50.040
The Washington, I'll ask you first of course if you will press.

27:51.040 --> 28:04.040
On the occasion when it's been testified to here that Mr. Adams grew up in the middle of the United States in the 90s and 90s.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.040
Mr. Prud is now in the manual.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.040
Yes, ma'am.

28:07.040 --> 28:15.040
Following the hearing on that day, Mr. Adams, Mr. Conan, I walked down the corridor.

28:16.040 --> 28:22.040
Mr. Conan and Mr. Adams were, I would say, close together I was more to the side.

28:22.040 --> 28:28.040
I noticed that Mr. Adams had a piece of paper in his hand and that he appeared to be drawing on it.

28:28.040 --> 28:34.040
I came over to them.

28:34.040 --> 28:43.040
The paper seemed to be one of these pad, Mr. Pseys, and Mr. Adams had...

28:43.040 --> 28:49.040
Well, somebody had sketched a rough outline of the United States on the paper.

28:49.040 --> 28:54.040
Mr. Adams had a pencil and was separating it into rectangles.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.040
There's been testimony.

28:56.040 --> 28:59.040
I believe the number was nine, but I'm not sure.

28:59.040 --> 29:05.040
I know he had it broken into rectangular questions.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.040
I asked Mr. Conan what was going on.

29:11.040 --> 29:22.040
He smiled and said, John's trying to treat us from homosexuals and the F was for information about our next investigation.

29:22.040 --> 29:26.040
As I recall, I just laughed and walked down the hall.

29:26.040 --> 29:29.040
I didn't stay with them at that point.

29:29.040 --> 29:35.040
Although you might say that I was still with them, I walked a little bit ahead until the side of them.

29:35.040 --> 29:38.040
They were engaged in other conferences.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.040
Well, you merely heard Mr. Colme make that statement.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.040
That's correct.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.040
That's correct.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.040
You've read no statement made by Mr. Adams.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.040
I know states made by Mr. Adams.

29:48.040 --> 29:52.040
Mr. Adams neither abum on the night of that fat time.

29:52.040 --> 29:57.040
I didn't stay long enough till, uh, no other he did or didn't.

29:57.040 --> 30:03.040
He remained silent in your presence when Mr. Colme made the statement to you that you just related.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.040
Yes, sir.

30:04.040 --> 30:09.040
It was a matter of a few seconds when he told me that I moved on.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
I wasn't particularly interested.

30:11.040 --> 30:16.040
There would be a few people with the stadiums after this so-called map history.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.040
Yes, sir.

30:17.040 --> 30:29.040
When we, Mr. Colme and Mr. Adams and I all arrived at the subcommittee office of the town of Room 101 in this building at the same time.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.040
Well, for some reason, I'm Professor Telephone Call.

30:31.040 --> 30:40.040
Mr. Colme went ahead and Mr. Adams and I were standing in the corridor outside of Room 101.

30:40.040 --> 30:50.040
We were discussing the, uh, hearings that I think our encolomans have been witnessed that morning of the day before.

30:50.040 --> 31:05.040
Mr. Adams said that it would be possible to hold public hearings with all the witnesses that we had in executive sessions on the secret laboratories at Fort Moments.

31:05.040 --> 31:18.040
He said that since we now had, uh, had had in the public session the principal, uh,

31:18.040 --> 31:27.040
so he said, uh, communist at Fort Moments, the best subject, uh, it would now be a good note to end the hearings on.

31:27.040 --> 31:31.040
This was the same general approach that he'd used before.

31:31.040 --> 31:38.040
I told him that, uh, I thought maybe he'd better say, uh, some of the McCarthy about the ending the hearing.

31:38.040 --> 31:45.040
Uh, then the conversation, uh, drifted to, uh, some of the subject, uh, what it was, I don't know.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.040
Uh, that, uh, that.
