00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I have these interruptions, but they're not taken out of your argument.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
They're just fine to worry about it. If you yield, they are taken out of your mind.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
I didn't yield. It was under Couseria. I know he'll be rather uncomfortable.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
The private worker was not taken out of your tent.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
I know he may be rather uncomfortable, very distressed.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
I know it was a problem because of my life, just for the sake of my life.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
You have any points to make you worry about what you're thinking and not about how I feel.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
That's like another one of my assignments.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Well, it was an interruption which was inappropriate because it did not adjust itself to the chair.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
The chair has been reminding him of some time that the proper way it could adjust the chair.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
So we'll just forget that.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Forget it. We'll not take it out of your time.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Never be happy. So I have to send him a mic.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
What's the chairman of the startup plan?

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
The head secretary of the company, Mr. Simon, who is talking about getting in touch with the worker.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
He is talking about getting in touch with Mr. Clipper in regard to the calling of workers.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
The only reason the worker was being called was to give us information about who promote it,

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
who want our ability discharge, who gave special assignments to a fifth amendment coming.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
Now, we find that there is nothing beyond the statement that will get in touch with Mr. Clipper,

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
which means of course, I think to the average individual that Mr. Simon had discussed

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
with Clipper with Mr. Steven before.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
But when I'm before we don't know, we know that someone calls the chair and says,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
now I'll talk to Mr. Clipper and you say, Clipper, who or Clipper's what?

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
It wasn't done here.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
Clipper is incidentally a fact Clipper, who is the chief political advisor of President Truman.

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
At the time, we were most vigorously fighting my attempts to expose communists and last administration.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
We now find that Mr. Simon can, and I can't say whether he's running for the presidency or not,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
many papers say he is.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
We find that that's no reflection upon him.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
That's a right of any American.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
We find that Mr. Clipper is also the advisor of Mr. Simon and without the knowledge of this committee,

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
the advisor of the Republican Secretary of the Army.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
That makes it very important, Mr. Chairman, that we have him here.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
But I would like to have him here for additional reasons.

02:51.000 --> 03:02.000
I would like to rate from some of the experts Mr. Simon from the Watergate phone call from page 5299.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
One of his findings is that, therefore, everybody in my opinion, maybe I should start to be an incentive scientist.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
There's no question of politics at all.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
There's no question of the integrity and fighting morale of the Army.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
And I call the chair of the Central Lids and we're for everybody in my opinion,

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
where the concept of what is decent will break their back to help you in any way they can.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
I don't suggest Mr. Simon's approach is back yet.

03:33.000 --> 03:46.000
Going on to the next statement we find Mr. Chairman and Pair.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Pair 53 or 5.

03:51.000 --> 03:59.000
This should be taken with the Chairman and the Commission with the monitor calls of Mr. Pair,

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Prime Mr. Stevens, his article that he was perfectly willing to come down.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
Then, here's the committee, the evidence we needed.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
The very call, the monitor calls from this morning, I believe it was Mr. McCullough.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
I also showed that Mr. Stevens was completely willing to come down and give the evidence we needed.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
That is about communist infiltration, about both members of the loyalty board,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
to a queer communist to go back to the radar laboratory.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
We must take that as an action of this, say 53 or 5 again by Senator Simonton.

04:38.000 --> 04:47.000
And this was after Senator Simonton had complained that there was a story and a Washington paper

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
that Mr. Stevens had agreed to come before the committee.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
And again, keep in mind Mr. Chairman that all except one of the calls were originated by

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Senator Simonton, not by Mr. Stevens.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
He says this.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
I ask very well that Mr. Stevens might come down and testify before our committee, give us information.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
Once we are all agreed that we must have, he says if you and I are going to work together,

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
we have got to be on the table with each other.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
So far, her told me he got it out of the Pentagon.

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
Now, so far, her got to the story apparently that Steven and Mike come down and testify.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
So we find in Stunnington calling, saying let's keep it from the table, you can't testify,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I don't even know.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
Further in the page, Mr. Chairman, we have a very interesting statement by the very chairman

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
of St. Christian Missouri.

05:51.000 --> 06:01.000
He says if you are going to play with McCartley, you'll have to forget about any of these marquee of Queen's Berry rules.

06:01.000 --> 06:09.000
Now, as a chairman of the marquee of Queen's Berry rules, I'd rule for fair fighting.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
So, it provides that you must not hit the low of the belt.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
You must not cheat. You must not lie. You must not lie.

06:20.000 --> 06:32.000
So we have the St. Christian Missouri, who is advising with the political advisor for the Democratic Party thing

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
to the Secretary of the Army.

06:35.000 --> 06:47.000
If you are going to work with McCartley, you must not play with McCartley, you must not forget about any of these marquee of Queen's Berry rules.

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
I might say a nice connection with Mr. Chairman. The St. Christian Missouri certainly is following that advice.

06:55.000 --> 07:05.000
He has finally advised Republicans, and there's no question about this, but the sort of a phrase.

07:05.000 --> 07:16.000
And page 2948, May 14th, the Adviathan Research Center, some Reduction Indicators, give some information.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
The regard to early change was called the only plan for understanding from where planning is.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
Mr. Chairman, this is getting so interesting that I wish I had an unlike committee at this time,

07:29.000 --> 07:38.000
but I'd like to say that it is much to some direction that only I'd like to expect, has been a great plan and forthright was expected in his position.

07:39.000 --> 07:51.000
And the problem involved with me thought about it, I think it only fair that the other members of this subcommittee who were interrogated or questioned or visited, or whatever he might call it,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Mr. Adams, also give their side of the position.

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
So you have the opportunity from Missouri, who is advising the Republican Association to understand and testify,

08:03.000 --> 08:15.000
what they did in that way, and by avoiding the rule of fair fighting is that he is not born with the same rule.

08:15.000 --> 08:30.000
Now I say that connection, the center from Missouri according to the times of March 21, 1954 at this time,

08:30.000 --> 08:38.000
I think that some bearing of those that fit and have been advised in the session are not to provide for the rule of fair fighting,

08:38.000 --> 08:46.000
so any time I'd invite Mr. Chairman, I'm making a point here, I think a personal privilege.

08:46.000 --> 08:58.000
I am sitting here as the individual with a child, and I am finally to the members of my staff for a child to come to such a zoo,

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
as it does not result in the loss of their reputation that now I would like to make this point,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
a personal privilege there is to do with throwing with the zoo,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
it has to do with...

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
I'd like to say goodbye to your child's figures in a Roger County,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
because you can get it over now if you have any financial pressure on the zoo,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
and take you by the perfect Christmas period, you have to share a rule,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
if you have a one-time civic honor for the Germanists,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
that's a matter of how it is, how state-tabled, quite a bit of a personal privilege.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
This is my fingers, the one-of-person privilege that I am now discussing with the committee.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
The situation in which I personally find myself,

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
in which I finally do young man with two top man on my staff,

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
with one of the judges, the individual who has been forget of the judges,

09:52.000 --> 10:01.000
who has gotten the top counsel of the Democratic Party to pull strings from behind the scenes,

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
and I would like to, if I may, proceed to this in front of the logic order

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
and give the complete picture of why I feel so strongly about this and why I feel

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
that Mr. Chilpe is the peanut-fourth wit and why other actions should be taken.

10:17.000 --> 10:25.000
Mr. Samington, have you ever liked to say a response to a group of him?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I have, he had come to me, started from Missouri,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
and after hearing he states he'll find a personal privilege,

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
he's not going to recognize the kind of privilege on a final personal privilege.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I certainly think the chair is true, I don't know, sort of, was very...

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I was standing in the chair, I can't recognize him, I can't.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I finally saw a hear from Mr. Chairman of the New York Times,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
and I said before not exactly my favorite subject.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
I was right from 1954, right over the time,

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
and there was a question of the fact that President McCarthy would fly in the hearing

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
of a charge against my staff, of a closely-storing,

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
Senator Samington issued a statement holding that post the good name of the Sun for the State.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
The post I feel confident he declared that some of them are badly,

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
does not want to appear in a triple role of accusing witnesses

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
of what a prosecutor in judge.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
And therefore I anticipate that he will step off the subject committee

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
and have another Republican member of the former government operations committee

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
serve in his place, and certainly with confidence that a less-this was done.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Demonstration members have put the express to the parent committee

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
with some of the party also heads.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
If the public in the insert and he's filing the triple role he declared,

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I mean, filling the triple role he declared,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
he will recommend the investigation you undertaken

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
to the Armed Services Committee,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
then one of their former designing companies,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
the member of that committee also,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
and one of their three comments on the same tape of the next day,

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
some of their former signings and Democrats of Missouri,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
as asked him whether McCarthy not be allowed to sit with the sub-comifix.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Now, the table recalls from his signings and took his song for this,

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
and also that I should not have been right to examine witnesses.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
He said that would not be fair because he felt that Mr. Stevens was not as good a lawyer as I was.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
That was publicizing all the papers.

12:35.000 --> 12:46.000
Now, Mr. Carolyn, when we find that the soldier from Missouri is urging the Secretary of the Army

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
after the Secretary has told 200,

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
but he said that he still appears and gives us too many information.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Erging a number one not to appear and a number two,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
urging him not to fight fair,

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
I just wonder if he feels he has qualified to sit as a member of this committee.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
I might say a nice connection, I'm not sure,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
and very wisely so I may just say something.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
He felt that from the accuser should not also sit as judge,

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
but let's go to the further as we may miss the cannon.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Again, on page 53 or 6,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
and again, this is a call made by Mr. Framington to Secretary Stevens.

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
Again, after the pair of Secretary Stevens might come to testify,

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
because Framington says this, the only thing I want to do is this.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
Don't put me in a box by going up there to his day.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
I would not go and I'll listen to this significant something.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
We can throw the block in this thing.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Mr. Framington, following the Secretary,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
saying don't look there,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
folks we can throw the block in this thing.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Then I was curious to know how he felt to get through the block in this thing.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
You reach further and you find out,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
but with the Framington head in mind,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
and page 53 or 6,

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
he says here are the rules we call truth,

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
and the terrible remember that we all lean over backwards

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
to what the number of facts had asked any rules of their self.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
They needed...

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
...to help that a one-party committee was in,

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
why is he just here as a rule we call truth.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
At that time, when I confronted their driving through those rules,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I thought they were coming back to help us by communist,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
not to put through the blocks in this thing.

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
And this thing was the attempt to get the numbers of the old human world he boarded before,

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
and find out why they sent communist back to the radar laboratories,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
coming as such as Coleman,

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
who was found and fits the serve by the new world he boarded for the last couple days.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
What was the method?

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Here's the statement from Framington.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
He says he can't sustain a year.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Here are the rules we draw truth.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
Here's the three democrat members of the committee.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Are unanimous in opposing a hearing.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Then the hearing will not be held,

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
unless the majority of the poor committee agrees to it.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Another significant problem.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Now I think, Framington's thinking,

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
now I think I've got it still that a majority of the poor committee will not agree to it.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.000
Now how some of his signings didn't talk he had gotten the poor committee to agree to call off

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
the hearing of communism, I don't know.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I'm curious to hear him understand on that.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
I don't think that he has succeeded in getting any Republican to agree with him on that.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
If so, I would like to hear a vote.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Point of order Mr. Chairman.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Point of order.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Can I just finish with the chairman?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Yes, just a bit of time.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I am a hearing by that.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
My colleague has been paying me all these races.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
And I would just ask him if he would,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
to read the whole paragraph for that part.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I'll be glad to.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
In order that, what phrase would you like to say?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Senator at the bottom of page 506,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
you say, now I think I've got it.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
So that the majority of the poor committee will not agree to it.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Let me just read this now.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
However, I just asked you not to make me look silly.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
If you decide to go off before I get a vote.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
That is one other.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
I just heard it at the beginning, Mr. Ponyman.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
He can't prevent us from going off.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Sure.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Now let's get this straight.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Further signings.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
He can't subpoena you.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Here are the rules we drove through.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
If the three Democratic members of the committee are unanimous in opposing a hearing,

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
then the hearing will not be held unless a majority of the poor committee agrees to it.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Are you read the next line?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
What I'm asking you is, I said however,

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I just asked you not to make me look silly.

17:29.000 --> 17:37.000
The point being that we wanted to wait until we all are gone for that.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
I'm so glad I faced all the charges and the worker testimony as he gave it to me.

17:42.000 --> 17:49.000
And I say, if you decide to go up before I get back, that is 100% with me.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
I will talk to them and tell them about it if it might make me look silly.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Senator Secretary of the Army, I'm not going to do that.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm not going to put you in any part.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
The only thing is, I don't want him to unload or unload on me while I am gone.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
The air is a little powerful because they're looking at me.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Let me...

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
One reason I read again is that you're no person about this thing taking out a convict.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
I read a cancel of 10 a year that the planning can start talking to Steven

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
after the coup that Steven would come down and testify.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
I namely give us a truth, the truth is we're entitled to.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
If he can't defend you, that is an implied evidence.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I mean, correct, we can't defend him.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
But what I get at here, he says, here are the rules we drove to.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
It's a three-democratic number of the committee.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Our unanimous and opposing hearing.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
Then the hearing will not be held unless the majority of the full committee is addressed to it.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
Now, I think I've got it so that the majority of the full committee will not adhere to it.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
Now, that's something I want to first and Mr. Sammington about on the rules.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Currently, he's fortunate that Senator Sammington wants me to read.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
He says, however, I just ask you not to make me look silly.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
That makes me look silly. He means to come down and testify.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
Now, how does it make the Senator's Missouri look silly?

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
Is the Republican Secretary of the Army came down and told us about Mr. Cal,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Mr. Boy, what's the issue with him?

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
I mean, it's making my face a deep sense of buying.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
And when he makes his face in that car, so I think I can make the point of order and plow by him.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Okay, good.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Now, the Secretary of the Army came in to see me and he was desperate about the situation with respect.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
The General's record.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
He knew that the next day I was going abroad.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
I wanted to see this matter deferred until I got back.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
And therefore, I said, after I read in the paper the next day, that he had asked to appear

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
when it was my understanding that he would ask no people from the Army of fear until I got back.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
I said, don't make me look silly because it seemed to me that what he wanted to do was to wait until I got back.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
I noticed that both Senator Dirkson and I, according to some of the testimony here,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
were anxious to have the hearings deferred.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
But if you have no certainty in I was, anxious to have the hearings deferred,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
only until I returned.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
And then I was very glad that the hearings should continue.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
I know, Senator McCartney, my dear, Mr. Chair, it's just a concept.

20:41.000 --> 20:49.000
Unfortunately, at the hour of the recess, the Chair has received the Sunday sign until he was recognized

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
in my new point of personal privilege.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
And you are presenting every request to the Chair concerning the convening,

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
so that the Chair would recommend that you limit yourself now on your final personal privilege

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
to the minimum amount that you think is justified, or to your standpoint.

21:07.000 --> 21:16.000
Mr. Chairman, I think this is the most important matter I think to come before the Committee in the 20th, 27th, 28th days since we started.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
I have to visit from taking any time all day, except the military there.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
And I will try and cut this down, but I do think this is the most important.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
And I would like a decision from the Chair and certain matters before we get through.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
As I started to say, Senator Simon can ask me to read,

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
how over I just asked you not to make me look silly,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
by making you look silly as he means that it seems as if he's coming testify,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
I have to make you look silly, I don't know.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
He goes on to say, if you decide that you're up before I get back,

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
that is 100% with me, and I will talk to Mr. Solomon about it,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
if it makes me look silly.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
The Secretary then makes the promise he will not come up,

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
because I'm not going to do that.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm not going to put you in a box, the Army can first do this,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
he has a hope on him, so I'm losing me, I'm going to go.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Mr. Chairman, the Secretary can wrote me,

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
for me he won't be present from Stephen Saptapai,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
and an accordion of the usual rule of the Committee, I agree,

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
to follow up the hearings and to get back,

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
but that time, the current play is a priority with the footwork,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
in order to progress to the point where we never did get back to the hearing,

22:36.000 --> 22:43.000
but Mr. Chairman, here is the title of my thinkable significant quote.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
I'm going to say 53 UN, people lying again,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
some of their time they can just following the Secretary of the Army.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
And I think this proves what I have often said,

22:54.000 --> 23:01.000
namely, that Secretary Stephen's life, and he is a fine honest individual.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
The businessman came down here, not a call,

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
appointed with the rather rough and sometimes very dirty underhanded politics,

23:13.000 --> 23:20.000
but he was not the man who called on the hearings,

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
called off the exposure of conduct.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Mr. Femme can was asking him about their report on Mr. Cohn,

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Mr. Shine, he had to say 53 UN, 53 UN,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
if you follow the foot of the Army,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
he does, he has to say, Stephen,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
he says that personally,

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
I think that anything in that line with proof

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
is very much exaggerated.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
That would be my opinion.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
In other words, I think there is some talk around,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
that has been very much exaggerated,

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
for anything that is there,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
still quoting the Secretary.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
He says, I am the Secretary,

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
and I have had some talks with the Committee of the Chairman of the Council on,

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
and by and large, as far as the people of me is concerned,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
I have no personal complaint.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
In other words, when he got after his record court,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
then I'm holler.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
But as far as I personally am concerned,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I don't have a lot of stuff,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
so far as my contact with Joe,

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
or the Committee of Concerns, and the Court.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Now, with the Chairman,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
the enviolously passed,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
last we have approval here and beyond,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
and a third venture of adept.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
The Secretary, Stephen,

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
was willing to come up and pull off way to the Committee.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
When he said, for like 24 hours,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
roughly that before the charges were issued,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
but there was really nothing to the charges,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
and the Secretary's running them,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
with part clover,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
the Chief Political Advisor of the First Minister of Truman,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
and I assume the Chief Political Advisor

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
of the man who would be present

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
with the Democratic Party in 1956,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
is doing the adept thing,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
so it's fine that the Affiliated of the Next day

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
was the length of the letter,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
and it wasn't a matter of a day or two,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
the charges were issued,

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
issued under the Secretary's name,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
charging Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn myself,

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
with almost everything except murdering our great-great-grandmother.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
We're fine here, Lord,

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
when he's talking to Stephen,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
he says there's really nothing to it.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Now, for this reason,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Mr. Chairman, I have expressed that,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Mr. Cohn could be subdeated,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
immediately,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
so that we will know what far he played

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
in this more than his importance.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
One, which, too,

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
and view the fact that Mr. Cymington

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
was active in telling the Republicans,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
and I referred to page 2948,

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
that they should testify

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
if they knew anything.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
The Republicans did that,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
that Mr. Cymington should be subpoenaed,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
if he refuses to object,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
to honor that subpoenaed.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
He has been talking about taking matters

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
to the Senate floor,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
then I would suggest that we take this matter

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
to the Senate floor,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
and the Republicans will suggest it,

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
and see for there enough

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
the Senate will order him to give us a truth.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Now, that time, I will quote in detail,

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
all the statements made by Saint Desmonia Sturz.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
When he told,

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
when he told about how everything had to be laid on the table,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
and number three, Mr. Cymington.

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
Mr. Cymington should do exactly what I did.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
He should disqualify himself,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
because never before in the history

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
of this son of his father, I know,

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
have we had the man who instigated the charges

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
in search of him setting his judge?

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Now, in closing, Mr. Cymington,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
there are those who suggest

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
that I take this to the full committee,

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
and forceless Mr. Cymington off this committee.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I have the song we advise to do that,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
and then take it to the Senate floor.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
I have made no decision on that.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
My President is in creation, however,

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
it is that we should leave it up

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
to the senator,

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
who, when he's onward,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
will so active in calling on the hearing,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
who will so thank Cymonia Sturz and ask him

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
to remove myself from the committee

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
and not even cross examine,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
I can understand right now.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I think we should leave it up to him

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
to decide he's on conscience

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
so that he can honestly sit on this committee,

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
and, as a last word, Mr. Cymmon,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I think Mr. Cymington,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I think Mr. Cymington,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
you should explain to the committee

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
why, when you sat in those executive sessions,

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
you did not tell us

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
that you were the man

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
who was calling Bob Cymons day after day,

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
and telling Bob Cymons we can block this thing,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I've got the committee fixed,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
and I've told Bob Cymons

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
before that committee.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I think that's something we're entitled to,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
and I think Mr. Cymington,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
we're entitled to it not

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
for you to sit behind the table.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
I think we're entitled to that on the witness stand,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
and I think tonight,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I think tonight, with him,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
the next one minute,

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
you should tell the American people

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
whether you are willing to raise your right hand,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
as I and the other Republicans have done,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
and take the witness stand,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and be cross-examined,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
as we have been cross-examined,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
or whether your statement's there

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
after day that you wanted to be,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
all the facts brought out,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
but the chips fall where they may,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
that we were satisfied

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
with some of the chips where they're hit by him.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Sharon is silent,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
and Sunday's silent,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
and he wants to be recognized

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
and to find a personal privilege,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
and he will still recognize him

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
as this time's indecency.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
There was some poised thought out by the

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
junior senator from Wisconsin.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
First,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
faced on some of the statements he made,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
some of which were incorrect.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I think it should be proper to put into the record

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
that Mr. Clifford left the government

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
and became a private attorney,

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
and I believe January 1950,

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
over four years ago.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
And, Mr. Chairman,

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
the distinguished junior senator from Wisconsin,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
made some remark about

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
Mark Wiss of Queenbury rules,

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
implying that I was suggesting

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
the Secretary's statement,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
that he should not use rules

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
that were decent and right and fair,

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
as I remember his statement.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Nothing could have been further from my mind.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
My suggestion to Secretary Steve was

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
that he better look out,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
because if he got in the scrap,

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
he might find that the junior senator from Wisconsin

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
would not use rules which were decent and right or fair.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And I just ask,

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
on things that I have seen as a member of this committee,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
and also,

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
on the caretaker of 1952 in Missouri,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
I had no idea

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
when this Republican cabinet member came to me,

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
and asked for help because he told me of the Army's problem,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I had no idea

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
that we would be here today,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
nor did he,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
but the record stands,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
and I stand behind it.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
As I said before, my chief interest,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
based on what was said to me.
