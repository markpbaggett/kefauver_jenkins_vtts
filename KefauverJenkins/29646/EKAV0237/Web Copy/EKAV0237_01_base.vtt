WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.100
I have a question mark.

00:01.100 --> 00:03.060
I have a couple minutes to go and answer the up to you.

00:03.060 --> 00:04.540
Chairman, I'm sure she is.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.880
I want to Mr. Manier if we can do the same with this car

00:08.880 --> 00:09.780
as the business.

00:09.780 --> 00:10.480
Mr. Stunned this car.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.340
We have no objection.

00:11.340 --> 00:12.180
No, I'm just a question.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.340
Clearly, next to Mr. Manier.

00:13.340 --> 00:13.840
All right.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.520
Send it a month.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.920
They want to go right in and start reading it

00:15.920 --> 00:18.020
without it even being here, I don't care.

00:18.020 --> 00:19.020
Mr. Stunned this car.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.180
What about you?

00:20.180 --> 00:22.360
That would be all right, except I will probably

00:22.360 --> 00:24.460
have one or two questions to ask this, man.

00:24.460 --> 00:25.420
Oh, it's on the way out.

00:25.420 --> 00:28.120
I hear you answer.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.720
Oh, by the way, Mr. Chairman, I did want to ask a question

00:31.720 --> 00:33.320
or two of Mr. Lucas, man.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.520
And, man, you can do that.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.200
We'll work our way through the time when it's very

00:36.200 --> 00:39.760
as I was having the car to you and Mr. Lucas is here.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.000
And you can ask him those questions now.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Thank you, sir.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.800
Look against me.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.200
Sir, I'm going to ask my ass.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.600
Mr. Lucas, are you, uh, Mr. Lucas?

00:49.600 --> 00:52.600
Yes, sir.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.400
Yes.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.840
When you get by a microphone Mr. Lucas,

00:54.840 --> 00:56.120
you will be left with a committee table,

00:56.120 --> 00:57.680
be all right.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.320
And, uh, and, uh, a concaptious question number.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.080
Oh, this is me.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.160
I'm going to take the list of staff.

01:04.160 --> 01:04.760
Yes, sir.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.480
Who is it?

01:07.480 --> 01:09.080
Oh, well, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Wellstoff,

01:09.080 --> 01:10.080
I mean, this plan is left.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.280
I did want to ask her a few questions to establish that.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.880
She does not want to have to Mr. Adams

01:14.880 --> 01:16.040
and the regular court of business,

01:16.040 --> 01:18.560
that this was a special little job done,

01:18.560 --> 01:21.480
after the blow up on the 24th of February.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.760
Do we have Mr. Johnson, come back, Mr. Lowe?

01:23.760 --> 01:25.040
Yes, Mr. Chairman, would you just

01:25.040 --> 01:26.880
be in the study of being saying you released her?

01:26.880 --> 01:29.280
I, uh, at least we had the conversation saying

01:29.280 --> 01:30.280
that I was needed.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.120
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't,

01:32.120 --> 01:33.520
I don't, I don't, I don't need to say anything.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.560
So, the officer said, I got the operation

01:35.560 --> 01:36.760
that so that all was through it.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.640
I never needed to have a goal.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.680
I wouldn't have had a goal if I had known there was a goal.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.720
So, maybe I don't even need a part set on a model.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.000
I was going to bring out some of his plans.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.080
He was, maybe Mr. Wellstoff,

01:45.080 --> 01:47.360
can see that that, uh, she does not want to

01:47.360 --> 01:50.600
let Mr. Adams call, no matter a regular court of business,

01:50.600 --> 01:53.440
that she only did a special monitoring job on Mr. Car

01:53.440 --> 01:56.280
here, so as to give Mr. Adams the opportunity

01:56.280 --> 01:57.920
to try to build a record for himself

01:57.920 --> 02:00.120
of self-serving declarations on his part.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.120
Well, if Mr. Dick, uh, Mr. Wellstoff,

02:02.120 --> 02:04.480
uh, Cornwood put it quite a lot differently from that.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.360
I, he might understand how I would or wouldn't agree to it.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.760
I, I'm willing to say that she was

02:08.760 --> 02:10.480
in his regular secretary.

02:10.480 --> 02:13.560
Uh, wait a moment, she is the secretary.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.120
But, uh, what kind of trust you want from me is that

02:16.120 --> 02:18.120
there isn't a fixed policy in that office

02:18.120 --> 02:21.000
of monitoring calls as there is in the secretary's office.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.200
That I will agree to.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.600
Uh, can you tell me whether or not there are any other instances

02:24.600 --> 02:26.840
of this crisis right when she did monitor calls?

02:26.840 --> 02:28.640
I cannot tell you either way on that, sir.

02:28.640 --> 02:29.480
I just don't know.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.680
If you'd rather have her up, you would certainly

02:31.680 --> 02:32.480
have her.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.480
That's all I wanted to establish.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.280
Mr. Wellstoff can get a written statement to that effect.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.640
What we wanted to establish, Mr. Chairman,

02:36.640 --> 02:41.280
is that it applies to the first and only little job of monitoring

02:41.280 --> 02:44.680
done in Mr. Adams office, and was it done after this lunch

02:44.680 --> 02:47.680
and then the third in office, uh, so the significant

02:47.680 --> 02:49.080
job will be quite quick.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.480
We will either produce third Mr. Corn,

02:51.480 --> 02:54.760
or a statement somewhere along the line to suggest

02:54.760 --> 02:55.960
that I statement his act.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.800
But now all I want to say is Mr. Wellstoff's just a channel

02:57.800 --> 02:58.800
with this.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.680
Mr. Wellstoff, you monitor the satellite 25th call

03:01.680 --> 03:04.200
between Mr. Adams and Mr. Car.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.000
Got that right, sir?

03:05.000 --> 03:05.840
That's right.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.000
Now, Mr. Adams, are you working, Mr. Adams?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yes, sir.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.280
Well, sir, that's not working, Mr. Wellstoff.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.200
Are you working the same floor with Mr. Adams?

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
No, sir.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.560
We're working, Mr. Davis, aren't you?

03:17.560 --> 03:18.240
That's right.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.760
I'd be working the monitor, Mr. Wellstoff.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.640
They call me Mr. Wellstoff, Mr. Wellstoff,

03:22.640 --> 03:25.560
and he was up in the office, and I have to look to the monitor

03:25.560 --> 03:27.600
to the call, which you may find out.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.960
And in other words, he was up in Mr. Davis office,

03:29.960 --> 03:32.760
where he's going to Mr. Car, and he has to run into the call.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.120
All right, that is right.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.960
Did you ever monitor any other phone call from the press?

03:36.960 --> 03:37.680
No, sir.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.800
So this one floor is the first floor.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.400
But the day after the blow-up is the third and only

03:43.400 --> 03:45.680
call, which you have ever monitored for Mr.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.480
John Adams.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.600
Mr. Kermann, I don't quite understand the word,

03:48.600 --> 03:50.880
but the blow-up, if you give a date, you will then

03:50.880 --> 03:53.760
state whether I'm talking about the fact

03:53.760 --> 03:55.560
that Mr. Chairman, the day following,

03:55.560 --> 03:57.360
the lunch and attendant kindness of Steven

03:57.360 --> 03:59.600
Glover here in the memorandum of agreement,

03:59.600 --> 04:03.600
and the day of his reaction to that memorandum

04:03.600 --> 04:06.120
of agreement, and his subsequent statement,

04:06.120 --> 04:07.560
that's where I'm referring to him.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.200
There was a day after the open, unquestion.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.560
You're asking the second, sir?

04:11.560 --> 04:12.600
Sir, I had a question.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.120
Sure, the question was this.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.400
Is it a fact that this was the first, the fifth monitor

04:16.400 --> 04:17.520
call?

04:17.520 --> 04:21.320
It's the first and only nine that you monitored a telephone call

04:21.320 --> 04:23.920
for Mr. John Adams.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.080
No, it's the other.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
I don't know for the first.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.720
It's the first and the other one.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.720
Pardon me, sir.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
I didn't get any.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
Sorry.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.520
Good news, Adam.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.720
It's not there.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.800
But it's all a purpose of making that call

04:35.800 --> 04:37.720
and having you monitored.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.320
I don't quite recall, sir, whether I don't think I

04:40.320 --> 04:42.120
would know whether that was the first or the first.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.520
That is the following, sir.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.840
Except that we had to be in the morning,

04:44.840 --> 04:47.440
after the following night.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.440
Yes, sir.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.040
You see, this is another important.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.560
So I know there are no calls monitored.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.200
With Mr. Carr until after the meeting

04:58.200 --> 05:01.760
that Mr. Stevens on the 24th, and I am curious,

05:01.760 --> 05:05.880
no, but are not, Mr. Adams, came up to that office.

05:05.880 --> 05:10.040
For the purpose of making that call and having you monitored,

05:10.040 --> 05:12.400
I think it tells that it would be possible.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.840
I don't know what fortunately came

05:13.840 --> 05:16.000
up before, but it would be right

05:16.000 --> 05:18.440
as good as I was there.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.840
How long would it be there?

05:19.840 --> 05:22.120
I don't recall.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.600
But many of them, you can help me set

05:23.600 --> 05:27.440
monitor this call between me and Mr. Carr.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.440
Yes, sir.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.440
Good.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.440
Thank you, sir.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.640
Mr. Chairman.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.440
Mr. Welp.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.320
I, by some hot call to our electronic power,

05:36.320 --> 05:39.400
Miss Clancy was stopped on her way down in the center

05:39.400 --> 05:40.080
of the corridor.

05:40.080 --> 05:40.600
Very good.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.240
I suggest that if you take a position,

05:42.240 --> 05:46.240
either with a table or a table, and the other way

05:46.240 --> 05:48.840
you help you, because you have a regular temperature,

05:48.840 --> 05:50.640
so you'll be with Mr. Carr on the chair.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.040
But in the front, I have a question to ask her.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.040
I'm Mr. Adams.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.840
As the modern leader of the cooking leaders,

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
may I ask you a question?

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
Yes, sir.

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
Come on.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.840
Mr. Clancy, you're back in the room now.

06:05.840 --> 06:06.840
I'm here.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.340
I'm here.

06:07.340 --> 06:07.840
Yeah, good.

06:07.840 --> 06:08.840
Fine.

06:08.840 --> 06:09.840
Very good.

06:09.840 --> 06:10.840
I'll have to ask you just one.

06:10.840 --> 06:11.840
I'll take your questions.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.720
You monitored some calls between Mr. Adams

06:14.720 --> 06:16.560
and whom you work in, Mr. Frank Carr,

06:16.560 --> 06:18.640
after the 20th of the subways, right?

06:18.640 --> 06:19.560
That's great.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.120
Now, did you have a monitor any calls between Mr. Adams

06:22.120 --> 06:25.360
and Mr. Carr before that?

06:25.360 --> 06:26.600
The further 25th of February?

06:26.600 --> 06:27.840
Yes, no, I did not.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.840
He did not.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.320
Now, is it a regular practice?

06:30.320 --> 06:34.840
And Mr. Adams office to have calls monitoring?

06:34.840 --> 06:35.640
It was not.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.640
It was not.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.080
Prior to that.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.120
When did Mr. Adams stop monitoring calls for the first time?

06:41.120 --> 06:43.400
The latter part of February or early March?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.040
In the latter part of February or in early March.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.640
Now, did he have all four monitors?

06:49.640 --> 06:51.400
Not all calls.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.600
What calls did he have monitored besides four of the Mr. Carr?

06:54.600 --> 06:56.120
Mr. Mothersley.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.120
Mr. Mothersley?

06:57.120 --> 06:58.120
No, great.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.080
I take with anyone else.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.640
I don't recall anyone else.

07:01.640 --> 07:06.440
Then he meant the picture is that prior to that February 24

07:06.440 --> 07:09.120
date, when the flood experience occurred

07:09.120 --> 07:11.920
in the State of England in the committee,

07:11.920 --> 07:13.960
at least the State of Minnesota was unpleasant.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.360
There was no monitoring.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.760
As far as Mr. Adams office was concerned.

07:17.760 --> 07:18.720
Next, please.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.480
And after that, there was monitoring.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.480
Great.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.600
Now, do you know if there was anything

07:25.600 --> 07:27.760
to stop Mr. Adams from telling Mr. Carr

07:27.760 --> 07:29.440
I've got this fancy on the phone?

07:29.440 --> 07:31.240
Take down this call.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.240
Mr. Mothersley.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.960
Well, the first time that I took this call,

07:33.960 --> 07:36.280
he didn't say he's here to record it.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.600
And I thought Mr. Carr, I'm good.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.440
Oh, he's really got a wiring for it or a tape

07:40.440 --> 07:41.440
or a gun.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.560
In that time, he didn't know there was some joking going back

07:43.560 --> 07:44.360
before.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.120
Yeah, in a way.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.560
But then they did wait for a while until I got to say

07:47.560 --> 07:48.560
anything.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
Because of what?

07:49.560 --> 07:51.040
You know the fact that we do not have a hearing

07:51.040 --> 07:52.600
for it or we would have a complaint.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.960
But I don't know if the problem is

07:53.960 --> 07:55.360
fancy anymore than the money.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.360
I'm trying to fix it.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.800
I'm just going to have to fix it for a while.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.160
This grant to you.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.080
In the course of monitoring calls,

08:04.080 --> 08:06.320
I presume you do want to change your hearing

08:06.320 --> 08:08.760
for a fan of the use over the phone.

08:08.760 --> 08:09.760
Yes.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.000
Do you recall that exactly?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.800
This comes over the line.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.960
I didn't use to make any ideas.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.400
This call to work itself, you know.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.400
Yes.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.800
Come, Mr. Carr.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.400
We're just saying that we're called

08:22.400 --> 08:24.840
that our incident-based horror

08:24.840 --> 08:26.240
set to us from the fun and dual

08:26.240 --> 08:29.000
around the propanity of life and creation.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.160
I don't know.

08:30.160 --> 08:30.960
So it's not far.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.880
Nothing beyond the watch you are

08:32.880 --> 08:34.960
ordinarily in touch with you.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.560
I'm a little bit scared out here.

08:36.560 --> 08:39.560
I can't believe that you can't go all the way.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.800
Nothing more.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.560
Look at that.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.560
Look at that.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.560
I've missed that.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.360
You are now dismissed then.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.600
How about the other lady?

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
200 years?

08:48.600 --> 08:50.600
I have no question.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.240
We'll also get to look at the stuff for them.

08:52.240 --> 08:52.600
Yes, sir.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
I'm on to it.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.600
Mr. Carr.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.600
Mr. Carr, I think I have two questions.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
I'm ready.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
Here.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.600
This way, this is not one I'm ready.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.080
Call the thing that's called that's the incident.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.160
Well, not that I don't know the status of news

09:08.160 --> 09:10.160
rather than our friends, they're calling.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.240
First, it's a call I believe is the reason for Adam.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.760
It had been such an hour of the amount of the call.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.560
The evidence was not any different.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.160
It was the amount of the incident we don't know.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.840
And I did monitor the tag end of a call.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.000
That's the telephone number.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
But which I can come.

09:26.000 --> 09:26.840
That's the case.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.840
Where is that?

09:27.840 --> 09:28.840
That's the way.

09:28.840 --> 09:29.840
Is there anything?

09:29.840 --> 09:31.040
I'll kill that.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.160
Have you ever noticed that?

09:33.160 --> 09:34.760
Somewhere I was.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.080
I've been not given enough of a first to call at all.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.720
And Adam was not the first case I was not at night at all.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.720
That's right.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.280
Well, I was on that then, if you were monitored any call

09:44.280 --> 09:46.160
between Mr. Carr and Mr. Adam.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.360
I have not.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.280
Well, now when you were monitored the first call

09:51.280 --> 09:53.720
of the clean minister, Adam and Mr. Carr,

09:53.720 --> 09:55.920
if you'd always testified about it.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.960
There's no doubt in your mind, but that Mr. Carr

09:57.960 --> 09:59.560
knew the call of being monitored.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.280
You'd have been a senior by you, wasn't it?

10:02.280 --> 10:03.560
Then the call must come.

10:03.560 --> 10:04.320
Mr. Carr.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.120
Mr. Carr, I thought of you as a being monarchy.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.640
That's right.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.440
Just a little bit more important than everything.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.840
I'm a critic.

10:11.840 --> 10:16.840
And I don't like just monitoring practice,

10:16.840 --> 10:18.440
and I don't think very clear that Mr. Carr

10:18.440 --> 10:23.000
can't complain the Compton Secretary

10:23.000 --> 10:24.640
for doing what they're about to do

10:24.640 --> 10:27.280
so that there's no blame on you.

10:27.280 --> 10:32.840
But that's the only conversation with Mr. Carr.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.320
I'm Mr. Adam's cad, despite indicate.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.600
Either of them know about monitoring

10:38.600 --> 10:40.960
that from one side, have you got your machine on?

10:40.960 --> 10:43.480
The other one said, no, have you got your son on?

10:43.480 --> 10:48.120
Mr. Fuzon, they're getting back and forth.

10:48.120 --> 10:51.360
Beyond that, there was never any conversation

10:51.360 --> 10:53.480
of any kind that an indicator for the crime

10:53.480 --> 10:56.440
was they used phone call for being monitored.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.960
Who doesn't come?

10:57.960 --> 11:06.280
And as far as you know, Mr. Carr,

11:06.280 --> 11:09.080
we've had Mr. Adam's phone with the car.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.520
And they've tried other conversations

11:10.520 --> 11:14.240
with Adam, with Frank.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.640
But there's nothing to indicate to Frank Carr

11:16.640 --> 11:19.360
that there was a monitoring from before and most things.

11:22.360 --> 11:22.880
I think so.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.360
Just one other question.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.120
Mr. Sinclair asked you whether or not

11:26.120 --> 11:31.560
you had monitored any calls between Mr. Adam's

11:31.560 --> 11:35.320
with the phone.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.240
There were a word that was called with the Mr.

11:37.240 --> 11:42.400
phone and Mr. Adam's answer to the point that's for that.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
That's right.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.920
I don't recall.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.920
I mean, right.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.520
Well, you could not have monitored it.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.520
I don't recall.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.360
That's all.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.560
Thank you very much.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.560
Thank you.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.360
I mean, I was there with the judge.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.680
People engaged in monitoring.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.360
You could go back to their office and be dismissed

11:58.360 --> 11:59.800
with the phone.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.360
They didn't remember his family phone.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.360
Mr. Chairman.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.360
Mr. President, my name is Mr. Baker.

12:06.360 --> 12:10.120
But that goes to my note on the conversation

12:10.120 --> 12:12.960
of Mark Feth, in 1964.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.560
I'd like that to list the situation

12:14.560 --> 12:16.440
of the fact that that conversation

12:16.440 --> 12:19.360
evidence is far knew, the telephone conversation

12:19.360 --> 12:20.160
is a model.

12:24.360 --> 12:31.360
I think it's not a political picture of the person's family

12:31.360 --> 12:32.360
of the evidence.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.360
I don't think this plan takes a big doubt

12:34.360 --> 12:36.360
upon the fact that I'm telling that event.

12:36.360 --> 12:39.360
I would like to read a question that you may need.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.360
Mr. Chairman.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.360
You're following this plan.

12:42.360 --> 12:47.360
It's been case that I don't do a problem.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.360
Mr. Adam, are you recording this conversation?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.360
Mr. Car.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.360
There's most of us both doing this.

12:53.360 --> 12:56.360
Cut, save the footage.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.360
Now that's all you've got.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.360
Mr. Car, continue.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.360
You cut off yours and then I cut off

13:02.360 --> 13:04.360
and when we have run the conversation,

13:04.360 --> 13:07.360
that isn't understandable.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.360
Then I'd leave that to the front door of the page

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
to monitor.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
Is that right?

13:11.360 --> 13:13.360
I've read it properly in seconds.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.360
That's not so far.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.360
That's all Mr. Denver.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.360
For the first time, we were dismissing the two people

13:23.360 --> 13:24.360
and getting this in the monitoring.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.360
Then I didn't make a back to you after.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.360
Unless someone has another question.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.360
And Mr. Mem, you can be conscious.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.360
You saw Mr. Cephanone about to get in truth to hold truth

13:32.360 --> 13:34.360
and nothing much of truth to help to judge.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.360
And then he said,

13:35.360 --> 13:37.360
I must let you tell you that I'm a way

13:37.360 --> 13:39.360
to go and write a good, very good, very good.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.360
You know, it's still a day of experience.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.360
You've got to register the monitors.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.360
Oh, very well.

13:46.360 --> 13:51.360
And many of you are supposed to get this monitor

13:51.360 --> 13:54.360
to call in the record in the appropriate style.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.360
When you say your name, please.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.360
Five to three minutes.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.360
But as many of you have said, five to four.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.360
Yes, I know.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.360
You have to put a copy of the monitor call

14:04.360 --> 14:06.360
about what you have just five.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
Not that I did not.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.360
I wouldn't mention that we're in together

14:09.360 --> 14:12.360
from what does.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.360
And if that's the case,

14:13.360 --> 14:15.360
you can check the details of Mr. Mem,

14:15.360 --> 14:16.360
or else.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.360
Oh, Mr. Mem, it looks like it.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.360
It's not the above thing.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.360
I'm going to tell you what,

14:21.360 --> 14:23.360
it's not the 62-hour show.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.360
It's the 62-hour show.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.360
Yes.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.360
Any guess how it is, Mr. Mem?

14:29.360 --> 14:31.360
Okay.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.360
Okay.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.360
You can check that out.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.360
It's a little bit too easy like that.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.360
As you remember, please read,

14:40.360 --> 14:42.360
go away and tell me when you're going

14:42.360 --> 14:45.360
to read the details of the weather

14:45.360 --> 14:48.360
and immediately whether I'm reading,

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
indicating by that,

14:49.360 --> 14:51.360
I'm going to give you an indication.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.360
Before the case is written,

14:53.360 --> 14:55.360
let's see what is the flag that's in your office

14:55.360 --> 14:57.360
to monitor telephone conversations.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.360
What's one for reading?

14:59.360 --> 15:00.360
And what's one for mentioning?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.360
This particular telephone conversation.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.360
As I call it, Mr. Mem,

15:04.360 --> 15:06.360
it is because which to choose from,

15:06.360 --> 15:08.360
which items is possible.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.360
A statement for gift approval

15:11.360 --> 15:15.360
or approval of that question for our annual report,

15:15.360 --> 15:19.360
which we have read for the final paragraph.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.360
I think you wanted a good case.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.360
I'm a particular question for cleaning,

15:24.360 --> 15:25.360
for the Army,

15:25.360 --> 15:28.360
and our investigation of kindness and jokingness

15:28.360 --> 15:29.360
is the Army.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.360
And other than the higher request,

15:31.360 --> 15:33.360
then you might as well be called.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.360
We'll see if I will read it.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.360
Sometimes during the conversation,

15:37.360 --> 15:39.360
we would ask you to come on the wire,

15:39.360 --> 15:41.360
and to make preparations to take

15:41.360 --> 15:44.360
the indication which was random might hear.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.360
You will weather not Mr. Adams,

15:46.360 --> 15:48.360
knew that you were on the telephone

15:48.360 --> 15:50.360
and monitoring the call.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.360
I've said that it is.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.360
Although I cannot recall exactly where it took to tell you,

15:54.360 --> 15:55.360
when I came on the wire,

15:55.360 --> 15:57.360
he either asked for you on,

15:57.360 --> 15:59.360
or at least he's on,

15:59.360 --> 16:00.360
something to be effected.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.360
I know that yes.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.360
I had been press in the chat,

16:02.360 --> 16:04.360
and he rather don't tell us on the phone.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.360
Now when you proceed to read the call.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.360
The telephone conversation was finished

16:08.360 --> 16:09.360
with the call,

16:09.360 --> 16:10.360
and Mr. John Adams,

16:10.360 --> 16:12.360
Washington DC,

16:12.360 --> 16:15.360
to answer that Tuesday's January 9,

16:15.360 --> 16:19.360
1953, it should be 1954.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.360
Mr. Car,

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
in the report,

16:22.360 --> 16:25.360
we are talking about the loyalty set up.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.360
Mr. Carley,

16:26.360 --> 16:28.360
at that portion of the annual report

16:28.360 --> 16:30.360
of the company having to deal with the Army

16:30.360 --> 16:31.360
Lawyer's program,

16:31.360 --> 16:32.360
Mr. Carley,

16:32.360 --> 16:34.360
is that correct so far,

16:34.360 --> 16:35.360
Mr. Adams?

16:35.360 --> 16:37.360
No, that is not correct.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.360
Mr. Carley,

16:38.360 --> 16:40.360
what is correct,

16:40.360 --> 16:41.360
Mr. Adams?

16:41.360 --> 16:42.360
Under the directive,

16:42.360 --> 16:44.360
the federal side's record of order

16:44.360 --> 16:46.360
104.5.0,

16:46.360 --> 16:49.360
the department of the Army Lawyer's Appeal Board

16:49.360 --> 16:50.360
has been about it,

16:50.360 --> 16:52.360
and has been superseded

16:52.360 --> 16:54.360
by the law of the Reheuvois,

16:54.360 --> 16:57.360
and the personnel is entirely different.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.360
Mr. Carley,

16:58.360 --> 17:01.360
is that the result of an executive order

17:01.360 --> 17:02.360
with the Adams?

17:02.360 --> 17:04.360
The result of an executive order,

17:04.360 --> 17:06.360
the thing was in the middle

17:06.360 --> 17:08.360
before the modern adherence,

17:08.360 --> 17:09.360
Mr. Carley,

17:09.360 --> 17:11.360
the law of the Reheuvois set up,

17:11.360 --> 17:13.360
and the department of the Army has been resigned,

17:13.360 --> 17:14.360
Mr. Adams.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.360
If you find the creative impression

17:16.360 --> 17:18.360
that the law of the set up was changed

17:18.360 --> 17:20.360
as a result of the modern adherence,

17:20.360 --> 17:22.360
I am not going to say it.

17:22.360 --> 17:24.360
I say this is all the name was in the middle

17:24.360 --> 17:26.360
before the modern adherence begins.

17:26.360 --> 17:28.360
Mr. Carley,

17:28.360 --> 17:31.360
is that not actually happened before the old party?

17:31.360 --> 17:33.360
It was just in the middle.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.360
Was he released before the adherence on one of the hands?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.360
And I was indicated at this point

17:39.360 --> 17:41.360
that I missed a few words.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.360
Mr. Carley continuing.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.360
He thought about it.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.360
Mr. Adams.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.360
He, oh, he was released before.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.360
Mr. Carley,

17:49.360 --> 17:51.360
was he removed from?

17:51.360 --> 17:53.360
Or did he become inactive?

17:53.360 --> 17:54.360
Mr. Adams.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.360
He was removed in July.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.360
Mr. Carley,

17:58.360 --> 18:00.360
I want to statement for you

18:00.360 --> 18:02.360
in finishing up our report,

18:02.360 --> 18:04.360
something you'll prove that we can go on.

18:04.360 --> 18:08.360
Not something he will say about later, Mr. Adams.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.360
Anything you want to say along this line,

18:10.360 --> 18:12.360
I just told you,

18:12.360 --> 18:14.360
it's clear if you say it that way,

18:14.360 --> 18:16.360
but he's classified removed

18:16.360 --> 18:18.360
and he first is terminated in July.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.360
His services have been terminated

18:20.360 --> 18:22.360
about July.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.360
Mr. Carley,

18:23.360 --> 18:24.360
you are saying

18:24.360 --> 18:27.360
there has been a change in the law of the appeal board

18:27.360 --> 18:29.360
and that it has now been superseded

18:29.360 --> 18:31.360
by the Law of the Review Board

18:31.360 --> 18:34.360
and that the personnel has been tired of history.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.360
The personnel of the Law of the Review Board

18:36.360 --> 18:38.360
is entirely different.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.360
That comes from an executive order.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.360
You mean we cannot take credit

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
for any of it?

18:43.360 --> 18:44.360
Mr. Adams.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.360
That is true.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.360
From April to about December,

18:48.360 --> 18:50.360
we were operating

18:50.360 --> 18:52.360
and I skipped words there,

18:52.360 --> 18:53.360
struggling to operate

18:53.360 --> 18:55.360
between three directives of

18:55.360 --> 18:57.360
and more of a skip.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.360
Our switchover was signed up

18:59.360 --> 19:01.360
in about October,

19:01.360 --> 19:03.360
which all needed here too.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.360
Mr. Adams continuing.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.360
We were between two agents of the Army

19:07.360 --> 19:09.360
and five out of ten were signing up

19:09.360 --> 19:11.360
under the new executive order,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.360
but security has nothing to do

19:13.360 --> 19:16.360
with rules for seizures.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.360
Mr. Carley,

19:18.360 --> 19:19.360
maybe, here,

19:19.360 --> 19:21.360
and some words only to his,

19:21.360 --> 19:22.360
I am amazed.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.360
It is an amazing coincidence,

19:24.360 --> 19:26.360
Mr. Adams may be told,

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
Mr. Carley,

19:27.360 --> 19:29.360
amazing coincidence.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.360
It is true Mr. Carley to put the report together.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.360
The Law of the Review Board has been revised

19:34.360 --> 19:36.360
in accordance with the executive order

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
one over four five holes,

19:38.360 --> 19:40.360
and the appeal board has been replaced

19:40.360 --> 19:42.360
by the Law of the Review Board,

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
right?

19:43.360 --> 19:44.360
Mr. Adams.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.360
That is correct.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.360
Mr. Carley,

19:47.360 --> 19:48.360
you removed nobody,

19:48.360 --> 19:49.360
Mr. Adams.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.360
Nobody.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.360
Mr. Carley,

19:52.360 --> 19:55.360
everybody on the Law of the Review Board

19:55.360 --> 19:57.360
had his service contaminated

19:57.360 --> 19:59.360
when the board was abolished.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.360
Mr. Adams,

20:00.360 --> 20:02.360
that is correct.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.360
Mr. Carley,

20:03.360 --> 20:05.360
do me a favor with you.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.360
Fix me up a statement on all this in writing.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.360
So I can talk to Roy and Joe,

20:10.360 --> 20:13.360
and get this thing finished up for the report.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.360
Will you do that for me as soon as you can?

20:15.360 --> 20:17.360
And that is the end of that

20:17.360 --> 20:18.360
because our state of state

20:18.360 --> 20:19.360
will still leave the wire.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.360
That was not the end of the conversation.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.360
So far as I know, no.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.360
I didn't know.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.360
Some four or five places,

20:24.360 --> 20:26.360
you stated that words were immediately

20:26.360 --> 20:27.360
stated in the committees of meetings,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.360
both words were immediately.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.360
I did not understand them,

20:30.360 --> 20:32.360
or either one of the parties

20:32.360 --> 20:35.360
that's going so fast I couldn't say it.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.360
I'm not just court reporter.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.360
By the way,

20:39.360 --> 20:41.360
the social missions which you indicated by

20:41.360 --> 20:43.360
are either a completion and correct transcripts

20:43.360 --> 20:45.360
of the telephone call.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.360
As you heard.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.360
Yes, sir.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.360
No further questions, Mr. Chair.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.360
Is that the only telephone call

20:50.360 --> 20:51.360
that has been given to the monitor?

20:51.360 --> 20:52.360
Yes, sir.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.360
And your old document.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.360
Yes.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.360
I have all the documents in the table.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.360
That's a good document.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.360
No further questions.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.360
Well, they're going around the table here.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
We'll take this opportunity.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.360
And I'm going to check.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.360
Mr. Roy, Mr. Senkler.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.360
That's one of the rules.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.360
This is Ms. Williams.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.360
Would it make any difference to you

21:10.360 --> 21:12.360
if you sat in the other chair?

21:12.360 --> 21:13.360
No.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.360
The reporter is locked in where he is.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.360
He can't move very well either way.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.360
I don't see if that hurt anyone else.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.360
Is that part of the human, Mr. Chairman?

21:21.360 --> 21:22.360
Not a bit.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.360
Thanks.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.360
Move those things there, sir.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.360
Mrs. Williams,

21:26.360 --> 21:30.360
only one or two lessons from me.

21:30.360 --> 21:38.360
There was a portion of the conversation on that day.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.360
You did not monitor.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.360
Is that correct?

21:41.360 --> 21:43.360
That is a few minutes to announce.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.360
Our unit of position is as long as to tell me whether

21:45.360 --> 21:50.360
it was the first part that you did not monitor or the last part,

21:50.360 --> 21:54.360
or did you perhaps monitor in the middle so that it was two segments.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.360
One earlier than yours is one after yours.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.360
I know there was one earlier, Mr. Welch,

21:59.360 --> 22:03.360
because that has been the trial that when he became a certain signal on intercom,

22:03.360 --> 22:05.360
I was some on the wire.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.360
Yes.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.360
How long he talked with Mr. Adams after I left the wire, I can't say.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.360
Yes, please.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.360
You'll never find the specific of that, then.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.360
On monitor prior to the conversation was it the shine?

22:16.360 --> 22:18.360
I have no knowledge, whatever.

22:18.360 --> 22:19.360
What conversation?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.360
Never mind anything about it.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.360
No.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.360
You are nearly, strike that out.

22:25.360 --> 22:29.360
I think a cast in the transcription of your monitor call

22:29.360 --> 22:32.360
are your own centi-graphic notes, is that right?

22:32.360 --> 22:33.360
That's true.

22:33.360 --> 22:37.360
Do you recall or put you established by looking at a calendar

22:37.360 --> 22:41.360
the January 9th, 1954, was the Saturday?

22:41.360 --> 22:44.360
I remember it was on the Thursday of the calendar.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.360
Do you recall the only words on Saturday?

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
Yes.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.360
I think we're all keen to work very hard.

22:50.360 --> 22:53.360
Could I ask you this to you, ma'am,

22:53.360 --> 22:57.360
how many people in yours strike it out?

22:57.360 --> 22:58.360
You.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.360
We've got to judge if they have that one or all ones.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.360
That is right.

23:02.360 --> 23:07.360
How many second-carriage hours did I have to prepare there?

23:07.360 --> 23:10.360
Seven or eight minutes to work on.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.360
Not.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.360
Do you have the assignment system so that each man

23:15.360 --> 23:19.360
has a priority on one of the tonight's first-large secretary?

23:19.360 --> 23:20.360
No, sir.

23:20.360 --> 23:23.360
I think that isn't achieved generally in our office.

23:23.360 --> 23:27.360
But as a real life take to vacation that Mr. Cohen

23:27.360 --> 23:28.360
and Mr. Cargeel.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.360
I was going to ask you that, ma'am.

23:30.360 --> 23:34.360
So, ordinarily, Mr. Cohen, along with you,

23:34.360 --> 23:37.360
has been working at that office

23:37.360 --> 23:40.360
and wishes to indicate you were taking a vacation.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.360
Yes, sir.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.360
And if Mr. Cargeel is in Washington alone

23:45.360 --> 23:48.360
and that office you take your vacation.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.360
That is true.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.360
And, by my own way, I judge you

23:52.360 --> 23:56.360
would always take Mr. Cohen's vacation if he were around.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.360
I think so.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.360
I have no exception.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.360
I can't recall right now.

24:00.360 --> 24:04.360
Now, and you tell me that it's roughly

24:04.360 --> 24:05.360
half a dozen others to not work for?

24:05.360 --> 24:06.360
That's true.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.360
One thing more.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.360
Perhaps I was in a tentie.

24:12.360 --> 24:16.360
But did your testimony indicate the time of day

24:16.360 --> 24:18.360
at what you monitored this call?

24:18.360 --> 24:20.360
Did there not, Mr. Wells?

24:20.360 --> 24:22.360
Have you, say, recollection about it?

24:22.360 --> 24:23.360
Within the afternoon.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.360
I would say between two and three o'clock.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.360
Between how do you place that, isn't it?

24:28.360 --> 24:30.360
The reason that during the morning

24:30.360 --> 24:34.360
I tried to locate Mr. Adams

24:34.360 --> 24:37.360
and then later in the afternoon when Mr. Cargeel reached him.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.360
I thought it was afternoon.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.360
Have you had some recollection with how

24:41.360 --> 24:45.360
I do in the Chicago work that day?

24:45.360 --> 24:48.360
That would be very difficult to call.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.360
No, I don't.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.360
In view of you remembering the time of the afternoon,

24:52.360 --> 24:53.360
I thought perhaps you were...

24:53.360 --> 24:56.360
I think if you were both busy about the annual report

24:56.360 --> 24:57.360
and that's why you were calling.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.360
Yes.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.360
And that the annual report went to Congress

25:02.360 --> 25:05.360
how much later than that if you recall.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.360
Mr. Wells, since I'm not the one who's submits it,

25:10.360 --> 25:11.360
I don't know.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.360
I know that we were just preparing our final drafts at that time

25:14.360 --> 25:15.360
and we were quite busy.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.360
And...

25:16.360 --> 25:17.360
And...

25:17.360 --> 25:18.360
And...

25:18.360 --> 25:19.360
And...

25:19.360 --> 25:20.360
And...

25:20.360 --> 25:22.360
I take it your recollection is,

25:22.360 --> 25:23.360
if you were Mr. Cargeel,

25:23.360 --> 25:25.360
a good part of the afternoon, probably all the afternoon, is that right?

25:25.360 --> 25:27.360
I have no 50th recollection

25:27.360 --> 25:30.360
as to how long we worked, Mr. Wells.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.360
But is it your recollection that you worked together

25:33.360 --> 25:36.360
until the report quits me tired when home?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.360
I imagine that we did.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.360
We usually do.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.360
Your answer to this is yes, is that right?

25:41.360 --> 25:43.360
I don't know how late we worked on Saturday.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.360
So that's my question.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.360
Yes, but my question is that you kept dogs and lawns on Saturday

25:47.360 --> 25:48.360
after until the report was left.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.360
You had it long enough, we could then get up

25:50.360 --> 25:52.360
and put on your half-term at home.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
Well, I still say that I don't know how long that was

25:54.360 --> 25:56.360
on that particular Saturday, Mr. Wells.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.360
Yes, I understand.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.360
I'm only trying to get at this point,

25:59.360 --> 26:01.360
and at some time you must both of self

26:01.360 --> 26:03.360
you've done a week's work and you're not talking.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.360
And do we did it sometimes or home?

26:05.360 --> 26:06.360
Yes.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.360
Mr. Wells, here, a minute.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.360
My office staff also,

26:15.360 --> 26:17.360
as you say, dogs are lawn on Saturday.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.360
So long is that, is what I would say,

26:19.360 --> 26:21.360
that just means that the dog's life

26:21.360 --> 26:24.360
and I think it is to work on Saturday afternoon.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.360
I might add that done something

26:26.360 --> 26:28.360
up until they got into this case.

26:28.360 --> 26:31.360
One other thing I think Mr. Corn was not every one

26:31.360 --> 26:33.360
or one that after that day at all, as far as you recall.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.360
As I recall, he was not there.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.360
You have a knowledge or recollection

26:37.360 --> 26:39.360
that you was in New York on that day.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.360
I know that he was not in Washington.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.360
I'm not sure about where he was from.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.360
Thanks.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.360
I think that's all.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.360
You're going to my car?

26:50.360 --> 26:51.360
You're going to my car?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.360
Yes.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.360
Mr. Chairman, I have no question for the witness,

26:56.360 --> 27:00.360
but I use my ten minutes of the photos.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.360
I've been waiting for all day long.

27:03.360 --> 27:07.360
I inquire first, and whether anybody else has any questions

27:07.360 --> 27:10.360
or the witness or whether she can step down.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.360
Any objection to dismissing the witness?

27:12.360 --> 27:14.360
You may step down.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.360
Sir McCartney?

27:16.360 --> 27:19.360
The witness of Chairman, I'd like to

27:20.360 --> 27:22.360
now request that the Chair,

27:22.360 --> 27:23.360
Sir Pina, witness,

27:24.360 --> 27:28.360
to witness whom I consider absolutely necessary,

27:29.360 --> 27:32.360
to bear to intelligently

27:33.360 --> 27:37.360
prevent the evidence from the Corn Carman Carcisside,

27:37.360 --> 27:40.360
and incidentally, at this time,

27:40.360 --> 27:42.360
I'm not speaking of something signing him.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.360
I also was afraid that the witness

27:46.360 --> 27:49.360
would be subpoenaed for tonight, however,

27:49.360 --> 27:52.360
and the tip is not long, and I expected

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
to get any money for the Corn Carcisside,

27:54.360 --> 27:57.360
so I assume it would be impossible to get him in here tonight.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.360
I would very much appreciate

27:59.360 --> 28:01.360
if he could beg up an inch in the morning,

28:01.360 --> 28:03.360
as if he isn't watching to me.

28:03.360 --> 28:07.360
I think he is before we have a session of the committee.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.360
Mr. Chairman, I have held on

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
that being questioned of the moaters

28:13.360 --> 28:17.360
and calling on these hearings that have called out,

28:17.360 --> 28:19.360
in that case, the communist and government

28:19.360 --> 28:22.360
will go to the utmost importance

28:25.360 --> 28:30.360
of the question of where the principal moaters

28:30.360 --> 28:34.360
rise as shifted from week to week

28:34.360 --> 28:37.360
as the Chair knows,

28:37.360 --> 28:39.360
and this particular witness

28:39.360 --> 28:42.360
is now under any presidential directives,

28:44.360 --> 28:46.360
not to testify,

28:46.360 --> 28:49.360
he can give us a great deal of important information

28:49.360 --> 28:51.360
and understand the practice of the Chair

28:51.360 --> 28:53.360
to subpoena any witnesses,

28:53.360 --> 28:55.360
or trust to be their side.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.360
So I wish to Chair, but consider this a formal request

28:59.360 --> 29:01.360
for the subpoenaing of this witness,

29:01.360 --> 29:04.360
and I'll explain why I'm wanting subpoenaed,

29:04.360 --> 29:07.360
the man I once subpoenaed was mentioned,

29:07.360 --> 29:10.360
and had set the chin in 95,

29:10.360 --> 29:14.360
he said to him when he had taken on June 4th,

29:14.360 --> 29:17.360
mentioned in a one of the monitoring calls

29:17.360 --> 29:19.360
of Mr. Simonton,

29:19.360 --> 29:21.360
at that time,

29:21.360 --> 29:25.360
Mr. Simonton, the talking to Mr. Stavins

29:25.360 --> 29:28.360
out there,

29:28.360 --> 29:30.360
tells which ear could be prevented

29:30.360 --> 29:32.360
from coming to testify,

29:32.360 --> 29:34.360
to testify that it was about

29:34.360 --> 29:36.360
for responsible for the fifth amendment,

29:36.360 --> 29:37.360
communist,

29:37.360 --> 29:40.360
he says I will get him a left with Clifford.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.360
A quarter of yours?

29:42.360 --> 29:44.360
I will not do you a twenty-fourth award

29:44.360 --> 29:46.360
for one moment, Mr. Chairman.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.360
I'm a senator, may the air-the-main

29:48.360 --> 29:50.360
and the senator will be a follow-up to practice

29:50.360 --> 29:52.360
when a final letter is made,

29:52.360 --> 29:53.360
he's going to stay to see what it is

29:53.360 --> 29:55.360
when some of the tests,

29:55.360 --> 29:56.360
if you have a final letter,

29:56.360 --> 29:57.360
send me a time limit.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.360
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

29:59.360 --> 30:02.360
I don't see anything about fifth amendment's communist

30:02.360 --> 30:04.360
and this testimony here.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.360
I'll pay the implication of the junior sound up

30:07.360 --> 30:09.360
from which time it was.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.360
There was some mention here,

30:11.360 --> 30:13.360
I was going to remember that.

30:13.360 --> 30:16.360
Well, we'll have to go in there at one point of order at the time.

30:16.360 --> 30:17.360
That's one of the orders,

30:17.360 --> 30:19.360
that's another point of order.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.360
Well, let's talk about the record,

30:22.360 --> 30:24.360
how we are on the same page,

30:24.360 --> 30:26.360
let's page every working out.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.360
You both have the same page.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.360
52.45.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.360
52.45.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.360
I do not know what it is,

30:32.360 --> 30:35.360
may I read the testimony on 52.95,

30:35.360 --> 30:37.360
Mr. Chairman, the point of order.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.360
That was the page that he wrote out.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.360
Very sure, it's only for everyone

30:42.360 --> 30:43.360
in the direction of the room,

30:43.360 --> 30:45.360
for my instrument.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.360
On a lecture theory of the army,

30:47.360 --> 30:49.360
that is one reason I am calling you,

30:49.360 --> 30:50.360
Senator Stomington,

30:50.360 --> 30:52.360
I will get into that with Professor,

30:52.360 --> 30:54.360
Secretary of the Army,

30:54.360 --> 30:57.360
I put an equal for John Sullivan II,

30:57.360 --> 31:00.360
and I talked to him just before your call came in.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.360
Senator Stomington, I just wouldn't go.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.360
Let me talk to Professor about it,

31:05.360 --> 31:07.360
and I will call you now,

31:07.360 --> 31:08.360
Mr. Chairman, my point is,

31:08.360 --> 31:10.360
that I don't see anything in here

31:10.360 --> 31:12.360
about different members coming.

31:12.360 --> 31:15.360
I'll tell you after a little bit of...
