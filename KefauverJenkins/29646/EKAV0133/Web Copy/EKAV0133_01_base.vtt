00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Washington, where Army Secretary Robert Stevens is being questioned by members of the Senate

00:06.320 --> 00:07.800
investigating committee.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.600
We take you now to Washington.

00:09.600 --> 00:17.840
Did he make any use of that he had discussed as to Mr. Gold?

00:17.840 --> 00:28.880
Yes, I think he mentioned that some thing of, I don't know whether it was that or some

00:28.880 --> 00:31.680
other time I think that he mentioned it sometime.

00:31.680 --> 00:39.380
Did he mention to you that Mr. Gold was to aid him secure in a position in the industry

00:39.380 --> 00:40.380
of the movement?

00:40.380 --> 00:42.880
No, there was a law partner, no, he did not.

00:42.880 --> 00:49.960
What I got it was that there was a certain amount of shall it call it banner or something

00:49.960 --> 00:51.880
about that, about the law business.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.480
But has this so-called banner taken place in your presence?

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
Yes, sir.

00:56.480 --> 01:06.600
Did you ever hear Mr. Adams suggest to Mr. Coleman that private practice would be looked

01:06.600 --> 01:08.680
upon, replaced with this time?

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
I know it is.

01:09.680 --> 01:15.280
Your information then relates to the information that you secure for Mr. Adams.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
That's correct.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.280
That's correct.

01:17.280 --> 01:23.080
Mr. Chairman, I have no other questions at this time.

01:23.080 --> 01:30.080
However, I would like to make one comment that my opinion the hearings are dragging on

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
pretty slowly.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.080
I am afraid that we will go on now.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.080
There won't be all of it here until later today.

01:33.080 --> 01:40.080
And it's my suggestion that unless we can move much faster, I'm going to suggest that we

01:40.080 --> 01:41.080
have nice sessions.

01:41.080 --> 01:48.080
I can take a no better way to speed up ahead.

01:48.080 --> 01:55.080
I wish you could think of another way.

01:55.080 --> 02:00.080
I have no questions at this time.

02:00.080 --> 02:05.080
I would like to comment however on what the Senate part just said.

02:05.080 --> 02:11.080
We have about six principals here and a good many other witnesses.

02:11.080 --> 02:15.080
They are getting added to additional testimony, come to them, pictures, problems.

02:16.080 --> 02:20.080
Especially me like we'll probably be here all summer.

02:20.080 --> 02:25.080
I would hope that everybody in our team does understand the position of Mr. Stevens and the

02:25.080 --> 02:28.080
position of those opposing you.

02:28.080 --> 02:34.080
I would hope that Chairman and the council will keep the questions relevant as possible and

02:34.080 --> 02:39.080
make it possible for us to get additional witnesses on the stand and all so that the

02:39.080 --> 02:41.080
key sharing will be closed.

02:41.080 --> 02:47.080
The earliest opportunity I could think you would agree with a comment of my colleague from

02:47.080 --> 02:48.080
Michigan.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.080
That's a nice session.

02:49.080 --> 02:53.080
Anything and everything except the IP sharing I would be for.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.080
That's all I have to say at this time is, Chairman.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.080
Senator Dwayne-Sat.

02:58.080 --> 03:03.080
I trust you are not unintimidated by our colleagues.

03:03.080 --> 03:08.080
The concern of the other members of this subcommittee that the hearings be expedited as much as possible.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.080
So that we can go on to more important business.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.080
Time to get through.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.080
Now let's back to you.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.080
Mr. Welch, nothing at the moment.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.080
Can you imagine or at least you can.

03:28.080 --> 03:33.080
First, we have a gathering of our 100 bodies to get through with the United

03:33.080 --> 03:34.080
States.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.080
We have a couple of questions so we can go through.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.080
This is quickly possible.

03:37.080 --> 03:45.080
Mr. Stevens, nothing at the two-star general for the last semester.

03:45.080 --> 03:48.080
We have a full panel of opinions.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.080
Another full panel is right.

03:51.080 --> 03:56.080
You get five of the number one in June.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.080
You have to generate your own, generate the back, generate the reaver.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.080
I'd like to know what these mean here.

04:04.080 --> 04:13.080
They're here in case they may be needed in connection with getting the facts in this case out before the committee.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.080
I wonder if you do this for me, Charlie.

04:15.080 --> 04:20.080
One of your case give us the names of all of the military personnel.

04:20.080 --> 04:25.080
But they are jobs in the Pentagon and the fire they are here.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.080
It looks like we've lost a member of the department.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.080
We have their needed employees.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.080
Do you have any information that they should be here?

04:33.080 --> 04:35.080
We're out of time now.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.080
We're going to go to 111.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.080
Did you have one of your lawyers?

04:38.080 --> 04:39.080
Make a list.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.080
Especially with jobs in the Pentagon and their jobs here today.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.080
Do you want me to identify any officers?

04:45.080 --> 04:47.080
I have to go right now.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.080
One of your counsels will do that.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.080
Give me a list.

04:50.080 --> 04:53.080
Now, we're going to go to the president.

04:53.080 --> 05:01.080
What was the gentleman that was planning to get his brother to the Senate?

05:01.080 --> 05:04.080
Don Adams, job was with the department of the Army.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.080
He was the counselor for the department of the Army.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.080
What was your attorney's decision?

05:09.080 --> 05:17.080
He was assigned as a liaison between the department of the Army and your committee.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.080
Did you know who failed?

05:19.080 --> 05:21.080
Did you like your brother?

05:21.080 --> 05:23.080
He was suspended.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.080
I told Mr. Adams that I wanted to cooperate with the committee.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.080
The limit of his and my ability.

05:28.080 --> 05:32.080
I told him that the different world is doing with his men.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.080
I never remember talking to Mr. Adams that.

05:35.080 --> 05:42.080
He was a great, good little, the, uh, hearing student.

05:42.080 --> 05:46.080
We have covered this 24-hp on the McCarthy Army.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.080
I'll be honest with you all right again.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.080
I'm assuming the government is different.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.080
I don't think it's different.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.080
I'm very clear about it with the day.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.080
Did you want the hearing suspended?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.080
Did you keep it a secret?

05:57.080 --> 06:03.080
I wanted the Army to have the right to take over this investigation and avoid one.

06:03.080 --> 06:07.080
Let's run it down to make reports to you.

06:07.080 --> 06:11.080
And for your investigation to continue on.

06:11.080 --> 06:17.080
Did you want the first to suspend your article with hearing suspended?

06:17.080 --> 06:20.080
Senator, I probably just so much do you want me to keep going over again?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.080
I just would like to be answered by a person.

06:22.080 --> 06:29.080
I, Senator, I am trying to remember my authority to get the voice of the committee the truth.

06:29.080 --> 06:34.080
And I think if you'll tell me to do that, we can go on faster.

06:34.080 --> 06:38.080
But I find myself being able to do it in few, the way you have these questions.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.080
What the great thing would work out is that I've justified so fully on the thing.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.080
And it's all a matter of record right now.

06:44.080 --> 06:48.080
We are here to have our lightest suggests that we go back over the record.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.080
Get out the answers.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.080
And that's the testimony.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.080
Mr. Jim, the United States may have a suggestion.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.080
I'm not a light man.

06:57.080 --> 07:04.080
The first thing to be the very first thing with respect to a civil matter.

07:04.080 --> 07:10.080
We will say a kind of the secretary, even though his repetitions merely acts of the question.

07:10.080 --> 07:14.080
And then your suggestion is he desires.

07:14.080 --> 07:21.080
I may really address this guilty in tolerance of the plan of Senator Carter to speak these years.

07:21.080 --> 07:26.080
I'm just, I said that I would, I would put the box for you.

07:26.080 --> 07:30.080
I put the box that I was very cold.

07:30.080 --> 07:35.080
But I thought that the fourth monmer of hearings, the way they were being conducted,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.080
had served their post.

07:37.080 --> 07:42.080
And I would like to have the Army, Mary on the hearings, carry on the investigation,

07:42.080 --> 07:46.080
and make the reports to you before you know the way you want us to do it.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.080
Have you ever heard of the General?

07:48.080 --> 07:54.080
I'd like to, I'm not having a investigation, but let our panel be in the business of running down the cases

07:55.080 --> 07:57.080
within the process of running down.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.080
Which of the secretary, if you want, will hear you as your spenders?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.080
I want to spend it here.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.080
I wanted the title of hearing that you are conducting suspended yesterday.

08:06.080 --> 08:10.080
You want to know our hearings to spend a legitimate, I wanted to have the title of hearing

08:10.080 --> 08:12.080
that you are conducting suspended.

08:12.080 --> 08:16.080
But when I used to do the training, if you want to continue holding hearing,

08:16.080 --> 08:18.080
you can have different types of hearing.

08:18.080 --> 08:24.080
If you have held a title here, which would have given the American people,

08:24.080 --> 08:31.080
and the people in the United States Army, a more accurate evaluation of what the situation was,

08:31.080 --> 08:35.080
the fourth monmer of our had no judgment, whatever.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.080
But you did won't be hearing the re-revolving suspended.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.080
Are these of that type, yes?

08:40.080 --> 08:43.080
Did you do anything to add them if you wanted those hearings to spend?

08:43.080 --> 08:45.080
I don't recall having told them that.

08:45.080 --> 08:53.080
I didn't keep anything of secret problems, but I know that I did not recall having discussed that particular point.

08:53.080 --> 08:59.080
You know they are talking to the veterans about the wounds that were getting the hearing suspended,

08:59.080 --> 09:01.080
or different types of hearing.

09:01.080 --> 09:05.080
I don't recall specific discussion on it.

09:05.080 --> 09:10.080
It was my idea that these hearings were getting out of hand,

09:10.080 --> 09:15.080
and they were creating a very unfamiliar question in the minds of the public,

09:15.080 --> 09:19.080
and of the Army, and of the facts for it, before the monmer.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.080
Did you discuss that with your own arms?

09:21.080 --> 09:24.080
Yes, I discussed that with the audience first.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
Sure.

09:25.080 --> 09:30.080
You want to do germs, those two trying to get the hearing suspended?

09:30.080 --> 09:33.080
No, I would not say that was correct.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.080
I would say one of them.

09:35.080 --> 09:39.080
I would say our collective job was to handle the Army's core.

09:39.080 --> 09:44.080
The Army's core operation with your committee, and the first way that we possibly could,

09:44.080 --> 09:51.080
but that we also had a responsible order to make sure that the news had run out to the public,

09:51.080 --> 09:56.080
or some real good relationship in the facts.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.080
Mr. Circuit, I just saw you.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.080
You will be aware of what your previous defense applied to me.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.080
You will hear from the elderly, because the money is going to be so bad,

10:06.080 --> 10:10.080
and I'm in the play opposite, but I think this committee will miss you,

10:10.080 --> 10:13.080
but to submit the sender, I record the Justice Department,

10:13.080 --> 10:16.080
I think all of us should keep that in mind.

10:16.080 --> 10:20.080
Some of the either-hazard banner will be guilty of poetry,

10:20.080 --> 10:23.080
but it's not a muted side food.

10:23.080 --> 10:28.080
Just so you will be aware of what your previous testimony made in 4.42,

10:28.080 --> 10:33.080
and the United States, Mr. Jankin, the President.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.080
Mr. Jankin's question, the water is raining,

10:36.080 --> 10:40.080
and that you did not ask the son of her to stop the investigation of 4.1,

10:40.080 --> 10:45.080
but rarely to suspend it and give you a chance to carry it on.

10:45.080 --> 10:49.080
And then if you fail to take over again, is that correct?

10:49.080 --> 10:52.080
And sure that is correct.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.080
You've left your testimony today.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.080
Sir McCarty, I think you know that my testimony is.

11:01.080 --> 11:05.080
I've got over it and over it and over it.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.080
Well, if you took the question very seriously, did you have it?

11:08.080 --> 11:12.080
We chose to spread into the hearing of the coming of new filtration

11:12.080 --> 11:15.080
at the Red River Forest.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.080
Sir McCarty, I've been over it and over it and over it.

11:19.080 --> 11:23.080
And if you show me, you may want to allow, I'll continue to go over it.

11:23.080 --> 11:31.080
Sir McCarty, I want to, I said that I thought that the type of hearing that you were holding had served its purpose,

11:31.080 --> 11:36.080
and that the Army should have the right to carry on and run these things down themselves,

11:36.080 --> 11:41.080
make progress reports to you that your investigation should not be suspended,

11:41.080 --> 11:45.080
and that we would do the job to the best of our ability.

11:45.080 --> 11:50.080
And have you been in any service before since the hearing of the coming of the infiltration or suspended?

11:51.080 --> 11:55.080
I think we've been in close touch with your committee at all on.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.080
Have you made any progress reports to me?

11:58.080 --> 11:59.080
What?

11:59.080 --> 12:01.080
Something to be hearing versus suspended?

12:01.080 --> 12:03.080
What's the idea you're talking about?

12:03.080 --> 12:05.080
Anytime from versus suspended.

12:05.080 --> 12:08.080
Any day, well, I think that we've been in close touch, John Adams,

12:08.080 --> 12:11.080
has been in close touch with your staff by straight along.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.080
The record will go right off.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.080
The question, have you made any progress reports?

12:16.080 --> 12:22.080
I know that I've been told there's how many people you've suspended since we, since we've been in the hearing.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.080
I've pushed along the building.

12:23.080 --> 12:27.080
I've pushed the flash without a public.

12:27.080 --> 12:34.080
In other words, the only progress report you've viewed was the progress report on the nuclear tank and the sports examination of that tank.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.080
Now, I wouldn't say that's the only progress report.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.080
Well, have you given us this progress report to talk about it?

12:39.080 --> 12:43.080
Time of Clackin, I didn't give you progress reports personally,

12:43.080 --> 12:51.080
but I knew that John Adams was in close touch with your staff and that information that you've was available that you wanted

12:51.080 --> 12:54.080
that we could properly give with these applied.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.080
If you may, you can give them the progress report in today.

12:58.080 --> 13:12.080
Since the hearing of the evidence of suspended, how many security risks have you suspended from the radar laboratory, if any?

13:12.080 --> 13:18.080
I'll have to check that sign of the car.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.080
I gave, so how long will it take to get to the experiment?

13:21.080 --> 13:26.080
I think we've got the information available here with one of our people.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.080
Let me then.

13:27.080 --> 13:36.080
Mr. Chair, I have a fantastic act to ask for that information that we are making available with as swiftly as possible.

13:37.080 --> 13:42.080
I would like to be testing when I want to try and get ready to recognize Mr. Steven Dingo, if he has it.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.080
Now, if not, if not, when will you have?

13:44.080 --> 13:48.080
I am under the impression that it can be furnished to the security at this moment.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.080
Am I right Mr. St. Clair?

13:50.080 --> 13:55.080
Mr. Dingo, I'm going to tell you one more.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.080
The story will be fine.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.080
On the giant of the fireworks.

13:59.080 --> 14:07.080
I request that all the gentlemen and gentlemen be here to the time that we appreciate the annual time and doubt.

14:07.080 --> 14:25.080
Mr. Chairman, I would like to make it as much as I have requested that of yesterday that the Army submit to this committee a report as to the exact situation with reference to the suspensions.

14:26.080 --> 14:43.080
Our fourth model, that if the conclusion of the interrogation of Mr. St. Clair by Senator McCarthy, I believe that the report is not too lengthy, that it will be ready in the records if the conclusion of the interrogation.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.080
That should be said.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.080
If you send him a graduate, he will not come out of your tracks.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.080
Sorry, go for a seat.

14:49.080 --> 14:53.080
I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.

14:53.080 --> 14:57.080
Just to be a good progress report, we know that's correct.

14:57.080 --> 15:05.080
We have a report that sounded attacked on that for a couple of months before the one you left for.

15:05.080 --> 15:09.080
How many of you are going to have your suspenders since our investigation?

15:09.080 --> 15:17.080
We'll come with some suggestions on the way to the library and then we'll come to 35 for the investigation of the progress.

15:17.080 --> 15:30.080
I think I talked about the other day, Senator, that we suspended six, higher to up to 80, which was the formal day of the opening of your executive committee.

15:30.080 --> 15:35.080
That's 29, that's the, that was you wanted to.

15:35.080 --> 15:39.080
29, that's the day's correct, the last we made.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.080
The date of the first hearing was on run.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.080
August 31st.

15:44.080 --> 15:52.080
August 31st, the investigation of the other one before that, is a month away, if you had suspended new one until we commence the investigation.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.080
Check that out from find out.

15:54.080 --> 16:00.080
I don't know, because I say my understanding of when you're hearing started was not on over eight days.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.080
Although I know that you had work going on before that, I didn't know what started.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.080
We were going to move to a separate area of your family, did you suspend the first one?

16:08.080 --> 16:11.080
Sorry, send your family to fire.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.080
We went back to council.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.080
Chairman, I think you're fine.

16:16.080 --> 16:22.080
I think we agreed that you might have a date until we have this time in response to Mr. Jackson's question.

16:22.080 --> 16:26.080
Would you like to go first, sir, so I read this.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.080
Doesn't make a good difference to me, Mr. Secretary, as you've grown, to be.

16:30.080 --> 16:38.080
You may meet now, and so do you may know fairly, by the before, for either Saturday, Saturday, or Saturday,

16:38.080 --> 16:45.080
to be stated to be prepared to be prepared before we leave, Mr. Schienel, be seated, so we have a set of letters being responded to the event.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.080
Mr. Chairman.

16:47.080 --> 16:55.080
I don't know if there is a question that I'd like to know how many of you have been reported on the distraction panel.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.080
For you, you've got to go first, and then we'll talk about the security.

16:58.080 --> 17:03.080
No, this one you're going to fire, at least, is prepared by the police, and it's the ability to commit to the US.

17:03.080 --> 17:10.080
Chairman, I just received a copy of what I bought three minutes ago, because I requested it.

17:11.080 --> 17:18.080
And as much as I have requested it out of yesterday, and it's been understood that it would be a better fail hole.

17:18.080 --> 17:24.080
This hearing, I think, of all the red and the red. I assume that the department of the army have extra copy.

17:24.080 --> 17:38.080
The reason we're going to meet now is because I received a letter from the committee staff,

17:38.080 --> 17:42.080
and the committee staff has informed me they received it from the panel.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.080
I just want to see.

17:44.080 --> 17:48.080
It's right and straight this morning, and I received it within five minutes.

17:48.080 --> 17:53.080
Mr. Schienel, we have a couple of things to do together.

17:53.080 --> 17:58.080
The meeting of the first district response to the question is one of the questions left.

17:58.080 --> 18:02.080
But it will be for a letter, the heading of this is for a month, the cases.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.080
Okay, you may be.

18:05.080 --> 18:11.080
May I read the question that I think will be relevant to all the data that you've received for the meeting?

18:11.080 --> 18:14.080
Let me read the questions from the record of yesterday.

18:14.080 --> 18:20.080
I thought Mr. Schienel had only helped, which is responsible for the report that he's about to read.

18:20.080 --> 18:25.080
This is on page 582 of yesterday. Senator Jack.

18:25.080 --> 18:33.080
I wonder if Mr. Schienel would you be good enough to give to the committee a statement without reference to the individual's name.

18:33.080 --> 18:39.080
The general nature of the allegations against them and a summary of the action taken to date by the Army.

18:39.080 --> 18:48.080
For example, whether any of them has been reinstated, whether some of them have been fired, how long it will be before there is a determination.

18:48.080 --> 18:54.080
I make this request of you, Mr. Stevens, because this matter has been kicked around in newspapers.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.080
It has been discussed.

18:56.080 --> 19:01.080
Here in the committee, the American people, I think, are pretty confused.

19:02.080 --> 19:08.080
No one knows the true nature of the situation with reference to these 35 people.

19:08.080 --> 19:19.080
I do believe it would be helpful if the Army could submit a statement outlining the present status of the fourth model of the situation as to the suspended personnel for the old material.

19:19.080 --> 19:26.080
I think it might be well to get to the consular of the committee also a classified statement, which could not be released.

19:26.080 --> 19:32.080
But only for their guidance and for information is not for necessary because of the classified material.

19:32.080 --> 19:41.080
The Secretary of State, from Senator, we would like to submit anything that you want and within a limit of private, private, and natural practice that applies will do so.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.080
I think that concludes this.

19:43.080 --> 19:48.080
If that is the unremarkable fact that you have just guessed it, I think that is the end of the day.

19:49.080 --> 19:54.080
I will take you to the slide to look for the management action.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.080
We should wait until the investigation comes around.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.080
The financial law, the hammer, hold more.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.080
It takes a long time.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.080
I don't think we should.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.080
Yes, we will.

20:02.080 --> 20:06.080
When these counsels are in profound depression on these, I'm going to be fine.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.080
I'm not sure if I have any money, but I'm going to be fine.

20:10.080 --> 20:14.080
Still is my way of further close examination.

20:14.080 --> 20:24.080
You have testified as we understand it that you retain Mr. Adams as of approximately October 1st.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.080
Yes, sir.

20:25.080 --> 20:36.080
And you assigned him to the special duties that were there to deliver all the VAs on the officer between you and the committee.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.080
Yes, sir. He was the Department of Counselor of Mr. Jenkins.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.080
And that was one of his jobs. He had other jobs, of course.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.080
That was one of his principles.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.080
Yes, sir.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.080
Jobs, as we understand it, Mr. Secretary.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.080
That's right, sir.

20:51.080 --> 21:05.080
Now, as that time when you had known for approximately one month that the MacArthur Committee was investigating the infiltration of communist and supersonic forces,

21:05.080 --> 21:12.080
in the first Army area, including Fort Mama, had you not met, right, sir?

21:12.080 --> 21:31.080
And as all of the date of your attention of Mr. Adams, you, as I understand your testimony, have made overtures to the MacArthur Committee to suspend their investigations,

21:32.080 --> 21:37.080
and do not conduct any hearings and to allow the Army to carry on that work.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.080
Is that correct?

21:38.080 --> 21:41.080
Did you say the former stratum came with me?

21:41.080 --> 21:46.080
I say that as of my question is this.

21:46.080 --> 21:56.080
Please state whether or not, as a Ottawa First, the dates of your attention of Mr. Adams as counsel,

21:56.080 --> 22:05.080
you have known that the MacArthur Committee was investigating the infiltration of communist and supersonic,

22:05.080 --> 22:13.080
at that security rate in the first Army area, including Fort Mama, is that correct, yes, sir?

22:13.080 --> 22:21.080
And you have discussed that situation with Senator MacArthur and his staff, as you might be, Secretary, yes, sir.

22:21.080 --> 22:27.080
On several occasions prior to October 1st, the date of Adams's attention.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.080
That's right.

22:28.080 --> 22:35.080
And as I understand your testimony, you have not, as a Ottawa First, that is prior October 1st,

22:35.080 --> 22:41.080
made overtures to the MacArthur Committee to suspend that investigation and to allow you to do it.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.080
No, sir.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.080
You have not?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
No, sir.

22:45.080 --> 22:52.080
Mr. Secretary, do you guys know about October 1st?

22:52.080 --> 22:57.080
Well, that investigation to the MacArthur Committee suspended?

22:57.080 --> 23:04.080
Actually, Mr. Jenkins, the Fort Mama investigation, as far as I'm concerned, started on 8th October.

23:04.080 --> 23:08.080
And I'm as relatively little about it if anything else about October 1.

23:08.080 --> 23:14.080
But as I understand it, you have learned in Montana from the newspaper accounts that Senator MacArthur

23:14.080 --> 23:20.080
was investigating three security risks in the first Army area, is that correct?

23:20.080 --> 23:22.080
But not a Fort Mama, all right.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.080
Fort Mama, the escort Mama, included in the first Army area, yes, sir.

23:26.080 --> 23:31.080
Then they think we're in that if he was investigating.

23:32.080 --> 23:38.080
The subject in real estate in the back security risk in the first Army area, that was in Fort Mama,

23:38.080 --> 23:40.080
was what it now has to work.

23:40.080 --> 23:47.080
And you can leave it in Montana that he had three men under investigation in the first Army area that you're not.

23:47.080 --> 23:50.080
Two men and one one, are very well prepared.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.080
And you can do something like that.

23:53.080 --> 23:57.080
And you can do, initiate a conference with Senator MacArthur.

23:57.080 --> 24:00.080
And you can do this, sir.

24:00.080 --> 24:06.080
Here is a list of the exact same things in the investigation of real estate persons that you're not.

24:06.080 --> 24:12.080
I came back, Mr. Jenkins, to get information about what the trouble was and try to get the work on it with him.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.080
Where did you do what I have asked you to do with him?

24:14.080 --> 24:17.080
From the office room at the Senate Office Building in Washington,

24:17.080 --> 24:21.080
the future has been bringing you a special coverage of the congressional hearings,

24:21.080 --> 24:24.080
and Senator Joseph Park for Montana was started over,

24:24.080 --> 24:32.080
and I think, are any members of staff, these three persons of public who had read in Montana as a dead, they're well?

24:32.080 --> 24:37.080
And did you at that time, to get to Senator MacArthur,

24:37.080 --> 24:41.080
that you had an agency equipped to investigate him,

24:41.080 --> 24:49.080
and that you would take the matter and hand yourself in conduct and investigate him with those three persons?

24:49.080 --> 24:52.080
I told him we'd investigate it, but I didn't say anything about it.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.080
It's not investigating them either.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.080
But you claim that you will do so. Oh, sure.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.080
You betcha.

24:58.080 --> 25:03.080
You said nothing about his washing his hands, so to speak,

25:03.080 --> 25:06.080
if that's work and allowing you to carry it on,

25:06.080 --> 25:09.080
this was the first contact I had to understand.

25:09.080 --> 25:18.080
Well, at any time between that first contact about the 7th or 8th of October and the date of retention of Adams,

25:18.080 --> 25:22.080
did you talk to the secretary to Senator MacArthur on other occasions?

25:22.080 --> 25:24.080
Yeah, that's a great experience.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.080
That's right.

25:25.080 --> 25:29.080
I thought the investigation was the first time he had...

25:29.080 --> 25:31.080
Yes?

25:31.080 --> 25:36.080
And did you at any time, during that period, suggest to remain,

25:36.080 --> 25:40.080
that you refer to people living in the grip to carry it on,

25:40.080 --> 25:44.080
and will he please step out of the picture and allow you to leave?

25:44.080 --> 25:47.080
No, sir. I always suggested that we were well equipped to carry it on,

25:47.080 --> 25:49.080
but I never suggested his step and all the questions.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.080
Did you want to step out of the picture?

25:51.080 --> 25:53.080
No. And allow you to do that work.

25:53.080 --> 25:57.080
The problem arose over the Fort Monmouth investigation, sir.

25:57.080 --> 26:03.080
You appreciated the fact that he was worth investigating the first time he had ever...

26:03.080 --> 26:08.080
The process was somewhat of a new prediction of your work.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.080
Did you not miss a day?

26:12.080 --> 26:18.080
May the judge like to make sure that the very firm is on the different side of the region.

26:18.080 --> 26:22.080
Combine with the committee rules to take any pictures that are going to take

26:22.080 --> 26:25.080
in a new position or sitting down.

26:25.080 --> 26:29.080
We generate many complaints from the television audience

26:29.080 --> 26:31.080
and from the television people,

26:31.080 --> 26:35.080
and all the cameras are getting at the back and the...

26:35.080 --> 26:38.080
...and the first time he had a chance...

26:38.080 --> 26:41.080
...to finish.

26:41.080 --> 26:44.080
I'll put this to the left.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.080
I'll put it to the left.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.080
I have to ask you.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.080
I'm for sure.

26:52.080 --> 26:56.080
You know, maybe you're the certain kind of witness to remain in secret when you think you're pictures.

26:56.080 --> 26:59.080
Unfortunately, due to the fact that the role of pictures there,

26:59.080 --> 27:02.080
I missed that question.

27:03.080 --> 27:08.080
And the last Mr. Jenkins repeated that I simply wanted to be sure this time that our...

27:08.080 --> 27:12.080
...forgives us a friend from life as a rule.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.080
You see, you've left the investigation...

27:16.080 --> 27:20.080
...our standing-in-the-carrier of the first Army area...

27:20.080 --> 27:26.080
...was a institution of your work, our infusion and economy, to any state.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.080
Now I didn't feel that way about it.

27:28.080 --> 27:33.080
So as all of October 1st, the date of the retention of Mr. Adams...

27:33.080 --> 27:39.080
...you have never requested a suspension of either an investigation or a name.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.080
As far as I know, I never had.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.080
Well, what is your...

27:43.080 --> 27:46.080
...unamisdistivation, as far as you know?

27:46.080 --> 27:50.080
Thank you, give this committee a direct answer to that question.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.080
I think I can assure this committee that I did not do that.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.080
When I was on, I just thank you little relegator.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.080
Your answer was parliamentary.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.080
And was your remedy?

27:59.080 --> 28:03.080
Now are you saying that...

28:03.080 --> 28:06.080
...it is your best recollection that you have not been...

28:06.080 --> 28:07.080
...had not been it?

28:07.080 --> 28:09.080
Are you saying that you go over my...

28:09.080 --> 28:10.080
I...I...I...I...

28:10.080 --> 28:14.080
...say him and I just don't think I did any such thing, Mr. Jenkins.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.080
You just don't think you did any such thing, though.

28:16.080 --> 28:20.080
Mr. Secretary, when did you first ask?

28:20.080 --> 28:23.080
Either Senator McCarthy or any member of his staff...

28:23.080 --> 28:29.080
...to please dispel the operations, their operations in the investigation...

28:29.080 --> 28:32.080
...our fourth month of the first Army area.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.080
What was your first request, Nate?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.080
I...I...I...I...

28:37.080 --> 28:40.080
I will think that I ever did exactly do that.

28:40.080 --> 28:44.080
You say now, I'm warning, we've never given a request for suspension...

28:44.080 --> 28:47.080
...of the McCarthy investigation.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
That's the...

28:48.080 --> 28:49.080
...the...the...the...

28:49.080 --> 28:50.080
...no other...

28:50.080 --> 28:52.080
...never requested a suspension of the investigation.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.080
All right, well, maybe I'd misunderstood you here for this, Secretary...

28:55.080 --> 28:59.080
...and I'm not going into details and I'm not going to read the record...

28:59.080 --> 29:03.080
...because the committee will remember what your testimony is...

29:03.080 --> 29:06.080
...and I'd be an area of body.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.080
Very well, Mr. Adams did come to you...

29:09.080 --> 29:12.080
...and was on your staff as a doctor with her.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.080
That's right.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.080
And one of the duties was to establish...

29:16.080 --> 29:20.080
...shake better relationship than to assume the committee wasn't.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.080
No, sir.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.080
I think I had a fine relationship with the committee.

29:24.080 --> 29:27.080
Mr. Adams' job was to help me maintain it.

29:27.080 --> 29:30.080
You can cut it off.

29:30.080 --> 29:37.080
Well, keep your relationship with the committee as you've often referred to as fine...

29:37.080 --> 29:42.080
...and have much to do to you.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.080
And you have no complaints.

29:45.080 --> 29:49.080
Then, while you're getting the specific issue of bringing the remain...

29:50.080 --> 29:53.080
...from Mr. Jenkins, the answer to that one is...

29:53.080 --> 29:57.080
...that, as Secretary of the Army, all of the terrific number of duties...

29:57.080 --> 30:01.080
...and responsibility, we should say, exactly, for the extent worldwide...

30:01.080 --> 30:05.080
...that the largest department that the United States government has...

30:05.080 --> 30:08.080
...must have terrific powers to carry.

30:08.080 --> 30:14.080
And that the liaison work with the committee was naturally a time-consuming one.

30:14.080 --> 30:18.080
I had carried it from its inception on the 8th of September...

30:18.080 --> 30:22.080
...through the month of September, and when Mr. Adams came...

30:22.080 --> 30:27.080
...I had to relieve myself of that in order to carry on with other parts of my job.

30:27.080 --> 30:30.080
Now, the second thing you were at...

30:30.080 --> 30:33.080
...and I've regained a media excerpt.

30:33.080 --> 30:38.080
Well, when you're not with Mr. Adams, came to you on our paper first...

30:38.080 --> 30:43.080
...used specifically as you to use.

30:43.080 --> 30:50.080
All the duties, with the democratic committee, just being without a position...

30:50.080 --> 30:54.080
...or as a suspension, I did not do that.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.080
That is your answer now.

30:56.080 --> 31:01.080
And as I recall your answer here before, I've been that you have no recollection of it...

31:01.080 --> 31:03.080
...and didn't remember that, sir.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.080
Now, your country has been the same.

31:05.080 --> 31:10.080
I've experienced a many things over the past few years.

31:10.080 --> 31:16.080
And you say now that we've been proud of this is that you did my right to be driving to the light.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.080
That's right. Did I create it? Yes, sir.

31:22.080 --> 31:31.080
Mr. Secretary, stop being your opinion is the mean of us being honest.

31:31.080 --> 31:38.080
Spine, use your instinct to the truth, and then...

31:38.080 --> 31:50.080
...a sigh and a sigh of voice, a vast security reach, there is a good answer.

31:50.080 --> 31:57.080
In your trust relief, I believe there's no one but 13 to the left to make us correct, sir.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.080
From the beginning of the answer.

31:59.080 --> 32:07.080
You speak into the truth that there was no one else as human in the army.

32:07.080 --> 32:12.080
That's right. I have no other than 20 kindos to an island for a month.

32:12.080 --> 32:15.080
But what about these things, sir?
