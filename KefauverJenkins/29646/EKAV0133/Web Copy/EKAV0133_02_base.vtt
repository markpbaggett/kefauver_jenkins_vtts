00:00.000 --> 00:20.600
I don't know whether I ever made any public statement.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.440
I know that you both are not only very keen.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.440
You made any reference to subvertisers.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.200
I would like to give you this.

00:29.200 --> 00:36.320
Oh yes, the whole question of Fort Marmot, then that's the in-hawage and security risks

00:36.320 --> 00:41.000
and that was all pretty fully colored Mr. Jenkins and that first conference.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.200
I understand that, but here the four year-old Dr. Mowee has been confined exclusively to

00:47.200 --> 00:49.400
spy this female, that's right.

00:49.400 --> 00:56.000
Now, if you go further, I thought first comes the conference of no room is empty.

00:56.000 --> 01:07.200
I'm saying that there is not only more espionage at the moment, but there is no room for

01:07.200 --> 01:11.840
the first two hours, not for our first security risk.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.840
No sir, you did not know that well.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.240
No, I didn't go that far.

01:15.240 --> 01:22.240
So, you understood this.

01:22.240 --> 01:33.240
The second question, Mr. Secretary, is it not your opinion that the investigation

01:33.240 --> 01:47.240
the apprehension, the exposure, the exposure of the first security risk is quite important

01:47.240 --> 01:51.240
as well as the detection of spy.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.240
Oh, extremely important.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.240
Yes sir, I'm you.

01:55.240 --> 02:01.240
How long is it still regarded and still regarded now from my first day in officer?

02:01.240 --> 02:11.240
I was a doctor for first, 1953.

02:11.240 --> 02:21.240
How many services or security risks have been dismissed from the army in particular for

02:22.240 --> 02:24.240
the first time?

02:24.240 --> 02:27.240
I was a research army.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.240
He's covered so the army is excusing those immediately.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.240
So the middle-aged official was done by the McCrytee Committee.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.240
Well, I just don't have that information on my head.

02:36.240 --> 02:41.240
I think maybe this report on the fort-mind with cases which I'll read whenever you want

02:41.240 --> 02:44.240
me to sir, may get some light on that question.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.240
Now, as we understand this, there were 35 suspicious in all the desperate.

02:51.240 --> 02:55.240
Do you know how many suspensions were assigned?

02:55.240 --> 02:57.240
Excuse me.

02:57.240 --> 03:01.240
Do you know how many suspensions were assigned?

03:01.240 --> 03:04.240
Excuse me.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.240
Do you know how many of us are injured?

03:07.240 --> 03:10.240
A winner of 1953.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.240
Excuse me.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.240
Do you know how many suspensions were assigned?

03:14.240 --> 03:15.240
No sir, I don't.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.240
Where do you mean?

03:16.240 --> 03:18.240
Well, I just defined this thing working on.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.240
I hear you.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.240
I'm sure the committee, though.

03:20.240 --> 03:27.240
I thought the five that in respect to certain cases there that I was sure that the McCryte

03:27.240 --> 03:31.240
Committee had expedited the handling of those cases by the army.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.240
Yes sir.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
For a certain extent.

03:33.240 --> 03:38.240
As I understand it, we've been in your rhythm statement which you wrote in the committee.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.240
And you said it was effective, right?

03:40.240 --> 03:42.240
I testified to adjust the order.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.240
I was in second place.

03:44.240 --> 03:50.240
This is sentient information with security and safety, this is the first reason that we've

03:50.240 --> 03:52.240
seen taken out of it.

03:52.240 --> 03:57.240
An important area for this fortnight is just sir.

03:57.240 --> 04:06.240
As it states that some of the requirements in this dark, extra-dirty, this is function.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.240
I've left right for persons.

04:09.240 --> 04:16.240
You've seen the correct details that you've got in both service information, did it not?

04:16.240 --> 04:17.240
That's correct.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.240
And you have no ammo.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.240
Sorry, I'm thinking.

04:21.240 --> 04:26.240
I'll give you the knowledge if the importance of that work.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.240
I do not.

04:28.240 --> 04:34.240
The chair is a little worried just because the timing is with the very essence that's correct.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.240
Yes sir.

04:35.240 --> 04:53.240
Why didn't the war all of these thirty-five suspensions work?

04:53.240 --> 05:02.240
If actually that's who's thought to have taken this suspension of the pipe work.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.240
May I have that red please?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.240
Yes sir.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.740
One is the solar, all of these thirty-five suspensions were inspected and the concept of

05:13.740 --> 05:17.240
the finished suspension of the mosaic work.

05:17.240 --> 05:24.240
As I say, I've never talked to, I get a suspension of the investigation.

05:24.240 --> 05:31.240
I will want the type of hearing that was being held suspended or changed.

05:31.240 --> 05:38.240
And the most of those suspensions that you've taken for place during the month of October

05:38.240 --> 05:43.240
and November's I recall two struggles after that.

05:43.240 --> 05:52.240
But I hear the other words, mentions this red scarf that the committees were asking you to have thought

05:52.240 --> 05:57.240
to think about the splintumes of new ways to get used to me.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.240
Well I don't know if I can answer by them if they didn't like that now.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.240
Now it's just like a clear painting to that.

06:04.240 --> 06:09.240
And give them back, not to care if you, a G.D.H.I.

06:09.240 --> 06:14.240
Through the blood of the air and air and you can even defend the November first.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.240
That's right.

06:15.240 --> 06:20.240
And the blood of the committee is straightened with nothing to the bottom and not on the foot

06:20.240 --> 06:22.240
and to November 10th.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.240
That's right.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.240
And the bottom is completely gone.

06:27.240 --> 06:33.240
The resolution now is letters to letters not being invited into the committee's arms.

06:33.240 --> 06:37.240
The Senate will not be wrong, only letters on November's sake.

06:37.240 --> 06:42.240
I think those arrangements for it are made by my staff, Mr. Jenkins.

06:42.240 --> 06:49.240
Would you start having thought it's a safe, tight, and emailed state army

06:49.240 --> 06:56.240
to a monthly luncheon given the use of the paper on a nation without social lectures?

06:56.240 --> 07:06.240
We would have been glad to have anybody from the staff over there, including China if he was there on committee business.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.240
I hear it November 10th.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.240
The meeting will be closed for active duty.

07:11.240 --> 07:18.240
Did you come to hear attention, Mr. Secretary, if this is targeted in the army?

07:18.240 --> 07:25.240
We're giving special coverage of the event at the week.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.240
It did that after you asked.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.240
Did you come to hear attention?

07:30.240 --> 07:38.240
That he was not doing anything to do with the paper full of our duty duty?

07:38.240 --> 07:45.240
Not for a long, long time, but if you come to hear attention, do you feel the feeling of the fact that we're the current?

07:45.240 --> 07:49.240
I don't know if I have the information about the KT there in the third use there.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.240
I don't think I did.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.240
Did you come to hear attention?

07:53.240 --> 07:56.240
It was not wearing.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.240
Did you look all?

07:59.240 --> 08:03.240
She was issued for the army to get the army and go to the army.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.240
I didn't know at the time, I found out all the letters.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.240
Later learned it.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.240
Did you come to hear attention?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.240
That is how I learned it.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.240
Not on my own or it was on my own.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.240
I didn't understand that.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.240
You knew that how you was doing the 14th.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.240
Also, I'm not sure what I did.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.240
Are you sure that you didn't?

08:23.240 --> 08:27.240
I can't remember exactly what day that I became.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.240
I was just aware of it.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.240
It was nice to go to the first floor too.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.240
It was a good meeting for you.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.240
The first one?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.240
It was a good meeting.

08:36.240 --> 08:40.240
You put me in a position where every time you get the shine,

08:40.240 --> 08:45.240
the eye and your fur are thrown into the pain of money.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.240
To keep me alive.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.240
I think I heard something about that later.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.240
You can tell where you're going to be in graduation.

08:56.240 --> 09:05.240
I was certainly going to tell you that he was not making up your borders.

09:06.240 --> 09:10.240
I was certainly going to do the room to find the new authority.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.240
Not for how it was a poor bitch, but I heard about it afterwards.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.240
That's it.

09:17.240 --> 09:23.240
Did he call the news and say that he was hiding?

09:23.240 --> 09:27.240
I don't think he's going to find the number of news for that.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.240
Five or 14th.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.240
I post a lot about that, Jessica.

09:31.240 --> 09:38.240
Another thing to show you here is that he heard 15 in a living experience.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.240
Improving the news of art and sins,

09:42.240 --> 09:45.240
embracing two or three ways.

09:45.240 --> 09:49.240
Where is the average private, how do we treat it?

09:49.240 --> 09:52.240
That's my crack, doctor.

09:52.240 --> 09:56.240
Did he tell me that he was in this private?

09:57.240 --> 10:01.240
Was taking that position with the officers?

10:01.240 --> 10:06.240
Was sometimes putting his arm around the commission officer?

10:06.240 --> 10:09.240
But I don't know, as Rick even talked to him,

10:09.240 --> 10:12.240
as really evil, he is equally right for his behavior.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.240
That one, I don't think I ever heard that.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.240
Never heard that.

10:17.240 --> 10:20.240
No, they call over here.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.240
That's this private call.

10:23.240 --> 10:28.240
He was the technical and there was enough.

10:28.240 --> 10:33.240
I don't recall the name of the company commander.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.240
Five or one occasion while at Fort Beach,

10:36.240 --> 10:40.240
with his arm around the 10th floor,

10:40.240 --> 10:43.240
and during the worms' eye,

10:43.240 --> 10:48.240
until he was there on a special assignment to weak,

10:48.240 --> 10:51.240
as in St. John,

10:51.240 --> 10:54.240
to modernize him as the American Army

10:54.240 --> 10:59.240
and seen landing along by the way.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.240
Did you know that?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.240
No, sir.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.240
You never heard that before.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.240
I heard that I think I heard later,

11:07.240 --> 11:10.240
along with these other points that you've been making,

11:10.240 --> 11:13.240
some reference to something along that line,

11:13.240 --> 11:17.240
but not in any such all-envading language as that was.

11:17.240 --> 11:22.240
Yeah, and the bottom point of order.

11:22.240 --> 11:27.240
The point of order I'd like to make for the gentlemen,

11:27.240 --> 11:30.240
when is the Army changed so much in the past?

11:30.240 --> 11:33.240
I never, I never know,

11:33.240 --> 11:37.240
that's the type of frequency that's unheated.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.240
You know, after you left the country,

11:39.240 --> 11:42.240
you find the word not a public company,

11:42.240 --> 11:44.240
and it can't be.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.240
And the point of order is something I understand

11:48.240 --> 11:54.240
that the inspector general has investigated all the information

11:54.240 --> 11:56.240
by council,

11:56.240 --> 11:58.240
and I spoke with a report.

11:58.240 --> 12:02.240
I think that the report should be made a part of the record.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.240
Otherwise, I'm afraid the questions will be taken

12:05.240 --> 12:10.240
to mean that the strike has been established.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.240
The chairman of the government,

12:12.240 --> 12:16.240
has the closing salmon and developed a pact with council.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.240
The parliament council, the parliament chairman,

12:19.240 --> 12:23.240
who's here, Mary, left the list saying that,

12:23.240 --> 12:26.240
in view of all the reports that prepared

12:26.240 --> 12:28.240
in the Mr. Stiffle's任 bill,

12:28.240 --> 12:32.240
the presently should present now the inspector general report,

12:32.240 --> 12:36.240
upon the special consideration of this private job,

12:36.240 --> 12:40.240
that the report was available in the possession of the typical director.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.240
Submit Mr. Chairman that they may be down at the proper time,

12:44.240 --> 12:46.240
and that now he's not the proper time

12:46.240 --> 12:49.240
during my cross-examination as a sectate.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.240
The general report is mentioned a full-requestion

12:51.240 --> 12:55.240
that the Senator McCarthy just received in the time.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.240
Mr. Chairman.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.240
Mr. Chairman.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.240
Mr. Walter, I'm very worried.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.240
It seems to me that it would be appropriate for Mr. Jenkins

13:03.240 --> 13:06.240
to say that the Army has made available to the human

13:06.240 --> 13:10.240
his staff such portions of that report as are complete.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.240
Would you mind doing that for us, Mr. Jenkins?

13:12.240 --> 13:16.240
And from now, the AI agreement facts,

13:16.240 --> 13:20.240
upon which now I am now facing my alleged facts,

13:20.240 --> 13:24.240
upon which I am now facing my cross-examination.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.240
Thank you, sir.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.240
See you next time.

13:29.240 --> 13:33.240
Mr. Secretary, the weather at Fort Bix,

13:33.240 --> 13:36.240
during the month of November, December, in January,

13:36.240 --> 13:43.240
was extremely, extremely, extremely,

13:43.240 --> 13:46.240
I don't know how to say it.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.240
Did you know that one day I was there,

13:49.240 --> 13:54.240
or did you know that the front of the road is at Fort Bix?

13:54.240 --> 13:59.240
We're trying to avoid it from one point in the area through another.

13:59.240 --> 14:03.240
To feel right, I know it might be.

14:03.240 --> 14:07.240
The Friday signs are almost invariably broken,

14:07.240 --> 14:10.240
the care for the truck.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.240
Where is the other tolls?

14:13.240 --> 14:18.240
Sometimes, numbering 40 and 50 were packed like,

14:18.240 --> 14:21.240
travelers sheep in the middle of the truck

14:21.240 --> 14:24.240
and they told us in the world that you learned that.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.240
No, sir, I know what I'm talking about.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.240
Is it the first time you ever heard of that?

14:28.240 --> 14:29.240
I'm here.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.240
What's the time?

14:32.240 --> 14:35.240
Are you over there, Mr. Secretary,

14:35.240 --> 14:40.240
before I sentence the inception of this investigation?

14:40.240 --> 14:46.240
Talk to the officers, the nine-pounders in the private.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.240
Mr. Chairman.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.240
Mr. Chairman, I point them in.

14:50.240 --> 14:57.240
I'm going to have to count the four of them, Mr. Chairman.

14:57.240 --> 15:01.240
I do have an interest in the million-man,

15:01.240 --> 15:05.240
the pilot of the Army, who is married to the right to answer.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.240
I think it is highly improper.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.240
The last substance here is some certain facts.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.240
And the fact is, not many of them.

15:15.240 --> 15:19.240
The fact is, not many of them are what we count for.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.240
For whom I think all of them are what a very deal respect.

15:22.240 --> 15:26.240
Says, have you ever learned what such and such was a fact?

15:26.240 --> 15:28.240
There are people watching, Mr. Millions,

15:28.240 --> 15:29.240
there are people watching, Mr. Televiz,

15:29.240 --> 15:31.240
there are going to be some of those of us.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.240
Mr. Chairman.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.240
No, no, no, no, no.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.240
Right, Mr. Chairman, let me finish by point of order, Mr. Chairman.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.240
And I keep my order.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.240
I have a duty, I thank you for taking the young man the roadways.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.240
I'm just glad.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.240
If Mr. Shindin's something improper,

15:45.240 --> 15:47.240
then let's have the facts brought out,

15:47.240 --> 15:49.240
Mr. Shindin, Mr. Chairman,

15:49.240 --> 15:51.240
I think it is highly improper.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.240
I think it is highly improper.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.240
If you ask the Secretary how you will learn this,

15:55.240 --> 15:57.240
how you will learn that?

15:57.240 --> 16:00.240
The assumption is that the facts are active.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.240
I don't agree they are active.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.240
I don't know.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.240
Mr. Shindin should be here for a grant

16:07.240 --> 16:11.240
to make him a part of his smear as it has been doing on.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.240
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,

16:13.240 --> 16:24.240
may the Chair say that Mr. Shindin will be calling in due court right as it will in its

16:24.240 --> 16:25.240
press.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.240
The Council has the Chair understand this statement.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.240
Mr. Chairman.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.240
Chairman.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.240
From the citizens, but the Secretary will acknowledge about these alleged facts.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.240
And if Mr. Chairman has a chairman of this,

16:35.240 --> 16:38.240
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.240
Mr. Shindin will be calling in due court.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.240
If Mr. Chairman may be against Mr. Shindin,

16:45.240 --> 16:48.240
then he should be notified of all charges.

16:48.240 --> 16:52.240
He should be notified that he can hear the Council in passing Laman.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.240
Otherwise, it is completely unfair that he unlawfully.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.240
But I think I don't know whether the Chair is going to agree with false.

16:59.240 --> 17:03.240
For the first time today, I hear him say that I have not been to fight my Council.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.240
I have asked for the report.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.240
I have asked for the report from the President.

17:07.240 --> 17:11.240
And whether Mr. Shindin has received any special consideration,

17:11.240 --> 17:16.240
up to this time, the only place where I can find the charges made public,

17:16.240 --> 17:22.240
I only knew you were in court, and in the columns of left-wing columns by your district.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.240
I want this.

17:24.240 --> 17:29.240
I want if those charges, if those charges, if those charges have been investigated,

17:29.240 --> 17:34.240
I think Mr. Shindin should have a copy of the report.

17:35.240 --> 17:40.240
Mr. Chairman, in the interest of Quarer at the end to keep the record straight,

17:40.240 --> 17:46.240
I think it should be pointed out that from the very beginning,

17:46.240 --> 17:50.240
a number of hypothetical questions have been put,

17:50.240 --> 17:56.240
without the requirement of evidence to substantially oppose questions.

17:56.240 --> 18:02.240
I recall a hypothetical question that was put with reference to Fort Momma.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.240
It's the very early, the first day on Thursday,

18:06.240 --> 18:10.240
and there have been a number of hypothetical questions,

18:10.240 --> 18:15.240
put to various witnesses without the previous requirement of testimony.

18:15.240 --> 18:22.240
Do I understand, this is a point of order, do I understand that we have the right to put those hypothetical questions?

18:22.240 --> 18:26.240
If not, then I assume that all the previous hypothetical questions,

18:26.240 --> 18:31.240
but by all members of this committee and Council, will be strict.

18:31.240 --> 18:34.240
Mr. Chairman, Chair of the group, without chairman,

18:34.240 --> 18:37.240
stay in response to both of the previous�,

18:37.240 --> 18:39.240
the chair of the quarer and fore.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.240
The chair of the group, the other response to both,

18:42.240 --> 18:46.240
these points of order, the group, the other opinion is one that always can really

18:46.240 --> 18:49.240
be seeking to do it to endeavour to become an acute,

18:49.240 --> 18:54.240
and to find out, and to any question that's by Council for his exile,

18:54.240 --> 18:56.240
or that members of the committee,

18:56.240 --> 18:58.240
that can share some light,

18:58.240 --> 19:01.240
and whether it is in this country of everything,

19:01.240 --> 19:03.240
will be in this room, and accept it.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.240
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman.

19:06.240 --> 19:10.240
Your further point of order, please be a sorry, certainly, here.

19:10.240 --> 19:15.240
When some of your Jackson would go into questions as a hypothetical question,

19:15.240 --> 19:18.240
I make a point of order that when Council says,

19:18.240 --> 19:24.240
have you learned that as many as four young men were packed in the back end of a truck like cattle,

19:24.240 --> 19:27.240
that if that is not a hypothetical question,

19:27.240 --> 19:30.240
that's completely unfair to the army,

19:30.240 --> 19:33.240
I don't think, I've been in the middle of that for a while,

19:33.240 --> 19:36.240
I've never seen young men appear to go like cattle,

19:36.240 --> 19:41.240
and I know that Council,

19:41.240 --> 19:43.240
I'm going to break you into this restful council,

19:43.240 --> 19:45.240
I think you've been in the next one,

19:45.240 --> 19:49.240
and I do think of order when I find that he is,

19:49.240 --> 19:51.240
in my opinion, making a great deal of that,

19:51.240 --> 19:53.240
I'm not going into the attention of the chair,

19:53.240 --> 19:56.240
and I don't think we should let it go up to the mother's nearest country,

19:56.240 --> 20:00.240
if there are some brave, seated-life cattle, because they are not.

20:00.240 --> 20:04.240
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, Mr. Secretary,

20:04.240 --> 20:08.240
and the president, and a very realistic question,

20:08.240 --> 20:11.240
was put with reference to Sam Regent,

20:11.240 --> 20:13.240
which I do not recall,

20:13.240 --> 20:16.240
there was any evidence offered in this hearing,

20:16.240 --> 20:20.240
as to the allegations contained in those charges,

20:20.240 --> 20:23.240
and I just want to know what the procedure is,

20:23.240 --> 20:27.240
so that I can better understand the questions that

20:27.240 --> 20:30.240
I have a proper right to frame,

20:30.240 --> 20:32.240
and to that point, of order that I agree with.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.240
Senator Daryen, will you call the procedure there,

20:35.240 --> 20:37.240
and the procedure now,

20:37.240 --> 20:38.240
unless you have any questions,

20:38.240 --> 20:41.240
which might be mostly shed some writing,

20:41.240 --> 20:42.240
I'm be telling you,

20:42.240 --> 20:44.240
the future is very difficult kind of issue.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.240
However, we've been able to provide a point of order,

20:47.240 --> 20:49.240
and we're finally in a point of order.

20:49.240 --> 20:54.240
Mr. Chairman, I am not always agreed with the council in these hearings,

20:54.240 --> 20:58.240
but I want to be the first to say that I do not think

20:58.240 --> 21:02.240
he is making any delivered effort to smear anybody.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.240
Thank you, sir.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.240
Mr. Governor, let's talk to all of them.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.240
I do not have a point of order.

21:09.240 --> 21:14.240
I want to make an observation on the points that have been made.

21:14.240 --> 21:18.240
The testimony being elicited,

21:18.240 --> 21:23.240
is absolutely relevant to the charges of whether

21:23.240 --> 21:27.240
private shine received referential treatment.

21:27.240 --> 21:31.240
That can be no question about their relevancy.

21:31.240 --> 21:35.240
However, if private shine be you,

21:35.240 --> 21:38.240
that he, because of this evidence,

21:38.240 --> 21:42.240
and because of the statements that are being made,

21:42.240 --> 21:46.240
or the report that has been submitted,

21:46.240 --> 21:49.240
is a point to this action,

21:49.240 --> 21:53.240
to these proceedings, he should be given the right.

21:53.240 --> 21:58.240
Just as Mr. Hensel was, after charges will made against him,

21:58.240 --> 22:01.240
he should be given the right to intervene

22:01.240 --> 22:03.240
if he desires to do so.

22:03.240 --> 22:10.240
As to the questions they are offered on the issue of whether

22:11.240 --> 22:14.240
the perpetrator,

22:14.240 --> 22:18.240
or the perpetrator,

22:18.240 --> 22:22.240
should be given the right to intervene.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.240
The perpetrator,

22:26.240 --> 22:29.240
the perpetrator,

22:29.240 --> 22:33.240
should be given the right to intervene.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.240
The perpetrator,

22:37.240 --> 22:41.240
should be given the right to intervene.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.240
I think the record should be cleared.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.240
Mr. Jenkins knows this.

22:46.240 --> 22:50.240
Mr. Hensel was interrogated by the Inspector General's

22:50.240 --> 22:52.240
Department.

22:52.240 --> 22:56.240
He was ordered not to discuss the charges with anyone.

22:56.240 --> 23:00.240
As a result, he could not tell me what the charges were.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.240
He was denied the right to counsel persons.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.240
He was completely honest and sincere about this.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.240
I don't question his honesty at all.

23:08.240 --> 23:13.240
But I do think that if we're going to start making public charges

23:13.240 --> 23:15.240
of this nature,

23:15.240 --> 23:20.240
that then the charges should be filed on Mr. Hensel,

23:20.240 --> 23:24.240
Mr. Adams, on me, on Mr. Karn, Mr. Torin.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.240
He should know of the right.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.240
He should be given the same right to cross the ground

23:29.240 --> 23:31.240
on the same right of the counsel,

23:31.240 --> 23:33.240
because those charges are awfully serious, though,

23:33.240 --> 23:35.240
being repeated today.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.240
That's the chance.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.240
I never thought I could make an observation

23:38.240 --> 23:41.240
as a Inspector that those were pretty serious charges.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.240
The Senator made against Mr. Reaver's brother,

23:44.240 --> 23:47.240
and those charges were filed over developed in testimony.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.240
Yes, this is being developed.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.240
Mr. Reaver's brother wants to come here.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.240
Well, I have no idea.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.240
In any position, there's counsel who will respect

23:55.240 --> 23:57.240
the mental Reaver's brother.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.240
He should be invited if he wanted to,

23:59.240 --> 24:00.240
but he would be in the nod.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.240
I certainly agree with you.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.240
We'll be fine.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.240
He's with you.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.240
I have a broad, broad, broad mind saying

24:05.240 --> 24:07.240
connection with Christ's son.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.240
He has been publicly on a number of times,

24:10.240 --> 24:14.240
as these were Mr. Stevens and those who served with him.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.240
Now Senator McCartney,

24:15.240 --> 24:17.240
with those who served with him,

24:17.240 --> 24:19.240
call Mr. Shines.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.240
Then the committee will call him as a matter of color

24:21.240 --> 24:22.240
and mental justice,

24:22.240 --> 24:24.240
because certainly he has the right to be heard

24:24.240 --> 24:25.240
he's on behalf.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.240
You have a lot of thoughts, sir.

24:26.240 --> 24:28.240
He will have a right to have counsel,

24:28.240 --> 24:30.240
and his will have a right to serve

24:30.240 --> 24:31.240
right to serve his emancipation.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.240
The chairman, I don't want to say any more

24:33.240 --> 24:35.240
to randomism, but there's a big difference

24:35.240 --> 24:38.240
between calling a young man as a witness.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.240
Days after a child was made against him,

24:41.240 --> 24:43.240
and notifying the child,

24:43.240 --> 24:45.240
because the child will own the roles

24:45.240 --> 24:47.240
we will be fighting the past rule with him.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.240
We've all just announced,

24:49.240 --> 24:50.240
I think chairman,

24:50.240 --> 24:53.240
it's a rule that the first nice chairman,

24:53.240 --> 24:55.240
I think it's probably a rule that will not be this.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.240
May I have a share of attention?

24:57.240 --> 24:59.240
As this man, no man,

24:59.240 --> 25:01.240
he is publicly accused,

25:01.240 --> 25:03.240
and that's given to him,

25:03.240 --> 25:05.240
which he commissioned himself

25:05.240 --> 25:07.240
and allows a step up an answer,

25:07.240 --> 25:08.240
and I think that's a good rule.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.240
I think we should follow that here.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.240
Well, Mr. Chairman,

25:10.240 --> 25:11.240
I was right there on the highway.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.240
I was right there on the highway.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.240
The chairman,

25:13.240 --> 25:15.240
and I was just called on the very first day

25:15.240 --> 25:18.240
with reference to General Rebritz brother.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.240
But he's not made a claim by position.

25:20.240 --> 25:23.240
And I think that counsels that as well,

25:23.240 --> 25:24.240
everybody.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.240
Including the contestant, very good.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.240
Now, hold on.

25:30.240 --> 25:33.240
By position in this line of cross examination

25:33.240 --> 25:35.240
and the purpose of it is this,

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
a child has been made

25:38.240 --> 25:41.240
by Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams,

25:41.240 --> 25:46.240
the McCarthy Committee's soft preferential treatment for shame.

25:47.240 --> 25:51.240
I am now in this line of cross examination

25:52.240 --> 25:54.240
for the purpose of showing the truth

25:54.240 --> 25:56.240
and falsity of that statement.

25:57.240 --> 26:01.240
My theory being that if he were a courted preferential treatment,

26:01.240 --> 26:03.240
it is some evidence

26:03.240 --> 26:06.240
that a law that was made on his behalf by that.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.240
Number one,

26:09.240 --> 26:10.240
number two,

26:11.240 --> 26:16.240
a countercharge has been made against Mr. Stevens

26:16.240 --> 26:18.240
and Mr. Adams

26:18.240 --> 26:20.240
to the attack.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.240
That the error in effect

26:23.240 --> 26:25.240
shines of our faith

26:27.240 --> 26:29.240
as they face

26:29.240 --> 26:31.240
from time to time

26:31.240 --> 26:34.240
for the purpose of stopping

26:34.240 --> 26:37.240
some of the murderous committee from continuing

26:37.240 --> 26:39.240
investigation of what might happen.

26:40.240 --> 26:43.240
He is also a fellow-aged sword

26:44.240 --> 26:46.240
pending to prove the truth

26:47.240 --> 26:49.240
of falsity of both charges

26:50.240 --> 26:52.240
and in my opinion

26:52.240 --> 26:57.240
does not necessarily reflect on private shine.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.240
Chair, I rule that the questions are in order

27:02.240 --> 27:04.240
that we are overseeing as best we can

27:04.240 --> 27:06.240
to address the information we require

27:06.240 --> 27:08.240
with the term that publicly announced

27:08.240 --> 27:11.240
that private shines will be called in the theory.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.240
Mr. Chairman, I am a comment.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.240
Mr. Chairman, I am a comment.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.240
Mr. Chairman,

27:15.240 --> 27:17.240
if council

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
and after Mr. President

27:20.240 --> 27:23.240
will say that have you learned that it was tried

27:23.240 --> 27:25.240
instead of saying that have you learned

27:25.240 --> 27:28.240
that men were caught by cattle and back in the truck?

27:28.240 --> 27:30.240
I don't think you expect a general.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
What they finished for you?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
I don't think you expect a general

27:34.240 --> 27:36.240
as reported by young men

27:36.240 --> 27:39.240
were caught in the back end of a truck by cattle.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.240
I think the council should rephrase those questions.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.240
I love you.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.240
Mr. Chairman, I have a better way of infighting

27:46.240 --> 27:49.240
than if I lived here at Arman.

27:49.240 --> 27:52.240
I am cyst only right for finishing something.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
Do that please.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.240
I thank you very much.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.240
What if he says it?

27:57.240 --> 28:00.240
I think it is important enough, Mr. Chairman,

28:00.240 --> 28:01.240
so that

28:01.240 --> 28:05.240
I have a way to do that, so I would like to ask for that.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.240
Here.

28:06.240 --> 28:09.240
If I can, can you please introduce your group?

28:09.240 --> 28:10.240
Very well.

28:10.240 --> 28:14.240
Secretary, you understand that in my examination of you

28:14.240 --> 28:18.240
along this line, I am not assuming a stating

28:18.240 --> 28:21.240
that the hypothesis of my question is true.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.240
You understand that, but you're not.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.240
Yes, sir.

28:24.240 --> 28:28.240
The Zionist and the right Jews, you have answered in the affirmative

28:28.240 --> 28:30.240
with respect to some of my questions

28:30.240 --> 28:32.240
and with respect to some of them,

28:32.240 --> 28:34.240
you said you would never have a result of that.

28:34.240 --> 28:38.240
And there he is still that I was not a part of the question

28:38.240 --> 28:41.240
and I have no personal knowledge of the truth or philosophy

28:41.240 --> 28:44.240
of the basis of these questions.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.240
How he understands that.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.240
I would ask you, Mr. Secretary, whether or not

28:50.240 --> 28:56.240
it's true to your attention that tried to shine a lighted light.

28:56.240 --> 29:01.240
Use the telephone or telephone that's for the date.

29:01.240 --> 29:05.240
I would like to ask you, Mr. Secretary,

29:05.240 --> 29:08.240
whether you are telephone that's for the date

29:08.240 --> 29:13.240
for the purpose of calling out other parties

29:13.240 --> 29:17.240
away from the board, and particularly in New York City.

29:17.240 --> 29:20.240
Did you learn that, Mr. Secretary,

29:20.240 --> 29:26.240
or were you allowed to inform such facts existed?

29:26.240 --> 29:30.240
I believe it allowed the Jewish public to be,

29:30.240 --> 29:33.240
and what is the telephone or your telephone

29:33.240 --> 29:37.240
where are you going to be located from time?

29:37.240 --> 29:41.240
Any law in ordinance made large number of times.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.240
Did you learn that?

29:42.240 --> 29:45.240
I learned that's better than he used to call,

29:45.240 --> 29:47.240
but I don't know how many times.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.240
Did you learn the legacies made?

29:50.240 --> 29:54.240
Five of chimes of from time to time?

29:54.240 --> 29:57.240
All the girls in New York City

29:57.240 --> 30:00.240
from the telephone that's for the date

30:00.240 --> 30:03.240
that he elected with his soul and did so sometimes

30:03.240 --> 30:06.240
as many as four times a day.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.240
Did you learn that?

30:07.240 --> 30:08.240
No, sir.

30:08.240 --> 30:12.240
I didn't know about that.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.240
Did you learn that, Mr. Secretary,

30:16.240 --> 30:22.240
I believe you have stated by way of an overall question

30:22.240 --> 30:28.240
that you did learn and knew from time to time

30:29.240 --> 30:33.240
that, starting with a special privilege is our commitment

30:33.240 --> 30:36.240
with the party of private China for date.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.240
Is that correct?

30:38.240 --> 30:42.240
Mr. Dagnopart, feel as if I should make a statement

30:42.240 --> 30:44.240
in a little short one of you.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.240
You may answer it and then you may end the nation

30:47.240 --> 30:50.240
you desire to give.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.240
How's that, sir?

30:53.240 --> 30:56.240
Fire will be different.

30:59.240 --> 31:05.240
We pause ten seconds now for station identification.

31:05.240 --> 31:11.240
This is WABC New York, AM and FM.

31:15.240 --> 31:21.240
I'm back to the hearing of Mr. Stevens' testimony.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.240
I heard about all of us once you were talking

31:24.240 --> 31:26.240
about your afterwards.

31:26.240 --> 31:31.240
Now my instruction to General Ryan as commanding General

31:31.240 --> 31:35.240
was the fourth day of death holds.

31:35.240 --> 31:40.240
Why is it very, it was a sample command

31:40.240 --> 31:42.240
for the turn after the authority of the political woman

31:42.240 --> 31:44.240
carry out?
