WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
Because this is not seen to be something that is the date,

00:03.360 --> 00:04.360
and that is not.

00:04.360 --> 00:05.760
I said over the time of the check,

00:05.760 --> 00:07.200
and I have another copy of Mr. Chairman.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.880
With your permission, may we proceed to the right?

00:08.880 --> 00:09.720
I'm just in the record.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.680
Marked the appropriating division number.

00:11.680 --> 00:12.180
Go up.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.400
I'm referring here in the specific code.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.000
Part two of our government's printing

00:20.000 --> 00:23.160
out of the hearing center, on page 166,

00:23.160 --> 00:25.200
Monday's grade, which is an administrative order,

00:25.200 --> 00:27.480
referring to the executive order, which

00:27.480 --> 00:31.520
is a great concern here.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.800
Just one or two great things, Mr. Adam.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.560
I believe you described it from the details,

00:35.560 --> 00:37.160
a telephone conversation, which you

00:37.160 --> 00:40.080
said you had with me on December 11.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.880
Remember that, sir?

00:41.880 --> 00:44.160
That's the telephone conversation with reference

00:44.160 --> 00:45.560
to shines weekday.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.760
The weather is at Saturday morning availability.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.520
Yes, that's what Mr. Mr. Adam is about.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.480
I stated that if there were a great conversation on either

00:53.480 --> 00:56.400
the afternoon of December 4th or December 11th,

00:56.400 --> 01:00.440
I believe you originally stated that if December 11th,

01:00.440 --> 01:02.960
I don't care much for paper.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.720
Now, I think I had faith in something

01:04.720 --> 01:07.280
that wasn't sure which of it was in the end of the slide.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.520
All right, together, you can drive.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.560
I believe in the original report you were

01:14.560 --> 01:17.560
debated with the afternoon of December 11th.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.200
My name's Greg, and that's Professor Chad St.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.920
Frank Bobby, take my work that I've done.

01:21.920 --> 01:26.120
And if I'm wrong, I'll show you who's the Welsh Mike.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.360
Correct me.

01:28.360 --> 01:34.040
Now, in that conversation, I believe you say that I

01:34.040 --> 01:36.440
abused you and used my two-footed of language,

01:36.440 --> 01:39.560
and it was thoroughly unfudent there.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.160
Yes, director.

01:41.160 --> 01:41.680
Yes.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.960
What would be thoroughly inconsistent with your story,

01:43.960 --> 01:46.680
and if there were not, in that same conversation,

01:46.680 --> 01:48.960
you asked me to contact and relative of yours

01:48.960 --> 01:53.720
and talk on a secure theater ticket to them and to you?

01:53.720 --> 01:55.560
Well, I certainly wouldn't do that.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.200
I've been abused in New Orleans using opportunities

01:58.200 --> 02:00.520
which have been following a front of the conversation.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.680
There were a commission conversations,

02:02.680 --> 02:05.040
I think, that afternoon, to come.

02:05.040 --> 02:10.880
And as I had testified before, when we had difficulty

02:10.880 --> 02:14.520
over the telephone or phase space, it was getting involved.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.000
There could be some building conversation and then

02:17.000 --> 02:17.880
a good amount.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.640
And there's only an end, and you might have

02:19.640 --> 02:21.320
asked me to get these tickets to you

02:21.320 --> 02:23.440
and get out in seatable.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.920
Did you cancel the order in the 12th?

02:26.920 --> 02:30.560
I don't recall the conversation exactly.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.040
My face.

02:31.040 --> 02:33.960
Now, Mr. Adams, do you think you might have forgotten

02:33.960 --> 02:35.920
the public committees that they were considerable talk

02:35.920 --> 02:39.400
about General Lawton on that afternoon?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.000
Well, I think I would have forgotten too,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.120
because I don't remember.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.800
You remember him here, right?

02:44.800 --> 02:45.600
I do not.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.960
Do you remember asking me to close any people in New York

02:47.960 --> 02:51.280
and in New Jersey about General Lawton possibly

02:51.280 --> 02:53.520
raising an appointment for you and me jointly

02:53.520 --> 02:56.200
to talk to some people about them the next week?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.120
I remember a conversation we had.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.760
I don't isolate today, and I remember the reason

03:02.760 --> 03:05.920
that you said you were concerned about General Lawton,

03:05.920 --> 03:07.760
at least in which we knew each other.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.960
With a few similar lessons, I don't remember.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.560
Well, maybe over the weekend, you think

03:12.560 --> 03:13.400
you could think about it.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.560
No, I don't think I could isolate when that conversation was.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.680
Well, could you tell us this, or do you

03:18.680 --> 03:21.440
recall now that the conversation in which you

03:21.440 --> 03:24.040
asked me and I, on a checklist, and I don't think

03:24.040 --> 03:25.800
it was a problem, and I'm very happy to do it,

03:25.800 --> 03:28.520
so call in hand to the yours as they might remember

03:28.520 --> 03:31.760
the long mentioned here in Brooklyn, and arrange a theater

03:31.760 --> 03:33.960
party for the next week when you invite

03:33.960 --> 03:36.440
to convene in New York, to do recall for us,

03:36.440 --> 03:39.080
whether that was not the very conversation which you said

03:39.080 --> 03:43.160
yesterday, I abused you and used obscenities, following

03:43.160 --> 03:44.280
unpleasant situations.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.120
I don't remember, Mr. Collins, as you know,

03:46.120 --> 03:47.320
we talked many times.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.800
Well, what is it for me?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.120
What may they remember?

03:50.120 --> 03:51.360
This one is really important to me.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.560
I understand that I would suggest to the committee

03:53.560 --> 03:55.820
that if in fact I had abused you and used you in the

03:55.820 --> 03:58.080
committee, there would be quite a consistency

03:58.080 --> 03:59.920
when I change conversation.

03:59.920 --> 04:03.280
So, ask me to put myself out for the point of time

04:03.280 --> 04:04.560
fighting here in Brooklyn.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.480
And my recollection, Mr. Collins, is that on that afternoon,

04:07.480 --> 04:09.880
we talked about three times.

04:09.880 --> 04:14.640
My record, or a record, and what records I have indicated

04:14.640 --> 04:17.160
that we talked many times, that I had stated

04:17.160 --> 04:19.040
our relationship was getting close.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.920
There were times when we could talk in a very friendly

04:20.920 --> 04:22.680
relationship as you well know.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.040
There were times when that was not the case.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.040
Well, I'm addressing myself particularly for what happened

04:28.040 --> 04:30.320
on that particular win at war, that I talked to you

04:30.320 --> 04:33.800
about that theater party that I was planning to ring.

04:33.800 --> 04:34.880
I don't remember.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.400
Well, so I was in December.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.440
Well, I'm suggesting to you, sir, it was in this very

04:38.440 --> 04:41.880
conversation in which you said I abused you and used

04:41.880 --> 04:44.520
all sorts of obscenities and created a story

04:44.520 --> 04:45.960
on certain situations.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.520
I wondered if you think of me from health

04:47.520 --> 04:49.240
and search your memory on that point.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.480
But I can either agree or disagree, because I don't

04:51.480 --> 04:53.320
remember what conversation it was.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.600
Well, can you recall whether or not you asked me to call

04:55.600 --> 04:58.200
your aunt, see if I could get tickets for a certain show,

04:58.200 --> 05:01.520
and then call you back in Washington.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.280
We thought whether or not I had 60.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.120
I recall a conversation about that.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.400
I recall what you agreed to do.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.160
It was very gracious about things like that.

05:09.160 --> 05:09.920
You always were.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.240
This was during the...

05:11.240 --> 05:12.720
That's right.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.480
I'm not sure it was during one of the difficult conversations.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.240
I see.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.560
Now, anyway, there was a difficult conversation

05:19.560 --> 05:21.360
in December 11, does that right?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.680
Well, about four before that.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.960
Oh, yes, there were.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.800
And did you...

05:26.800 --> 05:28.360
Did this act as little theater party actually

05:28.360 --> 05:30.440
come off on December 16th?

05:30.440 --> 05:31.160
Yes, it did.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.320
So in any event, I did get you the tickets

05:33.320 --> 05:36.000
and did arrange the thing for you after that.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Well, if you remember after these events,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.360
if you remember Mr. Cohn, we sat together in your office

05:41.360 --> 05:43.040
in New York on December 16th.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.840
And I said that I had decided I was going to go to the theater

05:45.840 --> 05:48.440
that night, and I had no luck on tickets.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.120
You teleponed two or three friends of yours in my presence.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.080
I don't know who it was, you teleponed.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.160
And one of them gave you a choice.

05:55.160 --> 06:00.160
It was two or three quarters there were tickets,

06:00.160 --> 06:02.840
and I selected Wonderful Town,

06:02.840 --> 06:05.160
played the role of the Rodlin Wattle with it.

06:05.160 --> 06:09.040
And you were arranged for the tickets tonight, did you know?

06:09.040 --> 06:10.080
Well, if they're out in the thing,

06:10.080 --> 06:11.560
you've all but firted in USV.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.480
And I, again, want to make it very clear,

06:13.480 --> 06:15.720
I don't think there was a flight attendant for Friday.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.200
And I was very happy to do it.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.000
Didn't you ask me to arrange for a little dinner

06:21.000 --> 06:22.600
for you and your family prior to that?

06:22.600 --> 06:25.400
And so on the first front, they call off the make of reservation?

06:25.400 --> 06:26.200
Well, that's quite correct.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.760
You asked me if I asked you if you didn't make a reservation for me

06:28.760 --> 06:29.880
so I could get a table.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.640
So this was after I had paid me,

06:32.640 --> 06:34.360
upfrontly, and abuse of time.

06:34.360 --> 06:34.880
Is that all?

06:34.880 --> 06:35.560
Yes.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.160
Oh, yes.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.600
It was each week.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.440
It was sweet.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.920
I'm glad you're here.

06:39.920 --> 06:44.920
I still miss the random food that your cold of life

06:44.920 --> 06:47.480
would be such food that you felt no reluctance

06:47.480 --> 06:50.040
in accessing the hospitality of myself and my family

06:50.040 --> 06:51.720
tonight after you've played.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.600
You were wet and primed.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.640
I was caught on a spot.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.320
I've already described the circumstances

06:56.320 --> 06:59.640
of accepting the hospitality of yourself and your family.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.920
I've stated that I thought your mother

07:00.920 --> 07:02.280
in thought of a very gracious tune

07:02.280 --> 07:03.120
you made where I was.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.520
I appreciate it.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.480
But that was the day after a fully-spreaded ticket flight.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.480
That is correct.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.920
I think now that you're out of foot, come up to the weekend.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.240
You testified here.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.840
But you said I think I abused you more than all the other people

07:16.840 --> 07:19.920
you've brought to a family prior to being

07:19.920 --> 07:22.280
in a new topic we're saying that we said so 10 o'clock.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.080
Monday night.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.760
You have job heard, chairman, mudd and outs.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.120
If the committee will hold its next session at 10 a.m. on Monday,

07:34.120 --> 07:35.120
one.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.920
And with the cross examination of Mr. Adam and Vice-Cone,

07:41.920 --> 07:43.840
who is one of the principals in this case,

07:43.840 --> 07:46.240
an adaptive in session comes to a conclusion.
