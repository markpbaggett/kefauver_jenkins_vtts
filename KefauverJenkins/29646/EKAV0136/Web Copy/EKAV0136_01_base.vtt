WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I was given promoted, as I said so often before.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Successfully and repeatedly and finally up to BAA.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Private, now, let me answer.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Now, let me answer this person and make sure the list that you're going to submit.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
Do you feel that all the officers who are here are necessary to this year?

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
I do, Senator D. The arrangement that I have is that, Jeff,

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
I expect those members of my staff who may be necessary in connection with them all,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
in fact, out on the table on any phase of this investigation that should be here with me.

00:39.000 --> 00:52.000
For me, as you listen, Mr. Hensel, as in, a few personal, let's put this for your regularity,

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
not as they represent all the military, but as the emergency agents, or representing the first

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
of the agents, to enable the department.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
Do you feel that it's proper to supply Mr. Hensel with frankly very confident army personnel

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
that said they are happy and tellable?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Or do you think they'll be finished by any person?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
My personal personal personal is Jalaghan.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Why do you think they have a man named Mr. Hensel?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Mr. Hensel has to fight a part of the man named Mr. Hensel.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I am the man named Mr. Hensel.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I am the man named Mr. Hensel.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
But I would like to finish the question.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I will not answer.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I will finish the question.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Please proceed with the questioning.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
When you read me the last word of my person, you will all the time in the world with counsel to object.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
I just want you to stop the task to fight and put it in the form of the last two words of my personal personal.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Do the last two words like you take up?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Okay.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I will not answer.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Please go.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Read the whole thing out.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Read the entire question.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
No, not on my time, Mr. Jalaghan.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Now just be me and your general and I will be comforted.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Thank you very much.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Read the entire question please.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Question, question.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
Let me answer you, Mr. Hensel has an excuse to personal, but I put it this way, irregularity.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Not as irrelevant about the military, but while he was purchasing representative,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
representative for purchasing it for the neighborhood law.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
And do you feel it is profit is the blood of Mr. Hensel with a shot of the very amount of the Army personnel who sit here at a jail poll?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Why do you think?

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
Because of the very early length that Mr. Hensel should reply to a fire of his own unilaterable counsel.

02:46.000 --> 02:56.000
And before he leaves up, Mr. Stevens of the megastare is right there in the project.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
May I come that down, Mr. Hensel?

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
No comments that you would make a point of what if you have one.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
It's already appears in the records that I have in the voice, my own counsel.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Senator McCarthy was here and heard that statement, mad.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
And the implications these men are here to assist me is not a proper one.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
And here's in my opinion enough that Senator McCarthy to testify as he has continuously tried to do.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I have checked the magazine here.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
The counsel, that's his request.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
If he was a relevant question in my opinion, if his father for the purpose of a listening from this witness,

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
his interest or lack of interest is prejudice by our otherwise.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
And it is my opinion of advice to the committee that the question should be answered.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
I have asked the counsel the point of what they told me to do in the Secretary of the Department of the question.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Could you and do with the interruptions?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I have a question, David.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
A little behind on that question.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Do you have the question, David?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
If I may say, it will be David.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Time off on a speaking evening.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Ah!

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
The reporter is rereading this question.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
We pause ten seconds for station identification.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
WNYC, New York City's own station.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Back to the committee room, the caucus room in the Senate office building.

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
Where Secretary of the Army Stevens has passed over a list to Senator McCarthy.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Apparently a list of those officers which are here.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
The reporter is now rereading that or another earlier question.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
And let's go back to the testimony.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
You were investigating for the mail in the office.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Do you feel that the property is a blindedard?

05:07.000 --> 05:15.000
A good attack is very confident property personnel who sit here at a jailboat or do you think?

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
Or do you think that Mr. Hentley can be required to hire his own legal counsel?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Happy?

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Mr. Chairman, I think any of the questions read this.

05:41.000 --> 05:56.000
In my opinion, the question, please suppose the existence of the fact that there are certain army personnel sitting beside Mr. Hentley advising him.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
And in view of the connotation of that question,

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
I reverse myself and hold up the question as it has been asked is improper.

06:08.000 --> 06:16.000
But the senator of course would have the right to first ask as a predicate to his question now under consideration.

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
Whether or not there are certain members of the Army that you want to present.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I think the most of all they can have after us.

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
Mr. Hentley, Mr. Chairman, we risk in guilt and the sustainment of Mr. Hentley is finally right here and I'm getting 5D.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Kind of Wisconsin, you are seeing that with Mr. Dr. who is quite well taken.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I am his back in again.

06:38.000 --> 06:48.000
Mr. Stephen was a three army officers, a general, two full officials, one setting these five of Mr. Hentley.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I take your questions.

06:50.000 --> 07:04.000
Two two gentlemen and one two staff general sitting here, one behind Mr. Hentley, two to his wife.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Question, have they here, here you age Mr. Hentley?

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
They are here to represent the Department of the Army with me.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Are they here for the purpose of helping Mr. Hentley?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
They are here for the purpose of helping me and by me to call upon.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Question, are they here also for the purpose of helping Mr. Hentley?

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
No, that's not Mr. Hentley, has already testified that he has his own counsel.

07:27.000 --> 07:35.000
Then we have to get to the, let me get them to the kind of names of each of them.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Can I have the names that you have been on?

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
Oh wait, it's time for Honour and I'll say it's next, seated next to Mr. Hentley.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
And General Cappy is on his left, and General Hentley is on his left.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
My lady is sitting in the second row.

07:52.000 --> 08:02.000
Mr. Chairman, I want to make a point which may seem rather important but we've been shifting and seeing your arrangement down here.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
So off on the understanding is that Mr. Hentley was a part of the industry.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
And he's sitting here with his counsel at the table.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
If these young women are not here to beg your pardon.

08:18.000 --> 08:26.000
If the officers are not here to ask Mr. Hentley, then I think they should adhere to the agency of Mr. Stephen.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I think they should move back if Mr. Stephen.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't like to have a man with some bad records.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
I can see they got outstanding combat records prepared from the ribbons they wear.

08:37.000 --> 08:45.000
I don't like to have them sitting here and lending dignity to Mr. Hentley by sitting at his left.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
The lawyer has been sitting here with him now.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
That was best of fun to work with.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
I think that, my mom was uncold for the Senate of McCarthy ought to be asked to apologize for that.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm happy to share this.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
May the chair remain in the audience for the final time.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Mr. Hentley, I have a question for Mr. Hentley.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
Mr. Hentley, the chair remain in the audience for the final time that your here is the guest of the committee.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
There are no manifestations of approval or disrequival.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
And I ask if that will be definitely important.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Are you ready to point out, lawyer?

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
I am quite ready to apologize for the request for an apology to Mr. Hentley.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
I do not think that we're more of a senator McCarthy about my dignity with law.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
I think I have plenty of dignity and deserve glory than I have.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Your statement will be in front of the committee.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
Mr. Chair, there is no power against the force to apologies on the part of any of the participants.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
You could request one, sir.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
There's nothing I can do with them.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Mr. Chairman, do you want to ask your final audience?

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I am anxious that we should finish with this witness tonight.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
You know it is repulsive to be to run over time, but to my time willing and glad to.

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
I hate to take these precious moments discussing, steaming the race, but you have seen it in the entire place.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
The point of order gave me go on with the hearings, sir.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Very well.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And I'm a proud member of the committee, very much.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
Mr. Stevens, who is the owner of the Supreme Court of General Secretary of State Council?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Who now?

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Mr. Chair, we go on with the hearings tonight.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I happen to know.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
I happen to know the federal verdicts there, because I have to have his there.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
He's helped with being there, but I don't want for some extra attention of the chair,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
but don't run any down there, much of mine.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I don't want the general in the office of my list, no rule.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I just want to make one order.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
My question was, Mr. Stevens.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
So the report of a deadline statement, I said, I don't want the GMM testifying Mr. Daviro.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
Mr. Stevens, did you order the true counsels of the general secretary, Mr. Hamilton?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
My arrangement is not a McCarthy.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
In your order, Mr. Members, the minds that are after the necessary security,

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
for the armed with me will come here, and for as far as what they said,

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
I don't care what they said as long as they're available to me.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
A very little bit is perfectly appropriate, or counsel for the army side of this country,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
if you see it at the end of the table, and they all know that every day I believe

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
with the members of the McCarthy group, which is very ridiculous to have this one testimony.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
The general of the two journals are not counseled to which are counseled,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
and I'll go to the committee.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
The counsel will be here to counsel.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
The committee runs down the street, and he has the right to have the seat in the thousand of the tables

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
with the rest of the committee on board, and I don't want any of the carries entirely,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
rather than any of them.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Yes, but on the out-of-the-right system, they are sitting right.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
And then I'm going to receive the number of members of the committee.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
We don't know any of the categories, but it's right, since that was a double-defeated statement.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
When this was handled, we were advised that the members of the committee are general of the mills,

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
and the members of the committee are general of the mills.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
I say a lot from Germany, reason for attendance with us.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Major general A&E on assignment chiefs to stay up to the one-person meal, reason for attendance,

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
advised us the army with the person in personnel matters.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
The Colonel calls to the assignment office of the chiefs,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
and we are going, reason for attendance.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
The Vice-Senator McCarthy reads this list of officers.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
We want to make this announcement for the last two hours ABC radio's been bringing you on the scene coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
direct from the Senate office, Billy, and Washington.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
At this time, due to a prior commitment of the network and many of its affiliate stations,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
we must leave the hearings for five minutes.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
After that, our live direct coverage will resume.

13:22.000 --> 13:33.000
Major GA-I-VM assignments, office of the judge advocate general, reason for attendance, legal assistance.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
Corporal James R. Frank from the assignment, messenger office chiefs, and staff reasons for attendance, messenger.

13:40.000 --> 13:51.000
Mr. Secretary general, Ridgeway to chiefs, staff, I've been here for some time.

13:51.000 --> 13:59.000
And Lieutenant General, I'll sit when, sir, deputy chiefs, staff.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
Also, Major, Major General George, back, deputy chiefs, staff.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.000
Because if you're feeling as all of those officers are necessary to prepare your case in regards to private time,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
it's point of order to come.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Senator, what's the...

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
How I'd give the...

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
...differentation is that those people are in the room.

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
And I think they should be identified if they're not in the room, but available to be in the room and to request the Secretary of the Army.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
And I think that matter ought to be made clear now.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
Mr. Secretary, I have my understanding of Secretary for finding a list of those who were in the room.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Am I incorrect about that?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Mr. Chairman, what was that?

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
Mr. Chairman, the list of the Senator who was reading from the list of the Secretary for the Army,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
you look people are in the room.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Well, he just read off the name of General Ridgeway and General Bath, for example.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
And they're not here.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Very well, the most is not here for me.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
General Lemnitz, sir, is not here.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
The January list?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
No, they were not on the list.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
We're the most important reading, because I keep a letter here and read.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
We'll report a read exactly what I said.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Why don't we get through some other thing they have been here previously?

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
So there's no question about what I said.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Mr. Chairman, may I make an observation?

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
I'm not a Secretary, I'm not a Secretary.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
As I understand, Senator McCarthy has just read a list of those persons, Mr. Secretary,

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
representing Army personnel, which list you have purchased.

15:36.000 --> 15:45.000
If his mind is standing to he ask you a simple question to with, whether or not General Ridgeway and some other...

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
A general back has been here previously, to the day or to this time.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Now they didn't you.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
If the election without the matter, if you will simply answer that question.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
They have been here.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I'll have this in the future.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Every other person has been asked it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
They've been here previously.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I think the question will continue.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
You can give me all of these officers who are necessary.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You'll prepare the case.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And all the private funds.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I didn't think so, they wouldn't be here.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
So, do you think they're all necessary?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yes, sir.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Well, if you think so, I assume you'll have them here.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
No.

16:24.000 --> 16:36.000
General, is it true that the order of us November 24, 1953, you call General Black, the office?

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
Does that time you indicated that you're very much disturbed over the fact that General Washington,

16:43.000 --> 16:53.000
the Commanding General of Fort Monmouth, had made a statement, paying tribute to the investigation,

16:53.000 --> 17:02.000
and also indicating the various institutions which the Communist, the Wiener, who he had to suspend,

17:02.000 --> 17:10.000
receive their education, and that you asked back to give you a report on that,

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
and get the next election.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Welcome, Mr. Chairman, I object to the question.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
You are at 22nd, Mr. Roosevelt.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Yes, the question is far too long.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I can't understand it.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Well, the time has never been questioned down in the shortest region, so the delicious thing,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
and we can't go into it.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
I think the question is not whether Mr. Roosevelt's understanding of the number of festivals

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
does.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Do you understand the question, Bob?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
It's too long for me, Senator Chote.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Either re-read or broken down.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
How about I'll break it down in a year, if you're up next to the politics?

17:42.000 --> 17:52.000
Did you call General Black, your office, oner of us, November 24, 1953, in regard to General

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Washington, the Commanding Officer, at the radar intelligence at Fort Monmouth?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
I did.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
You did.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
And at that time, were you considerably disturbed, as well as reinforce the General Washington,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
had complimented the committee?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
No, I wasn't disturbed about that.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
At that time, were you considering relieving General Lawton of his command?

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
Did I testify before that the matter was had received or was receiving at that time some consideration?

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
Now, Mr. Secretary, let me say this for your protection.

18:27.000 --> 18:34.000
General Black has made a statement, and I don't consider him making many witnesses at all.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I think he's loyal to you.

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
I know that your memory may be bad, and I'll testify in your day after the other pressure.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
It'll be as relative.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
As you know, I have no personal animosity toward you.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
I'm here at the time, Mr. Chairman's time, as you might.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Mr. President, you may be fired.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Mr. Stewart, you need to get a charity and fire from the members of the committee.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
What the patient is, is approximately 30.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
We want to scour you, nothing to go around now, I think you want to reach it.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
The chairman of the chair is going to be at the ball.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
We just need to be refabricated.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
Mr. Chairman.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Mr. Chairman, the right-hand man's charity, and we'll never find out the members of the committee

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
whether they prefer to be set for the chairman.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Or to continue for the president.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
I would suggest to find out from Senator McCarthy how much longer his interrogation will be,

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
and if it takes some time, why then would it happen?

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
We've grown old, but it's not that it's just as nice.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I am.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
There's a certain evidence that any idea how much longer we need to decide to interrogate him with.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
I have no idea of doing that because I don't know how long it will take to listen.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Thanks firmly with us.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Man, I say this, but while I'm on the member of the committee,

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
being chairman of the parent committee, I have a deep interest in the question of,

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
which is a sign of our opinion as efficiently, weight of money.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I think the longer we carry this on, the greater the weight.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
I think we should follow some of our partners who just have made this more known,

20:23.000 --> 20:31.000
have longer sessions of nice sessions, and somehow, yet really this red minimal burlesque for each.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Senator, have any idea how long it will take him to conclude his interrogation?

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I have no idea much from long with the chairman.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Not too long.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
Do you think in the possibility of completing your action to prevent an indirection

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
of maybe five o'clock?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
You mean if I have that time without a direction?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
I have that in the rough.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I have to find out where I'm at.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I dealt with the chairman of the other summaries who would read about that,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
and I think the label won't be the time of the time.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Most people just got a chance to have a riot and make the day of the included interrogation

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
for the UNESCO World Heritage Center.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
But we have rules here in support of the UNESCO World Heritage Center.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
We're going to try to follow them.

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
And I'm not going to leave anybody at half hour's time without interruption.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Say that now and that will hold good through these hearings.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
We're going to follow these rules.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
How may I focus the discussion out of the final question?

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
Do you want to reach out now, or do you prefer to continue with another order?

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
I'm not here to remember this as my subcommittee to serve me just now to raise your hand.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
I'm not here to prefer it to start in with another order.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I'm here to defend my defense.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
I'm standing in front of the security room.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I'm not a secretary.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
I don't know any reason why we walked in continuing, definitely.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
We're going to witness the energy we just put about on the riot.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Our line of time is going to find out if you want to start with another order.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
I think the vote is in favor of continuing to apply.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
If you're taking to get you for the question.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
No further questions, Mr. Chair.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Chair has done it this time, sir.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
In the comments.

22:52.000 --> 23:08.000
In order to expedite this proceeding, I can best the chauvin make my contribution to bringing the interrogation of this witness to an end by passing.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Under there.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Energy rejected.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Stand in the pot.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Stand in the pot.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Enemy go ahead.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
No questions.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Any other questions?

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
I guess we're right at the last press of the press that are up there.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
I thought that Mr. Steven, you know I have no personal animal state here at you.

23:40.000 --> 23:48.000
Therefore, I think in front of the CEO, I should tell you that we have a statement from General Bygge.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
I believe in complete freedom of nature.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Excuse me.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I'll be careful.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I knew the senator he got.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I'm just in the chair here with 20 working.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Yes, I assume the senator is offering this statement in evidence.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Do I know?

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Alive that might have a similar council then.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
This statement was taken by council as president of the summary.

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
As prepared by my staff being a summary, I assume it would not be a visible evidence.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
The summary by General Bygge said last night.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Well, in that event I would like to introduce the senator.

24:26.000 --> 24:41.000
I apologize the committee is entitled to use any document he has before him to request his recollection with respect to questions to the secretary and not statements of facts.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Yes.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Any other questions?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Yes, sir.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Any other questions?

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
May I say to the senator who looked at the committee and was chairman of the map.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
This is the summary.

24:53.000 --> 25:01.000
I have no objection at all to this being read by the secretary before he answers my questions or a Mr. Weld or many members of the committee.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
It so happens by only one chapter.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
It so happens only one copy is very brief.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
If anyone, any members are credited, they're welcome to.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I assume it's magic.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yes, sir.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Chairman.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Senator McCarthy, proceed with the interrogation of the witness.

25:18.000 --> 25:41.000
All right, then, uh, Mr. Secretary, did you indicate to General Bygge that you were very disturbed because General Lawton and the speech had paid tribute to the manner in which our investigation at Fort Monmouth was conducted?

25:42.000 --> 25:54.000
I had talked to, uh, to, uh, General Bygge about General Lawton and, uh, little worried about his judgment in respect to certain matters.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
You talked to me also about General Lawton, did you not?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
I've missed your address, I think, there.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
You also talked to Dr. Romulus.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I don't have the memory.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
I don't know if you recall that you talked to me, you said that.

26:06.000 --> 26:15.000
Well, I didn't coach you for a bit, and with that recall, you said that there was a possibility of a few mubbies to man, you said you were disturbed because of the judgment.

26:15.000 --> 26:29.000
And, uh, I asked you what the strategy, and you said because you admitted speech in which you pointed out what particular university most of these suspenders and people got their education.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
You recall, uh, in General Yavsert.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
No, I recall that information, I don't recall the conversation with you, Senator.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
But then that was roughly what you were describing.

26:40.000 --> 27:00.000
I was disturbed about some of the things that were reported to me as in that speech, incidentally, I know that it's important, but I, I, I, as Secretary of the Army, Senator, I, I dislike them, tends way to discuss the individual personal situation of one of our acting, commanding generals.

27:00.000 --> 27:17.000
If it's essential to the getting of all the facts on the table, I am of course prepared to do it, but I hope that you'll bury them on if you can, of course, if, uh, it's, uh, it's a fine, professional man, and he still in command of Port Mama.

27:17.000 --> 27:24.000
When we are saying, Mr. Doom, that I have the highest respect for General Wall.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
I think he is one of the most outstanding generals, with the way I've ever come in contact.

27:29.000 --> 27:40.000
The reason you're being questioned at this point is because of all the information, which came to us through various sources, including your man, John Allen.

27:40.000 --> 27:56.000
So the effect that you were going to remove him with my arm, after you're two awkward with the commission, I am now interrogating you as to whether or not he's as true as that is the reason why you're going to remove him or get some other reason.

27:56.000 --> 28:17.000
No, that was not the reason. That was not the reason. Now, did you tell General Blank when you called into your office on November 24th of last year that one of the reasons why you were very much disturbed, apparently the word is exercised, about law, and the effect of your duty.

28:17.000 --> 28:34.000
You submitted your first thing, and you just worked one month investigation. The thing that I really remember talking to Senator Pacquiao was the mention of these colleges and universities, it seemed to me that that was outside the scope of his activity.

28:34.000 --> 28:53.000
Well, I'm a secretary, I am not asking you to let me out. If you were very much disturbed because you've probably lost him, felt friendly for a good guy, because often since we were doing a good job, if you discuss that with a guy, you should've been more removed from that.

28:53.000 --> 29:15.000
I remember talking with General Pacquiao, certainly that was right in my office. I was disturbed for the reason that I've given, and I felt it was something that I had to give for any consideration to.

29:15.000 --> 29:35.000
As I say once again, I just, it just really needs my heart out there to talk about one of our fine new-and-all officers in this way, because I just recognize the senator that he is still there, he's doing a good job, there was no change in the way.

29:35.000 --> 29:43.000
Did you get any came through, Pawn? Did you feel he was doing a good job when you were considering removing him?

29:44.000 --> 29:57.000
Obviously, if I was to have any worries about him or any other officer, I would, if I didn't have, I wouldn't be considering and taking any action.

29:58.000 --> 30:07.000
This is a little person, Mr. Sarkar, you said he was doing a good job, with that I hardly agree, the first is, did you think we were doing a good job?

30:07.000 --> 30:13.000
At the time, as you said, you were considering removing him from that dimension.

30:13.000 --> 30:21.000
I was concerned about some of the things that he was reporting to have said in some talks that he made at Fortmont.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Did you think you'd do a good job, then?

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
I thought he was doing a good job, yes, but I was concerned about some of the material in those talks.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
You know, I didn't do any good job right then.

30:32.000 --> 30:47.000
Would you want to deny Mr. Sarkar, you under oath, that you could go general back, that one of the reasons why you were considering removing one, was because he had paid tribute,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
We do mean or do we are committing?

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
No, I would want to deny that.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I would rather we don't know.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
That's right, I'm trying my best to recall that particular conversation.

30:59.000 --> 31:08.000
A lot of while ago, I've given you the, my recollection of the senator, but I wouldn't be in a position to say that,

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
as general back might not recall something about the conversation that I don't recall.

31:13.000 --> 31:21.000
Now, as a true, that, that you talked to Mr. Bucker General back in the 24th, the interview is general law firm.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Can back it important to you?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
It's important to get that truth.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
After I talked with General back, he had turned talk with General Law, and I know that was true.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Can he back it important to you?

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
I think, yes, I think I got a memorandum from him.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
Does he come back personally just to the matter with you?

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
I don't recall, either memorandum or a visit, in any way, in any of that, he could come back.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
He has the memorandum available.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
It is.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Which puts you with the question of the chair, which is produced up in random.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
I don't know what I have a vibe here, but I don't expect it ever right there.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
Let me ask you this, does your council know the answer there?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Yes.
