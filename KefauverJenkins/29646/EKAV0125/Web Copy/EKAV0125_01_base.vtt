WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The state is a genius of insecure, and it might require a context to admit to me.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
So I understand though that they are consenting now all the principles?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
They're all here.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Mr. Chairman, I find out that that is included in the motion.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Mr. Chairman, I don't understand that the motion made by the center of March and Saw

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
means that all conversations having to do with the investigation of Communists in the military.

00:27.000 --> 00:40.000
I said all pertaining to this controversy and the front of the verse here is defined by the charges that have been filed in the specification of the parties to this controversy.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
The parties have been named.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
A new one was added to the record.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
Added to the proceedings that the Senate of Part B and Mr. Colme filed there charges and specifications.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
I asked that at the time that he made a parties to the proceedings, all parties, all principles are here.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
The Senate of Part B and Mr. Colme, I wasn't expecting to hear more from you.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Now, that's the first amendment.

01:05.000 --> 01:17.000
Do I understand that this would provide for all the moniker telephone conversations having to do with our committee's investigation of Communists in the military in flesh?

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
Relating all that to the issues that for this committee and involved in this investigation.

01:25.000 --> 01:36.000
If it's relevant to the inquiry now in progress, if they are included, if they're only irrelevant to it, they would not be included.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
I think the members of the committee understand the motion but to share much to make sure that they do before he puts it.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Any members of the committee?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
The Vice President will put the in-flight amendment on the motion.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Anybody on the roof of the roof of the roof is agreed to approve.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Any other democations?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I have the principle to be agreed to this.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
The question is, now we're going to put the motion.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Do you want to ask the principal to agree about the unmistakable of the other members?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
The javelin I understood they had agreed.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Mr. Wolf said Mr. Colme and Mr. Carvin have not been asked to be served.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I mean, they did it this way.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
Then the secretary is sitting behind me and I said I may speak for him and give his consent.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
On his end of any and all material telephone calls that are monitored are recorded.

02:21.000 --> 02:30.000
Mr. Hempsel is slightly on my right and has indicated that I may now give his consent to all of his calls.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
Mr. Adams is in sight and I observe him nodding his head so that we have his consent.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
We are lacking only Mr. Colme and Car.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Just a minute, just a minute.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
I would like to find out that we have the consent of Mr. Colme and Car.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
Mr. Chairman, I think that Mr. Carvin and Mr. Colme, I assume we're the same position we have in this,

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
that I not only consent but want all of the monetary conversations, all of the other conversations made available to the committee,

03:04.000 --> 03:14.000
but I don't want to have this intention upon getting the consent of some 50 or 20 different people of Mr. Stevens or Mr. Adams may have called.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
The example during the course of it, I know that Mr. Adams called members of this committee, other than myself.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
He called in a number of people on the hill.

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
I am not going to, I am not going to consent to put in only conversations involving whom and Car and McCarthy unless it is understood.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
And I don't think this should be based upon the consent of anyone.

03:36.000 --> 03:46.000
I think the committee, I think the committee, I think the committee by vote should order the production of all documents,

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
regardless of who objectures who consent to it, the committee has an unqualified right to do it.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I approve that, frankly, but I will not give any consent with the chair.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
I want to give the introduction of a few of the 100 telephone conversations, and I think I think Mr. Carvin and Mr. Colme,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
I don't mind Mr. Chairman, Mr. Senator from Wisconsin.

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
That it is only necessary to get to consent our full parties to a telephone conversation which is monitored.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
That this committee has power without the consent.

04:17.000 --> 04:27.000
Our party is to a conversation to subpoena and then the court, a record that they made, not some third party made,

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
a record all member and member that they made it to that.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Therefore, they only have a piece.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
The only instance in which they consent is necessary is where a telephone conversation is monitored.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Are you ready for the question?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I just like to learn, let me ask you that.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
Let's assume that Mr. Adam Cole General's record is just certain matter of him.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Do I understand that it is your fault that we just get the consent of General's record?

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Yes, we have conversation with monitored senators certainly so.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
Otherwise, we would all be valid and I'm sure that Mr. Voucher agrees with me.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I'd make sure Attorney Wu is not the other person who leaves the record.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Which is Wicker himself may testify to the conversation.

05:18.000 --> 05:28.000
But you need third party on the line who is monitoring that conversation may not testify to it without the consent of the party on the other end of the line.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
So then, then, I'm going to have one of us drink in the work.

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
But back when we started, this means that only the material which Mr. Adams, Mr. Steven,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
that will all consider it favorable.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
We'll look at the book in the record.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
How about the coals? How about the coals they make to Chris?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
To look here.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
To Mr. O'Connor's name.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Colonel Brown.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
All up and down the line, does this mean the committee has got the girl and receive a written consent from the last number of people?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yes, sir.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
The answer is yes.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Well, Mr. Chairman, may I, as other than do, I know this must be.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
I'm not going to give you a lot of people, but the two are in the middle of this one.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
As I understand, all we need to decide now is to subcene these monitors' conversations.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Now, we have the right to get those conversations.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
We do not need the consent of any of the parties.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Correct?

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
The only possible question of doubt is to the gallery rate relates to the possible release in a public hearing or in a court.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
And how does that happen?

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
So, we have the right to subcene all these records that are relevant to this hearing.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And I think that we ought to confine it to that enact on that.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
As far as the motion goes, Mr. Chairman, say, and I don't feel that the necessity of getting consent is a point of tissue at this time.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
And we all have tried, now, of what the motion provides is the committee ready to vote.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
Say, nothing to the council, as they ask just for the tender drink, just for the boldies alone.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
One few, group of these motions.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
There will be a one-year motion as a matter of fact.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Senator, I think it's been sent downstairs.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
We're making a move.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yes, sir.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
May these hearings suggest that Senator from Arkansas restate his motion now.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
We will go down the motion as we stated. The transcript is in the cut-down step.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Let the stamina outside of his state.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Let the stamina move.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Let all them arouse them.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
All documents.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
All notes of monitor conversations.

07:43.000 --> 07:51.000
As between the fightings to this controversy and all others, that all relevant.

07:51.000 --> 08:01.000
Including all parties to this controversy, be admitted in evidence.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Be sufficient.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And I thought they were open to me.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
Why, that they be sufficient and for here and present it to this committee,

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
by a reduction in evidence in that chronological order,

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
if they are found to be material and relevant to the issues this committee is now considered.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Introduce the unit.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Introduce the unit.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Introduce the unit.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Mr. Chairman.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
I should like to say, Mr. Chairman, if I may, I'll be back tonight.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
That's part of Senator McClellan's motion.

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
Embracing the bringing of all records before this committee, monitor their otherwise.

08:59.000 --> 09:09.000
It is not necessary because this committee has that power and we're the so may do so and we're the so.

09:09.000 --> 09:25.000
The only question that I desire to specifically call to you members of this committee is the question of admissibility of monitored telephone conversations without the consent of the parties to that.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Mr. Chairman.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Mr. Chairman.

09:28.000 --> 09:36.000
We can take up each document at the time with respect to the parties involved.

09:36.000 --> 09:47.000
But we have the principles here and therefore I'm making this motion for the purpose of getting all conversations between these principles.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
Here, in respect to all prisoners, whether the poll came from one to the other by person.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
Now you've got to do it without a motion.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Well, all right, they're over here and I want to make it.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
They said they considered it as all in this list to be the right mind.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
To be the introduction of the monitor to the party.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
I want them to either object or to say it and if they object, I'm going to make the motion and let's it's a very good one.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Mr. Chairman, when I say the speaking for myself and from us are coming.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Mr. Chairman is speaking for myself. Mr. Cron. Mr. Cron.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I have, hopefully, approved of the motion just made by the center of the market.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
So I understand, like that, period.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
And the chair is called Mr. Carl.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
That is also accepted by the House.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yes, sir.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
They make the same request to Mr. Cron.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Completely accepted.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
And they agree that the monitoring of the conversation is made.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
They agree that the monitoring conversation is made in public today's policy of the sworn testimony.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
But it's the commitment.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I want the committee to get all of this material.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I want all of it in the record.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I will not consent.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
They're taking two or three or five conversations.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
Out of 100 telephone conversations having made, having no of made part of the record.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
We've seen the example of that today.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
We saw the secretary come in.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
And out of some 50 or 100 conversations, he tries to introduce one.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
I want the committee to first go over the first hurdle and get all of the monitored conversations.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Then it's up to the committee to decide what they will put in the record.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
If they decide over my objection, they will select if he will put them in.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
The committee has that right.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
But I would not consent.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
And I would advise Mr. Cron, Mr. Cron, not to consent.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
To allow a Tuesday's and Tuesday's over in the Pentagon,

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
to ripple through these conversations and pick out what should be submitted.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
Mr. McCone's motion line is telling us nearly that they've been subtenant

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and that the committee have all this information.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
Mr. Cron, I think said you can make them up one by one decide what to do with them.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
I've always thought that was a respect to relevancy or materiality.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
That question may be raised at any time when he and his testimony is presented.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
But I am making the motion to include all.

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
Not only to select one or two or a thousand but two in two or three.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
That's all relevant and material.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
So this is from the version.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I would agree with that.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
That is I am not excluding anything except you have some documents presented.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
And offered in evidence and an objection is raised to its relevancy or materiality.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Then the committee can decide that if that's not.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Mr. Chairman, but I have heard of the integration.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
We wish to make every and all the telephone conversations available.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
There will be no selection at this table as to which one's going.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
It must then all go in. That will be because Mr. Jenkins thinks that some are not material.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
They will all be available for the consent of every human being on my side of this controversy.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Now I'm your aim.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And Mr. Jenkins is the boss.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
They go in and he says, oh, I'm not a B. Does.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm a desk.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
You mean you are in evidence.

13:08.000 --> 13:20.000
I produce them for Mr. Jenkins to select and offer an evidence and they will be no objection at any point in respect to any amount of telephone conversations on my behalf of the Army.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
And I'm sure it's just the same motion made by the time this march has not just been seconded.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
He now we say so we have a film.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I seconded the film.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
It's not the second.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
The film is on.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I have a film.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
I have a film.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Hey, you're going to be on.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Then the mic is off.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
The matter of the committee will have me steady best.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
The gentleman I think every member of the committee understands my motion.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.000
The federal none of the standard are we stated or we that this the novice will maybe read it.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
You have it, sir.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
You're resetting.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Be sure.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
I have it.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Yes.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
The last one.

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
Mr. Jenkins, I'm listening all of the members of our documents, all notes of monocle conversation that between the parties in this controversy and all others that are relevant.

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
Including all parties to this controversy be defeated and brought here and presented to this committee for introduction into evidence in that chronological order.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
Just they are found to be material and relevant to the issues this committee is not considered.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
The federal and the seconded job of the committee will be to go.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And then the talk.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Aye.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Senator Jackson.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Senator Jackson.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Aye.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Senator Mark.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Aye.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Senator Shannon.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Senator Bob.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Aye.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Senator Mark.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Aye.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
It is unanimous.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Senator Bill, I will come for my committee.

14:55.000 --> 15:15.000
Mr. Lucas, I am now asking you to present our read from a transcription of the notes that you took of a telephone conversation between Senator McCarty and Mr. Stevens on November 7th, 1953.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Will you now do that?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Mr. Chairwoman.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Mr. President, this is Mr. Rick Valor, I should have a motion to file.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Senator McCarty on the room, Mr. Chairwoman, Mr. Chairwoman, Mr. President, I'm not in the front line of the order.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Mr. Jenkins, I'm not in the front line of the order.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Mr. Jenkins, I'm not in the front line of the order.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Mr. Jenkins, that's not a big highly improper.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
You've got 100 monocle conversation.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I don't know what's in this case.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
No, I don't know.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
He is not the first monocle conversation that you have.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Are they telephone conversation between Senator McCarty and Mr. Stevens?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Are they having Mr. Stevens?

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
The first monocle telephone conversation?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Mr. Dr. Jenkins, you want me to go talk to you about.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Dr. disturbing, Mr. David.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
All right.

15:55.000 --> 16:02.000
Is it the first monocle telephone conversation that you have between any of the principals in this case?

16:02.000 --> 16:09.000
So we, Senator McCarty, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Kyle, Mr. Adams, Mr. Stevens or Mr. Hanzo.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Is it or not, you know, Mr. Lewis.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I'm not related to it, sir.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.840
But it is not, Senator Chair, we have to sustain the point of work, because the motion

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
condition needs to be diminished.

16:17.840 --> 16:18.840
Final action.

16:18.840 --> 16:19.840
Then I move.

16:19.840 --> 16:28.360
Then I move, Mr. Chaps, that there's witness-be-dissimist, who are the present, with instructions

16:28.360 --> 16:35.440
to proceed, to compile and arrange all of those monocle telephone conversations in order

16:35.440 --> 16:40.360
and the gear set-form is a form and made direct for further questioning and for introduction

16:40.360 --> 16:42.360
of the problem in chronological order.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.360
No, sir.

16:43.360 --> 16:49.360
Training with him, the original motion, here's transcripts of that concrete lecture.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.360
And you're a second in the motion.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.360
I'm a second.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.360
Second in that, Dr. Potter.

16:54.360 --> 16:58.360
Without objection, the motion will be approved.

16:58.360 --> 17:02.360
You're dismissed for the time being, Mr. Lewis.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.360
Mr. Stevens, may we turn to the staff?

17:04.360 --> 17:05.360
I'm here.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.360
We'll see.

17:06.360 --> 17:11.360
I don't know whether you can see a spot or not, but it's far thirty-nine.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.360
I have a hope that I'll get to Boston tonight.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.360
How are you going to run late?

17:14.360 --> 17:15.360
No, let's witness.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.360
We'll turn around.

17:16.360 --> 17:18.360
It is now four days.

17:18.360 --> 17:21.360
I think we're not objection-we can have a meeting.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.360
We have to go Monday morning at six.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.360
Send ready.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.360
All of us.

17:25.360 --> 17:26.360
All of us.

17:26.360 --> 17:27.360
All of us.

17:27.360 --> 17:28.360
Yeah.

17:28.360 --> 17:34.360
And so ends the second day's session of the McCarthy Army hearings.

17:34.360 --> 17:37.360
We'll be back from the caucus room of the Senate Office Building in Washington.

17:37.360 --> 17:41.360
The mutual network has been bringing you on the stop coverage of the congressional hearings

17:41.360 --> 17:45.360
involving Senator Joseph Armacardi and his plural with high army officials.
