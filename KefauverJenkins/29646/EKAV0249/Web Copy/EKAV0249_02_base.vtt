WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
The next day he should have a completely queen army.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
I thought he was mistaken about that. He mentioned something about the perfecting his job as we continued.

00:28.000 --> 00:40.000
What did he say about that senator? I think he said that we were to continue that he was losing job or roughly something without a fight.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
We understand you were there Mr. Cole, Mr. Carr. That's right.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Say gay students in Miss Adam.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm just saying five against.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Thank you very much. Do you know whether or Application was invited to be first in that month?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I am told that they have a sign what was the name of that.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
You told about whom? I was told by either Mr. Carr, Mr. Cole, not the time the day it was invited to come.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
Do you have any recollection of being told that Shine was invited by either the 3k army to Adam?

01:12.000 --> 01:23.000
I know when we got there there was one vacant seat. Mr. Stephen, I think it was about Stephen.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
I mentioned the fact that he was sorry that the day it could not be there.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
I don't recall too much about that. Getting back now to the conversation on medication.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I was talking about November 6th.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
What precisely, senator, to the very best of a recollection to the second day of the day,

01:45.000 --> 01:53.000
are Mr. Adam saying his presence about your growing age to the navy or the air force?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Do you think anything?

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
I can't give you the growing age of language, but they indicate if they were unhappy about any conflict on the army.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
They indicate if they felt the navy and the air force was just as bad as the army.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
If there was no conflict on the army, there must be an navy and air force.

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
As I recall, Mr. Adam, I heard Mr. Adam's offer, Mr. Cole, information in regards to the navy.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
For the thought of language views, I don't know.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
Senator going back, he first met the secretary on the day of September,

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
upon his returns on the state of Montana. That's correct as we understand.

02:43.000 --> 02:53.000
He had read the news paper while visiting Montana that you were investigating some subversive in the army.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
I think it's a little bit difficult for that direction.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm here for the first of all, senator Dreece.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Thank you, Senator. Did he not?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You recall getting his telegrams from the secretary?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I recall getting a telegram.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I recall the telegrams indicated he was disturbed.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
My mate, you're wrong with this.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
He's disturbed about some news story that came from the Pentagon,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
indicating they would not cooperate in the investigation.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
Now when he returned, then you met him for the first time and had this conflict.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
The secretary of the army is in directly our bi-inflicted.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Indicates to you that he wanted you to.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
This continues your investigation of the army and the Fort Monmouth,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
and the large human superstages.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
No third.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
No indication of that, whatever.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
No third.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
The next meeting is I recall.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Senator was, between you and the secretary,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
was the Shine apartment in New York City on September 16th.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
You recall immediately.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I recall immediately.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I will ask you whether or not on that occasion,

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
the secretary indicated any displeasure.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Are any displeasure over your investigation of the birthings in the army?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Not that I recall, that meeting is just...

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Are any displeasure.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
Are any indications that he wanted you to turn that work over to him and allow him to proceed without you?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
I don't recall any conversation along that line.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
I think the conversation there has some bearing upon this investigation.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I briefly recites that.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
You can present it to me if you desire.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
That is the time.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
At that time, there was a question of what they have signed with you and you win them in military.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
And while Dave was there and while Roy was there, I wanted to make my position very clear.

05:00.000 --> 05:09.000
So I told the secretary that I thought it would be a great mistake if he were to give any...

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
...thing which would appear to be such a consideration with the Shine.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
I told him to lean over backwards.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
That might have been unfair to Mr. Shines.

05:19.000 --> 05:28.000
But Mr. Shines, there's some lean over backwards and handling these times is because if he did anything,

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
which might even remotely appear to be giving signs of consideration

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
about the left wing press that's been signed to stream button up to getting mitties.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Was the boy in him, the boy in the committee.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Mr. Shines, there's a great of that.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Mr. Coln was there, led to object delivery.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
And that senator, frankly, I expect to ask you a little more about that later on.

05:56.000 --> 06:09.000
But I am now trying to f-a-zane just to what extent the secretary is the Army and the Army has attempted to block your investigation of the vertices in the Army.

06:09.000 --> 06:20.000
Do you recall an executive session of your committee on or about September 21st, senator in U.R., which was attended by the secretary of the Army?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
September 21st.

06:23.000 --> 06:40.000
You have identified a meeting at which time there was a discussion about General Patrick in which time perhaps you did testify when there was some discussion allegedly between you and the secretary with respect to General Patrick?

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh, yes. That was the meeting at which General Patrick was called an executive session.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Now, who was General Patrick in what position did he hold in the Pentagon?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I don't know, in the exact title, he was head of Army intelligence.

06:54.000 --> 07:04.000
Very well. Now, you may tell about any discussion between you and the secretary with respect to the energy intelligence in the Army, General Patrick.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
Well, we have to put the cartridge in when the secretary looks into the executive session testimony.

07:11.000 --> 07:22.000
We were pressing Mr. Patrick principally about the communist line literature being used to the General Intelligence Office.

07:22.000 --> 07:37.000
That's about the 90 percent communist lines, 10 percent mild anti-communism, the usual lines, so they could point to the anti-communist material.

07:37.000 --> 07:45.000
We were pressing cartridge about 20 jules of communism to draw a matter of record of time and sentence, best I can.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
How the proceedings of that meeting been passed by?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
The amon. How?

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Now, you may go ahead and tell us just what occurred and what was said between you and the secretary.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
At least I think you're not done.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
First, let me give you the background of the meeting phrase just in one minute.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Patrick was Steven President and we always give the secretary the right to ask questions also.

08:09.000 --> 08:22.000
Patrick was asked about the particular literature produced by individuals with non-common of practice, one of whom I believe had been cited or convicted.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
The head of Army intelligence seems to think that was unimportant, that the material was all right as I recall.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
So we didn't trust him as to what he knew about communism.

08:34.000 --> 08:43.000
The admittedly it never read Mark, one of the anguished, Stalin, and the writer.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
He's talking about General Patrick, yes, remember?

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
We had a book which was under the Secretary of the Pam book written by a communist, or a communist liners.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
I forget the name, but then I said to Mr. Patrick,ë§Œ you ever read any book?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And any book can come in it.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
In order to equip yourself with its important job, and if I wanted to add something, I knew he didn't ask for the assignment.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
He might have been a good combat soldier, perhaps, but I told him it was a prohibition around whole slice.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
And Mr. Patrick, have you ever read any book?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Dealing with communism needs to get on the way back more overseas.

09:19.000 --> 09:27.000
I read such as such a book and the secretary picked up the book and said something that affects my god.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
This is the book he read as one, apparently written by a communist office.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
After that, the question arose principally between Mr. Cohn and Mr. Seedham, as to whether or not Mr. Patrick is present.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
He's part of the interrupted.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Mr. Patrick, what's the matter with Mr. Frank?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
He's a more great eight-long career.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
He's very well-made.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I'll try to act in that kind of a sense.

09:53.000 --> 10:01.000
Mr. Cohn, would you make that clear that it's not under-signed and would you make that clear that it's not tell for it's failure?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
That's the other Mr. Cohn.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Okay.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Okay.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Okay.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
How are you pretending about your own post-aguse system?

10:12.000 --> 10:20.000
We had some kind of a situation around the difficult moves to do to separate the kind of situations that I had with the secretary.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
He was talking about a book which happened at the end of the second day of hand.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I didn't get what you said.

10:25.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, the secretary picked it up with a son of a humorous thought that something is like my god here's the book he read to think him about communism as one of the books we're investigating.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I like to be written by a communist writer.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Very well.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
How do you think about it?

10:44.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, I think it's difficult Mr. Jenkins to separate the conversation which I had with Mr. Jenkins about Mr. Cohn and Mr. Parker.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
Mr. Cohn had a related to me, but in substance here was the conversation.

10:59.000 --> 11:13.000
Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Cohn felt my great-of-ins that if we were to put Mr. Parker in public display and show how incompetence he was for that particular job.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Head of our Army intelligence.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I think I can put Bob Stevens for a bit.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I mean, since this would give great aid and comfort to the enemy.

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
We told Mr. Stevens as long as he knew what the facts were.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
He seemed to be as much disturbed about Parker's lack of knowledge as we were.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
We told him we told him to be unnecessary to call Mr. Parker.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
However, we know the public hearing from time later before getting to that, Mr. Dern.

11:46.000 --> 11:54.000
Do you know whether or not Mr. Secretary, Mr. Stevens, had appointed general packages in the meeting?

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
I don't know whether he did or not.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
At that time, that is on September 21st in the executive station.

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
Dern not to Secretary, Mr. Stevens, not to have general package test as I in an open session.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
He did.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
So what reason?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Did he say it?

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
He felt that there would be no benefit for the yet all the information.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
And that it was...

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, gives a country lack of confidence in our Army intelligence if they saw this man cross the government and publicly he was.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
An executive person, and as he said, he tells us to give, I think, use the word, aid and comfort to the Army.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
Let me drive around to set these two general packages before packing them.

12:44.000 --> 12:56.000
Do you know whether or not he was in the list of those who were given a permanent rank which in a sense might be considered a promotion?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Yes, he was.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Partridge got the consideration which Washington was.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Here, Washington was in the same list.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Washington was passed over.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Partridge got the consideration.

13:08.000 --> 13:17.000
May I say Mr. Jenkins, what's this we can do to a criticism of Partridge?

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
I know that a very good Army engineer, one of the best in the Army, might be assigned to intelligence.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Completely incompetence there, no fault of his own.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I know nothing about Partridge has come back record.

13:32.000 --> 13:43.000
He may be an outstanding combat soldier for all I know, but, certainly, from quickly to this morning, incompetence has had a Army intelligence.

13:43.000 --> 13:51.000
As you stated a moment ago, it's your theory that he was a star-packing around holes that is correct.

13:51.000 --> 13:58.000
Did you have an open session in New York City on the 20th of September at 10 p.m.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
That was in Washington.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I would ask you to tell the members of this committee what occurred at that time, Senator.

14:03.000 --> 14:12.000
We heard a number of witnesses in regards to coming inside blood at your being used for indoctrination purposes.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
I had talked to Mr. Cohn before and I'm told we would not require Partridge to be present.

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
He was a secretary of state that he was making arrangements for a new assignment for him.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
It was as much shocked as we were by the testimony of Partridge.

14:32.000 --> 14:41.000
When we arrived for the hearing, I found Mr. Partridge and we were sitting back here behind the witness chair.

14:41.000 --> 14:48.000
I turned to Mr. Cohn and I said, I thought that it was not Partridge to appear.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
He said, well, I'm sure they don't, so he called Secretary Steven for what is back to me.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
That Steven said it was a mistake or a smat-proof or something like that.

14:59.000 --> 15:09.000
And after we never insisted on a fan of the end of the hearing, I felt that I could not deny Partridge the right to take the fan that he wanted to.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
So that time, and again, I'm quoting from memory that it's all been transcribed.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
I turned to Partridge and said, now, General, if you want to take the fan today, you can.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
But I would suggest that you study the testimony first and decide when you want to come back and testify.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
He took the hint and decided to study the testimony and come back later.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
And as the consequence was never called before your committee's I had to.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
That is correct, then, was removed as head of Army Intelligence.

15:44.000 --> 15:59.000
It was removed between the day September 28th and the date of October 19th, which is tied in in my mind with a post-release.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I proposed a post-release.

16:02.000 --> 16:11.000
Will there anything of any consequence that significance so distinctly or do you remember of your staff, do you know?

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Yes, by either the sexy or it sounds to her, Mr. Adam.

16:15.000 --> 16:25.000
Or is it sex to the halving or the calling off of your investigation of having it in subversive report, my mother?

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
I'm covering now the date between September 28th and October 19th.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Let me check my dates here.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
That's for a minute.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Wow, they are checking this material. Let's be trying to watch today.

16:54.000 --> 17:03.000
My chief counsel disagreed with me on this, at some extent, but I recall that

17:03.000 --> 17:13.000
there was some what you would call mild, needling, matching sports that he was about to come with, but at some point he would

17:13.000 --> 17:19.000
forget it, and he would just be called off.

17:19.000 --> 17:26.000
And they were raving each other at the beginning, one for one week or six weeks.

17:26.000 --> 17:38.000
Mr. Steven, there was a time, at the time that you regard Mr. Adam as being serious in those suggestions or in that meeting you call it.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
I think serious for nothing improper. I think he just honestly felt that the hearing should be called off.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
He felt that they could do the job.

17:47.000 --> 17:58.000
Can you recall anything specifically that Mr. Adam said in his meeting of Mr. Combe with respect to these investigations?

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
He would ask Mr. Combe how long they hearing would take, and ask me how long they would take.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
We give him an estimate. He would tell us he thought that it was too long.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
Mr. Combe said, we have to be more efficient to be able to handle this up in a day or two, and that's not a thing.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Nothing unusual in nature.

18:20.000 --> 18:28.000
Mr. Adam, Mr. Steven, had lunch with us a number of times before that October 19th, date.

18:29.000 --> 18:42.000
Again, when I would call in my older things, the last hearing should be terminated up early as the possible dates.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
No feeling developed between you and the tech-paying, is that case?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
No, we're getting on very well.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Getting on very well.

18:53.000 --> 19:08.000
The guy who did say, and I'd take it to the jury, I'd simply wish his desires of a man in the position of the tech-paying, to be allowed to do the job in himself out of a sense of pride perhaps.

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
Or a fun part of this, where the usual opposition with your friend when you start to investigate any department.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing extraordinary about it, to your mind at the back.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Nothing extraordinary at that time.

19:23.000 --> 19:33.000
I won't tell the committee about the occurrences of October 19th, when the inspection is proposed, personally.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
Prepare, as I remember, my Mr. John De Adder.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, before that, there had been a first release by the Secretary of the Foundry.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
No, I think it might.

19:48.000 --> 19:56.000
I did know on the fact that there's a recall of the first release of the 13th Amendment.

19:56.000 --> 20:07.000
Mr. Coney Coney told me to discuss a first release with him, first release with him, the first release of the 18th Amendment.

20:07.000 --> 20:17.000
The survey of the fourth-modern installation was, I told Mr. Coney that I would have no objection to issuing a press release

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
if it stayed at the fact, and that he could go ahead and work out a press release with him for it.

20:22.000 --> 20:35.000
Adam, Mr. Coney Coney, the winner or winner, I forget that Coney Coney told me that the press release indicated that we would be calling off our hearings,

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
I tell him we of course could not issue such a press release.

20:40.000 --> 20:48.000
I believe the next conversation about the press release was in the arrow plane on the way up to Fort Monmouth.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
That would be October 20th.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
October 20th.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
I want you to tell the members who this committee, what that conversation was if you will, please.

20:56.000 --> 21:11.000
Mr. Coney Coney, Adam had a press release and in the pretty good cell phone, tried to convince me that I should issue that press release after the Fort Monmouth survey.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
I told him I could not for two weeks.

21:15.000 --> 21:23.000
Number one was the release indicated we were calling off the hearings and we report for a not.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
I did not release that senator that you were calling off the hearings.

21:28.000 --> 21:37.000
We released out of the readers in so many words, I interpreted the state best, the language of the release.

21:37.000 --> 21:47.000
For example, I believe that our recent hearings have brought their names up, much more forward.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
The army should be able to finish the job we have started.

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
I interpreted that to me and I think the press would have interpreted that as meaning that the hearing grew up in him.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Can I get any one other reason for not issuing it?

22:02.000 --> 22:10.000
It tells what we found at Fort Monmouth before we got there, but we were hearing that part of the release.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
I have been very, keep in mind this is not my release, but that is.

22:16.000 --> 22:24.000
I am very favorably impressed by all that I have seen today at Fort Monmouth and all Southern William Press.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I think that's a farce to each other.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
I have been very favorably impressed by all that I have seen today at Fort Monmouth.

22:31.000 --> 22:40.000
Now, that other word goes as the word he says is Mr. Adams is fitting in your mouth for you to stay before you ever got to Fort Monmouth.

22:40.000 --> 22:46.000
Well, he doesn't look in my mouth, but I am saying, as I am saying, he is telling us that he tried today.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yes, that's right.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
And that was before you got to Fort Monmouth before.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Now, that is right.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
And for those two reasons you say, you should issue that person.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
No, that is right.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
If you retire, that's right.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
And also, I think I told Mr. Adams about that.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Thank you.
