WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.640
and

00:15.640 --> 00:19.640
You have to start out the morning.

00:19.640 --> 00:24.640
I'd be fantastic by welcoming I guess to have come in to the committee chamber.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.640
The call will be really very ruling against any audible manifestations of approval and disapproval.

00:37.640 --> 00:43.640
I have asked again the uniform members of the Capitol Police Force that you see before you.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.640
And the plain clothesmen who are scattered among the audience

00:50.640 --> 01:01.640
to enforce the rules vigorously to politely but firmly escort from the rules any individual or individual.

01:02.640 --> 01:12.640
By writing the terms of the agreement by which you enter the chamber, namely to refrain from making audible manifestations of approval or disapproval.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.640
I just approved.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.640
Shall I like to remind you of the following?

01:17.640 --> 01:22.640
Again, that by the beginning of the afternoon session,

01:22.640 --> 01:29.640
you don't see any of them who have any additional names to suggest to counsel Jenkins as witnesses.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.640
We'll submit them to you in writing.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.640
Several of the committee members have already submitted their recommendations.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.640
These are four additional witnesses or sayings that they have none in mind.

01:43.640 --> 01:50.640
And they share one's to remind his colleagues that they have until the opening of the two of the manifestations that makes that.

01:50.640 --> 01:55.640
This is available to Mr. Jenkins and then we're going to have a meeting this afternoon.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.640
That's the staff.

01:56.640 --> 02:02.640
And I have meeting this afternoon as the conclusion of the open session to discuss

02:02.640 --> 02:03.640
the rules ahead.

02:03.640 --> 02:08.640
As far as our committee carries out, I'm happy to yield this and I'm a top.

02:08.640 --> 02:17.640
My understanding is sure now to make a ruling that unwrapped names are submitted by a known group of members of the committee,

02:17.640 --> 02:22.640
then there are a third of these excluded from my commission, Justin, or his questioning witnesses,

02:22.640 --> 02:27.640
who's asked for the valid information not what you asked to have on the board.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.640
We have a hearing of time that he's coming to cooperate with the House of the Council,

02:32.640 --> 02:37.640
so we can have some arguing procedure and we feel strongly confident that he's starting to end over to cooperate.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.640
I've been brought by the NWR today or later, that would be important,

02:41.640 --> 02:44.640
what the chair was saying on the right of the fair now.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.640
Make it clear now, public and open and obvious.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.640
We can't attend the meeting.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.640
As sentiment is coming.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.640
I'm very important meeting that the armed services, and I would like to excuse myself,

02:56.640 --> 02:57.640
as I may for you.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.640
You may turn it over to the top, as possible.

02:59.640 --> 03:06.640
I will assure you as we assure you that there's a pattern under so much of consensus the other day that can so far as the chair can,

03:06.640 --> 03:09.640
he will avoid any votes, but you are a way.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.640
Thank you, Jim.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.640
If I have permission, may I say send it over to the appropriate committee.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.640
As far as the armed forces of the preparation of the Smolniers,

03:18.640 --> 03:25.640
I feel constrained to have sent myself sometime a little bit later for that very, all important work.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.640
Well, all right, gentlemen, all the members of that committee, too,

03:28.640 --> 03:31.640
we can't attend move from some of us and stay here.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.640
Yeah, I was thinking, good enough.

03:33.640 --> 03:37.640
I think that's about all we can do is to divide our forces that way,

03:37.640 --> 03:41.640
and again, in the chair, once the state has just points up to the importance.

03:42.640 --> 03:48.640
To find the finding reasonable and right-level way and time and manner in which to conclude these hearings,

03:48.640 --> 03:50.640
because other important businesses,

03:50.640 --> 03:53.640
filing up a great importance to the country,

03:53.640 --> 03:56.640
and a great importance to our individual states.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.640
The minority leadership on the Democratic side, on the Senate floor,

04:00.640 --> 04:03.640
and the majority leadership on the Republican side,

04:03.640 --> 04:06.640
and with the strange majorities we have,

04:06.640 --> 04:08.640
these could reverse those procedures,

04:08.640 --> 04:10.640
as those designations just you've heard of,

04:10.640 --> 04:13.640
but on both sides they have been very cooperative.

04:13.640 --> 04:17.640
To these fair matters, which members of the committee are especially interested,

04:17.640 --> 04:19.640
both in the committee and on the floor,

04:19.640 --> 04:23.640
but we are approaching the adjournment date of the front.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.640
And it is imperative, I think, that each of us,

04:25.640 --> 04:28.640
pictures, stolen our conscience to determine

04:28.640 --> 04:33.640
just what we want to have do, done, in the continuation of these hearings.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.640
How far we want to expand the wishes?

04:35.640 --> 04:37.640
How long we want to continue them?

04:37.640 --> 04:40.640
It's without purpose for meeting this afternoon,

04:40.640 --> 04:43.640
but that purpose I have asked my colleagues to the past few days,

04:43.640 --> 04:46.640
to read the executive testimony that's been taken,

04:46.640 --> 04:48.640
all of which is now available,

04:48.640 --> 04:50.640
and to try to find, I hope,

04:50.640 --> 04:54.640
a formula for a procedure into our determination date,

04:54.640 --> 04:56.640
which will be acceptable, number one,

04:56.640 --> 04:59.640
and most important to all of the French.

04:59.640 --> 05:04.640
And then I hope to all of our most children members of the committee.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.640
Mr. Standemacati understands,

05:07.640 --> 05:11.640
undergoing direct determination at this time,

05:11.640 --> 05:14.640
by Council Jenkins.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.640
In a little bit of a prepared statement,

05:16.640 --> 05:20.640
he has made something of a speech as a presentation

05:20.640 --> 05:23.640
at the beginning of his meeting yesterday.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.640
And now I understand that his attention is ready to begin

05:26.640 --> 05:28.640
the direct determination to be followed by

05:28.640 --> 05:31.640
a proper testimony, comprehensive.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.640
So, Mr. Standemacati, at this time,

05:36.640 --> 05:39.640
I desire to examine you directly,

05:39.640 --> 05:43.640
with reference to the charges of the Macrathis Fair

05:43.640 --> 05:46.640
against Mr. Standemacati.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.640
I think perhaps it would be well

05:49.640 --> 05:51.640
to at this time, specifically,

05:51.640 --> 05:54.640
the time those charges so that

05:55.640 --> 06:01.640
the examination may be dealt within that particular area of inquiry.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.640
As we understand this senator,

06:04.640 --> 06:07.640
you, as chairman of the committee,

06:07.640 --> 06:10.640
and the members of your staff,

06:10.640 --> 06:12.640
at Standemacati,

06:12.640 --> 06:15.640
is the second day and his council

06:15.640 --> 06:20.640
talks to the credit for the work of the Macrathis committee.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.640
Secondly, that the second day

06:23.640 --> 06:27.640
of his council has stopped to present

06:27.640 --> 06:30.640
such as the stop of the block,

06:30.640 --> 06:37.640
your investigation of subverses in the Army and the Fort Monument.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.640
And, certainly, that Mr. Standemacati

06:42.640 --> 06:46.640
starts to prevent you from bringing before you to meet

06:46.640 --> 06:52.640
the members of the Lawy of the Board for examination.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.640
So, thank you, Mr. Standemacati,

06:54.640 --> 06:57.640
with you are not saying that those of the charges

06:57.640 --> 07:02.640
made by you and you are served against the Secretary of the Senate.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.640
Yes, Mr. Standemacati,

07:04.640 --> 07:09.640
I don't like the trouble about the cross-charges,

07:09.640 --> 07:13.640
but we did understand their charges.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.640
And, in doing so,

07:15.640 --> 07:16.640
and in the document,

07:16.640 --> 07:19.640
I have been involved in the use of the Union State of Athens

07:19.640 --> 07:21.640
for the implementation of one made,

07:21.640 --> 07:23.640
where they are not infectious.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.640
I think that's the senseless practice.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.640
I merely want to make it clear that

07:28.640 --> 07:31.640
we have nothing to do with calling on the hearing.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.640
We're merely made out of the charges for many instances.

07:35.640 --> 07:40.640
And, as you told us yesterday about when you were made chairman of this committee,

07:40.640 --> 07:43.640
I think it's in the records of Mr. Cohen's opinion

07:43.640 --> 07:48.640
to your committee shortly after you assumed the role of chairman Schultz.

07:48.640 --> 07:54.640
That's perhaps Mr. Shine's game with him from two big weeks back.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.640
Mr. Clark's game with your committee plan.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.640
Mr. Clark's game in July of the week.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.640
July of the week.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.640
July of the week.

08:06.640 --> 08:11.640
I may say Mr. Clark worked as head of the FBI subversive group in New York.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.640
I believe you are right.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.640
Mr. Clark's game was in the mind-eye.

08:16.640 --> 08:23.640
Mr. Steven, for his background, before he assumed the secretation of the Army,

08:23.640 --> 08:26.640
I have some radams about his background.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.640
I see something yet to be about you.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.640
In the selection of the members of your staff, Senator,

08:33.640 --> 08:40.640
who do not use the investigation records, their background, their qualifications?

08:40.640 --> 08:43.640
I do.

08:43.640 --> 08:48.640
Mr. Clark, Senator, and I think Mr. Cohen is pretty well covered.

08:48.640 --> 08:55.640
In short, why did you select Mr. Cohen as you chief counsel?

08:55.640 --> 08:59.640
Uh, great number of reasons of detection.

08:59.640 --> 09:06.640
I was working for a conflomber fired working young man who knew something about common atoms,

09:06.640 --> 09:09.640
who knew something about his up to getting,

09:09.640 --> 09:16.640
who had a background of FBI experience, a justice department experience.

09:16.640 --> 09:23.640
Mr. Cohen came to me very highly recommended from a sizable number of people.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.640
Mr. Cohen applied for this position.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.640
Did you speak to him out, Senator?

09:28.640 --> 09:32.640
I believe I saw him out for this judgment.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.640
What about the background of Mr. Chien?

09:36.640 --> 09:41.640
Mr. Chien came almost exclusively on the recommendation of Mr. Cohen,

09:41.640 --> 09:44.640
except that I had got an FBI name,

09:44.640 --> 09:49.640
so I can let Mr. Chien before I 50-mom make money.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.640
And what about Mr. Carl?

09:52.640 --> 09:56.640
Well, Mr. Carl is a man who we're trying to get for quite some time.

09:56.640 --> 10:03.640
I had known about Mr. Chien's activities in producing the evidence

10:03.640 --> 10:07.640
in the Conviction of Communism New York over a number of years.

10:07.640 --> 10:12.640
I knew that he was head of the subversive squad,

10:12.640 --> 10:16.640
a bunch of the right to name, I think they call it subversive death,

10:16.640 --> 10:20.640
when he directed all the way from a hundred up to over two hundred.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.640
It happens that to get his own Communism,

10:23.640 --> 10:29.640
I felt that Mr. Chien was one of the most confident administrators I could get.

10:29.640 --> 10:34.640
And we spent a great deal of time trying to persuade Mr. Chien with him.

10:34.640 --> 10:40.640
Mr. Chien was the first late plan for the investigation of the system

10:40.640 --> 10:44.640
who were allegedly in the Army.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.640
Mr. Chien's impossible to give you a state.

10:47.640 --> 10:57.640
Before I became chairman of the committee, I had received complaints about the type of lecture,

10:57.640 --> 11:00.640
the type of material the Army worked on,

11:00.640 --> 11:05.640
the type of indoctrination material being used to indoctrinate our troops,

11:05.640 --> 11:08.640
to indoctrinate our intelligence officers.

11:08.640 --> 11:14.640
I received complaints to regard to Port Monmouth.

11:14.640 --> 11:20.640
And the impossible to fix the case, I would assume,

11:21.640 --> 11:26.640
for those who shortly after I made the talk on the Sunsport,

11:26.640 --> 11:31.640
on February 9, 1950, I started to get a great mass of material,

11:31.640 --> 11:38.640
much of which I could not devaluate because I did not understand.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.640
I would say it's about 50-51.

11:41.640 --> 11:49.640
I started to get material out of the sensitive infiltration of the Army first.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.640
That's 50-51.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.640
Have you finished your lecture?

12:00.640 --> 12:05.640
No, I'm not saying I'm a detective,

12:05.640 --> 12:10.640
I've been unmuniting myself for long to make sure I'm safe on the front end,

12:10.640 --> 12:13.640
violating the room myself,

12:14.640 --> 12:23.640
I've been in my hand, I've uphold the controlling reason why we decided to go to the military,

12:23.640 --> 12:26.640
and keep in mind, with the drinkers,

12:26.640 --> 12:30.640
that I feel that we do have a good army.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.640
I feel 99% strong for more,

12:34.640 --> 12:37.640
great moral and not completely divine for their country.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.640
I know all over the place,

12:39.640 --> 12:42.640
I know that 50-51 was general rank,

12:42.640 --> 12:45.640
and I'm the manager that we have the greatest army in the world.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.640
I don't know if we have the greatest, I think we've got a great army.

12:48.640 --> 12:52.640
But now specifically, in an order to get along, my question is,

12:52.640 --> 12:55.640
only if you lay the groundwork or do the spacework,

12:55.640 --> 12:58.640
I choose you as function of the jam,

12:58.640 --> 13:00.640
as you've reviewed the meetings,

13:00.640 --> 13:04.640
to investigate a life-to-person in the Army.

13:05.640 --> 13:12.640
And I very firmly chair a very brief resume,

13:12.640 --> 13:19.640
the reason why I felt I'm still feeling a bit sympathetic to the acting committee,

13:19.640 --> 13:22.640
the cooperation committee, so for you to stay publicly,

13:22.640 --> 13:25.640
what your reasons were,

13:25.640 --> 13:28.640
for the plans that you raised,

13:28.640 --> 13:30.640
and which you,

13:30.640 --> 13:33.640
are investigating the execution,

13:33.640 --> 13:36.640
for the investigation of the Berkies in life.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.640
Could I do this, Mr. Duncan,

13:39.640 --> 13:43.640
and I hope that's over the last blow after,

13:43.640 --> 13:47.640
we have turning,

13:47.640 --> 13:49.640
oh, back,

13:49.640 --> 13:52.640
decades ago,

13:52.640 --> 13:56.640
the public statement by the top communists

13:56.640 --> 13:59.640
and one of their prime objectives was in so pretty Army,

13:59.640 --> 14:01.640
I just read you one or two of those,

14:01.640 --> 14:03.640
and I'd like to hand the others,

14:03.640 --> 14:06.640
as to the press to say a term,

14:06.640 --> 14:11.640
for example, the program of the Communist International,

14:11.640 --> 14:13.640
back in 1936,

14:13.640 --> 14:17.640
for an absolutely essential three requisites,

14:17.640 --> 14:20.640
for this form of action,

14:20.640 --> 14:22.640
that is the Communist action,

14:22.640 --> 14:26.640
is intensified revolutionary work in the Army and the Navy,

14:26.640 --> 14:30.640
then in the thesis and statutes of the Third International,

14:30.640 --> 14:34.640
that they book with the President of the Communist Party of America,

14:34.640 --> 14:38.640
forth in the most enlightened and free countries,

14:38.640 --> 14:42.640
it is a special way necessary to carry on unlawful work

14:42.640 --> 14:44.640
in the Army and the Navy,

14:44.640 --> 14:45.640
and please,

14:45.640 --> 14:48.640
again, the program of the Communist International,

14:48.640 --> 14:53.640
the Communist International must devote itself a special way,

14:53.640 --> 14:56.640
to organize work in the Army and the Navy,

14:56.640 --> 14:58.640
and skipping a few of these,

14:58.640 --> 14:59.640
to save time,

14:59.640 --> 15:01.640
with their second,

15:01.640 --> 15:03.640
the communists here,

15:03.640 --> 15:06.640
the Constitutional Program of the Communist Party,

15:06.640 --> 15:08.640
published away back in 1921,

15:08.640 --> 15:11.640
the Communist Party of America,

15:11.640 --> 15:14.640
will carry on a systematic agitation

15:14.640 --> 15:16.640
in the American Army and Navy,

15:16.640 --> 15:20.640
again, in factors governing your tactical land,

15:20.640 --> 15:23.640
towards the Communist Party of all countries,

15:23.640 --> 15:27.640
must increase their work in the capitalist Army,

15:27.640 --> 15:31.640
just one more of them to challenge from the daily workers,

15:31.640 --> 15:33.640
let us take root in the factories,

15:33.640 --> 15:37.640
let us penetrate into the Army and into the Navy,

15:37.640 --> 15:39.640
and I could quote many more,

15:39.640 --> 15:41.640
you will find at least,

15:41.640 --> 15:45.640
another of this resume that you will find in the dedications,

15:45.640 --> 15:47.640
at least 50,

15:47.640 --> 15:51.640
in fact, all of the top writers of the Communist Party,

15:51.640 --> 15:57.640
suggest the importance of infiltration of the Army,

15:57.640 --> 16:01.640
and may I say that I think it's no disgrace to

16:01.640 --> 16:05.640
a Secretary of the Army to find a Communist in the Army?

16:05.640 --> 16:11.640
I think the disgrace is when you find those who cover up that Army.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.640
Those are the reasons that as we understand it,

16:14.640 --> 16:18.640
why you directed your energy towards an investigation

16:18.640 --> 16:21.640
of Communists or the Virtues in the Army?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.640
Well, those are some of the reasons.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.640
Yes, some of the reasons.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.640
As an expert in the Senator was,

16:26.640 --> 16:31.640
when did you actually start working with your staff

16:31.640 --> 16:35.640
in the preparation of an investigation

16:35.640 --> 16:38.640
of the Virtues or Communists in the Army?

16:38.640 --> 16:40.640
Approximately when?

16:40.640 --> 16:43.640
It was only spring of 1953

16:44.640 --> 16:47.640
I took it into the month I was 30,

16:47.640 --> 16:50.640
perhaps many reasons there was.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.640
April, May, thereabouts.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.640
The next question Senator is,

16:55.640 --> 17:00.640
what was done generally in the preparation

17:00.640 --> 17:03.640
made the unit staff to the end

17:03.640 --> 17:06.640
as she might actually conduct?

17:06.640 --> 17:09.640
I came and determined whether or not

17:09.640 --> 17:12.640
there were the Virtues or Communists in the Army.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.640
For these few, you,

17:14.640 --> 17:16.640
I went to sign them,

17:16.640 --> 17:18.640
but they were just a bit of a...

17:18.640 --> 17:21.640
...crusting what sort of...

17:21.640 --> 17:24.640
...sexy whatever information we had.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.640
The exciting one,

17:26.640 --> 17:28.640
we should start to hold public hearings

17:28.640 --> 17:30.640
and take them out of the committee.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.640
I think I took them out of the committee.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.640
I frankly don't know what that was before

17:35.640 --> 17:39.640
or after my Democrat friends left.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.640
Anyway, I took it up with the committee.

17:41.640 --> 17:45.640
I think at least two months before we start to hold public hearings.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.640
Do you have any idea of a possibility

17:48.640 --> 17:50.640
to have any witnesses or questions

17:50.640 --> 17:53.640
Senator, prepare for your having hearings

17:53.640 --> 17:56.640
on the subject of inquiry?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.640
I'd rather not rely upon my memory.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.640
I've got a very common say up here.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.640
I think it can give me the figures

18:02.640 --> 18:05.640
that much better than I can do.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.640
Mr. Gorn tells me that they can't give us any of these.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.640
I know the very large number.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.640
Can you give them a proclamation of figures?

18:16.640 --> 18:19.640
So they're rather difficult to send them to the streets

18:19.640 --> 18:21.640
and that I...

18:21.640 --> 18:25.640
I do not work down in the office

18:25.640 --> 18:28.640
for my illustrators as their headquartered.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.640
I guess the end result of their work.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.640
When they find the witnesses,

18:33.640 --> 18:35.640
whom they think of,

18:35.640 --> 18:37.640
importantly come up and tell me about him.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.640
They may interrogate 20 witnesses

18:41.640 --> 18:43.640
before they find someone

18:43.640 --> 18:45.640
who may think has information

18:45.640 --> 18:49.640
or is professionally important to pass on to the committee.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.640
I think that our annual report indicates

18:52.640 --> 18:55.640
that over the year of 1953,

18:55.640 --> 18:59.640
there was considerably over a thousand witnesses interrogated.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.640
Some of them were on the voice of America,

19:03.640 --> 19:04.640
some of them are going to be running off

19:04.640 --> 19:07.640
from an inkless trade.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.640
If I were to get to the being purely a guest,

19:11.640 --> 19:13.640
I would have flown through a 300,

19:13.640 --> 19:16.640
but that's purely a guest.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.640
When the witnesses did use

19:18.640 --> 19:20.640
to actual questions,

19:20.640 --> 19:23.640
a consecutive hour open hearing

19:23.640 --> 19:25.640
in the investigation of the person

19:25.640 --> 19:27.640
who's coming into the army.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.640
I think the date was August 31.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.640
Was that an executive meeting?

19:31.640 --> 19:33.640
That was an executive meeting.

19:33.640 --> 19:40.640
So, they held in New York.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.640
Up to that time,

19:43.640 --> 19:47.640
and between August 31,

19:47.640 --> 19:50.640
and the date of the assumption of office

19:50.640 --> 19:52.640
by the security of the army,

19:52.640 --> 19:54.640
did you know whether or not

19:54.640 --> 19:56.640
any subversives or communists

19:56.640 --> 19:59.640
had been the suspended or discharged

19:59.640 --> 20:00.640
from the personnel,

20:00.640 --> 20:02.640
civilian personnel of the army?

20:02.640 --> 20:03.640
As far as I know,

20:03.640 --> 20:04.640
Mr. Daniels,

20:04.640 --> 20:07.640
none were suspended until after

20:07.640 --> 20:09.640
we started our investigation.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.640
That would be the subsequent to August 31.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.640
If that guy said it was not necessarily

20:14.640 --> 20:15.640
August 31,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.640
but subsequent to the date

20:17.640 --> 20:20.640
that the man and the army knew

20:20.640 --> 20:22.640
that we were investigating

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
the birth of the army.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.640
I believe they had some

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
sometime in early August,

20:26.640 --> 20:27.640
and I couldn't give you the date

20:27.640 --> 20:30.640
because they don't give up those dates.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.640
I think in funding your

20:32.640 --> 20:35.640
investigation at Fort Mama,

20:35.640 --> 20:37.640
did or not do anything about

20:37.640 --> 20:38.640
the senator's dysfunction

20:38.640 --> 20:40.640
of any communists

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
or subversives or families

20:42.640 --> 20:47.640
in any other army post.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.640
Yes, they're the right thing

20:49.640 --> 20:50.640
we bring in about.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.640
They were at the front of the after,

20:52.640 --> 20:54.640
we have them before the committee.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.640
The answer is yes.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.640
They were the security guard.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.640
In New York, the man was guarding

21:02.640 --> 21:03.640
the secret

21:03.640 --> 21:07.640
and had a communist back on

21:07.640 --> 21:09.640
the vendous vehicles

21:09.640 --> 21:13.640
who was in the quartermaster corps.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.640
Mr. C,

21:17.640 --> 21:19.640
that's a second note.

21:19.640 --> 21:24.640
It was a threat of light.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.640
But the court reminds me of

21:26.640 --> 21:29.640
the fact that I was in the

21:29.640 --> 21:31.640
court, and I was in the court

21:31.640 --> 21:32.640
as I just can't re-aw something

21:32.640 --> 21:33.640
like this.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.640
I'm in the state and I have a list

21:36.640 --> 21:38.640
of the senator's investigation

21:38.640 --> 21:40.640
and I recall that I had the

21:40.640 --> 21:42.640
security army give his version

21:42.640 --> 21:44.640
of the story of Fort Mama.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.640
The madam's name is story.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.640
The court is story.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.640
I'm going to ask you now

21:50.640 --> 21:52.640
the total of the committees.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.640
And as the President has

21:54.640 --> 21:56.640
brought 20 out of million Americans,

21:56.640 --> 21:58.640
give her your report Mama.

21:58.640 --> 22:02.640
Tell me, is your McCarthy version?

22:02.640 --> 22:04.640
West Preserver,

22:04.640 --> 22:06.640
an old and flip of custom,

22:06.640 --> 22:08.640
my version is that

22:08.640 --> 22:10.640
is this child

22:10.640 --> 22:12.640
now on exhibition, Jeremy,

22:12.640 --> 22:14.640
to that question and I say,

22:14.640 --> 22:18.640
the small star-twit-based

22:18.640 --> 22:20.640
the large-type severed

22:20.640 --> 22:22.640
all of the individuals

22:22.640 --> 22:25.640
who were curious to answer

22:25.640 --> 22:27.640
whether or not they were coming.

22:27.640 --> 22:28.640
Some have just been

22:28.640 --> 22:30.640
or some have just

22:30.640 --> 22:33.640
advertised invoking the

22:33.640 --> 22:35.640
self-incommonation

22:35.640 --> 22:36.640
and the translation of the

22:36.640 --> 22:39.640
Constitution.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.640
In small-time, you'll notice

22:41.640 --> 22:43.640
Mr. Drankin,

22:43.640 --> 22:45.640
shows that there were no suspensions

22:45.640 --> 22:47.640
at Fort Mama Fire

22:47.640 --> 22:49.640
or in investigation.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.640
Following in investigation,

22:51.640 --> 22:56.640
35 in the 1

22:56.640 --> 22:56.940
report that do soil

22:56.940 --> 22:59.660
some such class was made

22:59.660 --> 23:01.660
that the few days ago,

23:01.660 --> 23:05.660
we find that Aaron Chomes

23:05.660 --> 23:08.660
hasn't been removed.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.880
I'm well-beığım security grou

23:10.880 --> 23:11.460
so if the chart is not

23:11.460 --> 23:13.960
accurate as of this day,

23:13.960 --> 23:14.940
to be accurate as of the week is

23:14.940 --> 23:14.960
cut.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.540
When does the remaining

23:16.540 --> 23:17.580
storm disappointors,

23:17.580 --> 23:19.140
thank you again,

23:19.140 --> 23:21.140
your investigation report Mama.

23:21.140 --> 23:23.640
About this, we are going to spend it.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.640
Is that correct?

23:25.640 --> 23:27.340
I don't like structure language,

23:27.340 --> 23:30.040
but 35 who had records,

23:30.040 --> 23:32.740
which were in the case,

23:32.740 --> 23:35.740
they were subversals of that.

23:35.740 --> 23:37.940
I don't know how many of those

23:37.940 --> 23:41.040
are still under suspension centers.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.840
I understand from the information

23:43.840 --> 23:44.640
which we get,

23:44.640 --> 23:46.940
but only one case that's finally

23:46.940 --> 23:48.340
adjudicated,

23:48.340 --> 23:50.540
and that was not Aaron Chomes.

23:50.540 --> 23:55.040
And he has been removed.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.940
Now, Senator,

23:56.940 --> 23:59.040
I will ask you to explain

23:59.040 --> 24:00.940
to the committee the significance

24:00.940 --> 24:03.140
of the large chart.

24:03.140 --> 24:07.540
The large chart was to try to move

24:07.540 --> 24:10.540
conveying the names of the

24:10.540 --> 24:11.640
familiar movements that share it,

24:11.640 --> 24:12.540
so I can see the chart.

24:12.540 --> 24:13.840
I can say thank you.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.340
Thank you.

24:15.340 --> 24:18.240
92 individuals were paired

24:18.240 --> 24:21.240
in public touch,

24:21.240 --> 24:25.140
and who had used to testify,

24:25.140 --> 24:26.240
some of them are to come in

24:26.240 --> 24:28.040
in the section of these,

24:28.040 --> 24:30.940
some are to espionage activity,

24:30.940 --> 24:33.540
some are to sacrifice.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.840
Now, up to make it clear,

24:34.840 --> 24:35.340
I say,

24:35.340 --> 24:36.340
do we understand the fact

24:36.340 --> 24:37.340
that they were civilians

24:37.340 --> 24:38.140
and employees of the Army,

24:38.140 --> 24:39.140
those 90-year-olds

24:39.140 --> 24:40.440
in the victim's door?

24:40.440 --> 24:41.440
No.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.140
They were mainly witnesses

24:43.140 --> 24:43.740
of what you mean,

24:43.740 --> 24:44.740
Senator,

24:44.740 --> 24:45.940
no, there were more than last

24:45.940 --> 24:48.640
of the detectives.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.040
Some of them had never worked

24:50.040 --> 24:51.940
for the Ingeverment.

24:51.940 --> 24:53.340
But they were all told

24:53.340 --> 24:57.140
because of alleged connections

24:57.140 --> 24:59.640
which they had with people working

24:59.640 --> 25:03.840
in the Ingeverment.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.240
Thanks, for example,

25:05.240 --> 25:07.740
for having the first thing

25:07.740 --> 25:08.940
in the victim's amendment

25:08.940 --> 25:09.940
coming into the next one

25:09.940 --> 25:12.640
door, for his call.

25:12.640 --> 25:17.140
I was working for the Army

25:17.140 --> 25:19.940
in the quartermaster court.

25:19.940 --> 25:23.640
The National Network drop styles

25:23.640 --> 25:24.340
had been working

25:24.340 --> 25:26.840
in the government's printing office,

25:26.840 --> 25:28.340
access to six of material

25:28.340 --> 25:30.640
for a great number of years

25:30.640 --> 25:32.640
on the outline.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.040
I do have an explanation

25:34.040 --> 25:35.440
of each one.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.240
I could read it in,

25:36.240 --> 25:37.540
I'm not sure if you want that.

25:37.540 --> 25:38.740
Senator, I don't think

25:38.740 --> 25:41.140
for example, number 85,

25:41.140 --> 25:43.640
blue board,

25:43.640 --> 25:46.640
board,

25:46.640 --> 25:48.640
very good explanation.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.840
I believe it's maybe the

25:49.840 --> 25:50.640
public section.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.640
I think it's the public section.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.140
The fire laughed and undercovered

25:55.140 --> 25:57.140
the FBI agent and

25:57.140 --> 25:58.340
chastified the sports

25:58.340 --> 26:00.140
by Frank.

26:00.140 --> 26:03.140
That his job was to

26:03.140 --> 26:05.740
kill a term of a committee.

26:05.740 --> 26:07.240
Board came in for the committee

26:07.240 --> 26:08.940
and vote for the criminal.

26:08.940 --> 26:09.940
I frankly want

26:09.940 --> 26:11.940
to impress by my, I think

26:11.940 --> 26:14.940
he was just bragging.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.440
They were not the

26:16.440 --> 26:20.240
45th to function.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.340
Are included in that list?

26:22.340 --> 26:23.540
No.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.740
Are any of them included in it?

26:25.740 --> 26:27.740
Well, someone are included

26:27.740 --> 26:29.240
in that list.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.140
Others are not.

26:31.140 --> 26:31.940
Then they're going to be

26:31.940 --> 26:32.740
legitimate.

26:32.740 --> 26:33.540
We'll go around here.

26:33.540 --> 26:35.040
I'm not going to cut you off.

26:35.040 --> 26:35.940
I'm not sure if any of

26:35.940 --> 26:37.140
them are included in that list.

26:37.140 --> 26:37.940
I don't believe any are

26:37.940 --> 26:39.640
included in that list.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.540
You see, we didn't get the name

26:42.540 --> 26:44.240
from the military of the 35th

26:44.240 --> 26:45.640
at the front.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.740
We only got the numbers.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.240
The only way we could find out

26:49.240 --> 26:51.040
the public had been to front

26:51.040 --> 26:53.140
was to call on this list.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.640
We only have those

26:55.640 --> 26:58.340
that put the testimony.

26:58.340 --> 26:59.340
When did you first meet

26:59.340 --> 27:00.540
to fuck the day of the Army?

27:00.540 --> 27:01.340
Mr. Robert,

27:01.340 --> 27:04.340
he's needed.

27:04.340 --> 27:05.340
He was half of the hearing

27:05.340 --> 27:06.340
he's coming.

27:06.340 --> 27:08.340
I might say as far as

27:09.340 --> 27:11.340
the pinpointing date,

27:11.340 --> 27:13.340
that's impossible.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.340
It was somewhere in

27:15.340 --> 27:19.340
the funeral of a month's boss.

27:19.340 --> 27:21.340
My chief counsel,

27:21.340 --> 27:22.340
very sometime, he sent me

27:22.340 --> 27:25.340
a September-physel in the strike.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.340
When he came back,

27:26.340 --> 27:28.340
when he returned from Montana,

27:28.340 --> 27:30.340
he'll see me give it up

27:30.340 --> 27:31.340
west, and send me away.

27:31.340 --> 27:32.340
I asked when he came back,

27:32.340 --> 27:33.340
and that was it.

27:33.340 --> 27:34.340
We'll follow through the call

27:34.340 --> 27:35.340
as if you first meet

27:35.340 --> 27:36.340
and he was attacked

27:36.340 --> 27:37.340
by the Army.

27:37.340 --> 27:38.340
As far as I know,

27:38.340 --> 27:40.340
I may have met him,

27:40.340 --> 27:41.340
but he tells me

27:41.340 --> 27:42.340
I'm meeting the door of

27:42.340 --> 27:44.340
that, socially,

27:44.340 --> 27:45.340
and I'll be first

27:45.340 --> 27:47.340
to answer that for sure.

27:47.340 --> 27:48.340
Then he'll bring the

27:48.340 --> 27:51.340
few firsts, real-ads,

27:51.340 --> 27:52.340
that he knew

27:52.340 --> 27:53.340
that the pressure was being

27:53.340 --> 27:54.340
thought upon you

27:54.340 --> 27:57.340
as a number of your staff,

27:57.340 --> 27:58.340
by either the secretary

27:58.340 --> 28:01.340
or anyone in the news.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.340
Your decision.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.340
There'll be a call

28:04.340 --> 28:05.340
off your investigation

28:05.340 --> 28:07.340
to report Mama.

28:07.340 --> 28:08.340
Are we Army?

28:08.340 --> 28:09.340
A general secretary

28:09.340 --> 28:10.340
of the strike

28:10.340 --> 28:11.340
has tried to give you a specific

28:11.340 --> 28:12.340
base because,

28:12.340 --> 28:13.340
whenever you investigate

28:13.340 --> 28:15.340
a particular bureau,

28:15.340 --> 28:17.340
I always find

28:17.340 --> 28:20.340
some opposition to it,

28:20.340 --> 28:22.340
if the ray-dankers

28:22.340 --> 28:25.340
were ahead of a bureau,

28:25.340 --> 28:26.340
you perhaps wouldn't want

28:26.340 --> 28:27.340
a congressional committee

28:27.340 --> 28:31.340
investigating what he was doing.

28:31.340 --> 28:33.340
I, frankly,

28:33.340 --> 28:36.340
didn't think the pressure

28:36.340 --> 28:39.340
seriously until about

28:39.340 --> 28:42.340
the 21st day of January

28:42.340 --> 28:45.340
or thereabouts,

28:45.340 --> 28:46.340
and some of the frontiers

28:46.340 --> 28:48.340
called me and told me

28:48.340 --> 28:50.340
that Mr. Adams and Mr.

28:50.340 --> 28:51.340
Stevens had been

28:51.340 --> 28:53.340
to them, had been

28:53.340 --> 28:55.340
a Franklin Duke's

28:55.340 --> 28:57.340
grant to keep me

28:57.340 --> 28:59.340
from calling the members

28:59.340 --> 29:00.340
of the old human

29:00.340 --> 29:01.340
royalty-boy,

29:01.340 --> 29:02.340
which was no longer

29:02.340 --> 29:03.340
a system,

29:03.340 --> 29:04.340
but still working

29:04.340 --> 29:06.340
with Honeycomb as far as I know.

29:06.340 --> 29:09.340
It reached this height

29:09.340 --> 29:11.340
on the night of the

29:11.340 --> 29:14.340
funny second of January

29:14.340 --> 29:17.340
when Mr. Adams came

29:17.340 --> 29:19.340
to my apartment.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.340
Before that,

29:20.340 --> 29:21.340
I heard a lot of

29:21.340 --> 29:22.340
medley back and forth,

29:22.340 --> 29:24.340
as was lunch.

29:24.340 --> 29:25.340
To John Adams,

29:25.340 --> 29:26.340
I'm confused with him,

29:26.340 --> 29:27.340
almost all of our hearing

29:27.340 --> 29:29.340
was heard.

29:29.340 --> 29:30.340
And I would hear

29:30.340 --> 29:31.340
a new roar,

29:31.340 --> 29:32.340
and either in each other

29:32.340 --> 29:33.340
back and forth,

29:33.340 --> 29:34.340
suggesting that he

29:34.340 --> 29:35.340
was being called

29:35.340 --> 29:36.340
off.

29:36.340 --> 29:39.340
And I'm still,

29:39.340 --> 29:39.340


29:39.340 --> 29:40.340
surprised,

29:40.340 --> 29:41.340
nice thoughts.

29:41.340 --> 29:42.340
We were meeting

29:42.340 --> 29:44.340
over the Pentagon,

29:44.340 --> 29:47.340
called by Mr.

29:47.340 --> 29:49.340
Stevens, one of the

29:49.340 --> 29:50.340
big ones, right?

29:50.340 --> 29:51.340
So, let me remember

29:51.340 --> 29:52.340
it's quick.

29:52.340 --> 29:53.340
Now, that family

29:53.340 --> 29:54.340
secretary

29:54.340 --> 29:57.340
made a rather

29:57.340 --> 29:59.340
good argument

29:59.340 --> 30:01.340
for throwing off

30:01.340 --> 30:02.340
the hearing,

30:02.340 --> 30:03.340
and that they

30:03.340 --> 30:04.340
would proceed to do

30:04.340 --> 30:05.340
this job themselves,

30:05.340 --> 30:08.340
if we would quit.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.340
I didn't think there

30:09.340 --> 30:11.340
was anything

30:11.340 --> 30:12.340
frankly improper

30:12.340 --> 30:14.340
about that.

30:14.340 --> 30:17.340
The target we should

30:17.340 --> 30:18.340
put the investigation

30:18.340 --> 30:19.340
going to something

30:19.340 --> 30:20.340
helped.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.340
I think the honey

30:21.340 --> 30:22.340
and the

30:22.340 --> 30:23.340
hair color

30:23.340 --> 30:24.340
that mentioned

30:24.340 --> 30:26.340
the fire color,

30:26.340 --> 30:27.340
and the mandate

30:27.340 --> 30:28.340
perhaps.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.340
Now, I think

30:29.340 --> 30:30.340
I would like

30:30.340 --> 30:31.340
you to tell us,

30:31.340 --> 30:32.340
numbers of the

30:32.340 --> 30:33.340
subcommittee,

30:33.340 --> 30:34.340
as near as you

30:34.340 --> 30:35.340
possibly can,

30:35.340 --> 30:36.340
precisely what was said

30:36.340 --> 30:37.340
for the security

30:37.340 --> 30:38.340
army on the

30:38.340 --> 30:39.340
Remberstreet.

30:39.340 --> 30:40.340
You've got

30:40.340 --> 30:41.340
in the head of the

30:41.340 --> 30:42.340
state of the

30:42.340 --> 30:43.340
state.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.340
It's expected to

30:44.340 --> 30:45.340
question you,

30:45.340 --> 30:46.340
but you're on the

30:46.340 --> 30:47.340
Remberstreet.

30:47.340 --> 30:48.340
The meeting of the

30:48.340 --> 30:49.340
Pentagon.

30:49.340 --> 30:50.340
It's been fairly

30:50.340 --> 30:51.340
ahead in these days.

30:51.340 --> 30:52.340
I can give you the

30:52.340 --> 30:53.340
trust and

30:53.340 --> 30:54.340
support of Mr. Dreintham.

30:54.340 --> 30:55.340
I didn't think

30:55.340 --> 30:56.340
it's very enough to

30:56.340 --> 30:57.340
remember the wording

30:57.340 --> 30:58.340
for a break

30:58.340 --> 30:59.340
in the

30:59.340 --> 31:00.340
substance

31:00.340 --> 31:01.340
that even

31:01.340 --> 31:03.340
I give that the

31:03.340 --> 31:04.340
committee had

31:04.340 --> 31:05.340
performed a

31:05.340 --> 31:07.340
function that he was

31:07.340 --> 31:09.340
willing to take

31:09.340 --> 31:11.340
over into the jobs.

31:11.340 --> 31:12.340
So, the

31:12.340 --> 31:14.340
Remberstreet

31:14.340 --> 31:15.340
army.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.340
I pointed out to him

31:18.340 --> 31:19.340
that we had very

31:19.340 --> 31:20.340
little difficulty in

31:20.340 --> 31:21.340
having with the

31:21.340 --> 31:22.340
uniform

31:22.340 --> 31:23.340
and the

31:23.340 --> 31:24.340
mostly with the

31:24.340 --> 31:25.340
division.

31:25.340 --> 31:26.340
The old

31:26.340 --> 31:27.340
administration.

31:27.340 --> 31:28.340
I pointed out to him

31:28.340 --> 31:29.340
that we were

31:29.340 --> 31:30.340
making that

31:30.340 --> 31:31.340
very clear.

31:31.340 --> 31:32.340
Whenever we had a

31:32.340 --> 31:33.340
man before, we made

31:33.340 --> 31:34.340
very clear when he

31:34.340 --> 31:35.340
was brought into the

31:35.340 --> 31:36.340
administration.

31:36.340 --> 31:37.340
And up to that time,

31:37.340 --> 31:38.340
out of

31:38.340 --> 31:39.340
before the

31:39.340 --> 31:40.340
prime of his, I don't

31:40.340 --> 31:41.340
think we

31:41.340 --> 31:42.340
told a single individual

31:42.340 --> 31:43.340
suspect

31:43.340 --> 31:44.340
the common

31:44.340 --> 31:45.340
activities that came

31:45.340 --> 31:47.340
in under the

31:47.340 --> 31:48.340
even administration.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.340
He argued

31:49.340 --> 31:50.340
rather

31:50.340 --> 31:51.340
convincingly that he

31:51.340 --> 31:52.340
had been

31:52.340 --> 31:53.340
on top of

31:53.340 --> 31:54.340
10 months.

31:54.340 --> 31:56.340
And that

31:56.340 --> 31:59.340
if we were to

31:59.340 --> 32:00.340
continue that he

32:00.340 --> 32:02.340
would take

32:02.340 --> 32:03.340
the

32:03.340 --> 32:04.340
uniform

32:04.340 --> 32:13.340
and

32:13.340 --> 32:15.340
the

32:15.340 --> 32:16.340
uniform.
