WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Oh, it's time to go help.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.400
Harris, Senator Carl month, temporary chairman,

00:05.400 --> 00:07.800
wrapping for attention and the hearing will be underway

00:07.800 --> 00:08.800
and after the month.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.000
There's one of the other principal's

00:10.000 --> 00:11.400
members, Joseph McCartney, who's coming.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.400
May you come to order.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.400
I'll go ahead.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.600
Sheriff would like to remind our guests

00:17.600 --> 00:21.600
to say are here under the rule established

00:21.600 --> 00:24.800
by the committee at the very beginning.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.800
While we're happy to have guests come to the committee,

00:26.800 --> 00:29.200
whom they come here under the terms

00:29.200 --> 00:33.000
of the resolution providing that the officers

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
and the plain clothesmen in the audience

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
are likely removed from the room immediately.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.500
Anybody making any audible manifestations

00:41.500 --> 00:44.200
of approval or disapproval during the question of these

00:44.200 --> 00:45.500
here.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.200
So without further instructions from the chair,

00:48.200 --> 00:50.400
both the audience and the officers

00:50.400 --> 00:53.600
know their duties in this connection.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.800
The chair was highly gratified yesterday

00:55.800 --> 00:59.100
at the progress that was made and that the complete

00:59.100 --> 01:01.700
absence of interruptions.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.000
He has the unpleasant duties this morning

01:05.000 --> 01:08.800
and sad duty of violating his own suggestion

01:08.800 --> 01:12.300
that there be no preliminary faith.

01:12.300 --> 01:17.500
But due to the attaching of our beloved colleague,

01:17.500 --> 01:20.600
Senator Hoey, the chair wants to read and propose

01:20.600 --> 01:24.100
this resolution since Senator Hoey was at one time

01:24.100 --> 01:27.200
chairman of the committee and for many years,

01:27.200 --> 01:30.100
he's a member of the school committee.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.600
Whereas the late senator from North Carolina,

01:33.600 --> 01:35.800
the honorable Clyde Arhoey,

01:35.800 --> 01:38.300
there is a distinction as a member of this committee

01:38.300 --> 01:41.200
for a period of more than six years.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.900
And whereas during the entire period of his service

01:43.900 --> 01:46.300
on this committee, he participated actively

01:46.300 --> 01:50.000
in the activities and deliberations of the committee

01:50.000 --> 01:52.100
and profoundly impressed his colleagues

01:52.100 --> 01:54.300
by the soundness of his judgment.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.600
His judicial temperament is never

01:56.600 --> 01:58.200
killing criticism.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.700
His non-partisan approach to the resolutions

02:00.700 --> 02:02.800
of issues before the committee

02:02.800 --> 02:07.000
and his utmost consideration for the views of his colleagues.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.800
Whereas for almost four years,

02:08.800 --> 02:10.900
he served as the chairman of the firmness

02:10.900 --> 02:14.000
investigating subcommittee of the senator

02:14.000 --> 02:15.500
and of this committee.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.400
And before that, difficult assignment

02:17.400 --> 02:20.600
in such a manner to impress the public by the thoroughness

02:20.600 --> 02:22.600
for a mind-denist and impartiality

02:22.600 --> 02:26.000
of the investigations conducted by the subcommittee.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.300
And in such a manner as to bring about many desirable changes

02:29.300 --> 02:31.600
in the operations of the government,

02:31.600 --> 02:34.000
now therefore be it resolved.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
That the committee and government operations

02:36.000 --> 02:38.800
has heard this profound sorrow and deep regrets

02:38.800 --> 02:41.600
of the death of honorable Clyde Arhoey,

02:41.600 --> 02:44.900
late to senior senator from the state of North Carolina

02:44.900 --> 02:47.400
and directs its clerks to transmit a copy

02:47.400 --> 02:51.000
of this resolution to the family of the disease.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Those are the very most.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.500
Senator McDonnell, Senator McDonnell.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.500
I move the adoption of the resolution

02:59.500 --> 03:02.500
that Chair has yet to add.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.500
I would further move Mr. Chairman

03:05.500 --> 03:09.800
that as the further Mark of Apple's

03:09.800 --> 03:12.500
Foundlance back to our deceased colleagues

03:12.500 --> 03:16.800
at 10 minutes of 12 o'clock,

03:16.800 --> 03:19.600
this committee reached that in depth

03:19.600 --> 03:24.100
and stood this bad hour.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.100
Now the defendant makes a second

03:26.100 --> 03:28.600
and that's the second and that's the idea

03:28.600 --> 03:32.600
and understands the question that we have to go to the floor,

03:32.600 --> 03:35.100
the senate where there will be memorial services

03:35.100 --> 03:39.600
and that we can reconvene again at 2.5 to no.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.600
Are those in favor of the resolution will say aye?

03:42.600 --> 03:43.600
Aye.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.100
It is the question anonymously adopted.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.600
Yesterday we had Mr. Jenkins

03:49.600 --> 03:52.600
conducting the direct examination of Mr. Adams

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
throughout the day.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.600
Mr. Jenkins decided that he had already now

03:55.600 --> 03:58.600
to proceed with the cross examination of Mr. Adams.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.600
Mr. Dickens.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.100
Mr. Chairman.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.100
Mr. Sinclair.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.600
Mr. Walsh has asked me to inform you

04:04.600 --> 04:08.600
that he has a slight stomach upset support.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.100
And as a result, he was referred away

04:11.100 --> 04:12.600
to remain away from these hearings

04:12.600 --> 04:14.100
at least through the morning.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.600
But he has asked me to carry on in this absence

04:16.600 --> 04:19.100
in the request of the committee to continue the hearings.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.600
I'm sure he hasn't able to stand it

04:20.600 --> 04:22.600
and you, Mr. Sinclair, am we talking to you?

04:22.600 --> 04:24.400
I'm in no position to vouch for that,

04:24.400 --> 04:26.100
but I would like to introduce to you

04:26.100 --> 04:29.100
the Assistant Department of Council, Mr. Charles Pasons,

04:29.100 --> 04:31.400
who will be my assistant to Mr. Walsh returns.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.100
Hasn't he, a.k.s.A.I.S.?

04:33.100 --> 04:34.100
Yes, sir.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.100
Yes.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.100
All right.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.100
Mr. Dickens.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.100
Come on.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.100
The Adam's free.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.100
Yes, sir.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.100
Yes, sir.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.100
He.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.100
You were examined directly with respect

04:46.100 --> 04:49.100
to the charges made by you and Mr. Stevens

04:49.100 --> 04:51.100
against Senator McCarthy.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.100
And is he, you understand that, if not?

04:54.100 --> 04:55.100
Yes, sir.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.100
I do.

04:56.100 --> 05:00.100
Mr. Adam, it is not a pleasant pass for me.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.100
The committee was on the witness stand,

05:03.100 --> 05:06.100
and examined directly as I undertook to do yesterday

05:06.100 --> 05:09.100
as fairly as possible.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.100
But it is necessary for this committee

05:11.100 --> 05:15.100
when it's just to the point of making its decision

05:15.100 --> 05:19.100
to properly evaluate your testimony.

05:19.100 --> 05:23.100
And it is my conception and the conception of the committee

05:23.100 --> 05:28.100
that it can better do that in the life of a cross-examination.

05:28.100 --> 05:33.100
I say that to the benefit of those who do not understand my position,

05:33.100 --> 05:38.100
to the benefit of those who no doubt will spend many telegrams

05:38.100 --> 05:41.100
of a critical nature.

05:41.100 --> 05:44.100
No doubt.

05:44.100 --> 05:47.100
What's the union and my friends who are stockholders

05:47.100 --> 05:51.100
in that organization will not appreciate that statement?

05:51.100 --> 05:55.100
But it is, as I say, an unpleasant pass.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.100
Mr. Adams.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.100
The Senator and his staff have made

06:02.100 --> 06:06.100
what this committee regards as serious charges against you

06:06.100 --> 06:09.100
and Mr. Stevens.

06:09.100 --> 06:14.100
I'm sure you're well aware what those charges are.

06:14.100 --> 06:18.100
In order to focus those charges to pinpoint them,

06:18.100 --> 06:22.100
they are as I can see, as to the fact one.

06:22.100 --> 06:26.100
As you and Mr. Stevens sought to discredit

06:26.100 --> 06:31.100
this investigating committee of which Senator McCarthy is the chairman,

06:31.100 --> 06:33.100
and sought to minimize its importance

06:33.100 --> 06:38.100
and particularly minimize the importance of its work in Port Mama.

06:38.100 --> 06:43.100
Two, that you undertook you and Mr. Stevens

06:43.100 --> 06:50.100
to bring about a discontinuous of their investigation of Port Mama.

06:50.100 --> 06:54.100
Number three, that you thought in every way possible

06:54.100 --> 06:58.100
to prevent their investigating your security lawyer,

06:58.100 --> 06:59.100
the lawyer of the Port.

06:59.100 --> 07:03.100
In other words, that you tried to prevent their investigation

07:03.100 --> 07:07.100
of any sense your investigator.

07:07.100 --> 07:10.100
I think it's top of the weir in agreement

07:10.100 --> 07:14.100
with respect to those issues, aren't we?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.100
There are some things that are...

07:16.100 --> 07:19.100
You came to the Army on the first day of October 1953.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.100
That's correct.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.100
Is it about Mr. Adams?

07:21.100 --> 07:24.100
Yes, sir.

07:24.100 --> 07:29.100
And you were specifically assigned the duties of the liaison officer

07:29.100 --> 07:32.100
between the Army and the McCarthy Committee,

07:32.100 --> 07:33.100
were you not?

07:33.100 --> 07:34.100
Yes, sir.

07:34.100 --> 07:37.100
At that time there was a liaison officer

07:37.100 --> 07:40.100
between the Army and the Committee.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.100
Is that him?

07:41.100 --> 07:42.100
Was there not...

07:42.100 --> 07:44.100
Not specifically, sir.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.100
Well, not specifically, but there was an officer,

07:47.100 --> 07:50.100
or officers, those duties in fact.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.100
That is correct.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.100
Is it not, Mr. Adams?

07:52.100 --> 07:54.100
Not exactly, sir.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.100
Well, now I'm not exactly, but generally,

07:57.100 --> 08:00.100
is there not that true, Mr. Adams?

08:00.100 --> 08:03.100
I think we got along beautifully yesterday.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.100
We got direct answers, generally,

08:05.100 --> 08:08.100
and there were no interruptions.

08:08.100 --> 08:11.100
And is there not, if the fact that at the time you came,

08:11.100 --> 08:16.100
there was already a contact officer in existence.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.100
An intermediary between the Army and the Senator McCarthy

08:19.100 --> 08:21.100
and his staff.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.100
The very first question is not exactly correct.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.100
The IMA can elaboration, which will clarify the situation.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.100
Certainly, me.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.100
The officer, the Department of Council,

08:32.100 --> 08:34.100
had been established about three years ago

08:34.100 --> 08:38.100
for the specific purpose, among other things,

08:38.100 --> 08:40.100
of representing the Secretary of the Army,

08:40.100 --> 08:42.100
and assisting the Secretary of the Army

08:42.100 --> 08:44.100
and officials of the Army,

08:44.100 --> 08:47.100
in the preparation of matters of interest

08:47.100 --> 08:50.100
to congressional committees and congressional investigations.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.100
There also exists in the Army

08:53.100 --> 08:56.100
and officers legislative liaison.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.100
The office of legislative liaison

08:59.100 --> 09:02.100
has a primary function, the handling of specific

09:02.100 --> 09:06.100
and individual requests from members of Congress,

09:06.100 --> 09:09.100
the arranging of witness groups

09:09.100 --> 09:15.100
and the many routine duties,

09:15.100 --> 09:18.100
which routine functions,

09:18.100 --> 09:21.100
which come to the Army through

09:21.100 --> 09:25.100
as a result of inquiry from members of Congress.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.100
There was an officer, General Finn,

09:27.100 --> 09:30.100
to whom previous reference has been made,

09:30.100 --> 09:36.100
who, as an official of the office of legislative liaison,

09:36.100 --> 09:41.100
did much work for the office of legislative liaison.

09:41.100 --> 09:45.100
This work and the work of the Office of Department of Councilor

09:45.100 --> 09:48.100
did not overlap.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.100
There was collateral work.

09:50.100 --> 09:53.100
The Department of Councilor's Office did substantive work

09:53.100 --> 09:56.100
in the preparation and study of cases.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.100
We legislated the liaison office,

09:58.100 --> 10:01.100
of which General Finn was applied.

10:01.100 --> 10:06.100
It does much more,

10:06.100 --> 10:08.100
as many more people,

10:08.100 --> 10:10.100
and does much work on an individual basis

10:10.100 --> 10:12.100
from members of Congress,

10:12.100 --> 10:15.100
and does not get into the presence

10:15.100 --> 10:17.100
of investigations in the manner

10:17.100 --> 10:19.100
that the Office of Department of Councilor does.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.100
That is the difference.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.100
There was an officer,

10:22.100 --> 10:23.100
if what General Finn,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.100
his duties were different from those

10:25.100 --> 10:28.100
which the Department of Councilor had before I came

10:28.100 --> 10:31.100
and had after I arrived.

10:31.100 --> 10:34.100
But you were specifically assigned the host task,

10:34.100 --> 10:35.100
as we understand it.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.100
You were assigned the task,

10:36.100 --> 10:37.100
as I understand it,

10:37.100 --> 10:38.100
as in the affirmative.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.100
You knew Mr. Adams,

10:39.100 --> 10:41.100
when you came to the Army,

10:41.100 --> 10:42.100
you were appointed the first,

10:42.100 --> 10:44.100
that Senator McCarthy and his staff,

10:44.100 --> 10:46.100
who were investigating,

10:46.100 --> 10:48.100
the alleged infiltration

10:48.100 --> 10:50.100
of the first is the Fourth Monument,

10:50.100 --> 10:51.100
did you not?

10:51.100 --> 10:52.100
That's right.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.100
You knew that after you were inducted into office.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.100
Yes, sir.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.100
That is one of the first things

10:57.100 --> 10:58.100
the Secretary told you.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.100
Yes, sir.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.100
I think it's the Secretary's talk to you

11:01.100 --> 11:03.100
before you were actually employed,

11:03.100 --> 11:05.100
and before you were inducted into office,

11:05.100 --> 11:06.100
did he not?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.100
Yes, sir.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.100
For some several days,

11:08.100 --> 11:10.100
fired off to the first.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.100
Yes, sir.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.100
I think the first time that I talked to the Secretary prior

11:13.100 --> 11:14.100
to my appointment,

11:14.100 --> 11:15.100
which is about ten days,

11:15.100 --> 11:17.100
preceded my appointment,

11:17.100 --> 11:18.100
or two weeks.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.100
I'm hearing the course of that ten days

11:20.100 --> 11:22.100
or two weeks that you have.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.100
More than one of our several conferences

11:24.100 --> 11:27.100
with the Secretary looking to your employment.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.100
I had one conference with Mr. Steven,

11:30.100 --> 11:34.100
which was in the form of an interview,

11:34.100 --> 11:38.100
in which he did not specify anything about the duties.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.100
A week or two we laughed,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.100
so I'm not sure exactly.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.100
And I had another conference with him,

11:43.100 --> 11:46.100
in which he indicated that I would be appointed.

11:46.100 --> 11:50.100
I told him that for two or three days,

11:50.100 --> 11:51.100
previous to my appointment,

11:51.100 --> 11:53.100
I was going to go down to the office

11:53.100 --> 11:54.100
of the Department of Counselor,

11:54.100 --> 11:57.100
and all of the work which was being done,

11:57.100 --> 12:00.100
and more or less to watch the other people who worked.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.100
I did do that.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.100
I don't recall anything more than a

12:03.100 --> 12:06.100
for puncture and conversation with Mr. Steven.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.100
During that period prior to my appointment,

12:08.100 --> 12:10.100
with reference to the committee investigation.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.100
Well, you got a cleaning with him,

12:11.100 --> 12:13.100
and you had conferences with the impire

12:13.100 --> 12:15.100
to your formal employment, of course.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.100
That is correct.

12:16.100 --> 12:20.100
I did have one contact with the committee

12:20.100 --> 12:23.100
prior to October 1st.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.100
The committee was investigating...

12:28.100 --> 12:31.100
You mean with the McCarthy Committee?

12:31.100 --> 12:32.100
Yes, your welcome.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.100
Well, I thought I did.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.100
My associate told me I was wrong.

12:37.100 --> 12:41.100
I thought that the investigation of the Korean atrocities

12:41.100 --> 12:43.100
had preceded today or so.

12:43.100 --> 12:46.100
My appointment was about apparently it did not.

12:46.100 --> 12:49.100
I don't think about your contacts with the secretary.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.100
And in those contacts prior to your employment,

12:52.100 --> 12:55.100
no doubt your duties were outlined.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.100
And you were told,

12:57.100 --> 12:59.100
definitely what was expected of you.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.100
The character of work for which he sought your employment.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.100
Is that correct, Mr. Adam?

13:06.100 --> 13:09.100
Well, I don't think he told me much about it

13:09.100 --> 13:11.100
because I think he assumed that I knew.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.100
I have been in the synagogue for four years,

13:13.100 --> 13:16.100
and I knew my predecessor and I knew his predecessor,

13:16.100 --> 13:18.100
and I knew generally the function of that office.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.100
Well, Mr. Adam's did or not, he told you,

13:20.100 --> 13:22.100
but prior to your formal employment

13:22.100 --> 13:24.100
about his problem with the senator?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.100
No, Mr. Adam.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.100
Not to my right, please.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.100
Not to your recollection?

13:27.100 --> 13:28.100
No, sir.

13:28.100 --> 13:32.100
You did not know that you were being hired as a sort of a diplomat,

13:32.100 --> 13:35.100
as a sort of a peacemaker, as a sort of a go-between.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.100
I didn't know it then, and I don't know it now.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.100
You don't know that now.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.100
It's not the primary reason for my appointment.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.100
Well, all right.

13:42.100 --> 13:46.100
Did you know that it was one of the second-day reasons for your employment?

13:46.100 --> 13:48.100
I knew that it was one of the many functions of the office.

13:48.100 --> 13:53.100
And did you know that before you were formally employed and inducted in the office?

13:53.100 --> 13:56.100
I don't believe that I was fully aware

13:56.100 --> 13:58.100
before I became the department counsellor,

13:58.100 --> 14:03.100
as to the extent that the office was involved with congressional investigation.

14:03.100 --> 14:08.100
He just hired you because of your general policy commissions as an outstanding lawyer.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.100
That's correct.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.100
And he stated that...

14:11.100 --> 14:14.100
Maybe I shouldn't say that is correct.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.100
I don't know where he hired me as an outstanding lawyer.

14:17.100 --> 14:22.100
He told me that he was particularly pleased with the fact that I was a veteran of the Army,

14:22.100 --> 14:26.100
and that he was pleased with the fact that I was a middle-western,

14:26.100 --> 14:31.100
and that he was pleased with the fact that I had some knowledge of the working city congress,

14:31.100 --> 14:35.100
and he was pleased with the fact that I knew the organization of the Department of Defense,

14:35.100 --> 14:38.100
and that I had worked on the Defense Department reorganization.

14:38.100 --> 14:42.100
All of the experiences I had over the past four or five years,

14:42.100 --> 14:48.100
knelt it together and happened to make in me as sort of an individual he happened to be looking for.

14:49.100 --> 14:52.100
Very well now, I see your formal requirements.

14:52.100 --> 14:56.100
You then became fully acquainted with the secretary's problem,

14:56.100 --> 14:59.100
as it was a problem with Senator McCarthy and his staff.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.100
That's correct, didn't you?

15:00.100 --> 15:03.100
Yes, sir, but the secretary never indicated to me that it was a problem.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.100
Very well.

15:05.100 --> 15:11.100
Mr. Adam, did the secretary indicate to you our state to you,

15:11.100 --> 15:14.100
definitely that it was an embarrassing situation for him?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.100
He did not.

15:15.100 --> 15:18.100
He is the secretary of the Army,

15:18.100 --> 15:19.100
and McCarthy investigating,

15:19.100 --> 15:24.100
then the McCarthy and his staff investigating the verses in the Army.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.100
You say he did not indicate that it was embarrassing doing,

15:27.100 --> 15:28.100
did it not work?

15:28.100 --> 15:30.100
Did he indicate to you at that time,

15:30.100 --> 15:36.100
or ever, that he wanted those hearings and investigations of the Senator and his staff,

15:36.100 --> 15:39.100
discontinued?

15:39.100 --> 15:41.100
Did he say, ever?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.100
No, at that time,

15:43.100 --> 15:45.100
so struck me after your employment.

15:45.100 --> 15:51.100
Did he say you that there was a new and different directive

15:51.100 --> 15:53.100
dated April 27th,

15:53.100 --> 16:01.100
re-evaluating the procedures to be taken in the investigation of the birthdays?

16:01.100 --> 16:02.100
No, sir, he did not.

16:02.100 --> 16:05.100
Did you learn that to be a fact early in the course of your employment?

16:05.100 --> 16:06.100
I did, sir.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.100
You did.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.100
I knew that before I had come to work there.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.100
Very well.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.100
But sir, I didn't think quite well acquainted with it.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.100
I said, Joe,

16:13.100 --> 16:17.100
did you at the time of your employment or shortly as I have to know or learn?

16:17.100 --> 16:20.100
Or were you told by the secretary,

16:20.100 --> 16:24.100
that even though that directly was dated April 27th,

16:24.100 --> 16:28.100
nothing had been done about it by the secretary until the early part of September.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.100
No, sir.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.100
Did you later learn that to be a fact?

16:31.100 --> 16:32.100
No, sir.

16:32.100 --> 16:36.100
Have you read the secretary's statement, 25th-state statement?

16:36.100 --> 16:37.100
Yes, sir.

16:37.100 --> 16:40.100
Have you think you do not know it to be a fact?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.100
No, he did not.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.100
Sir, Adam,

16:43.100 --> 16:45.100
I will ask you,

16:45.100 --> 16:52.100
if you did not hand me a 40-page document prepared under your direction,

16:52.100 --> 16:57.100
for my use in the examination of you as a witness in this conference.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.100
It was handed to you by my counsel, yes, sir.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.100
And was it prepared by you?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.100
Yes, sir.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.100
Under your direction, you know it's content.

17:05.100 --> 17:06.100
Yes, sir.

17:07.100 --> 17:10.100
May I read just one paragraph now, sir?

17:10.100 --> 17:14.100
Adam, you say that you did not know it was a fact.

17:14.100 --> 17:18.100
Now, does nothing have been done under this new directive,

17:18.100 --> 17:21.100
under the new administration of April 27th,

17:21.100 --> 17:23.100
until the early part of September,

17:23.100 --> 17:25.100
and I now read that you may follow me,

17:25.100 --> 17:28.100
and it's on page one of your statements, right paragraph.

17:28.100 --> 17:32.100
In September prior to my appointment,

17:32.100 --> 17:35.100
the Army had already begun to review all the documents

17:35.100 --> 17:38.100
that were issued by the Army,

17:38.100 --> 17:41.100
and the Army had already begun to review all the whole

17:41.100 --> 17:44.100
of the security cases under the new criteria,

17:44.100 --> 17:48.100
the Spanish Prophecy and Eisenhower's Executive Order,

17:48.100 --> 17:50.100
April 27th, 1953.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.100
This included a review of all personnel reports,

17:53.100 --> 17:57.100
my mouth and previously has been considered for removal,

17:57.100 --> 18:00.100
but retained and acquired directives.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.100
I have been considered for a year,

18:02.100 --> 18:06.100
six degrees employees have been suspended from the farm.

18:06.100 --> 18:09.100
And so I have seen Mr. Adam,

18:09.100 --> 18:13.100
there isn't a fact that nothing was done

18:13.100 --> 18:17.100
under that directive of April 27th until September, 1953.

18:22.100 --> 18:26.100
I think there is not correct any correction.

18:26.100 --> 18:30.100
I think the fact that that is not so.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.100
Well, when was anything done under that directive of April 27th?

18:34.100 --> 18:36.100
Well now, when is the Secretary Axon,

18:36.100 --> 18:38.100
is there a new accident?

18:38.100 --> 18:40.100
I know you were not there a lot over first.

18:40.100 --> 18:44.100
I was not there until October 1st, very shortly after I arrived.

18:44.100 --> 18:50.100
There was admitted to the Secretary a series of reviews.

18:50.100 --> 18:53.100
In existing Army regulations,

18:53.100 --> 18:57.100
these reviews had been being prepared by the officers

18:57.100 --> 19:01.100
which handled the administration of the loyalty program,

19:01.100 --> 19:03.100
separate officers from mine.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.100
And I understood that those reviews had been being worked on

19:06.100 --> 19:08.100
during many months.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.100
I don't know how long.

19:09.100 --> 19:14.100
The directive of April 27th was a revision with the Nazi status.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.100
It was the adivision and President's Executive Order.

19:17.100 --> 19:22.100
When was any work our investigation conducted

19:22.100 --> 19:24.100
in the Army and particularly the Fort Monmouth,

19:24.100 --> 19:27.100
under the directive of April 27th?

19:27.100 --> 19:29.100
When was the first...

19:29.100 --> 19:32.100
When was the initial work done by the Secretary?

19:32.100 --> 19:35.100
Under that directive of April 27th?

19:35.100 --> 19:37.100
Well, shall you say by the Secretary?

19:37.100 --> 19:39.100
Well, I, the Secretary, am not by...

19:39.100 --> 19:44.100
that he embraces you now and all the important under the Secretary.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
The Secretary is ahead of the Army.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.100
He is needed, Secretary.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.100
All right.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.100
I don't mean by him personally.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.100
I mean by his fact.

19:52.100 --> 19:56.100
Well, I think the Secretary justified during one of the latter days

19:56.100 --> 20:00.100
of his examination last the Army had requested

20:00.100 --> 20:04.100
the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make a re-examination

20:04.100 --> 20:08.100
of loyalty matters and individuals that Fort Monmouth

20:08.100 --> 20:12.100
in the summer of 1953 shortly after the presidency's

20:12.100 --> 20:13.100
Executive Order.

20:13.100 --> 20:17.100
There were three different agencies that the Army

20:17.100 --> 20:20.100
which had responsibilities in the field of defense.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.100
Let's talk about yours, Mr. Adams.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.100
And we get along better.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.100
The one in the Army.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.100
You don't care for this hearing about the Navy or their...

20:27.100 --> 20:29.100
I said three different agencies in the Army.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.100
In the Army, very well.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.100
Very well.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.100
And one of them was the intelligence section

20:34.100 --> 20:37.100
of headquarters first Army in New York.

20:37.100 --> 20:41.100
Another was the intelligence section at Fort Monmouth.

20:41.100 --> 20:46.100
The third was the security division of G2 in the Army

20:46.100 --> 20:48.100
and had Washington.

20:48.100 --> 20:51.100
And I am not able to tell you the precise date

20:51.100 --> 20:56.100
when those agencies began to re-examine

20:56.100 --> 20:58.100
the cases of individuals.

20:58.100 --> 21:01.100
I do know that G2 is an FBI report

21:01.100 --> 21:04.100
and other investigative reports constantly were coming in

21:04.100 --> 21:06.100
to these intelligence agencies.

21:06.100 --> 21:10.100
And that's re-evaluation and study were constantly going on.

21:10.100 --> 21:13.100
Those facts were made available to me and were made clear to me

21:13.100 --> 21:15.100
shortly after I came to work for the Army.

21:16.100 --> 21:19.100
But the FBI agency is entirely separate

21:19.100 --> 21:21.100
that is the enemy of the Army's agency.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.100
That's right.

21:22.100 --> 21:25.100
And I ask you, Mr. Adams, when was the first suspension

21:25.100 --> 21:28.100
made of Fort Monmouth under the...

21:28.100 --> 21:30.100
under Secretary Steven Dredin.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.100
The first one was on 19 August.

21:34.100 --> 21:37.100
On 19 July of one person.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.100
One person?

21:38.100 --> 21:39.100
Yes.

21:39.100 --> 21:43.100
Do you know how many have been suspended when you came to all of them?

21:43.100 --> 21:46.100
I think six additional people were suspended

21:46.100 --> 21:48.100
in the last weekend of September.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.100
Did you know when Senator McCarthy and his staff

21:51.100 --> 21:56.100
began their investigations about the first use of queer rifts

21:56.100 --> 21:57.100
at Fort Monmouth?

21:57.100 --> 22:00.100
I have no knowledge of the committee's investigation

22:00.100 --> 22:03.100
for any time preceding October 1st or 2nd.

22:03.100 --> 22:07.100
Did you later learn that he actually had hearings in August?

22:08.100 --> 22:12.100
I did not learn that he had hearings on Fort Monmouth in August.

22:12.100 --> 22:17.100
But hearings with respect to the verses in the Army in August.

22:20.100 --> 22:23.100
He had hearings in New York on the verses

22:23.100 --> 22:26.100
who were in the employ of the Fort Monmouth before.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.100
I think in most instances,

22:28.100 --> 22:32.100
and one individual who was a guard at a signal-cord depot

22:32.100 --> 22:34.100
in New York in Separat.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.100
I remember.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.100
Again, I state I have not read those transcripts.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.100
I was not present at the hearing.

22:38.100 --> 22:41.100
Mr. Adams, how many suspensions were there?

22:41.100 --> 22:44.100
Susensions were as fexious as they were

22:44.100 --> 22:46.100
as though of Senator McCarthy's words.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.100
At Fort Monmouth.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.100
Were there not 35?

23:00.100 --> 23:02.100
There have been a total.

23:04.100 --> 23:08.100
There have been a total of 35 individuals

23:08.100 --> 23:10.100
who were suspended at Fort Monmouth.

23:10.100 --> 23:13.100
Did some of whom have been reinstated?

23:13.100 --> 23:15.100
How many have been reinstated with that?

23:15.100 --> 23:17.100
Well, I think it's 12.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.100
I think it has a number of suspensions.

23:19.100 --> 23:22.100
And 20 now in effect is 21.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.100
I think there were two resignations.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.100
Well, is that as I think we all agree?

23:29.100 --> 23:32.100
There are Fort Monmouth's words,

23:32.100 --> 23:35.100
a tremendously important Army installation.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.100
Do we not?

23:36.100 --> 23:37.100
Yes, sir.

23:37.100 --> 23:43.100
At which is located it probably the heart of the signal core of the Army?

23:43.100 --> 23:45.100
Is that correct?

23:45.100 --> 23:48.100
It is an important technical installation.

23:48.100 --> 23:53.100
I am not qualified to say whether it is the heart of the signal core.

23:53.100 --> 23:57.100
And would you say that in view of its importance

23:59.100 --> 24:06.100
as the seat to the heart of the Vade defenses set up for the Army against?

24:07.100 --> 24:11.100
And it taxed the enemy with a hydrogen or atomic bomb

24:11.100 --> 24:14.100
that it was tremendously important to discover

24:14.100 --> 24:18.100
and sustain the core security we expect.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.100
It is important, sir.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.100
It always was important and it always will be important.

24:22.100 --> 24:26.100
And so you regard it your work's of the McCarthy Committee

24:26.100 --> 24:28.100
as a tremendous important support modelist.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.100
Did you not?

24:29.100 --> 24:31.100
I always considered the work of the McCarthy.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.100
That was what worked.

24:32.100 --> 24:35.100
Work's primarily...

24:35.100 --> 24:37.100
Did you see how it was?

24:37.100 --> 24:42.100
I didn't told the National Council of the Court that I had this account for.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.100
It didn't have to be finished.

24:44.100 --> 24:47.100
Sometimes it's difficult to tell, but it can't be finished tonight.

24:47.100 --> 24:50.100
I will interrupt the Council if I don't think that.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.100
Very good.

24:52.100 --> 24:56.100
That work was primarily the duty of the Army, too, was the Mountain of the Saddam.

24:56.100 --> 24:58.100
I'm afraid you don't have to restate it.

24:58.100 --> 25:01.100
The introduction has what work is it to refer to?

25:01.100 --> 25:05.100
The work of discovering and suspending these

25:05.100 --> 25:08.100
foolish and subversive support modelists.

25:08.100 --> 25:12.100
Yes, sir. Security is a continuing command responsibility.

25:12.100 --> 25:18.100
Well, I must add, if the Secretary tells you that he first learned of that

25:18.100 --> 25:22.100
when he was in Montana,

25:22.100 --> 25:25.100
on Labor Day, that he first learned about support modelists,

25:25.100 --> 25:28.100
that he first learned the Senator McCarthy had under investigation

25:28.100 --> 25:31.100
three bad risks to support Mama's.

25:31.100 --> 25:34.100
And that he learned of an on Labor Day, September 53.

25:34.100 --> 25:39.100
No, sir. I think that the individuals under investigation by Senator McCarthy

25:39.100 --> 25:41.100
were not support modelists.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.100
What were they in the Army? They were in the Army.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.100
They were like a say-tell you that.

25:45.100 --> 25:46.100
Yes, sir.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.100
Did he tell you that was embarrassing to him?

25:48.100 --> 25:49.100
No, sir.

25:49.100 --> 25:51.100
Never did he finally take such a place.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.100
No, sir.

25:52.100 --> 25:57.100
Never did he tell you that he was used to use all of your persuasive

25:57.100 --> 26:05.100
abilities and your power and bring about a cessation or suspension.

26:05.100 --> 26:08.100
I'll send them a slice of work at Fort Monmouth.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.100
Never at any time, though, you might.

26:10.100 --> 26:14.100
If you did that, Mr. Adams, if you do it on your own in the city,

26:14.100 --> 26:15.100
I didn't do it.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.100
You didn't do it.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.100
You never at any time.

26:18.100 --> 26:21.100
Stop either of this continuous.

26:21.100 --> 26:26.100
Or even a height of this in that work, the suspension.

26:27.100 --> 26:30.100
I thought you saying you got right, Mr. Adams.

26:30.100 --> 26:31.100
That's right.

26:31.100 --> 26:38.100
I mean, madam, the heavy is fading in your 40-page statement.

26:38.100 --> 26:44.100
That file Senator McCarthy's been in office this work.

26:44.100 --> 26:49.100
And did uncover these bad news, bring about this suspension?

26:49.100 --> 26:52.100
Never the least, you would have done it.

26:52.100 --> 26:55.100
And by you, I mean you and Mr. Steven.

26:55.100 --> 27:01.100
If you've been given more time to do it, is that correct?

27:01.100 --> 27:04.100
I didn't say anything in the statement about being given more time.

27:04.100 --> 27:09.100
Let me reach your frontiers statement on page 5.

27:09.100 --> 27:16.100
Some of these suspension took place more quickly than might have been the case otherwise.

27:16.100 --> 27:21.100
You mean more quickly because of what the Senator from Wisconsin and his father did?

27:21.100 --> 27:23.100
I do, sir.

27:23.100 --> 27:30.100
What's probably would have taken a few months under ordinary procedures was done in a few weeks.

27:30.100 --> 27:35.100
You mean that what the Army would have required a few months to do?

27:35.100 --> 27:39.100
Senator McCarthy and his A's did in a few weeks?

27:39.100 --> 27:42.100
No, I can just read it on a few more times to describe.

27:42.100 --> 27:46.100
Well, you can answer that question. I'm going to read all.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.100
I'm leading your words now.

27:49.100 --> 27:55.100
You're talking about here about what the McCarthy Committee did at Fort Monmouth.

27:55.100 --> 28:01.100
And you say here that the suspension took place more quickly than they would have otherwise.

28:01.100 --> 28:02.100
That's correct.

28:02.100 --> 28:04.100
And the property in the district.

28:04.100 --> 28:11.100
And the property would have taken a few months under ordinary procedures was done in a few weeks.

28:11.100 --> 28:14.100
You mean that I take it with that?

28:14.100 --> 28:19.100
That these suspension would have required a few months' time of the Army,

28:19.100 --> 28:25.100
whereas Senator McCarthy, the told him it's a car and other members of the staff did it in a few weeks.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.100
Is that what you mean?

28:26.100 --> 28:27.100
No, sir, I don't.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.100
All right, what do you think?

28:28.100 --> 28:30.100
The state said that these things would have occurred.

28:30.100 --> 28:35.100
I know that the state of order required an examination of all the security cases

28:35.100 --> 28:38.100
and the sure that these actions ultimately would have occurred.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.100
All right.

28:39.100 --> 28:44.100
The quick action at Fort Monmouth was because the Secretary directed his personal attention

28:44.100 --> 28:47.100
and his personal staff had one particular area.

28:47.100 --> 28:51.100
This he did because of the headlines and the bad effects they were having on any morale.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.100
All right.

28:52.100 --> 28:54.100
Same question.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.100
So it's not only for much Senator McCarthy,

28:57.100 --> 29:02.100
but because the Secretary then directed his energies in that direction.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.100
That's correct.

29:03.100 --> 29:04.100
Yes, sir.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.100
And you say that it would have occurred?

29:06.100 --> 29:13.100
Yes, that you would ultimately have brought about the same results as the Secretary and his staff

29:13.100 --> 29:16.100
if you had been given more time to do it.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.100
That's correct, sir.

29:17.100 --> 29:20.100
In other words, I didn't use the word if we had been given more time.

29:20.100 --> 29:22.100
But you say the general idea is correct.

29:22.100 --> 29:23.100
That is correct.

29:23.100 --> 29:27.100
Ultimately, the same thing would have been accomplished as it is being accomplished at other installation.

29:27.100 --> 29:34.100
In other words, you were using the water with which to put out the fire.

29:34.100 --> 29:38.100
Whereas the Senator was turning on the holes or calling out the barriers.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.100
Is that right?

29:43.100 --> 29:44.100
Well, all right.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.100
Just let your silence be your answer if you can.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.100
I don't quite understand.

29:48.100 --> 29:52.100
Mr. Adams, in all of your press releases,

29:52.100 --> 29:53.100
this is a recall.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.100
You think of espionage at Fort Monmouth, do you not?

29:56.100 --> 29:57.100
Yes.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.100
What's the Secretary's duty?

29:59.100 --> 30:01.100
Your...

30:01.100 --> 30:03.100
You say in all of our questions.

30:03.100 --> 30:10.100
Well, we have said that to November 13th, November 60th, or approximately those things.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.100
You speak of espionage.

30:11.100 --> 30:14.100
The Secretary is press conference of November 30th.

30:14.100 --> 30:16.100
I am, and his press conference.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.100
You have the emergency squad on November 7th.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.100
Yes, sir.

30:19.100 --> 30:22.100
You speak of espionage at Fort Monmouth, do you not?

30:22.100 --> 30:24.100
The Secretary spoke of permanent.

30:24.100 --> 30:30.100
And nowhere in those releases do you speak of subversive security issues.

30:30.100 --> 30:31.100
No, sir.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.100
Well, Mr. Secretary, I'm Mr. Adams.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.100
What is it, the Secretary?

30:36.100 --> 30:38.100
I did burriott.

30:38.100 --> 30:42.100
I'll put it this way.

30:42.100 --> 30:45.100
Isn't it the Secretary's burriott?

30:45.100 --> 30:48.100
An embryonic spy.

31:01.100 --> 31:10.100
Thank you.
