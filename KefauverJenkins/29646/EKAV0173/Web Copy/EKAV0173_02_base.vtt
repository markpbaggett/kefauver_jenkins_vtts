WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.400
Abraham, stole from me the

00:30.000 --> 00:40.260
you

01:00.000 --> 01:25.240
I haveWhen they

01:25.240 --> 01:26.460
are

01:26.460 --> 01:28.300
они

01:28.300 --> 01:29.920
forty

01:30.860 --> 01:32.860
I

01:32.860 --> 01:35.100
From

01:43.100 --> 01:46.300
No

01:47.340 --> 01:51.000
And

01:57.340 --> 01:59.140
Are

01:59.920 --> 02:01.920
Well

02:03.640 --> 02:07.400
Going on and I'm again leaving now from

02:09.160 --> 02:11.160
Your document

02:13.680 --> 02:15.680
Continuing for the pages

02:22.800 --> 02:24.800
And on page seven

02:25.160 --> 02:27.160
Are you satisfied

02:28.160 --> 02:30.160
You were never instructed by the secretary

02:31.480 --> 02:33.480
Bring about a combination of these years

02:37.720 --> 02:43.160
Starting off the page and we're talking about this incident in the October 20th now up at the Fort Monmouth

02:44.080 --> 02:46.480
When Lieutenant Corps done a lot of these

02:47.440 --> 02:50.840
Then that he did not see why I was up there over coal-sangers

02:51.480 --> 02:56.400
I've pointed out to him that I had discovered that coal had both the capacity

02:57.520 --> 03:00.160
The message into the chains the Sunnader's plan

03:01.400 --> 03:03.400
to terminate the investigation

03:04.120 --> 03:11.720
And give his finding to the artist and the influence over Senator McCartney to throw all the investigation indefinitely

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
if you wish

03:14.880 --> 03:17.880
That and doesn't that isn't that and

03:18.520 --> 03:22.320
Admission or a confession that at least you wanted these

03:22.320 --> 03:24.320
Investigations

03:24.320 --> 03:29.480
Terminated artists and venues it is not an estimation and it was not a confession the other customers

03:31.440 --> 03:35.920
On both the 13th and the 14th of October while Mr. Stephen was in New York

03:36.720 --> 03:40.760
visiting with the Senate of the Lieutenant of McCartney and watching the investigative hearing

03:41.280 --> 03:45.000
Senator McCartney volunteers the information to Mr. Stephen that

03:45.520 --> 03:51.600
He felt that the committee has largely completed its investigation and it insipiates he would concern

03:52.320 --> 03:56.080
He was ready about ready to transfer his records

03:56.640 --> 04:00.560
Transcripts and information to the Army so that the Army could continue the investigation

04:01.200 --> 04:03.680
During the balance of that week for the 15th of October

04:04.560 --> 04:05.680
of like

04:05.680 --> 04:13.200
14 15 and 15th of October I heard nothing from Mr. Cohn or from Mr. Cohn or from Senator McCartney to indicate that there was any change in

04:13.200 --> 04:19.320
Senator McCartney's plan the one which he had fallen here is the secretary twice on the 13th and on the 14th

04:19.720 --> 04:24.280
The following week was to the day which was the day that entered and occurred I was

04:25.640 --> 04:34.040
Operating under the illusion or the assumption the Senate of McCartney had concluded that he was largely through with the investigation and plans to turn it back to the Army

04:35.560 --> 04:38.360
And it was based upon that assumption that I made those remarks

04:38.360 --> 04:42.360
So you walked the senator's to do that the conclusion hearings and turning back to the Army

04:43.240 --> 04:47.000
Now I have the question again. I say to you desire that Senator McCartney and his aide

04:47.560 --> 04:51.800
Consumed our terminate their dreams and turn that work back to the Army

04:52.440 --> 04:57.560
I expected that that's what they were going to do. I'll have a message in your desires about it

04:58.360 --> 05:02.280
Well, I don't think I felt strongly one way or another but as long as that was the program I

05:02.920 --> 05:07.000
Was getting ready to help my staff and talk to the next story people to follow fast program

05:07.000 --> 05:08.840
If it was going to be put in effect you're right

05:08.840 --> 05:12.760
Clearly as it was a matter of indifference to you whether the senator and his aide

05:13.160 --> 05:20.120
Considered his in your investigation of the verses in the Army. That's where I can get her as I have stated congressional investigations

05:20.920 --> 05:29.880
In integral part of me of my operation and there are always two three one or four investigations of some sort before one or another

05:29.880 --> 05:31.880
Kennedy with which we're absorbed

05:33.080 --> 05:35.080
The fact that this one was going on was just

05:36.280 --> 05:38.040
Something obviously the work is

05:38.040 --> 05:41.240
The rather you realize the enough that you have not answered my question

05:41.400 --> 05:43.400
I didn't realize a certain place the question again

05:43.400 --> 05:48.200
The question is, is writing your answer to the previous question is that it was a matter of indifference to you

05:49.320 --> 05:51.480
That's the whether or not senator McCartney and his aide

05:52.440 --> 05:58.680
Continues our terminate their investigations of the verses in the Army. That's what I'm saying directly. I think that's correct

05:58.680 --> 06:00.680
That is the answer

06:00.680 --> 06:05.480
I'm so you say that when this outburst occurred on the parts of the school

06:07.480 --> 06:09.480
So the army

06:09.560 --> 06:12.120
Report monies on the 20th of October

06:13.560 --> 06:18.920
This outburst to this organization of millions of men as described for the secretary

06:20.040 --> 06:22.040
And this blue planet is aimed to use

06:22.760 --> 06:28.520
You're the second up to the second highest officer in the Army are you not the president? I would suspect them about the 30 seconds

06:28.600 --> 06:31.960
That's the 30 seconds very well. That's still pretty high up on the

06:33.800 --> 06:37.880
Only ended the end is not very high this young man named you

06:38.360 --> 06:40.360
This blue planet is not the you

06:41.080 --> 06:46.360
I just found for the army why you have said over this outburst on the part of the

06:47.800 --> 06:49.800
And you say you pointed out to him then

06:50.920 --> 06:53.880
That you discovered that mr. Cohn has the capacity

06:54.600 --> 07:00.280
So let's get the incident change the senator's plans to terminate the investigation and give the findings back to the army

07:01.400 --> 07:04.680
And further that he has sufficient influence over senator McCartney

07:05.320 --> 07:09.240
For long the investigation indefinitely you make both statements

07:09.640 --> 07:13.960
And yet you say that that investigation was a matter of uttering difference to you. Well, I

07:15.720 --> 07:17.400
I think that better

07:17.400 --> 07:20.680
Qualify the answer to whether it was a letter in different professionally

07:21.160 --> 07:23.880
It was a it was a matter of worth as far as I was concerned

07:25.080 --> 07:27.080
I was beginning to get uneasy about that time

07:27.720 --> 07:31.480
About the headlines then how they compared to what was going on in the executive session

07:32.120 --> 07:33.640
but

07:33.720 --> 07:36.440
I had not yet reached the point where I was making over

07:37.480 --> 07:42.440
Or over plans plans for over at to accomplish and end of the area in any manner was

07:43.480 --> 07:46.440
Well, make whoever make over to act to accomplish the end of the area

07:47.000 --> 07:50.440
You say to me that it's okay. No, I said to say you I never read that point

07:51.640 --> 07:54.440
I made over to act if we're in any way in proper

07:55.960 --> 07:59.480
What if you ever make any over to act with the idea mind of bringing you here?

08:00.440 --> 08:01.720
none

08:01.800 --> 08:03.480
Now I read you further

08:03.480 --> 08:05.480
Mr. Adams from your

08:05.480 --> 08:07.480
testimony

08:07.480 --> 08:09.480
on page 25 19 of the record

08:12.120 --> 08:14.120
as follows

08:14.920 --> 08:17.720
Holmes distress calls me in turn to be the threat

08:18.920 --> 08:20.920
Our folks me out of cone jane

08:21.800 --> 08:26.360
And then he didn't understand why I got got so upset about a matter of this order because he said

08:27.160 --> 08:29.160
This man is an employee of this image

08:29.720 --> 08:31.160
He is not a senator

08:31.240 --> 08:33.800
He didn't see why it should be upset about that

08:34.600 --> 08:39.080
I responded that I have found out already that Mr. Cohn had the capacity

08:39.720 --> 08:41.720
to control what happened to the committee

08:42.600 --> 08:46.200
And that he has the capacity to spread hearing wrong and terminably

08:47.080 --> 08:49.240
Our attorney mob is he killed

08:49.240 --> 08:52.040
And that I was not happy about having cone angrily

08:52.040 --> 08:54.040
Have I let you testimony correct?

08:54.840 --> 08:57.320
And then I refer you to your statement on page 15

08:57.960 --> 09:02.920
He gave us reasons that it would appear to be a deal with Mr. Cohn

09:04.040 --> 09:06.840
And with the damaging to the subcommittees festivities

09:07.960 --> 09:12.120
These were the main reasons call the fancy me shortly before

09:14.600 --> 09:16.600
Have I read that?

09:16.840 --> 09:18.040
When in one

09:18.040 --> 09:19.400
In

09:19.400 --> 09:23.160
You say that the reason was that it was the damaging to the prestige

09:23.800 --> 09:27.560
Of the subcommittee and in the others

09:29.240 --> 09:31.240
That you have the subversive

09:31.240 --> 09:35.400
That Mr. Cohn has the capacity to continue these investigations in depth

09:36.200 --> 09:40.600
You consider that there be any discrepancy in those statements as well

09:41.240 --> 09:43.240
You said that in one instance I said

09:43.960 --> 09:46.600
That it would be damaging to the prestige of the subcommittee

09:46.600 --> 09:48.440
I did not say that I was told

09:49.640 --> 09:50.600
You were told that?

09:50.600 --> 09:51.400
Yes

09:51.480 --> 09:52.680
About whom?

09:52.680 --> 09:53.640
I send him to my target

09:53.640 --> 09:54.680
Send him to my target

09:55.480 --> 09:57.480
Now further reading on page 7

09:57.480 --> 10:00.120
And further question to you about tourism is this news?

10:00.120 --> 10:01.640
Is that his use or disemitting?

10:02.360 --> 10:05.720
I believe you stated that I said this much in on the 20th of the fourth month

10:06.440 --> 10:08.440
The Secretary of the Army is the head of the Army

10:09.480 --> 10:11.560
In the presence of 25 people

10:12.520 --> 10:14.680
Apologize to Mr. Cohn

10:14.680 --> 10:17.480
We're not allowing him to go in the district lab resources

10:17.480 --> 10:18.360
Is that right?

10:18.360 --> 10:19.160
Yes

10:19.240 --> 10:23.480
The stratum did they not do that as you were interested

10:24.600 --> 10:25.640
No, there I was surprised

10:25.640 --> 10:26.120
I mean it is

10:26.120 --> 10:26.760
You were surprised

10:26.760 --> 10:29.560
I was at the other end of a large square table

10:29.560 --> 10:33.720
And I think Colonel Blue was sitting beside me

10:33.720 --> 10:35.640
And Mr. Cohn has the table

10:35.640 --> 10:39.160
I had told him and Blue had told him also how English home was

10:39.800 --> 10:40.040
But

10:42.760 --> 10:45.240
I think of 1520 or half 30 minutes

10:45.240 --> 10:48.680
At the last sequence of the time I last talked to him during which time there had been lunch

10:49.800 --> 10:54.200
And the conclusion of lunch and there had been short remarks made by

10:54.200 --> 10:55.640
Senator McCarthy and by

10:57.640 --> 11:00.920
I think by the Congressman and the Senator over there

11:00.920 --> 11:03.960
And as I recall this is the sequence of making the concluding remarks

11:04.760 --> 11:07.640
And as he concluded he made this remarks

11:07.640 --> 11:12.440
That was a very gracious and generous sort of apology to me

11:12.440 --> 11:14.600
But seems as a surprise to you Mr. Cohn

11:14.600 --> 11:15.480
I had not expected

11:15.480 --> 11:17.320
And of course that was the cause

11:17.320 --> 11:18.840
Nothing has gone on before

11:19.320 --> 11:21.320
That was called for an apology in Europe

11:23.160 --> 11:25.720
Well I think that I've been Mr. Cohn

11:27.480 --> 11:30.120
I would have found the time to take you home before I left the

11:31.320 --> 11:33.720
Before I left in that day I was telling that I was fired

11:33.720 --> 11:35.080
But the thing came out that way

11:35.080 --> 11:37.400
I did not expect Mr. Cohn to do publicly

11:38.040 --> 11:40.920
I was much more than a very nice and gracious thing to do with my opinion

11:42.360 --> 11:44.040
Mr. Cohn has done nothing

11:46.200 --> 11:47.800
Which called for an apology

11:47.880 --> 11:49.480
In making a decision that only

11:49.480 --> 11:51.160
Certain cases would go into that laboratory

11:52.280 --> 11:53.080
All right

11:53.080 --> 11:57.160
Now we start off with the major premise of Mr. Cohn that does nothing to call for an apology

11:57.160 --> 11:57.960
That's right, Jimmy

11:57.960 --> 11:59.160
Not in my opinion he had

11:59.160 --> 12:00.440
But he did apologize

12:00.440 --> 12:01.320
Yes sir

12:01.320 --> 12:01.960
Very gracious

12:01.960 --> 12:03.400
Then Mr. Adams

12:03.400 --> 12:06.200
If he had done nothing to call for an apology

12:06.200 --> 12:09.320
But did apologize so that your man who obviously was angry

12:10.040 --> 12:12.440
Wasn't it for the purpose of appeasing

12:13.640 --> 12:14.440
Mr. Cohn

12:15.320 --> 12:17.320
The members of his staff

12:19.320 --> 12:22.440
Well you're asking me what Mr. Cohn's purpose was

12:22.440 --> 12:24.600
He was here for many days and he talked to you

12:24.600 --> 12:28.600
In my opinion it was the sort of thing that any government official would do

12:29.800 --> 12:31.800
If an incident occurred involving

12:31.800 --> 12:36.440
Conversion of the employees when he was a participant in the incident and where he made himself

12:36.440 --> 12:38.440
With some decision that his has called the incident

12:39.400 --> 12:41.160
I don't think there were any appeasements

12:41.160 --> 12:43.000
We were in business with this committee

12:43.080 --> 12:45.720
We expected to continue in business in business later

12:45.720 --> 12:50.840
And insofar as I can recall there had never been a time during my employment in the Pentagon

12:50.840 --> 12:53.640
When it hasn't been expanded back to the chance to maintain

12:53.640 --> 12:56.120
Pleasant relationship with congressional committee and their best

12:57.160 --> 12:58.680
That isn't easy

12:58.680 --> 13:00.680
That's living with people

13:00.680 --> 13:01.720
All right

13:01.720 --> 13:05.560
On the 9th beat you had prepared an investment for the center make it your turn

13:05.560 --> 13:06.360
Yes sir I had

13:07.320 --> 13:09.560
And the effect of that was Mr. Adams

13:10.600 --> 13:12.360
That there was

13:12.360 --> 13:14.360
Nothing to worry about as far as

13:15.960 --> 13:16.760
They say

13:16.760 --> 13:19.640
I think it's been ready to direct this why don't we look at it

13:19.640 --> 13:21.720
But the patterns I'll be having to do with

13:21.720 --> 13:24.840
The question either perhaps this was more available than you and the meeting

13:24.840 --> 13:26.600
I have a right here

13:28.600 --> 13:29.560
Do you want to read it in?

13:29.560 --> 13:30.440
You prepared it

13:30.440 --> 13:31.240
I just said yes

13:31.240 --> 13:32.440
I have an excuse

13:34.200 --> 13:35.240
The post statement

13:35.240 --> 13:36.840
I can reply to this

13:36.840 --> 13:39.160
This is the committee's existence number 8

13:39.160 --> 13:40.040
Very well

13:40.120 --> 13:42.440
The post statement to be delivered at Fort Monmouth

13:42.440 --> 13:44.120
Drasted on the 19th of October

13:45.160 --> 13:49.080
I have been very favorably impressed by all that I have seen today at Fort Monmouth

13:49.080 --> 13:52.360
And also have been very impressed by the aggressive steps being taken both here

13:52.360 --> 13:54.600
As opposed by General Law and the Post Commander

13:54.600 --> 13:58.600
And by Secretary of the Army, Steven Dundewocking to improve security measures at Fort Monmouth

13:58.600 --> 13:59.880
And do also take the course

14:01.000 --> 14:04.360
The fact of President Adams' deputy has developed with respect to security violations

14:04.360 --> 14:08.040
And some certain of Fort Monmouth have all been brought to the attention of the Secretary of the Army

14:08.760 --> 14:13.320
And the transcripts of all executive sessions have now been submitted to the Army for evaluation and study

14:13.320 --> 14:17.320
In connection with the various security cases now being processed by the Army

14:17.320 --> 14:21.000
Traditionally, I am sent to submit the transcripts of the hearings to the Department of Justice

14:21.000 --> 14:25.320
And the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the termination as to whether the Treasury has been submitted

14:25.320 --> 14:29.000
By certain licences who have sent clear material information from the canate

14:29.000 --> 14:34.440
And also to assist the FBI and President investigations of individuals whose names were brought to the same canate

14:34.520 --> 14:41.480
I have every confidence that Secretary Steven Dundewocking will move immediately and effectively to continue the investigation already undertaken by the Secretary

14:41.480 --> 14:48.440
I have a sure Secretary Steven that the Secretary is available to assist the Army however needed in standing out some versioned elements in the Army

14:48.440 --> 14:53.240
And that is the supreme power by which the Congress and Committee can determine facts from reluctant witnesses

14:54.440 --> 15:01.080
For ex employees, but which is not ordinary available to the head of the department, is available to the Army from this committee on the Army's request

15:01.160 --> 15:05.320
Provided the Army and how they difficultly can its investigation of the versions and need help

15:06.200 --> 15:11.640
I know that there are many thousands of competent, capable and complete of all Americans in the employable signal car has worked on

15:12.200 --> 15:16.680
To these many people I can only say that I am proud of the citizen and as a senator of the words that they are doing

15:17.640 --> 15:20.520
The fact that it's small group, that's better very small group

15:20.520 --> 15:27.640
A very small fraction of one percent of all these employees have passed records of political beliefs and associations of the types to render them perfect

15:27.960 --> 15:30.280
There's no reflection on any other faithful employees

15:30.920 --> 15:33.800
Loyal employees know that they are loyal and they should have no concern

15:34.600 --> 15:38.680
equally those who refuse with record are not acceptable have reasons to know for their

15:39.480 --> 15:41.480
Know the reasons for their predicament

15:41.800 --> 15:43.800
They are the few that apples who are painting the barrel

15:44.680 --> 15:50.120
I believe that our recent hearing has brought their names out and that's from here forward the Army should be able to finish the job we have to

15:51.080 --> 15:56.040
There are still some witnesses on the subcommittee and they will be heard later this week in New York in a legislative session

15:56.760 --> 16:00.120
Following both hearing get it our presence planned to hold open hearing down the same subject

16:00.280 --> 16:02.280
Probably in New York

16:02.280 --> 16:05.720
Happy hearing those individuals who passed record or perform and that's that that you have cast

16:06.520 --> 16:09.320
But the bad right over Fort Monmouth will have an opportunity to defend themselves

16:10.360 --> 16:14.120
Those who are unable especially to do so of course will be branded for all the citizens

16:15.720 --> 16:16.920
That's not all I'm prepared

16:16.920 --> 16:20.200
Now you want me to sign that statement

16:21.240 --> 16:23.400
I don't want to sign it I thought you might issue this for a moment

16:23.400 --> 16:24.760
I will ask you prepare it for that purpose

16:24.760 --> 16:28.200
Yes, I need that very statement you and her having him say

16:29.160 --> 16:34.760
That he is now turning back to the army is in investigation of for a fort moth. That's correct

16:35.000 --> 16:36.040
That's correct

16:36.040 --> 16:37.480
All right

16:37.480 --> 16:40.600
The defenders are inside of it. He does not have this statement. No, sir

16:40.600 --> 16:45.800
I want to issue the place. No, sir. I want to restate so you serve in the context of the consideration of listening around

16:46.280 --> 16:48.280
For only five days previously

16:48.280 --> 16:50.280
The party had states that that was it

16:51.240 --> 16:53.720
And that was the thing that motivated me to prepare

16:54.120 --> 16:55.720
And I

16:55.720 --> 16:57.720
My

16:57.720 --> 16:57.720


16:57.720 --> 16:59.720
If it wasn't you

16:59.720 --> 17:01.720
But I like when I can when I'm going someplace

17:01.720 --> 17:03.720
To be fair and spend

17:03.720 --> 17:05.720
Immigated that he wanted that he was willing

17:09.720 --> 17:11.720
In the

17:11.720 --> 17:13.720
You

17:13.720 --> 17:15.720
To

17:15.720 --> 17:17.720
Different

17:23.720 --> 17:25.720
I

17:25.720 --> 17:29.720
Didn't hear the last time you realize those statements are really the

17:29.720 --> 17:31.720
Few are just none of this

17:31.720 --> 17:34.720
About to the place and the first was that I say wasn't

17:35.720 --> 17:41.720
At fort moth. Yes, they used to say that it was a matter of indifference to you and this other you

17:42.360 --> 17:45.720
So whether or not the Secretary confused his investigation of for moth

17:46.920 --> 17:48.920
Well perhaps

17:48.920 --> 17:52.920
The word a matter of indifference was not the word I should have used

17:52.920 --> 17:54.920
In different

17:54.920 --> 18:00.520
Not correct of course I had an assignment and investigation and as long as it continued I had the work

18:02.120 --> 18:04.120
Professionally

18:04.120 --> 18:09.320
It was in the final which might continue another week or another month and as far as that I was concerned professionally

18:10.120 --> 18:17.320
It would be to this investigation or another investigation. I prepared this press release with the thought of the Secretary of the Secretary of the Secretary my promulgated

18:17.720 --> 18:19.720
He did not promulgate it. I made no fuss over it

18:19.720 --> 18:21.720
I didn't even

18:21.720 --> 18:25.080
Diapainfully it's just one of the things that was suggested was not

18:25.720 --> 18:30.820
You followed him into the men's room. Well, is it he? No sir? Not with it. No, we have a

18:30.820 --> 18:32.820
Congress in there

18:32.820 --> 18:40.220
All the Senator go in and this comb go with him going with the comers mad you and in my I just and you went in there for the purpose

18:40.720 --> 18:47.220
I've counter balancing any influence you thought Mr. Cohn was in the House of Democratic and was the idea in mind of his releasing

18:47.720 --> 18:51.220
This statement to the White House is about to go on right make a little consultation

18:52.720 --> 18:54.720
This what you mean is nearly the truth

18:55.220 --> 19:00.220
No, sorry. I think so that I will not be crossing them into later on statements I made now

19:00.720 --> 19:04.220
Which might the assumption might be an act with me. I correct something with you a statement

19:05.820 --> 19:07.820
This exhibit number eight

19:08.220 --> 19:12.420
Was the draft I prepared on the 19th and fifths in its comb

19:13.420 --> 19:15.820
As I recall he sent me back every day

19:17.720 --> 19:19.720
Which is your subcommittee exhibit number

19:23.820 --> 19:26.720
Probably subcommittee a bit of number 10

19:31.020 --> 19:33.020
We took on to the airplane with it I

19:34.220 --> 19:38.720
Think both versions I'm not sure whether we just both number eight and number 10 on the aircraft

19:39.020 --> 19:43.020
But the matter with the trust a little bit on the aircraft and a revision

19:43.520 --> 19:50.820
Which is your exhibit number 11 was miniatrath that fort munless after having been substantially agreed to by senator McCarthy on the airplane

19:50.820 --> 19:56.020
Incipised I can now remember so the matter that we were discussing is not a good at number eight sure

19:56.020 --> 20:00.620
That's the thing I wanted to correct but a statement which the senator had indicated

20:02.120 --> 20:05.520
When we arrived at fort munless that he was probably homing a day

20:06.520 --> 20:11.120
So that I am incorrect now mr. Adam. Let's get it straight. I'm incorrect

20:11.620 --> 20:18.320
When I ask you are soon that the purpose of your following senator McCarthy and mr.

20:19.320 --> 20:24.520
Into the men's restroom was for the purpose of counter balancing mr.

20:25.520 --> 20:29.920
In front of the center and getting the senator to Zana greets you that press release

20:30.120 --> 20:33.200
Well, I don't think that I was going when I follow the moon there

20:33.200 --> 20:36.360
I don't think it was for the pre-sites and the epic purpose

20:38.360 --> 20:40.360
There's men ordinarily go

20:41.360 --> 20:43.360
Why did you go in there mr. Adam

20:45.920 --> 20:48.400
Not for the reasons the ground seems to think well

20:55.120 --> 20:57.120
All right now we've eliminated one reason

20:57.120 --> 20:59.120
Now

21:00.920 --> 21:08.400
Specifically why did you get up from the luncheon table and follow senator McCarthy and Roy Cohn in the

21:09.120 --> 21:11.120
Men's room. I don't know any other

21:12.120 --> 21:14.120
Cohn

21:14.120 --> 21:16.120
Very very

21:16.120 --> 21:19.600
The last hour or so as a result of this laboratory situation and

21:21.360 --> 21:27.080
Inspired I knew at that time that of a McCarthy was prepared to release a statement that was

21:27.120 --> 21:28.320
on

21:28.320 --> 21:31.480
And I knew that Cohn followed in the McCarthy out of the room

21:32.520 --> 21:37.200
And I knew he was angry with me. I hope that I would get an opportunity to talk to him

21:37.200 --> 21:41.120
McCarthy and perhaps in the presence of both of them accomplish a little

21:41.760 --> 21:47.160
Playkating or conciliating. I didn't know what I would accomplish. Yeah, and I didn't accomplish anything

21:47.160 --> 21:51.680
Then it was for the purpose of playkating and conciliating the senator and mr. Cohn

21:51.680 --> 21:56.200
Well, mr. Cohn wasn't a senator, but I I wanted the senator to be aware of

21:58.120 --> 22:05.360
The situation that existed and so it can't be in my own small way to apologize to the development of the incidents and

22:05.680 --> 22:10.960
Say if I could say that it didn't do anything to ruffle about appears to be the plan of the morning

22:12.440 --> 22:16.920
I we've been what it is and you win even for the purpose of you have just now expressed on the witness

22:16.920 --> 22:18.920
I have the idea

22:18.920 --> 22:24.680
I'm a there now to receive you from your testimony on page 257 of the time script. Oh, yes today

22:24.680 --> 22:27.840
And at the bottom of the page

22:28.840 --> 22:30.840
Mr.

22:30.840 --> 22:37.240
Some time hearing the course of the luncheon senator McCarthy left the dining room for a moment and mr. Cohn followed him

22:37.240 --> 22:39.240
I

22:39.240 --> 22:45.200
Have a feeling that this would be the time that the best release would be killed

22:48.600 --> 22:50.600
And I followed him also

22:50.600 --> 22:55.080
Have I read that directly? Yes

22:55.840 --> 23:02.200
Now how do you reconcile that statement that you had a feeling of the press release that you feel

23:03.200 --> 23:06.560
With your other statements that your only purpose is going in there

23:06.960 --> 23:11.200
Was not to discuss no it's not for the press release in mind the price

23:11.200 --> 23:14.680
I didn't mean to say that my only purpose in going in there was not the

23:14.680 --> 23:19.160
Presteration mind you have it in mind when you went in there. I'm quite sure that I did right sure the video

23:19.440 --> 23:25.100
Then you were motivated. I was motivated by the fact that I felt the trouble might develop from a little visit

23:25.600 --> 23:32.120
Outside of the dining room and I hope to avoid it and that this press release was not the issue then which the senator

23:32.400 --> 23:36.360
Watch to say that he was calling all of its all so to speak

23:36.880 --> 23:39.920
capitulating and turning over this investigation to the army

23:42.040 --> 23:44.040
That's what you want me to do

23:44.680 --> 23:48.080
No, sir. No, I don't want him let me be

23:48.080 --> 23:49.080
Say

23:49.080 --> 23:51.080
You say one more time. I was not trying to get

23:51.080 --> 23:53.560
And the party is a situation I was not trying to get

23:53.560 --> 23:59.320
And the party is called off the dogs. I was operating in the impression that I had all the previous week

23:59.560 --> 24:02.760
The center of the party has the essentially concluded investigation

24:02.760 --> 24:06.840
And when you concluded investigation and turned this back back to another agency

24:07.480 --> 24:09.480
Sometime you got to do it

24:09.480 --> 24:12.520
Well now if he had concluded is investigation

24:13.480 --> 24:18.280
And you believe that you say why was it necessary to use a potty merer

24:18.280 --> 24:23.640
Urgent along the little I didn't try him. I didn't urge him along and it wasn't necessary

24:23.640 --> 24:25.640
That's just happened to be something that I did

24:25.640 --> 24:27.640
Well why mister? I don't

24:27.640 --> 24:32.520
If he had concluded is investigation was it necessary to do all the

24:33.560 --> 24:35.560
And present to him all this

24:36.360 --> 24:41.640
Releasing the deal to the press when you believe that it was then a fact to copy

24:43.080 --> 24:45.880
It was a fact to essentially accomplish

24:45.880 --> 24:49.720
Right if you know whether it would be accomplished on Tuesday or on Friday or on a week from Friday

24:50.520 --> 24:52.920
The madam's best go back to the level if you will

24:52.920 --> 24:55.320
If you served you use of secretary's season

24:55.320 --> 24:58.760
That the season's higher apartment will start to rise from our

24:59.560 --> 25:01.080
On further way the force is

25:01.080 --> 25:02.120
Life is yes

25:03.160 --> 25:06.600
And you use the secretary's season like yourself

25:07.320 --> 25:09.160
Was a man of great pride

25:09.160 --> 25:12.920
And a man of great pride in carrying out his assignment

25:13.240 --> 25:15.400
And doing a good job you knew that

25:15.960 --> 25:17.960
Yes a conscientious expert

25:18.600 --> 25:21.080
I have never known more conscientious evidence in this yet

25:21.640 --> 25:25.960
And you use the secretary when he passed her thing out in long time

25:27.000 --> 25:29.480
That's in the independent agents

25:30.360 --> 25:32.360
This collection is from the army

25:32.760 --> 25:36.840
Because doing a part of the work that was primarily his duty

25:37.480 --> 25:40.440
That in the sense is five of us hurt you

25:41.240 --> 25:42.040
I did not

25:42.040 --> 25:42.840
Did not

25:42.840 --> 25:44.040
I never did it hurt you
