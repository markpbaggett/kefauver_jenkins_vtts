00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Back in Washington and mutual coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings before the Senate's

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
prominent subcommittee on investigations, the stenographer is now repeating some of the

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
previous testimony of Robert T. Stevens at the request of Senator McCarthy.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Here's their any other examples.

00:27.000 --> 00:36.000
Our statements are connected with the September 16th visit of the Shine apartment, the Chebs

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
in the light on the issues of this controversial sectarian.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Will you please tell these gentlemen on the committee what that is?

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
I remember very clearly, Senator McCarthy asking me if why I couldn't make use of what he

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
called David Shine special qualification.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
He went on to suggest that David Shine might be made a special assistant to me, or perhaps

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
a special assistant to the intelligence division, the G2 division of the Army, in connection

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
with crimeists.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
And I told Senator McCarthy that such an arrangement I did not think was possible, and especially

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
where a young man of rap day was concerned.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Anything else you could have heard of Inter-Svisture from Stephen?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I think that is the substance of what there is on the issues.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Where did you go from there?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I came back to Washington.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
Did you go up town in New York to any meeting of the Senator's committee?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
No sir.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Do you recall whether or not on meditation David Shine drove you anywhere in his automobile?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
He did not.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
He did not.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
You forthright came back to Washington.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
That's correct.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
Did you have a bad coming here a conversation with Senator McCarthy with respect to his investigations

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
in the first Army area?

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Well I just discussed that with him yesterday.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Were there any conclusions reached with respect to that investigation?

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
Well we were processing those three cases to find out what the facts were.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
There were three men in their investigation that you knew of.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Two men and one woman.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
You have received that information from Senator McCarthy that is the names of these two men and one woman.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
And I say those were the three that I saw listening to the paper.

02:39.000 --> 02:49.000
When I was your September 16th, did you next contact either the Senator or his staff or the Senator and his staff contact you?

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
I believe that was a telephone or otherwise.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
My recollection is that it was on the 21st of September at a executive hearing of this committee.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
There, here in this building, here in this building.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Yes sir.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
Did you have any discussion with Senator McCarthy or the members of the staff at that time?

03:10.000 --> 03:20.000
This was a, I came over for the purpose of, I mean, invitation of Mr. Senator McCarthy to return to testimony that was going on in the second session.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Was anything said to you all not at all?

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Our own let's say that he and his rescinder are any member of his staff and referenced it.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
He gave it a chance.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I do not recall it what I was.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Is there any other event that occurred that day?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
That is the 21st day of September.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
That's right.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Have any injuries?

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Well, of course the proceedings in the hearing.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I can go ahead and submit the names.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
I don't know, but with respect to any attempt on the part of this committee,

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
I think you need to secure preferences for our chat.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
Mr. Secretary, when was your next contact with the Senator and his committee?

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I think the next contact was on the 2nd of October.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Where was that?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
That was in my office.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I was in the station.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
That was, that was the result of, that was motivated from the senators under the law.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Initiated by the Senator are his back.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That's correct.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
What purpose?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
The purpose, uh, uh,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
for the events needing to, to the initiation of that conference,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
by the McCarthy Investigating Committee.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, Mr. Cohen came over to see me and he was fired October 2nd.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
No, no, I'm sorry.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
On the 2nd.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
On the 2nd, yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
And he was joined a few minutes thereafter, got there by Mr. Carr.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm fine to work it.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
One more.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
I think the record should show,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
while there's working nothing improper about the secretary's doing,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
and he's got a perfect right to do it,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
if the record should show however that, uh,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
he is not making the answers from room, right,

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
but from the room, the chairman prepared, and as before him,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I think the record should show who prepared them and ran them.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
If I'm incorrect, then this secretary is not using a memorandum,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
but I think the record should show that.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
We make a sure, which is like a threat.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm not indicating, because anything improper about your using a memorandum,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I do think it should be clear that,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
that's one of your always best question, mate.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I like that question, mate.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I think it's just some little solicitor's decisions.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Are you referring to a memorandum in the giving of your testimony?

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Very well, I have a here, uh, well, I call it chronological,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
let's update.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I will ask you who prepared that memorandum,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
are you, if you are, did someone on your behalf?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Well, I think it was the result of a joint effort,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
the transactions between you and the room and council,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
that is Mr. Web, Mr. Simplair.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
They whether or not he was prepared from your own recollection of events

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
and are any memorandum data or documents that you have in your possession?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Oh, yes, sir.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Is it in your opinion and accurate memorandum?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yes, sir.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Very well.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Now, yes.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
My diary follows that the memorandum in the Sampara give me

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
a part of the record so that anyone reading the record will know

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
about the secondary of the frame does he make these matters?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Do you have any objection, Mr. Stevens,

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
to making that memorandum a part of the record when you shall?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Have finished with it?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yes.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Mr. Chamin, a copy of this chronology has been handed to Mr. Jenkins.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Mr. Jenkins knowledge is the case.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Happily or so good that he doesn't have very very early.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
The company has been handed.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
And apparently the witness has to refer to it very seldom.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
But Mr. Jenkins, I think we'll confirm that a copy was supplied here.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
But the senator won't even say,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
because he's found as an exhibit to Mr. Stevens' testimony.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And I think if you have no objection to that,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
do you, Mr. Stevens, determine the whether it's him?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
May I add that it's a closely a simple chronology,

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
and it is not fully abrasive of all retest warnings

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
that the witness will give.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Or is there any objection to it, whatever it may be?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Mr. Jenkins, if it were a secret,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
it would not have been in your possession.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Thank you very much.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Mr. Chamin, I understand it's not answered that there is no objection

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
between the file.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, there is not.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Thank you very much.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Mr. Chamin, let's go.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Mr. Chamin, then we set a precedent

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
by this procedure and by a jealousist,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
that ever witness who now gives your after,

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
that reversed the innumerable random gib black testimony

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
and file it with the committee.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
All right.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary,

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
we are now at the meeting in your office

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
in the Pentagon on October 2nd.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Is that correct?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yes, sir.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Who is present at that meeting?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Mr. Chamin, first,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
was later joined the few minutes later by Mr. Carb.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I was the only other person there.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Senator McCarthy was not present at any time at that meeting.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
No, sir.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Will you please now show this parade in detail

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
what occurred at that meeting?

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Mr. Chamin told me that about the forthcoming investigation

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
at month,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
and he said that the general law

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
was the commanding general of the Fourth Monmouth installation.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
That's taken some action which made it difficult for

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
the staff of Senator McCarthy's committee

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
to get the information they wanted by talking with the people

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
they wanted to talk to at Fourth Monmouth.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And he said,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
preparing their ability to do the job.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
I said, well, I wanted to cooperate with the committee.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
This is very limited my ability.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And in their presence,

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
then and there, I called General Lawton on the telephone,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
what did you say to General Lawton

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
been in there in the presence of Ms. Kuhn-Mitchfah?

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
I told General Lawton that I wanted full cooperation by him

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
and the members of his staff

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
and that he was to make available those people

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
at his installation

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
that properly accredited representatives of Senator McCarthy's committee

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
at one of the interviews.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
What's the answer to anything transpired on that occasion

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
between you and Ms. Kuhn-Mitchfah?

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Mr. Kuhn particularly was referenced to G. David Shane,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Mr. Kuhn brought up the matter of G. David Sean

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
and wanted to know if he couldn't be assigned to New York City.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Why did he say he wanted to be in the stands in New York City?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Well, he said there was a lot of committee work

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
that had to be attended to

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
and that he was sure there were various assignments around New York City

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
that the Army could assign David Sean to.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
What was your plan of that?

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
My reply to that was that if David Sean

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
were actually inducted into the Army

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
that he would have to take the regular Army training.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Ms. Kuhn-Mitchfah did indicate for him

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
that if committee business required David Sean

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
assistance to the early stages of his military training

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
that I would cooperate to the best of my ability

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
in making David Sean available for committee work

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
providing a commitment of fear with.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Now is a good time, Mr. Secretary,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
for you to explain to this committee

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
the routine through which a draft C is put

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
upon being inducted into the Army

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
and particularly with reference to his training,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
the duration of his training,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
and the character of his training

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
without going into unnecessary details.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, in general, Mr. Jenkins,

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
what's known as the plea and documentation period,

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
that's a period during which the inductee

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
is sent to the induction reception center.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
It's a period during which he is being issued

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
is calling being given various tests,

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
medical attention, assigned to unit,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
and in ordinary course of events,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
all of that takes in the general nature

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
about a week or two.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
It depends on the scope of the care

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
and immediately after the induction of the draft

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
the end of the Army, after he's sworn in.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Yes, usually that.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
That's the first about a week's time.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Sometimes longer, those will occur on the base

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
after he can't do which inductees are sent.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
The reception center, no, am I not the one

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
at particular place in this case, it was.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Following that, what is the routine?

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Then, at the start of a next cycle,

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
a basic training, which might happen to get within a week

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
after the inductee came in or it might be two

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
or in some case, even the longest three weeks,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
then that's the joins of cycle.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
That cycle is 16 weeks of basic training,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
which is broken in the middle after the eighth week

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
with two weeks, please.

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
The injury accepts things in the regulations of routine

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
except in exceptional cases.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
For a draftee to a paid or a scheme,

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
that cycle of training, the minimum 16 weeks

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
of basic training, that's what I mean.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Also, there's no reason to escape that, sir,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
but I know that.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
All right, Mr. Cohen discussed and viewed the assignment

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
of shine to the New York area,

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
is that correct or not?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
That's right.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Did it not always say anything about making an exception

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
to the room with respect to shine insofar as his basic training

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
with some say, why don't we share the committee

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
what that was?

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
You are in the front of New York without basic training.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
What would you regard to that, Mr. Secretary?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
That could not be done.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Why did he tell you he wanted to be resigned

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
in New York without basic training?

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
The indicators that there was committee work.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
David Shine was needed for, remember that, very clearly.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Had you ever up to that time,

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
excuse the draftee from basic training?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I had no knowledge of any exception ever being made.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Very well.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Will you relate to the committee anything else

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
that transpired on that October 2nd meeting?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I think that's just about covers that...

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
You say Mr. Cohen, car was present, that's right.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Did Mr. Carr make any statement, whatever?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Insofar as your recollection,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm able to answer that question.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
You mean with respect to David Shine?

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
Did Mr. Carr make any statement that that conference?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Did any of your seats, for shine?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I do not recollect that he did.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I think the conversation on shine

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
was entirely what Mr. Cole.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Mr. Stevens, I will ask you whether or not

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
a medication.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
I will ask you to state that the degree of insistence

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
on the part of Mr. Cole

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
was respect to Shine being excused

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
from a part of his basic training

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
or all of it or being transferred to the first Army A.V.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
Well, Mr. Jenkins, I felt that it was somewhat unusual

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
and that there was a degree of insistence

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
in Mr. Shine's approach to the subject.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
It's a little hard to evaluate

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
the degree of a situation, but is that?

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
I knew that Mr. Cole was serious about this matter.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
There was no question about that.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
Who's your next friend next to this committee?

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
The next contract for the committee was on the 13th of October.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Where is it?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
That was in New York, sir.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Who is this?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
That's what I want to New York in order to attend

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
hearing of this committee.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You conducted this senator MacArthur,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
conducted by Senator MacArthur,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
and going to Mr. Car, perhaps other members of his band.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
That's right, sir.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Where is the executive hearing?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yes, sir.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Where is the interconnection with the alleged infiltration

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
of Communists in the Army?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
At Fort Mama, yes, sir.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
An espionage?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yes, sir.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
And whose direction or who initiated that visit to New York

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
on October 13th?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Was that done over your own volition?

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Did the senator invite you or how was that, Mr. Secretary?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
The I can't exactly remember.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I know that I wanted to go to some of those hearings.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
They had started on the 8th of September officially on the Fort Mama

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
hearings.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Did anybody come to you on that trip, yes, sir?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Who's that, Mr. Adams?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
When did Mr. Adams have the current

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
council for the Department of the Army

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
on the first day of October?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Now he and his neighbors didn't know he was 13 days.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
That's correct.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
And since whether or not you have the same hearing

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
with your liaison officer or company,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
between you and the McCrady committee,

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
yes, sir.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
When Mr. Adams became the councilor for the Department of the Army,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
I called him into my office and sat down and had a chat with him.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
And I told him I charged him with the primary responsibility

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
of liaison between the Department of the Army

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
and this committee.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
I told him that I wanted him to cooperate fully with the committee

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
and made it his primary mission.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Of course, Mr. Adams was new on the job.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Did you personally know Mr. Adams of that time?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I've met him only a few days before.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Can't you know the thoroughly and conclusion

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
of investigation of his qualifications and of his records?

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I certainly have looked into it, yes, sir.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Very well, and I was very pleased with it.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
Now, when you state Mr. Secretary what occurred in New York

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
on October 13th and particularly what the affinity was said

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
are done shedding light on the issue of whether or not the senator

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
or any member of his staff sought undue lead

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
to obtain preferential treatment for G. David Shai.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
They were executive hearings and I think it's a federal

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
part building there in New York just twice in the morning.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
I sat as a spectator with some of the twice-ning of the witnesses.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
There was no discussion about Mr. Shai.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
I see during the course of the hearing I invited Senator McCarthy

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
of his staff to have lunch with me.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
We did have lunch in the air

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
at the merchants club in New York.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
Anything is there to feed at that luncheon.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
Between the respective parties to that front of the way

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
to his reference to Shai.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
I don't recall anything significant.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Was or not the discussion in the main with reference

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
to the senator's investigation like it was then underway?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
That was correct, Mr. Jackins.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Mr. Steven, did you at that time attempt to

19:22.000 --> 19:31.000
assert any effort to first all or curred, say, or how

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
that investigation by the contrary, sir?

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
Did everything I said to the assistant?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Did you tell him in the executive session that afternoon?

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
I did.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Is that all with a third or not over 13 that you consider

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
of injuries?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yes, sir.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
And the time that the man that was sent by either the senator

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
was deported by all the members of his staff with reference

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
to G David Chin on Medicaid.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I have another particular.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
What was your next meeting with the committee or any member

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
of his staff day on a 14th in New York City?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yes, sir.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
And stay there overnight.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Yes, sir.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
You did not see the senator or any member of his staff

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
on the evening or night.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
I did on the evening of the 13th of October.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
By the way, if I had said that the hearings at Fort Monmouth

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
officially started in September, I meant it to be October.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
I think the official starting date was the 8th of October.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
Very well, now, who was it today that you saw on the night of the 13th?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Where?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Drop this, sir.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
The particular reference to Jack.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
Well, it was, uh, uh, Mr. Jenkins, there was a dinner party.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Where was it given?

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
It was given in a five-attining room at the Waldorf Astoria.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Ah, by whom?

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
I think it was given by Mr. and Mrs. Sean Senior.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
Well, and I think the senator McCarthy invited me to attend.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Where did you attend?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yes, sir.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
That was a dinner party given by the parents of Fah-ha-ha.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
How G-Dated Shine, it was at the time.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
That's correct.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
All was the night of October 13th.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Yes, sir.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Attended by you?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Got a bombing.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Senator McCarthy?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Yes, sir.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
G-Dated Shine.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Yes, sir.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Mr. Colme?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yes, sir.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Anyone else?

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
Uh, Judge Colme and Mrs. Colme were there.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
They are all the parents of Mr. Roy Colme.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
That is correct.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Uh, Mrs. McCarthy was there.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Mr. Senators, why?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
That's right.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
Uh, Mr. Mrs. Richard Berlin were there.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Uh, there were...

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
As I recall it, there were two young ladies that were there, but I don't recall their names.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Mr. Jenkins.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Possibly another couple.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I need to get there, Mr. Smith.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I should possibly another couple.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
What's with anything?

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
Mr. Secretary said to you on the set of keys.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
From the Beck Mahogany panel caucus room in the Senate office building in Washington.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
The neutral has been bringing you a special coverage of the congressional hearings,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
and Senator Joseph Barber, McCarthy is disposed for the office.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I owe our I.P. exempted from the argument.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
What?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Would you repeat that, sir?

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
The private shine himself making the request of you on the set of keys.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Not on other keys, another.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
Then as I understand it, Mr. Secretary, there was nothing of interest on medication.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Insofar as this committee is concerned,

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
with reference to the allegations in your bailiff's particular, is that correct?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Yes, sir.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
When will your next contact with the committee?

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Well, then, I stayed overnight in New York that night,

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
and the following morning, a fire arrangement, uh, David Sean,

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
six me up in his car at the corner of 37th Street in Park Avenue,

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
at approximately 9.30 in the morning, just take me down to the here.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Who made those arrangements for our David Shane to take you down to this?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Can I make those arrangements?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I would call for you, the favor, please.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
The two of you wrote together in an automobile given by him,

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
made the better courthouse where the senator was conducting his year.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
That's right.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Ampstichuthanloji?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Yes, sir.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Anything said to you, that day?

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
By the senator or any member of his staff,

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
with reference to any preference or treatment to be accorded, Shane?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Well, uh, let's just sign an eye,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
that's by an interesting talk in the car,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
sliding down how.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
Uh, will you relate what that conversation was, Mr. Secretary?

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
Well, the conversation was along the line that, uh,

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
I was doing a good job in feriting our communists.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Was that your statement, or their ears?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
That was Mr. Sean's statement.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
Very well. That, uh, people, I could go a long way in this field.

24:19.000 --> 24:28.000
And that he would like to help me.

24:28.000 --> 24:35.000
He, uh, thought that it was, with me much more,

24:35.000 --> 24:43.000
a much more logical plan for him to become a special assistant of mine,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
then to do one, to a certain communist,

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
a former, a former communist speaking program in the Army,

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
and, uh, he thought that would be a more logical assignment

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
than being abducted into the Army.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
Now, I told David Sean, substantially this,

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
is that the first time that David Shane ever implemented

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
the use of any wanted some special dispensation,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
that's my first definite recollection.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
A loyal and you take told David Shane what.

25:22.000 --> 25:29.000
I said to him that one of the best things that had ever happened to me in my life

25:29.000 --> 25:37.000
was my opportunity for service in the United States Army in two world wars.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
But I felt that he would face up to his forthcoming induction

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
and approach it in the right way, that he would look back on it for his life

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
as one of the great experiences that he'd had.

25:50.000 --> 25:56.000
And that if for any reason he did not have takes this military training,

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
in my opinion, he would regret it the rest of his life.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
And I pointed out to him that, uh, I had served,

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
and my sons had served, we all think we got a great deal out of it

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
in addition to having the opportunity of serving our country.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
Do you recall his reply to that Mr. Sucke-Date?

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
I think that, uh, it made some impression on Mr. Sean,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I don't know of course how much.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
That was on our two-refourth theme, does we understand?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
That's correct.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
During that theme, at any time, either it's the James Ronson-Gerl's way,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
whether or not Senator McCroth here any member of his best,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
did you experience the shame?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I do not recall that.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
When did you come back to Washington?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
I came back, uh, that afternoon.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
When was your next contact with the committee?

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
My next contact with the committee was, uh,

27:00.000 --> 27:09.000
was on October 20th, where this was a trip that we made to Fort Monmouth.

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
Me, meaning, meaning, meaning, uh, I had planned a trip, Mr. Jenkins.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
To go down here, I wanted to visit the installation, see how things were.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
The installation report might be interesting.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
And, uh, I invited Senator McCroth here and any members of his staff,

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
or any members of the committee that cared to the bill along with me.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Senator McCroth, they take go.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Mr. Colin Wann.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Mr. Adams Wann.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Colonel Below Wann.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Mr. Jones, uh, Mr. Potter's office probably.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Wann and I think Mr. Rainbow.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
Senator Jones, who soon has been in the office of the executive executive?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Was there a representative of any other member of this committee?

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
Well, yeah, I think Mr. Rainbow has done a deduction for the office of the president.

27:57.000 --> 28:05.000
Do we understand Mr. Secretary, that all the men whose names you have mentioned,

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
left Washington and went together to Fort Monmouth by a friend?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Yes, sir.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
Now, Mr. Secretary, without my asking you specific questions,

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
and, far the purpose of excavating this hearing as much as possible,

28:22.000 --> 28:30.000
I want you to now take up the events of October 20th,

28:30.000 --> 28:38.000
beginning with the start of the trip here in Washington and continue to out today.

28:39.000 --> 28:49.000
Well, we left here by plane and flew to I think of the golden town of New Jersey.

28:49.000 --> 28:56.000
Fair amount of discussion about, of course, the Fort Monmouth situation on the plane going down.

28:56.000 --> 29:06.000
I have gained the impression and the, on the previous meeting,

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
which was the 14th of October in New York, that Senator McCartney,

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
and it was approaching the point where he felt that he would turn the prosecution,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
he will, of the investigation over to the Army.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
I think this was to start some on the plane.

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
We were met when we landed at the airport by Senator H. Alexander Smith of New Jersey

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
and General Lawton, the commanding general.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
We drove to the Fort Monmouth installation,

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
and we were later turned by Congressman Hawking's class of the third New Jersey District.

29:47.000 --> 29:57.000
We went into the airport's building and had a meeting with General Lawton and members of his staff,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
which was all of us as I requested from Washington Attendance.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
And that was where we had discussion of the security measures of Fort Monmouth,

30:07.000 --> 30:14.000
opportunities for questioning the commanding general and members of his staff.

30:14.000 --> 30:25.000
Then when that meeting adjourned, we went out for a visit around the installation to get an idea of what it was like,

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
about the different building where the laboratories were.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
They either left with one question,

30:33.000 --> 30:42.000
and you will not find that date and sit your installation secretary of the Army visited Fort Monmouth.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
This was my first visit.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
There we go.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Well, without much to chip around to some of these laboratories,

30:50.000 --> 30:59.000
we came to one lab, which required a special security conference to gain a distance.

30:59.000 --> 31:07.000
As Dr. Taylor said, the Army without leaving away any information that might be of greater comfort to the enemy,

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
if there is one, describe the nature of that installation.

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
Laptop installation has to do with advanced research and development on radar.
