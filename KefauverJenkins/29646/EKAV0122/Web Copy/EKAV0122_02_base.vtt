00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I was worried about it.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
It was not clear when anybody else was, or was it?

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
I made an honest, bad decision.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
I was wondering, see the lab, and that I would take quickly.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
The... those in the fire who had been elected to the Congress

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
by the people of the United States.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
And that included Senator McCarthy, Senator Smith,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
and Congress went off and fought.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
People who lived in a risk of having the news be admittedly.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Adams, yes, Adams, I believe, was in...

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
He has the proper clearance, and I think he was in for a while.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
He would give me a proceed, maybe an article.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
He would be great.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
We spent the possibility of having 12 minutes in the lab,

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
and then came out, and when we came out, quickly became aware

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
that Mr. Cohen was exceedingly angry,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
but he had not been permitted to go with us under the law.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Now, I want you to now describe to the committee

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
the reactions to conduct the statements of Mr. Cohen on the occasion.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Say, what's your personal name?

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Say, no, I say all this information given to you by a rose person,

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
and I'm just expecting you to see this in the investigation of this Congress.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
All right, Mr. Sacken.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm kind of a little bit by no other type of assistant.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
I told me that Mr. Cohen had been deemed guilty in the engine now,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
just a few days.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Mr. Cohen had been very provoked,

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
and that he had made statements substantially as follows.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
This is yours.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm cleared for the highest classified information.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
I have access to FDR files when I want them.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
They did this just to embarrass me.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
We will now really investigate the arms.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
I was also, Glenn,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
later,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
that within the hearing of Lieutenant Cohen,

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
A to none of the individuals you are and in the name of A to General Lawton,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
the Commanding General at Fort Madness,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
and Mr. Flattery,

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
who is the head of the Counter-Measures Division at Fort Madness,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
that within the hearing Mr. Cohen was raised to say,

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
quote, this is a declaration of war, unquote.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
I wish you whether or not the power was and is a Lieutenant, that is correct.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
We have no one.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
I wish you would have been the head of the Counter-Measures Division at Fort Madness,

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
or what the statement called made to say, who are the Commanding officer?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
No, I don't know what I'm going to say.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
We are used to allowing the important measures

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
who you will have best interest at that fact.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Yes, of course, we are used to say it.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
We will easily be able to say a little bit to you, well.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
All right, next was done.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I say, well,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
at Fort Madness, I'm not over 20.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes, sir, let's take it alive,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
and we went into another statement live,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
and we had a box under the same divide up of people,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
but that was the role of a short visit.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
When we came out, and we finally got the party together,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
it was so very fast and made that Mr. Cone was very much

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
provoked by the whole proceedings.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
We went back to the headquarters building,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
the same room we'd been in before,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
and we had a sort of a box luncheon and a throwing-in.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
I want you to say what transpired is that luncheon?

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, Mr. Cone was, so obviously,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
the most possible proceeding with...

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I took it upon myself, Mr. Jenkins,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
to fly to calm him down a little bit, you might say.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
What did you say, you knew,

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
the idea of calming him down is you could...

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, I said that it was too bad that there wasn't time available

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
at the door of that laboratory to make all the necessary inquiries

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
about who was cleared for what.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And therefore, I made that on the spot,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
the station, I certainly didn't intend to offend anybody by it,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
but I did the best that I could,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
and I did not send as many offense from Mr. Cone or anyone else.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Who's that even in the children of college, you've been to the sick days?

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I would say that it was.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
There were.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
You make me make routines.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Well, I have.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
I'd say that it was in the nature of apology.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I don't know, Mr. Cone,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
but you think that when I was the weather,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
not a apology is the right word?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
I knew that I hadn't done anything that was wrong.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
On the one hand, I thought in my heart I had done what was right.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
I was the secretary of the United States.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
If you make any effort on roughly just not sufficient restitution,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I was the first Army area to be the report month.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
No, I did not.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
We talked about the plans.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And there you have.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Yes, the wires were of each basement unit,

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
whether they could be confused as in the fall of year or not.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
The design needs to prevent the death of any team's yard.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
No, sir.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I already were not.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
They continued with investigation of the report month.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And when there's a declaration of war on the Jenkins,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I am secretary of the Army.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
And there was a declaration of war,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
and I am the secretary of the Army.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
They were.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Preferences of this theory.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
This through the security aid.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Did anything use untoward a clear only day after which one?

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, there was after some discussion after lunch,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
there was a tax conference.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I sent a McCarthy and was there and sent a Smith.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And I promised them all some class.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
And I thought I think most of the other gentlemen were in the room

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
and questions were issued back and forth.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
McCarthy made some statements just so that I,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
and later we went out and I appeared with Senator McCarthy

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
before the cameras on the long a star.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
And then I repeated back to the airport.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
And I returned to Washington.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
And that is an narration as me understand,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
is a worthy of answer that you consider important equipment

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
on October 20th.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Yes, sir.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I think those are the important ones.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
They go back and forth a lot more.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I'm glad that the day the senator and his staff returned

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
and we do that afternoon evening.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
My recollection is that after taxes,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
my recollection is that they, uh,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
do a pressure recollection.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Was there not the data from which the senator had official business

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
and most of them had been here about it?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
No, I think I think not very well.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Did the group, and the group most of us came back,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
and I couldn't say positive, but nobody went from

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
on to New York, perhaps, somebody.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
We knew you knew.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Contact will withstand.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Investigating staff.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
Well, uh, David Shahn called me up on the 21st of October.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I have a direct message.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
And what was sent to you on the radio by David Shahn?

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, David Shahn, uh,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
I have a direct message.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I think that is the key to the radio.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I think the private, the host,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
so we say that, uh,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
he puts, uh,

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
do some special job of investigation,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
rather than the army.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yes?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
He knew all these services with the committee,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
is that what you understood?

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Yes, and the events that the act of radio was taken in the beginning.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I was in October 21st.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I got with Paul at the moment.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I was in the next contact.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
I was contacted by, uh,

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Mr. Carl.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Do they?

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
The date was the 27th of October.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Were you in conference with Mr. Cohen on the 27th of October?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
On the telephone.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Will you please relate to the conversation that occurred at that time?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Well, Mr. Carl said that, uh,

09:36.000 --> 09:45.000
advised me that David Shahn was going to be conducted under the army on the 3rd of November.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
And he said he had two ideas and Ma was expected.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
This is a telephone conversation you were relating, just as I was.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Between you and Mr. Cohen.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Very well.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
One idea was that

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
David Shahn should be given a fellow at a time in New York.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
The other idea was bringing the furloughed bikini after the beginning of his service in the army,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
that's what I got it from the conversation.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
All right.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
The other idea was that, uh,

10:23.000 --> 10:31.000
maybe central intelligence agent, please, could use David Shahn.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
I said I begot to stop down dollars about that ahead of CIA if you wanted me to, and I did.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
For the next month.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
We want to do something.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Negative.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Did you serve that as Mr. Cool?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I did.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Back to the board in another way.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
I talked personally and you want to be a support myself.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
That was Mr. Cohen's reaction to that information.

10:59.000 --> 11:09.000
Well, Mr. Cohen's reaction to that was that he went back to the furloughed business.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
And I indicated that in order to,

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
if it was necessary, in order to facilitate the work of its committee,

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
during the transition period of David Shahn from a consultant to this committee,

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
for the status of a selectee in the United States Army,

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
that I would see if I could arrange two weeks of temporary duty for him at first Army in New York,

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
for the purpose of being available available to finish up his committee work.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
He said that it tights out up for Senator McCarthy, and let me know.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Did you let you know?

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Yes, he did.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
He said that their arrangement was okay.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
You did agree then.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
For Mr. Shahn to be assigned to New York City during the first two weeks,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I was his basic training.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
He said what we understand was not there.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
The basic training was not the start until later.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Mr. Jenkins, this was during the so-called pre-inductination period.

12:19.000 --> 12:27.000
I had agreed that David Shahn could go on temporary duty at first Army,

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
if needed by this committee, for purposes of committee work.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
And I would like to say about that.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
The reason that I made that agreement was this.

12:41.000 --> 12:50.000
I did not want the United States Army to be in the position in any configurable way

12:50.000 --> 12:58.000
of obstructing the work of a committee, which was then engaged in intoxicating the Army.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
As you can advise that Mr. Shahn worked with the committee,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
was in reference to investigation of the Army,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
and that it was regarded as essential,

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
and that he had the reports that make-on as investigations

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
which had not been completed.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
That's right.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
And why here agreements made the first thing to that understanding?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
That's right.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
That was on his day of October 27th.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Mr. Collins, is this to make notes that,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
this is called me on the 27th around the two points that I mentioned.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I call in back on the 28th from the 28th.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
You said he'd take it up for the Senate,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and then call me back on the 31st.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
When will you next come?

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
I can't keep by any member of the investigating staff.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
There you go.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
I think the next time that I saw any else from the office,

14:07.000 --> 14:15.000
I think he's the best telephone I've personally.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
I think it was on the 6th of November.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
And we need to be able to hear about that.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Got that?

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
I think that the situation,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
the State Department, to say,

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
is quite a number of facts of the temporary duty,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
effective November 3rd.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
That was the day of change in the action in the Army,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
as we understand the November 3rd, that's correct.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
That's almost about the time that he was defined the first Army.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Mr. Adams received words from Senator McCarthy

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
that the temporary duty he would like to have canceled.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Upon one glance,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
this of course comes to me from Mr. Adams,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
to say that he's only available to me

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
in the variety understanding.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
He said that Senator McCarthy said that

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
he didn't think that David Sean also

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
said that his first Army on temporary duty

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
because the newspaper then might pick it up

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
and that might throw them tires into it.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
All right, now you have been asked about the event style

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
November 6th.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
The events of November 6th were

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
a form of a luncheon at my request in my office,

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
Mr. Pentagon.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Senator McCarthy was there,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Mr. Cohen was there, Mr. Carl was there,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Mr. Adams was there.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
What was the purpose of that meeting?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Why would you go?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
the fort-monic investigation

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
in the first instance that was the primary purpose

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
and the second one was

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
the fort-monic investigation then under headway or yes sir.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Do you even write the committee?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Oh yes, I do.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I want you to tell the committee

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
the events of November 6th

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
are in your office in the Pentagon

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
at which time you,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
the Senator McCormick,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Mr. Cameron,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
you're going to go to Mr. Roosevelt.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Well, I would like to say to Mr. Jake and through you

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
that because his mind moves as quickly as it does,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
he sometimes cuts off the witness

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
before his answer is completed.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Mr. Dean,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Mr. President,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000

Mrs. President,

Mr. President,

17:31.460 --> 17:32.440
Mrs. President,

17:32.440 --> 17:33.040
Mr. President,

17:33.040 --> 17:34.040
Mr. President,

17:34.040 --> 17:35.040
I know the

17:35.040 --> 17:35.840
hyper leadership

17:35.840 --> 17:37.500
that we got on the arming

17:37.500 --> 17:39.440
and breakfast

17:39.440 --> 17:41.060
and my starts to then

17:41.060 --> 17:43.260
and then complete

17:43.260 --> 17:44.640
corporations

17:44.640 --> 17:45.600
insofar as the one

17:45.600 --> 17:46.540
of the committee's

17:46.540 --> 17:48.540
utveck challenge.

17:48.540 --> 17:49.320
Those were my two

17:49.320 --> 17:49.860
rons'

17:49.860 --> 17:50.800
fent

17:50.800 --> 17:51.440
in investing

17:51.440 --> 17:53.960
in our launching.

17:53.960 --> 17:54.820
Senator implicit

17:54.820 --> 17:55.800
colon

17:55.800 --> 17:57.000
and the cards

17:57.000 --> 17:57.720
Game of the Lunch

17:57.720 --> 17:58.580
and which

17:58.600 --> 18:00.180
declared in my office

18:00.180 --> 18:01.380
and I would

18:01.380 --> 18:02.000
say it is

18:02.000 --> 18:02.440
much greater

18:02.440 --> 18:03.800
than the one I have

18:03.800 --> 18:04.700
after which the three

18:04.700 --> 18:06.400
generals came in

18:06.400 --> 18:07.480
and we had another hour

18:07.480 --> 18:08.600
and a half of discussion

18:08.600 --> 18:09.440
after their arrival.

18:09.440 --> 18:09.940
I would say

18:09.940 --> 18:10.480
approximately

18:10.480 --> 18:12.480
a three hour meeting.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.480
Now, as the

18:13.480 --> 18:15.480
luncheon

18:15.480 --> 18:17.480
I discussed with them

18:17.480 --> 18:18.440
the third monotonous

18:18.440 --> 18:20.440
investigation.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.520
I told them that I felt

18:22.520 --> 18:25.480
that it had served as a purpose.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.440
That it had

18:26.440 --> 18:27.240
we were

18:27.240 --> 18:28.360
on top

18:28.360 --> 18:30.680
of everything that they've given us.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.080
We were

18:31.080 --> 18:32.680
all in that.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.680
We'd have information

18:34.680 --> 18:35.440
on everybody

18:35.440 --> 18:36.320
every name that has been

18:36.320 --> 18:37.160
turned up

18:37.160 --> 18:39.480
anyway.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.240
That I wanted to

18:41.240 --> 18:42.960
have the army

18:42.960 --> 18:45.000
carry out.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.120
And if you will

18:46.120 --> 18:47.120
subject to the approval

18:47.120 --> 18:49.040
of this committee

18:49.040 --> 18:50.120
in the sense that I said

18:50.120 --> 18:51.720
that I was

18:51.720 --> 18:52.560
when the progress

18:52.560 --> 18:53.840
was worked

18:53.840 --> 18:55.840
as the how we were doing

18:55.840 --> 18:56.640
as the questions started

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
back to you

18:57.640 --> 18:58.400
and full well

18:58.400 --> 18:59.840
as many with

18:59.840 --> 19:02.160
that off.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.680
But I wanted to stop

19:04.680 --> 19:06.160
the hammering

19:06.160 --> 19:07.120
in the headlines

19:07.120 --> 19:09.400
of the parts of the country

19:09.400 --> 19:11.120
of the army

19:11.120 --> 19:13.720
which was creating the impression

19:13.720 --> 19:15.000
that there was widespread

19:15.000 --> 19:16.640
sionage

19:16.640 --> 19:17.960
at Fort Monmouth

19:17.960 --> 19:21.120
but such was not the case.

19:21.120 --> 19:26.320
There you go.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.040
All medical

19:27.040 --> 19:29.560
unit is November 6th.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
What is anything

19:30.560 --> 19:32.440
we said to you

19:32.440 --> 19:34.000
or miss Adams or anyone else

19:34.000 --> 19:35.280
present

19:35.280 --> 19:36.560
by members of the

19:36.560 --> 19:37.240
McCarthy and

19:37.240 --> 19:38.280
gestigating staff

19:38.280 --> 19:39.680
who respect the G-David

19:39.680 --> 19:42.440
shine.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.560
Well, the question

19:44.560 --> 19:46.160
of David

19:46.160 --> 19:48.680
Sean

19:48.680 --> 19:49.480
being available

19:49.480 --> 19:50.120
and the battery

19:50.120 --> 19:51.240
for this being available

19:51.240 --> 19:52.920
for committee work

19:52.920 --> 19:54.320
was

19:54.320 --> 19:55.080
stressed

19:55.080 --> 19:56.080
considered.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.120
I who

19:57.120 --> 19:57.600
was stressed

19:57.600 --> 19:58.320
by a son of the

19:58.320 --> 19:59.480
McCarthy

19:59.480 --> 20:00.480
Stale

20:00.480 --> 20:01.480
accurately

20:01.480 --> 20:03.160
as is possible

20:03.160 --> 20:05.160
what the senator said

20:05.160 --> 20:05.760
about baby

20:05.760 --> 20:07.160
shine.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.160
Well, he said

20:08.160 --> 20:11.160
that they had these reports

20:11.160 --> 20:12.160
that were overdue

20:12.160 --> 20:13.160
to the committee

20:13.160 --> 20:14.160
they had to make

20:14.160 --> 20:15.160
made up

20:15.160 --> 20:17.160
but

20:17.160 --> 20:17.840
with David

20:17.840 --> 20:19.640
Sean going into the army

20:19.640 --> 20:20.640
that he had a lot

20:20.640 --> 20:22.640
of information

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
of a little bit

20:23.640 --> 20:24.640
in his head

20:24.640 --> 20:25.640
that had to be made

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
available

20:26.640 --> 20:27.640
and that they

20:28.000 --> 20:28.640
had to do

20:28.640 --> 20:29.640
that

20:29.640 --> 20:30.600
but

20:30.600 --> 20:31.800
I believe

20:31.800 --> 20:32.800
Sean was in the army

20:32.800 --> 20:33.800
that is correct

20:33.800 --> 20:34.800
Mr. Secretary

20:34.800 --> 20:35.640
you stated

20:35.640 --> 20:36.640
that you have

20:36.640 --> 20:37.640
only one

20:37.640 --> 20:38.640
positive definite

20:38.640 --> 20:39.640
recollection

20:39.640 --> 20:41.640
of senator McCarthy himself

20:41.640 --> 20:43.640
discussing

20:43.640 --> 20:43.720
David

20:43.720 --> 20:44.640
Sean with you

20:44.640 --> 20:45.640
with respect

20:45.640 --> 20:46.640
to securing

20:46.640 --> 20:47.640
a favor

20:47.640 --> 20:48.640
of preference

20:48.640 --> 20:49.640
you think

20:49.640 --> 20:50.640
is correct

20:50.640 --> 20:51.640
but would you

20:51.640 --> 20:53.640
say

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
that

20:54.640 --> 20:56.640
or come

20:56.640 --> 20:57.640
back

20:57.640 --> 20:58.640
up

20:58.640 --> 20:59.280
bout

20:59.280 --> 21:00.640
any

21:00.640 --> 21:02.280
you wanted

21:02.280 --> 21:03.920
but

21:03.920 --> 21:07.560
you

21:07.560 --> 21:09.440
imagined

21:09.440 --> 21:10.280
on

21:10.280 --> 21:13.620
the

21:13.620 --> 21:15.540
level

21:15.540 --> 21:17.660
of

21:17.660 --> 21:18.900
reg

21:18.900 --> 21:19.660
even

21:19.660 --> 21:22.260
on

21:22.260 --> 21:24.180
extremely

21:24.440 --> 21:25.460
self

21:25.460 --> 21:28.800
the

21:28.800 --> 21:30.220
nine

21:30.220 --> 21:30.420
for

21:30.420 --> 21:33.020
perfectly

21:33.020 --> 21:35.260
literally

21:35.260 --> 21:35.460
that are

21:35.460 --> 21:37.820
that

21:37.820 --> 21:38.060
clearly

21:38.060 --> 21:40.440
described

21:40.440 --> 21:44.380
a

21:44.380 --> 21:46.380
with

21:46.380 --> 21:48.240
stayed on

21:48.240 --> 21:51.380
could be vardı

21:51.380 --> 21:51.420
that was 20

21:51.420 --> 21:53.280
菜

21:53.280 --> 21:57.320
meeting of November 6th was the date you had in mind

21:57.320 --> 22:00.280
with respect to your positive recollection of senator

22:00.280 --> 22:00.880
McCarthy's

22:00.880 --> 22:02.400
intercession for shy

22:02.400 --> 22:03.200
is that

22:03.200 --> 22:05.160
not with respect to a commission

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
now

22:06.160 --> 22:08.160
perhaps I cut you off

22:08.160 --> 22:12.760
as you completed your testimony with respect to the conversation on the part of the

22:12.760 --> 22:15.160
senator on November 6th

22:15.160 --> 22:15.660
now

22:15.660 --> 22:17.040
not a feckishine

22:17.040 --> 22:18.040
no

22:18.040 --> 22:19.040
respect to shy

22:19.040 --> 22:19.960
I

22:19.960 --> 22:21.640
you stated it

22:21.640 --> 22:22.640
in the

22:22.640 --> 22:23.640
community

22:23.640 --> 22:26.200
discussed with you shine on that date

22:26.200 --> 22:28.640
that

22:28.640 --> 22:30.040
that

22:30.040 --> 22:30.640
you

22:30.640 --> 22:31.640
have

22:31.640 --> 22:33.640

22:49.640 --> 22:50.640

22:50.640 --> 22:57.640
what

22:57.640 --> 23:03.640

25:09.400 --> 25:11.400
about the press and that

25:12.400 --> 25:18.040
Mr. Adams invited to collect any statements that I made and he felt that I was in error

25:19.000 --> 25:19.800
if the

25:19.800 --> 25:21.400
the

25:21.400 --> 25:23.400
point of order

25:23.400 --> 25:25.400
point of order is the

25:27.400 --> 25:29.400
Mr. Stephen Minnard made that

25:30.400 --> 25:33.400
stunning proper statements made the press after any meetings

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
then he should give us a date the time the price until

the

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
service

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
the

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
point of order

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
is

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
the

25:55.000 --> 25:55.000


25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
is

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
the

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
secretary

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
was

26:12.000 --> 26:12.000


26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
secretary

26:15.000 --> 26:15.000


26:15.000 --> 26:15.000


26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
damn

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
l

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
r

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Or

26:24.000 --> 26:24.000


26:24.000 --> 26:24.000


26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.020
They

26:28.020 --> 26:29.020
can

26:29.020 --> 26:35.520
tell

26:35.520 --> 26:37.520
that

26:37.520 --> 26:39.520
the

26:39.520 --> 26:41.520
paper

26:41.520 --> 26:43.520
I said

26:43.520 --> 26:45.520
that it's

26:45.520 --> 26:47.520
not

26:47.520 --> 26:49.520
intention

26:49.520 --> 26:53.520
and we

26:53.520 --> 26:55.520
know

26:55.520 --> 26:57.520
how to handle

26:57.520 --> 26:59.520
the situation

26:59.520 --> 27:01.520
then the car

27:01.520 --> 27:03.520
said that he was

27:03.520 --> 27:05.520
in a

27:05.520 --> 27:07.520
situation

27:07.520 --> 27:09.520
in industrial

27:09.520 --> 27:11.520
plant

27:11.520 --> 27:13.520
and I stated that

27:13.520 --> 27:15.520
the army and back the

27:15.520 --> 27:17.520
hold

27:17.520 --> 27:19.520
against the

27:19.520 --> 27:21.520
park very much

27:21.520 --> 27:23.520
in that

27:23.520 --> 27:25.520
problem

27:25.520 --> 27:27.520
connected

27:27.520 --> 27:29.520
I think that that

27:29.520 --> 27:31.520
covers what I

27:31.520 --> 27:31.520


27:31.520 --> 27:33.520
said

27:33.520 --> 27:35.520
from

27:35.520 --> 27:37.520
senator McCarthy

27:37.520 --> 27:39.520
you

27:39.520 --> 27:41.520
the

27:41.520 --> 27:43.520
president

27:43.520 --> 27:45.520
and

27:45.520 --> 27:47.520
the

27:47.520 --> 27:49.520
president

27:49.520 --> 27:51.520
and

27:51.520 --> 27:53.520
the

27:53.520 --> 27:55.520
president

27:55.520 --> 27:57.520
and

27:57.520 --> 27:59.520
the

27:59.520 --> 28:01.520
president

28:01.520 --> 28:02.520
and

28:02.520 --> 28:03.520
the

28:03.520 --> 28:05.520
president

28:05.520 --> 28:06.520
and

28:06.520 --> 28:09.520
the

28:09.520 --> 28:11.520
the

28:11.520 --> 28:13.520
I like

28:13.520 --> 28:17.520
not

28:17.520 --> 28:19.520
I like

28:19.520 --> 28:21.520
not

28:21.520 --> 28:23.520
I like

28:23.520 --> 28:26.520
not

28:26.520 --> 28:30.520
not

28:30.520 --> 28:34.520
I like

28:34.520 --> 28:37.520
not

28:37.520 --> 28:42.520
I like

28:42.520 --> 28:44.520
not

28:44.520 --> 28:50.520
I like

28:50.520 --> 28:53.520
not

28:53.520 --> 28:55.520
I'm

28:55.520 --> 28:59.520
good

28:59.520 --> 29:05.240
I in

29:05.240 --> 29:07.740
a particular job except that I do know Mariela

29:07.740 --> 29:10.500
I getting

29:10.500 --> 29:11.900
I remember

29:11.900 --> 29:14.100
I come home

29:14.100 --> 29:16.000
I remember

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
I remember

29:17.000 --> 29:17.720
I remember

29:17.720 --> 29:18.400
I remember

29:18.400 --> 29:19.320
I remember

29:19.320 --> 29:19.920
it

29:19.920 --> 29:24.380
RL

29:24.380 --> 29:27.700
I'm changed as I came into office

29:27.700 --> 29:29.820
precisely as I found it

29:29.820 --> 29:32.860
the procedure is this

29:32.860 --> 29:36.220
when a telephone call comes in

29:36.220 --> 29:41.620
Mr. Lucas stays on the line

29:41.620 --> 29:44.020
the reason he stays on the line

29:44.020 --> 29:47.940
is in order to adjust the secretary's

29:47.940 --> 29:51.820
in doing his job and let me give you an illustration

29:51.820 --> 29:56.460
the whole day with the telephone call from somebody in Chicago

29:56.460 --> 29:59.980
who invites me to come to Chicago

29:59.980 --> 30:02.620
to address the annual convention

30:02.620 --> 30:03.700
of some kind

30:03.700 --> 30:06.220
of some organization

30:06.220 --> 30:07.500
and to hold

30:07.500 --> 30:09.820
by a quick glance at my calendar

30:09.820 --> 30:13.660
I find that I can accept this engagement

30:13.660 --> 30:15.820
and decide that I have this immediately

30:15.820 --> 30:18.060
for the hour

30:18.060 --> 30:22.460
I then say I want justice in the patient

30:22.460 --> 30:27.260
the following things have them in set emotions

30:27.260 --> 30:29.940
Mr. Lucas being on the line

30:29.940 --> 30:31.340
first

30:31.340 --> 30:32.820
when and where

30:32.820 --> 30:35.380
is this apparent to be

30:35.380 --> 30:36.460
second

30:36.460 --> 30:40.060
transportation to in Chicago

30:40.060 --> 30:41.020
third

30:41.020 --> 30:42.620
hotel reservation

30:42.620 --> 30:44.540
in Chicago

30:44.540 --> 30:47.920
and

30:47.920 --> 30:55.400
taken

30:55.400 --> 31:06.080
and

31:06.140 --> 31:12.420
first
