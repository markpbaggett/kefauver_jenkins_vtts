00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
We have that.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
We have that.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Will you tell us.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Well, the human, the Adam discussed whether or not.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Such tragedies should be made public.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
I don't recall having discussed that.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
Did Mr. Adams ever discuss with you the question of other not making public these charges might hold up the investigation of the committee?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
No, sir.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
Did you ever personally go to the office of any of the senators on this committee?

00:44.000 --> 00:54.000
At the time, we were asking for the production of certain people in the Wyoming board and discussed the charges against Mr. Cohn.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
I called on five individual members of this committee of the time that General Wicker had been abused.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
On the 19th day of February, I called on five members of this committee.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Would you read the question to the Secretary last, without having read it, Mr. Secretary?

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
I again, growing your attention to the fact that you have not answered the question.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, that's the only time I recall having gone up and talked to members of this committee.

01:22.000 --> 01:32.000
The question was whether or not you ever called on any members of this committee with respect to the charges you've made against Mr. Cohn?

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Is that correct, Senator? Is that what you have, Mr. Cohn?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
No.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
I wonder, answer was not the sponsor of the Payton with Mr. Cohn.

01:42.000 --> 01:51.000
Okay, I get simple. Did you call on any of the members of this committee with respect to your charges against Mr. Cohn?

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Would you have been back all the other members of this committee with respect to General Wicker?

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Well, all right, then. And again, that isn't the night.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
You can call on them with respect to the alleged abuse of General Wicker.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
Well, that can be true. And still, you could have called on the members of this committee with respect to the charges against Mr. Cohn.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Now, you know that I did not call on the members of this committee and we've asked the charges against Mr. Cohn.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Now, we have a direct answer, Senator. You could be placed something else.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
You know, if you didn't call on, did you ever discuss with any members of this committee the charges against Mr. Cohn?

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
It seems to me that there may be one or two cases.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
The question might have come up about Oh, Shine and Thorn and Soap.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
But I had no papers in connection with it. I didn't know there for the purpose of discussing that.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
And if it came up, it was a purely incidental or a parallel discussion.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
I didn't go there for that purpose. Mr. Secretary, the secretary of the committee has not quite inspired the discussion environment

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
is calling for all members of the Senate. And it's almost me, that's perhaps the release of it until 2.30pm.
