00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Now back to the McCarthy Army hearings.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Mr. Jenkins speaking now.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
The Secretary understand it.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
He may answer now that we'll have a view of it if you're going to be ready.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Yes, it's true, and I'd like to continue on to meet.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
That letter of February 16th, two-sided McCarthy, in regard to the arrest case,

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
I've made public myself because I wanted the American people to know how I felt about the arrest case.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
It's a matter of public record, and it's certainly true what the McCarthy just quoted from.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
The Secretary of the Constitution is appointed for the Supreme Court.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
He hasn't even testified that he never heard the name Perez until after the man Perez was out of the Army.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
And he has also testified that he has not yet had his expected challenge report.

01:06.000 --> 01:18.000
And in an effort to expedite these hearings, might it not be better to ask witnesses who get know about the arrest case before he was out of the Army?

01:18.000 --> 01:29.000
If it's relevant to the hearing, and who do know about the expected challenge report, the respect of what it says in this particular situation?

01:29.000 --> 01:39.000
Sure, they're not believed in questions dealing with the expected general's report, but he's properly at this time, and as much as the report is not complete, as I have been advised by the Secretary.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
I haven't asked those questions yet, but if there are people who know these things, the Secretary says he doesn't know that he did not hear the name of Major Perez.

01:47.000 --> 01:56.000
Until after he was out of the Army, presumably there will be witnesses called later who do know more about it.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
And I'm just simply raising this point in an effort to expedite these hearings.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't have to, I don't have to.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
I'm just going to say, I don't have to be the judge of the court general as thoroughly from Major with all the details of this case.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm sorry, I made this mistake.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Come, it's a good time to be safe to hear the issue.

02:17.000 --> 02:28.000
The Secretary and the Saddam's accused of a target committee of using undue influence to get preferential treatment for G. David Shines.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
The maids or the demates of the Perez case shed no light on whatever on that issue as I see it.

02:37.000 --> 02:51.000
Counter charges are made by Senator McCarthy's committee against Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams in which among other things it's charged that they sought to discredit this committee.

02:51.000 --> 03:03.000
Number one, number two that they sought a cessation of investigating committees, investigation of court mamas.

03:04.000 --> 03:26.000
Number three, that they sought to stop Senator McCarthy and his committee from investigating the machinery of the Army and exposing its lack of efficiency in bringing about an expeditious investigation of the infiltration of Communists in the Army.

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
Frankly, I see fail to see where the Perez case in any respect sheds any light on those issues.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
Except this is the one and this is the Senator in part in the interruptions.

03:43.000 --> 04:09.000
It might be proper to infarge this witness with respect to the major Perez case in order to elicit from the witness his idea of what constitutes a subversive, a bad security risk, or what constitutes such a given state of fact as would justify the suspicion of an employee from the Army.

04:09.000 --> 04:33.000
Mr. Chairman, one of these one of the very important issues here is whether or not this report and Mr. Conn, Mr. at least charges against Mr. Conn, Mr. Kern, myself from WEDD, in order to pull up the work of the committee to protect those who in turn are given special considerations on known communists.

04:33.000 --> 04:42.000
And once I can run about and develop that, requesting your time, that's the issue. That's one of the all important issues.

04:42.000 --> 05:02.000
Mr. Chairman, I agree with Senator McCarthy a moment ago that that question was proper and should be answered. It went to the policy and attitude of the Secretary of the Army as to going into details of the Perez case that has no proper place in this procedure.

05:02.000 --> 05:19.000
I do not intend to be detailed with the Perez case. But let me make my position clear again, I think, I don't like the repetitious, but I am no intention going into the fact of the Perez case.

05:19.000 --> 05:43.000
I do want to go into this question. The question of why the attack was launched against Mr. Conn did it have any connection with attempts to cover up and protect those who mishandled or gave special consideration to Perez.

05:43.000 --> 06:02.000
It goes to move of in this case. I think it's all important. If I am for, I'm recruited from going into this. Then it's only logical that I cannot go into the motives surrounding the attacks made in connection with our attempts to get those who covered up to come in and support Mama.

06:02.000 --> 06:13.000
Mr. Chairman, I think all members of the committee and Council should have pretty clearly before it. What we consider relevant in your main and proper question.

06:13.000 --> 06:23.000
I don't have a question. Anyone else deal with the matter of more than the specific charges before it.

06:23.000 --> 06:39.000
Mr. Farahs, they go in to try and determine the secretary's attitude to the guilt or innocence of any of the individuals. They are improper because we're not trying at this time to determine the guilt or innocence of any of the people.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I agree with the secretary. I think the senator has stated he didn't tend to go into that.

06:43.000 --> 07:10.000
The senator has stated that he was protecting somebody or covering somebody up for something of that time. I want to make it clear to this committee that I'm not covering up any time.

07:10.000 --> 07:20.000
I believe you stated Mr. Secretary that you had never heard about the President's case before he came back to the state of the resident of Black.

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
That you received a communication with Mr. Adams in regard to the President's case when you were in the east.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
In the forest? Well, any place before you return.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
I think it was a memorandum of when he had a healing stop in California in the middle of the night on the way back to Washington. That's the first time he heard of it.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
He was out of the army for that time. You received a memorandum on the press case before you make your statement to the President.

07:47.000 --> 07:58.000
I had a Miss memorandum on the press case which I looked correctly at on the plane before I got on. But I had no real working knowledge of the press case.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
Does that memorandum tell you who ordered his honorable discharge?

08:05.000 --> 08:14.000
No. You sure as far as I can remember. As a matter of fact, I didn't have really a contact. I just studied a memorandum.

08:14.000 --> 08:23.000
I was within the middle of the night when it came on board and we got in here the next morning. I didn't like any particular attempt to measure out myself with the press case.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
I had a return to Washington. As soon as I got back here, then I made a funny my business to get into it and find out what it transpired.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Did you study the memorandum? You can make it.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
I don't think I studied the memorandum. I started talking with the people who knew about the case because it seemed to be some of a matter of public interest.

08:41.000 --> 08:50.000
I wanted to familiarize myself. Secretary did not let memorandum tell you who was responsible for the honorable discharge.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
I don't recall what it is. Do you have that memorandum?

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't think we do. Do you mean you didn't say it? I don't think I did.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know. Did you find that? We'll find out. Yes, I'm soon to be known.

09:05.000 --> 09:14.000
That's the afternoon. You don't recall what was in the memorandum at all. I'm not asking you what was in it. I'm asking if you recall what was it.

09:15.000 --> 09:26.000
This is the first I heard of the arrest case. I don't remember even whether I fully worth the memorandum.

09:26.000 --> 09:37.000
But I know that as soon as I got back and landed at these questions where I asked me which have been referred to, then I made it my business to get into the arrest case.

09:37.000 --> 09:45.000
I ordered the inspector general to get on it and get me the unmistakable fact about it as soon as he put it.

09:45.000 --> 09:54.000
No, that was quite some time ago. Yes, sir. That was probably around the 10th and 12th of February.

09:54.000 --> 10:05.000
Now, to this time, Mr. Secretary, have you discovered who was responsible for the honorable discharge?

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
Yes, sir. I have asked the inspector general to give me the report, Senator. For answer the questions. No, I don't know who was responsible.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
You don't know who was responsible? You said you got into it. That's right.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
The first logical thing you would do was to be to find out who was responsible for the honorable discharge.

10:25.000 --> 10:43.000
The logical thing for me to do was to get the inspector general to make a complete report, or me on the arrest case, and then know exactly so far as the facts could be established as to who had in any way that at any point touched the arrest case.

10:43.000 --> 10:56.000
If there is one not information available, if there is any delirious election of duty, in connection with the arrest case, I can assure you it will be properly dealt with.

10:56.000 --> 11:07.000
You said you turned to the people who knew about the arrest case you came back. That's right. Did you know the asking a simple question who ordered an honorable discharge for this man?

11:07.000 --> 11:17.000
I was a... As I recall it was a routine action in the Aged and General's Office, which handled thousands of cases per day.

11:17.000 --> 11:28.000
Did you know the answer? The friend of the fellow owner, Mr. Adams, was the man who phoned and ordered the honorable discharge?

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
Now sir, I don't recall Adam Paul. And Mr. Adams would have had no right to order an honorable discharge.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
Let me just... Without going into detail the case came with a mechanism for question.

11:43.000 --> 11:52.000
There had been an honorable discharge order. Or did I believe around January 1st he was given 90 days to accept.

11:52.000 --> 12:02.000
When I talk about ordering the honorable discharge, I think the record should be correct to refer to the speeding up for the extra-diving of it.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
The day after he appeared before our committee. Did you find out who did that?

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
You restate that hard, left for the lawyer, will they say?

12:11.000 --> 12:18.000
The discharge was ordered as I recall sometime around January 1 of 1954.

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
It gave the commanding officer rather gave Mr. Perez 90 days to accept that honorable discharge.

12:27.000 --> 12:36.000
He did not accept it until the day after I wrote you suggesting a court marshal in his case.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
The question is who arranged for his honorable discharge.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
After I had written that letter which was made public, in the meantime of the day before he got the honorable discharge.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Did you find out who that was responsible for that?

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
No, I didn't, Senator. And I expect that'll all be in Inspector Donald's report.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Are you interested in that number?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I've never seen them all phases of this thing to see how we can...

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Are you interested in that?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:12.000
You met the Center for Month, the Center for Honor, Center Dixon myself on February 24, is that right?

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
That's correct. That's correct. That's on the conversation we're talking about.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:32.000
Did you, after you left that office, decide that you would have issued a report on Mr. Cohn, Mr. Char,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
or my smith self, charges against him?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I did not.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
Well, I'll have been written to Mr. Hensel's...

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
...versification of the fine money.

13:45.000 --> 13:54.000
Keep in mind that Mr. Hensel, the test for Mr. Hensel, either help prepare or regard the preparation or something this...

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
...char.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
He says, not until February 24, 1954, that I have any information.

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
But the Department of the Army has been having difficulty with Senator McCarthy Roy Cohn, or anyone else who respects a G-David Cheyenne.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
Now, listen in the case, but after you had the meeting with...

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
...Sunday for months, months out, the other two senators.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
Some of them, for the first time.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Talk to Mr. Hensel, to prepare the report.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Is that correct?

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, have it, I'd like, from what you've discussed, of course, the Mr. Hensel had must have been correct.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
But, then, did you order the report?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Prepare that for your left.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I did not.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
Were you putting on a pass, or were you left for a conference, though?

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Mr. Char, my name is Char.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
I don't think there's varying of a conference between the Republicans as...

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
...white fair as the Democrats will be in the air.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
I think...

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
...I've taken order to invite it to the issue, too.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
You've really gone through all of them.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
You don't belong these proceedings.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
Inefinitely, if we're going into all of these family calls.

15:18.000 --> 15:25.000
Mr. Char, I'm very interested in knowing, I think, is very important to know.

15:25.000 --> 15:33.000
Why it is only after this conference with the Sunkers that Mr. Hensel's contacts have been told to prepare this report?

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
If yours to the moment, very important, very important, issue in the case.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Mr. Char, I'm sorry.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Char.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Mr. Char, I'm sorry.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Mr. Char, I'm sorry.

15:51.000 --> 15:58.000
Mr. Char, the new attorney is reading from the document, and I must assume that he's reading that document correctly.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And that is...

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
...the statement made by Mr. Hensel in writing...

16:04.000 --> 16:11.000
...that he did not know that there was a difficulty between the Army and the McCarthy Committee until February 24th.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Is that right, Senator? Is that what you read?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yes, sir.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
You're under the February 24th, Mr. Hensel.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Is your nothing you say in the affirmative?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Yes, sir.

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
Now, he has asked the secretary about a meeting on February 24th, which time the secretary was present.

16:27.000 --> 16:41.000
And his question was whether or not the secretary determined as of that date or immediately the attempt to release this document making the charges against the McCarthy Committee, I think the division's added property.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm sure he's going to have to overload the final order, then, by Council to Mr. Hensel.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Mr. Hensel, I did not do any such thing.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
What must we ask you this, Mr. Secretary?

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
Well, when did you first tell Mr. Hensel to prepare this report?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I never told Mr. Hensel to prepare this report.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Let me ask this, Mr. Chairman.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
Is there evidence of this time a letter to Mr. Potter?

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
The Richardist state of Mr. Hensel either should provide it to prepare the report.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Is that in the record?

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Chair, does not be told that there is no such letter?

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
There is no such letter.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
Mr. Hensel, did not you letter to Potter from Hensel or someone saying Hensel prepared this?

17:26.000 --> 17:35.000
There is a few, I assume, you are referring to the letter on which the secretary was present.

17:35.000 --> 17:43.000
And I believe that if I'm not mistaken the letter was signed by a lay of officer.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Would you sign it or pass it or sign it or not?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm not certain.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Well, I wonder if we can add an error to that.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
The file file is staying in perhaps exercise.

17:55.000 --> 18:06.000
The letter in response to Senator Potter's letter of March 8, I believe it was,

18:06.000 --> 18:15.000
transmitting a chronological statement to the defense, was signed by Mr. Hensel as counsel to the Department of Defense.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Thank you.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
The letter was signed, you say, but Mr. Hensel?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
That's correct.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
We have a red order to the record.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Mr. Potter, I'm signed by Mr. Hensel.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
We have a red order to the record, Mr. Chairman.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
In order to Mr. Hensel to follow this, make sure this is the correct copy.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
There is another powder in response to the request made near letter of March 8, 1954, for the secretary of defense.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
I am in closing here with the chronological statement of the discussion with the private

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
David D. Shine, or G. David Shine, in the manner in which he was assigned and treated.

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
This chronological statement has been compiled under my supervision by examination of various files of the Army.

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
And after oral examination of the individual's mention were available to the man, assigned by me to prepare the document itself.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.000
I believe this chronological statement will furnish the answer to three specific questions requested by you and all.

19:13.000 --> 19:19.000
If you wish any further information, please call upon me.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
My call attention again to the one line.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
This statement has been compiled under my supervision, signed in the H.2, Hensel.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
And now I have a statement letter stated March 10, 1944, 1954.

19:34.000 --> 19:42.000
The date of the letter is published, the time is present, and Miss Kahnchen has expired.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Mr. Kahnchen, how do you identify the question?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Mr. K. K. One question.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
You state today for your return from the war end.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
You first learned of the Perez case.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
That's correct. That's right. When was that mistake, Dave?

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
That was during the night of the 2nd and 3rd of February.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
2nd, 3rd of February.

20:07.000 --> 20:18.000
That's when did you request the instructor general to investigate the Perez case and give you a report on it within a few days after I returned?

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Then you made that request early in February of the year.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
That's right.

20:23.000 --> 20:34.000
So that February, March and April, some three months have a last thing you made the request of the instructor general by a report on the Perez case.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Is that correct?

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
A little less than that, yes sir. A little less than three months back.

20:38.000 --> 20:49.000
How long does it ordinarily take an instructor general to make an investigation and give you a report on it is comparable to the Perez case?

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Well, first of all, I don't recall any comparable to the Perez case.

20:53.000 --> 21:00.000
There way I can lay if it depends on the amount of tarot that has to be covered and the number of people that have to be interviewed.

21:00.000 --> 21:12.000
Well, Mr. Stevens, in the interim have you ever requested the instructor general to be deposed investigation or to give you any report on it?

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Well, I know that the inspector general knows of my interest in this case.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
I've never spoken to him personally and told him to do anything except get this report for me as soon as he could do a good job on it.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Give me all the facts.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
You're a contact him personally. A little less than three months ago.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
I didn't contact him personally. I sent instructions that I wanted to have this report.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Well, all right. Same thing as I was in the conference. That's right.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
And now that's been nearly three months. That's a good one. That's right.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
What in the meantime have you received any interim report on it?

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
I've picked any partial report. I've picked up information from time to time.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Yes, about the Perez case. I have, Mr. Jenkins.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
I have the inspector general given you any report. Now partial, or otherwise, no sir.

22:02.000 --> 22:10.000
Have you requested him to make any report on it? Since your first message to him early in February.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
No, I don't think I have. I wanted to have a complete wrapped up job done on it and things.

22:16.000 --> 22:29.000
But you see, if I could explain for just a moment the number of people that would handle the papers in a case like this might run the very substantial numbers.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
It might run to, might be very hard to realize that if I am.

22:33.000 --> 22:43.000
And we're trying our best to get these names of the people that handle the papers which is what's done in the car of the ass before.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
Where wasn't the investigation of the Perez case apparently a fairly simple matter?

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Very no, complicated matter. Very complicated case.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
I'd say that there was a big job to get all the facts together in regard to just how the Perez case was.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
So for that reason, it has never occurred to you that the inspector general has been barely in his duty or at all.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
No, no, no, no, no, no. When making use of investigation and giving you a room no sir.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Do you have any idea when you will get a report on the Perez case?

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I think it could come at any time.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
It's expected momentarily, anytime.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
They need all probability before the termination of this case.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I would guess so.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Yes sir.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
That's all Mr. Church. Very good. Any defenders at the right? Have any questions?

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Any defenders at my left? Mr. Welsh?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
None.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I have a right here, Mr. Cohen.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Here we suggest that after this next ten minute interval that we will be able to...

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
Leave for ten seconds now for station identification.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
This is WABC New York's first station.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
We've had another go around with questions or opportunities at any rate.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
For members of the Investigating Committee to ask and questions, but they will all pass.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
So we're back to Senator McArthur again, whose questioning secretary Steve's.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
That this matter was brought to Mr. Hensel's attention.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
Mr. Hensel's minutes of life I supervise the preparation report.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
Do you think that is merely coincidence or was it because when you went back to the Pentagon...

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
Some of your people back there were very unhappy about this and decided to get out of report to then Mr. Cohen.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Got it, absolutely nothing to deal with it.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Well, if you ask me that when you went back to Pentagon, it's a fact that some of them were very unhappy...

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
With their agreement with your minutes of committee.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
If so, they didn't say so to me.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
Well, weren't you extremely disturbed yourself later that evening?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I was worried about it, yes sir.

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
But you know all your views during the agreement was to furnish us the names of those responsible...

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
In the press case to make them available to us apart.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I tried.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And why would you be so disturbed about that?

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
I was disturbed by Marley on account of the General's Wicker case...

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Where General's Wicker had been abused.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
And I was very anxious that Army witnesses whether in a out of uniform be not abused by you in the future.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
But let's condition hasn't changed from time you left.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
So, what do you think?

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
I think it's a very important thing to do.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
But let's condition hasn't changed from time you left.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
The meeting with us until the time you got to the Pentagon.

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
Otherwise, as far as the worker was concerned, his situation had not changed at all on the 24th.

25:48.000 --> 25:57.000
Well, it changed to the extent that it was popularly considered by the press and others...

25:57.000 --> 26:07.000
That I've forgotten all about General's Wicker and my fundamental principle of fighting to have my witnesses from the farm of the Army not abused and treated properly.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
And I never gave that principle up and I don't know.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
I think maybe there Mr. Secretary, you're putting your finger on the trouble.

26:14.000 --> 26:21.000
You weren't disturbed about what you had agreed to do, but you were disturbed about the press set up of what you agreed to do.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I was disturbed because it wasn't more than that men around us too.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Well, are you held right to memorandum?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
I was present.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
And some very month bettered over to you very carefully.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Better than month's title.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.000
Yes, and we spent a great deal of time looking over the memorandum, striking out of work here, adding one rear as my brain.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Striking some out of your suggestion.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
There was a lot of discussion.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
And we made some deletions of your suggestion.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
I too made some deletions of your suggestion.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
There were a lot of things I did suggest that you didn't put in.

26:54.000 --> 27:09.000
All right, well now, the substance, the substance of the memorandum was that you agreed to give us the names of those responsible in the case of the system and the communists, and they would be called before the human being.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Beyond that, we didn't go that way in the agreement.

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
I'm wondering why you had been disturbed, so deeply disturbed that you had agreed to give us the key, the leadback to those who were responsible.

27:21.000 --> 27:35.000
I was disturbed because of the fact that the abuse of witnesses was my fundamental problem that I was having with you at that time.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
And it continued to be a problem.

27:38.000 --> 27:47.000
And it just appeared from that memorandum that I had no apparently, I forgot all about that, which was not the case.

27:47.000 --> 27:55.000
Accordingly, I spoke from the White House the next evening and already cleared a situation up on that point.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
And you'll recall what you said about my statement right after I made it.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
You said it was a complete falsehood.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, do you know what gets back to this, uh, the Robert's complaint?

28:08.000 --> 28:14.000
You have, under 24th, in other words, that's the date Mr. Hemp will serve the person.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
We're in about the charges.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
You and Mr. Cohn, you're in the other side.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
That was the date you left the meeting. You said you went to the Pentagon after that, did you?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
That's right.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
And when did you start to become unhappy about the agreements you made?

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
I was unhappy about it right from a conception.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
You were unhappy when you said they're smiling, shaking my hand, well, if targets were to take my picture?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Unhappy.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Be very.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
Right, then you get back to the Pentagon and get hell out of the way.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
How old are there with the originator of that particular night?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
The charges against Mr. Cohn.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I have no idea.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Did you talk to Hemp so at night?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I don't think I did.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Do you remember?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I don't think I did.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
No, I'm pretty sure I did.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Did you talk to Mr. Adams?

29:14.000 --> 29:22.000
At the matter of fact, uh, uh, I went back to the office and then, uh, I went home.

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
I don't think I saw anybody except some of my own staff, or a matter of afternoon, after I get back from this meeting.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
You went from the meeting to the Pentagon?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
That's my right.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Can you say you did not see Mr. Adams that late?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
No, I didn't say I didn't see Mr. Adams.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Well, do you know what you did or not?

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
It's rather important, Mr. Secretary, to know how come on this particular night,

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
where I finally was conceived the idea for this smear campaign against my son.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
I'd like to know who originated, who talked to him?

29:54.000 --> 30:01.000
I, if it was originated, then which I, for any other time, which I very much doubt, I have no knowledge of it.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
What do you think you were doing with it?

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
Did, did, did you see you had nothing to do with it?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Absolutely nothing to do with it.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
Did you ever discuss with Adams the preparation of these charges?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Discuss what?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
What that?

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Did you ever discuss with Adams the preparation of these charges?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Of course I did discuss with Adams.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
You discussed the preparation of the charges with Adams?

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
Mr. Hensel, without lying, how this, what this chronology was prepared under his supervision.

30:31.000 --> 30:38.000
Transcript, Mr. Hensel, did you discuss with Mr. Adams the preparation of these charges?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Which charges you mean now?

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
The ones against Mr. Hensel, the Charm, Mr. Cohn and myself.

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
As far as I know, there was no discussion,

30:50.000 --> 30:58.000
but 24th of February, or for a considerable period upon their after about any charges.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
Right now, let's forget about the time in the last few generations.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
But you've been asking me about 24th of February.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
Let's, let's forget another question about it.

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
The question is, did you ever discuss with Mr. Adams the preparation of these charges?

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Actually, the charges were prepared by council.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Or else it might be because even if you have not answered the question,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
then I respectfully recall your attention to that fact.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
His question is simple.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
Did you ever discuss with Mr. Adams the preparation of these charges?

31:30.000 --> 31:37.000
And I'm sure he means the release of March 11, 1954.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Did you ask this, Mr. Adams?

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
I tell you all I know about it, Mr. Jackson.

31:43.000 --> 31:54.000
One of Mr. Hensel's men, that came to my office and asked me of what I knew about certain of these events.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
And I told him.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
And I can attribute it to the, to the preparation of this chronology of events,

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
to answer the Senate of Potter's letter by recalling and putting in whatever information I had on the subject.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
But did you discuss it with Mr. Adams?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I'll tell him about the con.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I'm sure I wasn't the discuss of a measure.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I'm sure that you must have served.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Then he's your right hand.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Oh, he was the department councilor.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Yes, the age.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
All right.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Very well.
