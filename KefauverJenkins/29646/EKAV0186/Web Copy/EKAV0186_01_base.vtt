WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Senator McGarby, take this place now at the end of the committee table.

00:05.040 --> 00:08.800
The captain position is on the left.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.800
This is Mr. Cohen on the right.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.800
Mr. Carr.

00:12.800 --> 00:18.920
Senator Carr amount is wrapped for attention and the session will be underway in just a moment.

00:18.920 --> 00:24.720
It is expected the first witness will be Secretary of the Army Stevens who is expected to test

00:24.720 --> 00:32.040
the service morning only on the fact that the Army takes responsibility for making and

00:32.040 --> 00:35.360
pressing the charges against Senator McCarthy in his death.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.360
There he is, com, doider.

00:39.360 --> 00:51.720
The committee will come to our duty and the chair will resume his custom of welcoming

00:51.720 --> 00:58.720
our guests who have come to the committee room and advising them of the standing committee

00:58.720 --> 00:59.720
room.

00:59.720 --> 01:05.560
Which is to the effect that there are to be no manifestations, audibly, of approval or

01:05.560 --> 01:11.880
disapproval at any time, like anybody, during the course of the hearings.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.440
The officers that you see in the room and the playing clothesmen who have scattered to

01:15.440 --> 01:20.800
the audience have standing ordered from the committee to politely escort from the room

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
immediately.

01:21.800 --> 01:28.880
Anybody who is in the position to which you enter, which were to refrain entirely from

01:28.880 --> 01:34.520
manifestations of an audible nature, either expressing your approval or disapproval.

01:34.520 --> 01:41.880
The chair will play at the beginning as we open this morning that when these hearings

01:41.880 --> 01:50.040
recess a week ago, the chair was instructed by the motion declaring the recess to hold

01:50.040 --> 01:57.040
whatever conferences he could to the end that these hearings could be continued and concluded

01:57.040 --> 02:03.520
on a basis that would give the committee and the public as complete a picture as it is

02:03.520 --> 02:08.420
possible to provide under the Attorney General's interpretation of the President's

02:08.420 --> 02:11.800
Executive Order, Dates and May 17th.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.480
These conferences have been held.

02:14.480 --> 02:18.920
We are resuming this testimony this morning with the expectation that it will continue

02:18.920 --> 02:24.880
on schedule and without interruptions until all the available information has been up

02:24.880 --> 02:25.880
hand.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.360
The chair is pleased to report the Secretary Stevens who is here this morning to make

02:30.360 --> 02:34.960
a statement relative to the relationship of the conference referred to by Mr. Adams

02:34.960 --> 02:41.880
is taking place on January 21st to the hearings and that Senator McCarthy has advised the

02:41.880 --> 02:47.320
chair that he and his associates are willing and ready to testify as soon as we have

02:47.320 --> 02:53.080
concluded with witnesses from the Stevens-Adam side of this country.

02:53.080 --> 02:59.560
It is not now known, of course, how much or how little in connection with this country

02:59.560 --> 03:06.640
of the evidence will not be available to this committee as a result of the Executive

03:06.640 --> 03:08.600
Order of May 17th.

03:08.600 --> 03:14.640
However, if this committee were at this time to involve itself in the historic differences

03:14.640 --> 03:20.320
occurring between the Executive and legislative branches of our government, on the question

03:20.320 --> 03:25.920
of what testimony and evidence officials of the Executive Branch of government shall

03:25.920 --> 03:29.400
appropriately provide the congressional committees.

03:29.400 --> 03:35.760
It could well involve us in a collateral controversy which might be impossible to settle before

03:35.760 --> 03:40.360
the expiration of the current conference.

03:40.360 --> 03:46.560
Believing that the conclusion of these hearings by producing all of the pertinent information

03:46.560 --> 03:53.880
which is now available is a paramount importance so that the vital work needing to be done both

03:53.880 --> 04:01.120
by the Army and by this committee can be resumed without the restrictive burdens of these

04:01.120 --> 04:02.120
hearings.

04:02.120 --> 04:08.120
The Chair was pleased that these hearings can continue without being interrupted by an

04:08.120 --> 04:14.040
effort to determine at this time with finality the appropriate relationships in connection

04:14.040 --> 04:18.840
with congressional investigations which should properly prevail between the legislative

04:18.840 --> 04:21.920
and the Executive Vences of our government.

04:21.920 --> 04:28.640
In the view of the Chair, the Executive Order does not prevent the asking of any questions

04:28.640 --> 04:35.960
that interrogatories might care to ask, but it will be up to each witness and his counsel

04:35.960 --> 04:42.400
to make the plea of the protections set up by the Executive Order when it is considered

04:42.400 --> 04:44.920
essential to do so.

04:44.920 --> 04:51.840
In the interest of providing us all with the maximum access to the facts involved in this

04:51.840 --> 04:58.460
dispute, it is the hope of the Chair that witnesses and counsel will take weeks to

04:58.460 --> 05:05.940
be courted in the Executive Order as infrequently as they consider permissible and possible under

05:05.940 --> 05:06.940
the courts.

05:06.940 --> 05:07.940
I am just to cancel.

05:07.940 --> 05:12.940
I understand the Secretary of the Army is here and if you want to follow him as you

05:12.940 --> 05:13.940
please witness.

05:13.940 --> 05:14.940
That is correct.

05:14.940 --> 05:15.940
You are in for seat.

05:15.940 --> 05:26.180
I wonder if we can have the next, the May 17th Executive Session with public.

05:26.180 --> 05:33.180
I think they would benefit to the Senators.

05:33.180 --> 05:38.420
The benefit to the people who are kind to follow this, but that time all of the Senators

05:38.420 --> 05:39.420
expressed themselves.

05:39.420 --> 05:48.660
Some of them are rather forcefully on this secrecy order to keep us getting in all the

05:48.660 --> 05:49.660
facts.

05:49.660 --> 05:53.260
We have had practically every Senators been prepared at a time.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.860
There is nothing to be led on the table.

05:55.860 --> 05:56.860
Everything should be public.

05:56.860 --> 06:02.700
I would like to, at this time, ask the Chair if someone moves.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.700
I can't make the motion myself.

06:04.700 --> 06:15.620
My boss, hearing those minutes he made public, I will need them incidentally as they proceed

06:15.620 --> 06:17.620
to these hearings.

06:18.620 --> 06:22.260
Well, the chair of the committee has been released.

06:22.260 --> 06:27.620
Any of the executive testimony or hearings is by a motion of the committee as the son

06:27.620 --> 06:28.620
of Mr. Johnson knows.

06:28.620 --> 06:34.460
The motion is made either in the Executive Session or in public Session, the chair of the

06:34.460 --> 06:37.460
Glad to put it and incidentally the chair of the Glad to vote for it.

06:37.460 --> 06:43.820
The chair believes that anything he says in the Executive Session is part of this public

06:43.820 --> 06:44.820
debate.

06:44.820 --> 06:45.820
Should we be made part of the public debate?

06:45.820 --> 06:48.620
We probably wouldn't understand anything he says.

06:48.620 --> 06:52.820
I was very much appreciative that the chair would put the Julie Voulterly committee so that

06:52.820 --> 06:58.620
the chair of the Glad to have the motion before him and then the Senate Secretary of the

06:58.620 --> 07:00.820
Senate said he cannot make the motion.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.820
If one is made, I will be sure I will put it.

07:03.820 --> 07:13.820
Mr. President, is that the Executive Session that was held at the 357, the Reptents of the

07:13.820 --> 07:24.320
Army and yourself there, Mr. Chairman, I move that the record of that Executive Session

07:24.320 --> 07:29.660
be made public and handled in the same manner as it relates to the previous Executive Session

07:29.660 --> 07:30.660
that was made public.

07:30.660 --> 07:31.660
I talked about that.

07:31.660 --> 07:37.160
Now I have an motion before it, and I wish we'd made by Senator Carter and seconded

07:37.160 --> 07:44.800
the introduction that the minutes or the notes of the Executive Session on May 17 at

07:44.800 --> 07:50.200
which time all parties to the dispute were present at which time we discussed the problems

07:50.200 --> 07:52.280
going out of the Executive Order.

07:52.280 --> 07:57.120
They made public in the same manner as the other Executive Session at which we decided

07:57.120 --> 08:00.520
to conduct this investigation in the first instance with May Public.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.760
Is there any discussion or are you ready for the question?

08:03.760 --> 08:10.760
I move as the substitute for that motion that every Executive Session we held, every minute

08:10.760 --> 08:15.760
kept public, the whole record be made public from beginning to end.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.760
I accept the substitute.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.760
You don't know what these were.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.760
I understand.

08:20.760 --> 08:26.760
Obviously one cannot force C what might happen at an Executive Session on it.

08:26.760 --> 08:32.760
It seems to me one is approved in the dark something that has not yet happened.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.760
The meeting of May 17 is in a complete fact.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.760
There's something to be candid out of the consequence of that.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.760
I don't know that I can't go that far.

08:42.760 --> 08:49.760
We just have the substitute to inject yourself into the future for all the Executive Session

08:49.760 --> 08:50.760
meeting.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.760
He's not here to tell.

08:51.760 --> 08:52.760
We have a thousand minutes of future.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.760
Next to the chairman of the work on the Make-A-M Public for the time of time, let's

08:57.760 --> 09:04.760
start here and see in public from now on.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.760
Bar of them.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.760
Any further discussion?

09:10.760 --> 09:15.760
He shared before he puts the motion would like to place this interpretation out of the subject

09:15.760 --> 09:18.760
to the approval of the Senate of March and South America.

09:18.760 --> 09:26.760
He believes that the motion should cover only those Executive Session at which members of the committee

09:26.760 --> 09:33.760
were meeting and discussing matters involving our procedure and our decisions that it should

09:33.760 --> 09:38.760
not include all of the Executive Session that has been taken from witnesses.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.760
Is the chair correct in that interpretation?

09:41.760 --> 09:45.760
Yes, you may get a second.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.760
We'll appoint that as all restricted as well.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.760
Point being we have heard a great many witnesses from the Executive Session.

09:53.760 --> 09:59.760
Many of them in an interior exploratory capacity, many of whom those who call because they

09:59.760 --> 10:03.760
didn't clearly have them called in public and it seems to me rather unnecessary to embarrass

10:03.760 --> 10:04.760
the great many people.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.760
Well, if you're going to have the conversation with all of this, then let's go.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.760
If we're not going to have the correct discussions, you're going to keep bringing them out.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.760
You have that spot, bring everything out up to date and keep everything out from the future.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.760
We'll have this problem every day.

10:18.760 --> 10:23.760
We'll get moving all along in public everything that is suit me.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.760
Mr. Chairman, anytime.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.760
In a minute, I'll go down to the public.

10:28.760 --> 10:35.760
It's got another aspect, if I may, of this high procedure, these hearings along the same line.

10:35.760 --> 10:42.760
But I want to completely agree with the position taken by my distinguished colleague from Arkansas.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.760
The American people are interested in this problem.

10:46.760 --> 10:51.760
And if we're going to put those Executive Session in, if we want to put in, and keep those out,

10:51.760 --> 10:57.760
if we want to put out, put in parts of those, we want to put in, they will not be satisfied.

10:57.760 --> 11:02.760
I think it's the duty of this committee to publish everything in a way of Executive Session

11:02.760 --> 11:05.760
that we've had since these hearings started.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.760
Well, Chair understands that that is the purpose of the substance abuse motion.

11:09.760 --> 11:15.760
The reason we raised this question about witnesses who have been called in quite an array of them,

11:15.760 --> 11:20.760
I might say, by both sides, who have appeared and been questioned.

11:20.760 --> 11:25.760
I would just run members of the committee presence, sometimes too, just enough to take foreign testimony,

11:25.760 --> 11:30.760
with the understanding and the part of the Army who called their witnesses,

11:30.760 --> 11:33.760
and the Carpe side of scholars, and the witnesses.

11:33.760 --> 11:38.760
If this was an exploratory nature, then we might well call them all in seconded situations.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.760
And then, following, you call them in public sessions.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.760
The Chair can be raised as a question whether it serves any good purpose,

11:45.760 --> 11:48.760
to put in public testimony.

11:48.760 --> 11:53.760
A lot of witnesses who have to be have answered the questions, those who call them,

11:53.760 --> 11:55.760
that said, well, you have nothing to contribute.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.760
Obviously, we call you an efficient expedition, nothing to fail.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.760
You can go back home and no testimony needed, now.

12:02.760 --> 12:07.760
If you want to needlessly embarrass those people with Chair has, of course, only one hope.

12:07.760 --> 12:12.760
But it feels it would be rather unjust to witness this, who would call and has nothing to contribute.

12:12.760 --> 12:19.760
That simply to publish this, because of the fact we have agreed that our own colleagues in our own decisions

12:19.760 --> 12:22.760
and our own deliberations could be publics.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.760
That's why I'm asking for the interpretation.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.760
That's a job.

12:27.760 --> 12:33.760
I think the whole thing is just cumbersome, as well as the record is concerned.

12:33.760 --> 12:39.760
The whole thing is said in executive sessions, but remember this committee is explored for as you say.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.760
But I don't, but I don't say we're just hanging out one meeting and putting it out here.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.760
The public that's just exposed at all.

12:47.760 --> 12:51.760
I can't believe we say from beginning to end, we'll have no more executive sessions,

12:51.760 --> 12:53.760
we'll just move and publish.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.760
I quite agree, as far as our own deliberations are concerned,

12:56.760 --> 12:59.760
because it is my putting the motion wanted to have an interpretation.

12:59.760 --> 13:04.760
So I know how to act, because I'm an expert, I'm going to have to have these notes not come to my office.

13:04.760 --> 13:08.760
As far as I'm concerned, I'm just going to have to admit that I'm an army and everything.

13:08.760 --> 13:12.760
I don't know how to express it anymore.

13:13.760 --> 13:19.760
That's the unique army that's come on the average saying that's been made up of this record,

13:19.760 --> 13:24.760
and secret, and public, or otherwise, now that you've made up of the record.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.760
Everything is everything, Mr. Chairman.

13:27.760 --> 13:31.760
We can't really make it to the very end, but we're going to have to talk to people on himself,

13:31.760 --> 13:35.760
we're shooting rounds, we're going to go against that kind of motion,

13:35.760 --> 13:37.760
because he has talked to so many witnesses.

13:37.760 --> 13:43.760
So, if you have nothing to consider, obviously we're not going to make just the money up.

13:43.760 --> 13:47.760
I'm just going to talk to them, but they're not a crime to a conference,

13:47.760 --> 13:51.760
they're an opportunity for the financial integrity of witnesses,

13:51.760 --> 13:54.760
and they're the members of the fiscal committee.

13:54.760 --> 13:58.760
But it now was under the interpretation that Senator Metzon has placed on.

13:58.760 --> 14:03.760
That was a charity within this act of not being altogether not expected in committee meeting.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.760
If the members of the committee were not present, I don't know, the council has been interrogating witnesses.

14:08.760 --> 14:13.760
That does not imply that it is a, with a certain committee executive section,

14:13.760 --> 14:18.760
the man who made the most use of himself, so in general, he has my actual expertise on what I'm describing.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.760
The council of the himself has been charity to witnesses,

14:21.760 --> 14:25.760
does not include that, but it does include an executive section,

14:25.760 --> 14:31.760
was one member of the committee was present in the personal, under the role, that's what I'm talking about.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.760
With Mr. Gueldos?

14:32.760 --> 14:36.760
Well, as all some were interrogating a witness, I don't care anything about that,

14:36.760 --> 14:38.760
I don't know, and the record has made all that they made.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.760
I don't know, but it's been a minute to such a conference.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.760
I don't know, none.

14:42.760 --> 14:46.760
But wherever a witness is put on the role, forever, an executive section was held,

14:46.760 --> 14:50.760
wherever anything was done in five years of secret, that's a part of this record.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.760
Let's make it all public.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.760
Mr. Chairman.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.760
I'm here.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.760
I have the attention, I have the subject of Mark and so, the subject of the comment.

14:58.760 --> 15:07.760
I wonder if it might not be wise to modify that motion to exclude the material that Senator Dorsak suggests,

15:07.760 --> 15:13.760
and then we have to money taken for a council, either for Mr. Stevens or not present.

15:13.760 --> 15:20.760
So our council for Adams, not present for a council for this, by the table, is not present.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.760
I think that, as many representatives, members of those parties are not present,

15:24.760 --> 15:27.760
some of these executive persons are here.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.760
Well, if that's what it is, if they were not passed to be present.

15:30.760 --> 15:34.760
I think there are some of them, Mr. Jenkins, and we have to share the message.

15:34.760 --> 15:42.760
Mr. Jenkins was conducting an interrogatory, where either council for Adams, Mr. Stevens, were not present.

15:42.760 --> 15:50.760
I think it would be on there to make that public, because Mr. Stevens, Mr. Adams had no chance to cross-examine.

15:50.760 --> 15:57.760
I think likewise, their witnesses were present, and either I and I might stand for a lot of their presence.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.760
I think it would be unfair to make that public.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.760
I think everything else would be public.

16:02.760 --> 16:09.760
For a council for both sides, for an invited represent, I think all that would be made public.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.760
The chair would like to raise this other additional point.

16:12.760 --> 16:21.760
If we adopt the McClellan substitute, where we'd be releasing, presumably this afternoon or tomorrow sometimes,

16:21.760 --> 16:30.760
the executive, the testimony taken in executive session, under oath, which is scheduled to come into these hearings at its appropriate time,

16:30.760 --> 16:37.760
both on the army side and on the McCarthy side, perhaps three or four days, and now maybe a week from now.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.760
But it would certainly be a very disarguely way in which to present a case, because instead of doing it,

16:42.760 --> 16:48.760
as we have all agreed to, in an arguably procedure, we simply be dumping it all out on the table simultaneously.

16:48.760 --> 16:53.760
And I don't think the government's been as accountable in orderly way to proceed with the interrogations to you.

16:53.760 --> 16:59.760
Chairman, I hardly agree with what you said, and in addition to that, too, I will make this paper.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.760
And perhaps the chairman is already covered in it.

17:02.760 --> 17:08.760
We have examined the great many witnesses and the executive session when the chairman, along with the president and I was present,

17:08.760 --> 17:10.760
representing the committee.

17:11.760 --> 17:19.760
Many of those witnesses knew nothing, whatever, that shed any light on the controversies involved yet.

17:19.760 --> 17:33.760
They were assured, as I recall, by both the chairman and myself, that the fact that they had been called in executive session and could under oath and yet give them testimony would be strictly confidential.

17:34.760 --> 17:42.760
And that the fact that not even their names would be revealed, and I feel that Mr. Chairman is with the executive's confidence,

17:42.760 --> 17:51.760
on our part, if we did otherwise then what we promised those witnesses at that time.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.760
I have no mind right now, next connection.

17:53.760 --> 18:01.760
I'd like to say, Senator McClell, with a witness who came under those circumstances, called incidentally the suggestion of Mr. Wilson.

18:02.760 --> 18:06.760
We had a perfectly proper reason for calling, so it might have some information.

18:06.760 --> 18:18.760
And we just knew, found there just wasn't any information that we had expected, and Mr. Wilson, I think it would be embarrassing to everybody, if under those circumstances you made that fact known and that testimony known.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.760
But the person here, all of them, agreed to make this happen.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.760
Mr. Chairman, I stand on the front end.

18:24.760 --> 18:29.760
It's a request of the first half of all, discussing this question.

18:29.760 --> 18:41.760
And the rising question that I was drawing my motion, so that I could take them up tomorrow morning, and the decision can be made at that time.

18:41.760 --> 18:47.760
I think we have a sector of army here. We have many witnesses to hear us from today.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.760
Mr. Chairman, I wish we would draw my motion to have this question, because it's the first thing to move on.

18:52.760 --> 19:01.760
For the time of New York, I mean, now I may result in the same motion, but I understand that there is no motion as well, and it's a question of the situation in the rules.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.760
And can you further remain in question?

19:03.760 --> 19:07.760
The regular motion has been withdrawn, but now it's all the substance that you must have seen.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.760
Mr. Chairman, I stand on the front end of Mr. New York.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.760
Yes.

19:13.760 --> 19:21.760
We have said that some of the Michigan students are going to be extremely difficult for me to discuss certain matters today, which I will have just go.

19:21.760 --> 19:30.760
Unless I can freely discuss what I'm on that executive such as some of the knows we did go into this matter in detail.

19:31.760 --> 19:36.760
And I think that that should be available now to all the centers to the public.

19:36.760 --> 19:44.760
Otherwise, we'll be guessing about it, misscoding it in an advertisement later, which shouldn't be forced to do that.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.760
So I wish the center was not withdrawn as motion.

19:47.760 --> 19:52.760
If the senator is writing comments, I will say this.

19:52.760 --> 19:57.760
I have no objection to having the executive section made public.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.760
However, I do feel that no questions will be asked.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.760
We'll discuss in this one point the question all morning.

20:06.760 --> 20:14.760
And I would suggest that the chairman call at the conclusion of the morning hearing, the morning session, I think,

20:14.760 --> 20:20.760
meeting this committee to act on this question I do feel.

20:20.760 --> 20:36.760
So only that testimony of what was called before the council, the member of the committee, when assurances have been given to that person, that certainly is a thank you upon the right to that individual who has that testimony made public.

20:36.760 --> 20:43.760
I don't want to leave the impression that anything is being hidden because of the executive section.

20:43.760 --> 20:57.760
At the same time, you've got to protect the people who have been given assurances that their testimony was given in private and the same token may have no relationship to bond with President Connerman.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.760
I'm not going to tell him that.

20:58.760 --> 21:04.760
It wasn't really as far as the fellow witnesses there, and she didn't not get in public.

21:04.760 --> 21:14.760
I don't want to say that the council has a part of the chairman's legal witness and make his testimony in effective session and give him assurance that it will not be made public.

21:14.760 --> 21:19.760
I can't say anything in question. I might say that that was done.

21:19.760 --> 21:28.760
It was done by the party and interest to call the witness on the assumption that this witness would have something to say that might be useful to his side of the case.

21:28.760 --> 21:36.760
Finally, the witness had no information, then the person who saw them said that I had no desire to have them appear in public. That's where the assurance came from.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.760
Mr. Chairman.

21:38.760 --> 21:43.760
I'm very clear that I am only referring to the meeting we had last Monday.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.760
You know what the witnesses were present.

21:45.760 --> 21:52.760
At that time, we discussed in detail the secretary's order which called the recess.

21:52.760 --> 21:57.760
I will want to quote from that. I don't want to quote from memory.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.760
I think that should be made public.

22:00.760 --> 22:05.760
As I say, I heard some of his up and down the table make long speeches saying everything should be on the table.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.760
The chair will recall before we start.

22:08.760 --> 22:15.760
I suggest that we have an official reporter present to take down everything that is said so no one could be in this book.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.760
The chair agreed with me. We had an official reporter present.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.760
The testimony or the statement was all available.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.760
I can see no reason for this time where we can't disclose the last.

22:27.760 --> 22:32.760
The other question, what other hearings have been made public?

22:32.760 --> 22:39.760
Committee can certainly take it up a few days before it's time to turn.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.760
Anybody anything else to say or any motion to make? There's nothing before the chair.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.760
The absence of any other statement.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.760
Chair, we would like to introduce Jason Cumpan.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.760
This gentleman, a son here at Cumpan.

22:52.760 --> 22:57.760
So, all we ask questions of the council is a little matter that I'd like to clear up.

22:57.760 --> 23:10.760
I was down at the store over the weekend and based on some of the stories which appeared in the papers based on press conferences or statements made by the chairman.

23:10.760 --> 23:17.760
There appears to be a general feeling in the papers of Missouri that there was some interest on the part of the Democrats

23:17.760 --> 23:21.760
in not having the monitor telephone calls published.

23:21.760 --> 23:28.760
Now, I know that Chairman would not want to say anything that's unfair to the Democratic members of this committee.

23:28.760 --> 23:32.760
And I'm even more sure that he wouldn't want to say anything that's untrue.

23:32.760 --> 23:37.760
In order to clarify this matter, I have a couple of short sentences here.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.760
With all the principals and all the senators have placed for them this time.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.760
And I would like to read that. It'll take about a minute.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.760
It'll last.

23:47.760 --> 23:54.760
I request that all monitor telephone calls between the office of the Secretary of the Army and myself,

23:54.760 --> 24:00.760
which this subcommittee and its council believe are relevant to the issues now before the subcommittee,

24:00.760 --> 24:03.760
shall be promptly made a part of public records.

24:03.760 --> 24:11.760
I agree to be above provided all principals of each argument and members of this subcommittee also sign this agreement.

24:11.760 --> 24:18.760
And then Mr. Chairman, I have a place for you to sign and send a dirtion and send a potter and send a dorsac and send a mccrollum

24:18.760 --> 24:27.760
and send a Jackson and myself and send a McCarthy and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Carr and Mr. Hinsle and Secretary Steven and Mr. Adams.

24:28.760 --> 24:33.760
And I would like to make this suggestion submitted to you, sir, and make it far the right to the climate.

24:33.760 --> 24:41.760
I'm sure that you receive it and add further that Mr. Wilk can begin with the chair at the beginning of the session this morning

24:41.760 --> 24:47.760
that he had just arrived back from Boston and not had a chance to read the letter which I sent him over the weekend,

24:47.760 --> 24:54.760
which sent to him the four blanks signed by the Republicans and the three blanks signed by the Democrats,

24:54.760 --> 25:00.760
and at which I said it, from those seven blanks he could deliver the monitor and cabinet statements through our council.

25:00.760 --> 25:06.760
I hope he would do so. I mean, he could not. I hope he would tell us what he had to have so he could,

25:06.760 --> 25:13.760
because we'd like to have that first step taken care of immediately. And it may be that Mr. Wilk has heard your statement read

25:13.760 --> 25:18.760
and will find that helpful to him when he can purge with our council through the luncheon.

25:18.760 --> 25:29.760
Now, Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Wilk, I say a single word you make. I apparently gave the chairman the impression that I'd arrived on the disforming from Boston.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.760
I did in fact arrive about 10 o'clock last night, but did not see your letter until this morning.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.760
Right, Mr. Chairman, you're off at the pieces like five.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.760
All right, Mr. Jenkins. Mr. Smith, you're just one of the other ones.

25:39.760 --> 25:46.760
I wonder if I may as a matter is being discussed strictly from legalistic angles.

25:46.760 --> 26:03.760
And that is that it seems almost incredible to me that Mr. Wilk and his council and Mr. Roy Cohn and conceded these monitored conversations

26:03.760 --> 26:10.760
by agreement between somebody and somebody. At the same time, not a single member of this committee,

26:10.760 --> 26:19.760
sitting in judgment on these charges, has so far by any agreement been allowed to see any monitor telephone conversations.

26:19.760 --> 26:29.760
Mr. Chairman, I would like to have the honor of having the first signatures on Senator Simon's paper produced by Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams.

26:29.760 --> 26:34.760
They would like the honor of being the first ones to put their names on your paper.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.760
Now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask you what to make as if this matter is being cleared up.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.760
We've certainly hoped it would be cleared up because it has been in the fall for a long time.

26:42.760 --> 26:47.760
Now, Mr. Jenkins, will you proceed with this chairman?

26:47.760 --> 26:56.760
I desire to make it perfectly clear at this time that the secretary of the army is being called to the witness them this morning out of water.

26:56.760 --> 27:06.760
For one purpose and one purpose only in so far as direct and cross-examination of the secretary are concerned.

27:06.760 --> 27:23.760
As we all know, the president issued a directive on May 17th following that the press carried a statement allegedly made by the secretary of the army under date of May 19th.

27:24.760 --> 27:36.760
The purpose of this examination is to interrogate the secretary with respect to this release of May 19th and for no other purpose.

27:36.760 --> 27:42.760
You are Mr. Robert K. Stevens, Secretary of the Army.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.760
Yes, sir.

27:44.760 --> 27:51.760
Even if my memory has not failed me, I believe you have yet a poor test of honesty hearings.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.760
That is correct, sir.

27:55.760 --> 28:04.760
Did you appoint yourself with the presidential directive of May 17th, Mr. Stevens, and particularly the context of that directive?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.760
Yes, sir.

28:06.760 --> 28:18.760
I would ask you whether or not after the issue is that directive you consulted with your attorneys and with your associates and with Mr. Adams and Mr. Welles.

28:18.760 --> 28:19.760
I did.

28:21.760 --> 28:35.760
Please state whether or not Mr. Secretary some two days following that directive and particularly on May 19th you issued a release to the press, a statement to the press.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.760
I did, sir.

28:37.760 --> 28:45.760
I will ask you whether or not you consulted with Mr. Adams and Mr. Welles prior to the issuance of that statement.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.760
Yes, I did.

28:47.760 --> 28:54.760
Do you have that statement with you in its original form?

28:54.760 --> 28:59.760
Yes, I don't have the original, but I've got to put it in the exact copy of it, Mr. Stevens.

28:59.760 --> 29:10.760
Yes, I will ask you to now please read the exact copy of your press release of May 19th, 1954 to the Supreme Committee.

29:10.760 --> 29:16.760
The statement by the Secretary of the Army was as follows.

29:16.760 --> 29:24.760
I wish to make it perfectly fine, but the decision and the act on the part of the Army, concerning the controversy,

29:24.760 --> 29:32.760
presently being heard by the Senate's subcommittee, were the decisions and the action of the Department of the Army along.

29:32.760 --> 29:44.760
At no time did the Army or I as its secretary receive any orders from anyone in respect to the preparation or presentation of the Army's case.

29:44.760 --> 29:54.760
Specifically, the conference of January 21 was only for the purpose of the painting and interpretation of existing directives.

29:54.760 --> 30:03.760
Actions taken by the Army prior or subsequent to the meeting were independent actions taken on the Army's own responsibilities.

30:03.760 --> 30:13.760
As Secretary of the Army, I believe and now believe that the Army, its secretary and its counsel were subjected to improper pressures from front of the McCoy.

30:13.760 --> 30:20.760
Mr. Cohn and Mr. Carr in respect to private G. David Chan.

30:20.760 --> 30:30.760
I am convinced that the Army had no other honorable force and to bring those acts which I consider improper to the attention of the United States Senate.

30:30.760 --> 30:42.760
No meeting or conference influenced my decision to protest and fight attempts to obtain preferential treatment for a private in the Army by the use of the power and prestige of the Senate committee.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.760
At the end of the fight.

30:45.760 --> 30:50.760
Mr. Cikicay is where words you on January 20th.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.760
I was in the party.

30:52.760 --> 30:59.760
You knew nothing about any conference between Mr. Adams and any members of the executive department of the government.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.760
As was that date, that's right.

31:01.760 --> 31:05.760
When did you first learn of such a meeting, Mr. Cikicay?

31:05.760 --> 31:07.760
After my return from the party.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.760
And what was the date of that?

31:09.760 --> 31:11.760
The third of everywhere.

31:11.760 --> 31:17.760
Without telling what was said, state-mother and opnestradents would discuss that meeting with you, be dead.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.760
And a prize to you is the fact that such a meeting has been had.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.760
That's correct.

31:24.760 --> 31:32.760
I will ask you, Mr. Secretary of the Father and Noth, the statement you have just read under date of May 19th, 1954.

31:32.760 --> 31:37.760
Is a true and correct statement of fact.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
It is.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.760
This is one other question, Mr. Cikicay.

31:43.760 --> 31:48.760
Did you hear, Mr. Adams, testify in this controversy?

31:48.760 --> 31:49.760
No, sir.

31:51.760 --> 31:59.760
I will ask you or your counsel to turn the page 2619 of the record.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.760
Seeing in Volume 15.

32:04.760 --> 32:14.760
And I lead you an excerpt from the testimony of Mr. Adams, his testimony having been given prior to the presidential directive of May 17th.

32:18.760 --> 32:22.760
And I am now reading from the second paragraph on that page.

32:22.760 --> 32:32.760
At this meeting, Governor Adams asked me if I had the written record of all of the incidents with reference to private facts.
