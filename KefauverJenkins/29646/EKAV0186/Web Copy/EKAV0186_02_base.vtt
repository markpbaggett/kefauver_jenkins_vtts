WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I should prepare one.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
And further in his forty feet with his statement,

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
and this would be fire to his testimony,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
there is this expert from fascinatement.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Governor Adams asked me if this meeting

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
if I had a written record of all of the

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
incidents with reference to fire this time

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
because it's just within that day,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
when I was fired in the negative,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
he stated that he thought I should prepare one.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Will you have stated without Dr. Smith's

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
statement when you prepared this statement of May 19th?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Just a moment.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Governor Adams, I'm not quite sure

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
to what you refer Mr. David,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
that you said, were you have stated with that?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Now, will you have stated with the fact

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
or are the alleged facts as stated by Mr. Adam?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
That Governor Adams asked Mr. Adam whether or not...

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
He had prepared a written record of all of the

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
incidents with reference to fire this time.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And when you were fired in the negative,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Governor Adams stated to him that he thought

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
we should prepare such a written record.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
The testimony, the restatement of the question,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
makes it quite firm, Mr. Jacobs,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
that you are at the bottom asking for what

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
for quite a fast conference.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And between the testimony of Mr. Adam

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
and the present moment, the

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
President told directly, as interviewees,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I think it's quite clear,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
that between you and me,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
what the expected answer would be,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
but the difficulty as to the answer is,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I think it's fair to you as it is to me.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Mr. Chairman, I certainly have no intention,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
whatever, of impinging the ball in a presidential

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
directly, or I've been this witness to

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
violated it in a respect I was proceeding on the theory.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
That this testimony of Mr. Adams was given

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
prior to the time of the presidential directive.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
And that the presidential directive was not

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
retroactive.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
And my question of course is directed to whether

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
or not there is some discrepancy.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
I am not alleging it as a fact,

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
but I intend to intend to explore it,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
to the presogatives, to advise the Secretary

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
not to answer the question if you so desire Mr. Welch.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
But my talk was perhaps the committee might conclude that

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
there is some discrepancy in the testimony of Mr. Adams

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
and the statement of the Secretary on the date of May 19th.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Now I will read the question, Mr. Jenkins,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
that I have make an attempt to

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
question this without the same time violating the

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
presidential direction.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
If what you have is not, is,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
did we have a order to do something along that line?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I answered that, no, if it's not.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
I understand that Mr. Secretary, in your statement of May 19th.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
And I read from it, I wish to make it

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
perfectly plain that the decisions and the acts on the part of the

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
army concerning the controversial express and the being

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
hurt for the Senate's sub-committee were the decisions

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
and the acts of the department of the army alone.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
That's number one.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
At no time as the army or eyes is Secretary

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
receiving any orders from anyone in respect to the

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
preparations, our presentation of the army's case

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
specifically the conference of January 21st,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
was only for the purpose of obtaining an interpretation of existing

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
directives.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Now as I understand that, Mr. Stevens,

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
you state that the sole purpose of the conference of

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
January 21st was for the purpose of obtaining an

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
interpretation of existing directives.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
That's correct, isn't it?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Yes.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
And Mr. Adams says, Mr. John G. Adams says in his testimony

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
that at that conference he was directed by Governor Sherman Adams

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
to prepare a written record of all of the incidents

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
with reference to Piedit Chien.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Do you consider Mr. Secretary that there is any

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
discrepancy between your statement of May 19th

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
and the testimony of Mr. John G. Adams?

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Would you like to write this one?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I'll share the one.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
In some of the records in Shervery, like the states,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
a report has passed up a note and it's fired

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
whether Mr. Stevens has been sworn.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
And Mr. Stevens was sworn at the beginning of

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
his testimony and was not unswore when he stepped down

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
and told you to be called back to which

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
in that reference, Secretary, that's correct.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So you want to testify in under all?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes, that's correct.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Mr. Roberts, I also going through the record.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
The difficulty of the misdeed in this judgment

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
than me is the use of his word either directed

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
or ordered to prepare a statement.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
On page 2619, the paragraph you read

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
reads, and when I replied in the negative,

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
he stated he thought I should prepare one.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
That does not strike me, Mr. Jenkins,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
the Zither of Directive or in order to prepare a statement.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
It was not the case of justice that won't be prepared.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And that only.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
If Mr. Adams advised you, Mr. Stevens,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
that a suggestion was made to him that he prepared

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
a written statement of events with respect to Chien,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Mr. Chairman, although that seems to me to be

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
close to what ought not to be testified to,

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
I am going to instruct the witness to leave me out.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Now I have the question read, please.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
The party is going to be between the red.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Let's pretend our studio is across the country

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
to permit our stations to identify themselves.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Commibration, nothing.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
You're going to be able to provide more

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
to friendly greetings of your children

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
with respect to Chien.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
He did.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
He did, sir.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
Then Mr. Secretary, where these events,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
as they have been designated in an oddly

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
consisting of 34 pages, prepared as the suggestion of

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Mr. Chairman Adams,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
and the boxing.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
I think Mr. Jenkins wanted to mount it to

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
was Mr. Adams getting his files and records

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
and memorandid in connection with this matter in shape.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
I do not consider that he had any order to do that

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
to the police.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I think Mr. Johnson's wanted to mount it to

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
was Mr. Adams getting his files and records

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
and he did not have any order to do that.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
As I've said, I consider that he received the suggestion.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Yes, Mr. Secretary, I understand that,

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
and I'm afraid that you did not directly answer my question.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Now in your statement, you state that you know

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
at any time received any order from the executive department

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
of the government, and that to these charges

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
and the decisions and the acts where the charges

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
and the decisions and the acts of the army alone.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Mr. Adams is testimony he states that a suggestion

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
was made to him by Mr. Chairman Adams that he prepared

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
a statement of facts or events with respect to China.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
And my question now is whether or not Mr. Adams

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
are you or anyone under the direction of either of you

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
did prepare those events consisting of 34 pages

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
at the suggestion of Mr. Chairman Adams.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Did you or not?

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
I'll say the answer, that is no.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
The answer is no.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Yes.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And I believe you for the state that you do not consider

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
this there is any discrepancy whatever between your statement

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
and the testimony of Mr. John G Adams as red to you.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
None whatever.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
This one of the questions Mr. Stevens,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
and then I'm sure I'm through when you were last on the witness stand

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
you were asked to consult with the inspector general

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
who prepared his report and I pleased that you stated that it perhaps

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
consisted of some 500 pages.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I'm just going to ask to have him

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
designated to use a pertinent part to enable you to answer the questions

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
of Senator MacKenzie or Mr. Colne.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Has that been done Mr. Secretary?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
What I have not a sense to raise is what turned out to be 419.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Well, now we are not going to ask you about that this morning

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
except I have been requested to ask whether or not

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
when you are called back to the witness stand for a general examination

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
you will be prepared to give specific answers to those questions.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I will say you say you will.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
That's all I can ask Mr. Secretary of the Chairman.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
Sure has no question to defend Senator MacKenzie.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
I think we ought to make it very clear that in your press release

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
or the 1st is at the date 19.

10:22.000 --> 10:30.000
You said you did not act under directives and instructions or orders

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
that's the way I imperfect your testimony is that correct?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yes.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
You did have all Ms. Adams.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Did have a suggestion from Governor Adams that he prepared

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
to make a memorandum all the events regarding private signs?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Is that correct?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Yes, it is.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
Mr. Secretary, Ms. Adams is on the stand a few days ago.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
We could go today I believe in this committee read that for a week.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I have given the simple questions

11:10.000 --> 11:18.000
who have their responsibility after that meeting on January 21st.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
That was the information I was trying to get.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Is there any reason why he could not have answered the question?

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
That day since you have answered the question now you will hear

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
a week thereafter answering it on those.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
If it violated the order then, it violates the order now.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
That was the position he took on his vice council

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
that he couldn't answer because his violation is the president's directive.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
When did you decide it didn't violate the president's directive?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
I did not hear the testimony on the senator McCollum.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
That was a simple question I asked him whether the responsibility shifted

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
at that meeting on January 21st from the secretary's office

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
to a higher level of authority.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
He was advised by council his council that he couldn't answer it

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
that it violated the president's directive.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
That reason, I think the meeting was adjourned.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
We will also, a week's time, two days later,

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
you give out a statement to the press saying that you had all the responsibility.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I likened it to been answered that day.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
The only way I can answer your question time,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
McCollum, and I'm most anxious to answer all these questions, is that I think

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
a modest amount of time was needed in which to determine what could or could not be said.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
Although you have the whole responsibility to you

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
to take all of the responsibility,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
the charges that are made against you or against your army,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
is like the list of the responsibilities.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
I bet the responsibility for the charges that the army has made.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
I'm asking it the other way.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I'm asking the other way.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
I want to know if the countercharges are true

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
or you, the one who has responded.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Yes, I know.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I have to make a statement to the judiciary.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
It's a meeting with a healthy movement, come back to him as he agenda that time and the judgment.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Mr. Steven,

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
you stated that

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
pursuance to the statements that you released on May 19th,

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
that you had not received any orders from a ball that the army had initiated these charges.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
The substance of the state,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
the army took full responsibility for whatever charges were initiated.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
That's right.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Let me ask this.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
Is it fair to say that while you received no orders from a ball,

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
did you receive any assistance in the preparation of these charges from a ball?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
I mean from higher authority.

14:22.000 --> 14:30.000
Well, to reflect your recollection,

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
I believe in response to a question

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
by Senator McCarthy.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
I'll have the page in a moment.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Senator McCarthy asked this question.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
What was the report prepared?

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Was that report prepared after Senator Potter wrote you?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And your answer, Secretary Steven?

14:58.000 --> 15:06.000
I think the report, the so-called analogy, was prepared by Mr. Brown of Mr. Hensel's office.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
Along I would say starting about the fourth or fifth of March, somewhere in there, that is again.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
In other words, you did have assistance outside of the...

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh yes, yes sir.

15:18.000 --> 15:30.000
Well, the thing that I don't quite understand, if you have assistance above the level of the Department of the Army,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
how did they get into it?

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
I mean how did the defense department get into this picture?

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
Well, as I think I testified, Senator Jackson, in fact I know I've testified,

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
there was an increasing amount of interest on the part of senators and congressmen.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
In regard to the matter of David Chan, this went on and accumulated over a period of time,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
and of course the defense department was just as aware of it as the Department of the Army.

16:00.000 --> 16:08.000
Now Mr. Adams was close to this thing and connected with it as part of a natural thing,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
General Poundful's office with the Department of Defense,

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
which helped take this file and begin to put it in shape so that, if as in when,

16:18.000 --> 16:30.000
the time came that the information should be sent, the did come as well as the original letter to Senator.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
The part of the fire went over the signature of Mr. Hempel,

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
but concurrently, practically at the same time as I recall it,

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
the Department of the Army on its own communicated with all the members of this committee,

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
plus other senators and congressmen who had acquired about this matter and sent the same material

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
over the Department of the Army signature.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
A police sender of fathers, the letter was directed to the Secretary of Defense, that's right.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Some of the other inquiries were directed to the Department of the Army, that's right.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
Well, the thing that I am trying to get clear here is, I understand your state,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
and that is that the Army assumes full responsibility for initiating these charges.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
But assistance was obtained from a level higher than the Department of the Army,

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
namely the Department of the Defense in connection with the preparation of this phenology of events

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
that was later related first.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Now there's one other question I will conclude.

17:36.000 --> 17:44.000
You referred to the January 21st meeting, which of course you were all the country at the time.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
Yes, yes. Well, I believe you stated that that meeting was for the purpose of going over the legality of the law,

17:50.000 --> 17:58.000
the legality of the various directives and presidential orders.

17:58.000 --> 18:08.000
I don't quite understand why Senator, why Henry Cabot-Lodge would be present at such a meeting if that was the purpose of the meeting.

18:08.000 --> 18:16.000
I have nothing against Mr. Lodge, I am just asking the, I don't know the answer to that question, that I am.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
I am still that the January 21st meeting was for that purpose. That's right.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I'm off now.

18:31.000 --> 18:41.000
And the topic, Mr. Secretary, is that your testimony that every second of the January 21st meeting,

18:41.000 --> 18:54.000
that the order of the barely said has been, has been the center of this controversy, would have been made public by the Army.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
No, we did not make a public center to part of the issue by the Army.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
We sent it to the interested senators and congressmen.

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
But every expected, the point of my question is that every expected by the meeting of January 21st,

19:09.000 --> 19:19.000
that the Army would have sent this order of events to the members of the Congress that I've been following.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I'm quite sure we would have.

19:21.000 --> 19:35.000
And that this meeting, no way influenced you one way or the other, has to whether or not you should send the comply with requests of the various members of the Congress.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
Well, it was a consultation. The same as there were consultations with the general counsels of the Department of Defense.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
That's not a part of it, but they just, the responsibility and the independence of the action was the Department of Army.

19:49.000 --> 20:01.000
Well, this meeting, I'm saying this to my yourself, or this meeting could have been a advisory capacity, nevertheless, the action was yours,

20:01.000 --> 20:07.000
and the action would have taken place here, respectively, of this conference.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
That's my opinion. That's your opinion.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Mr. Chairman, that's the only question that I have.

20:13.000 --> 20:23.000
However, I would like to make this take, and unfortunately, I have an important official business in New York.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
I have a major committee at 1130, and I will not be back until tomorrow morning.

20:29.000 --> 20:37.000
I wish to strain out at this time, as the Chairman's commission to make excuse, what's nothing for?

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
Very well. Ten at your service.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Mr. Steven, to whom does this data support?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
The report's to me directly.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Yes, Director. To whom do you report?

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
I report to the Secretary of Defense.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Mr. Wilson, yes sir. To whom does he report?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
He reports to the President.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Now that's the line of authority, is it not?

21:06.000 --> 21:14.000
Yes sir. Any orders that were given to Mr. Adams as orders are given by you, is that correct?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
That's correct.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
And any orders that are given to you as orders are given directly to you by the Secretary of Defense.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
That's right. Is that correct, yes sir?

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
And therefore, regardless of what was said or who was at a meeting of staff members of the White House.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
So, none of those people could give an order.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Mr. Adams, that's right. That's right.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I know the organization.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I know that.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I know that.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
To call up and say the White House is calling.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
But that was never an order.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
The order to you come from the Secretary of Defense, is that correct?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It is absolutely correct.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
And what is to Mr. Adams come from you? Is that correct?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Yes sir.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
And therefore, on the basis of echelons and this government of ours,

22:00.000 --> 22:08.000
nobody could have given an order to Mr. Adams to make up this particular group of charges we're talking about, except you yourself.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Is that correct? That's right.

22:10.000 --> 22:21.000
And nobody could have given you an order to do it, except the Secretary of Defense himself or somebody in this department who he had delegated that responsibility and had so told you.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Is that correct? Yes sir.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
Did the President ever tell you that he was delegating any authority with respect to this situation?

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
Do any members of the staff who were at that meeting?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
He did not.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
Did the Secretary of Defense ever tell you that he was delegating any authority to any member of the group? Is that meeting?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
He did not.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
And therefore, if Mr. Adams acted based on that, he could only act.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
He could only act on the your direct order.

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
That's right. Although he could take advice from anybody in the administrative side of the government.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Correct.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Is that correct? That's right.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
No more questions, Mr. Jim.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Mr. Welch.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Madam, Madam McGrassi, Mr. Comon.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
No, Mr. Secretary, I have a few brief questions.

23:12.000 --> 23:21.000
You said that no one except you could give orders to Mr. Adams to propose charges and answer to Senator Slaming from question.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
My question now is, did you give those orders to Mr. Adams?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Yes. As I specified, Madam McGrassi.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Did you or did you not?

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
I was, I was, I was a country at the time the meeting first place.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
So I did not ask for that particular time issue in order.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
No, then who did, that's the question.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Who did give the order or makes the suggestion?

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
Mr. Adams, give it a suggestion, yes, the time.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Who made the suggestion to give the order?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I think I'll have to ask Mr. Adams.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Can I have your first release in the next week?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
The one you read in the record this morning.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Yes, thank you very much.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I think you can.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Will you answer that in the next week?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Now I have the question right, I don't care.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
The party will repeat the question, please.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Now then, who did, that is the question.

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
Who did give the order or make the suggestion to Mr. Adams if it is a suggestion and the act of the party?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Who made the suggestion or gave the order?

24:39.000 --> 24:48.000
I think, I think that Mr. Adams acts as usually his own judgment, acted on his own while I was away.

24:48.000 --> 24:55.000
Have you heard that he did get advice from a conference of the point of view?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
How do you ever went?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I was there, I don't think I've heard that.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Seven years of papers.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Well, I didn't save the papers.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Well, I didn't save the papers.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Well, I didn't read because he went to a conference of the point of view.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
Well, that's the Attorney General's Office, the big department.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Change the question. Did you hear that he went to the Attorney General's Office?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Oh, yes, I did.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Not the White House.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
All right, at the meeting in which there was presence, the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General,

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
the White House, the State of the Advisory, the Ambassador of the UN,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
did you know about that?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yes, sir.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
Did you hear that he got his advice there for the preparation of the charges?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
No, sir.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Did you read him a paper that he had gotten to the suggestion?

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, that wasn't necessarily a fact, rather than a paper.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Well, did you read it?

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
Were you curious enough, Mr. Adams, to see them to read his papers?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yes, sir.

25:53.000 --> 26:00.000
Before you came here this morning, did you read his testimony to see whether or not?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
No, I did not read the testimony.

26:02.000 --> 26:11.000
So as a bit moment, at the time we should be press release, you had not read the testimony

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
of what occurred to the point of view, or that the Justice Department of Conference, Mr. Adams,

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
had informed me of long time ago with respect to that meeting.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
So then as of the time you made the press release, saying that you own or responsible

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
for something without effect, you knew that the charges were prepared as a result of a conference,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
with point of view?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
No, I did not know that.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Do you know it now?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
No, sir.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Well, tell Tillerson what you do now.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
What do you want?

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Is that it?

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Who's it, Mr. President?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
What is the question?

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
To tell us what you do know about this now.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I assume that you have enough curiosity on this.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
To find out point of view, or some will, may it be in charges?

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
You tell us now there were no in your order.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You tell us now, I did not say that.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
We talk about the laborism, then where are the on your order?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Please charge it.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Yes, sir.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
They were in your order?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Yes, sir.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
When were the order?

27:16.000 --> 27:24.000
The order was, I don't know, the exact date of it, but sometime following my return from the faries,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
was it a written order or a verbal order?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Verbal?

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
Did I read your testimony to you, Mr. Secretary, and see if you want to change your answer?

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
In 1959, in 1949.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Who decided to prepare it?

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
Mr. Secretary, the question, who decided to prepare it?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Some of them are currently here.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Answered.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
I don't know who decided to prepare it.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
I know that Hensel got in touch with me, and asked me to see Mr. Brown,

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
and discuss these matters with him when I did not, and I did not.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
I assume that Mr. Hensel was probably acting in reporters of the Secretary of Defense.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I do not know.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Some of them are currently here.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
These charges were put out in tribal army charges or something without a fight.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
You were the Secretary of the Army when they were put out.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
There's obvious that it's not.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
The evils that is right.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Did you order them put out?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
No, sir.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
I did not order them put out.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Now, which is true?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
When that true is your testimony, it's their true.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
They responsibility for these charges being put out as mine, completely.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
You just told me you ordered them put out Mr. Secretary.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
It's mine or did you not?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
It's mine, yes, sir.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I did.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
When did you order them put out?

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Well, we sent them up to the committee here.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
I think it was on the tenth of March.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
Did you, when did you order them put out?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Well, that's right.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
I can't tell you exactly what day, sometimes following my return from the far east.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Mr. Secretary, you were in the rules.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
When you testified the last time.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I was in the rules today.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
The last time I said, did you order them put out?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Your answer no, sir.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I did not order them put out.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Today, the question was finished.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I wait a minute.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Wait a minute.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Did you finish the question today?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Today, I say, did you order them put out?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
You say, yes, sir.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
I did order them put out.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Well, maybe I must understand what you mean by put out.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
Now, if you mean by put out published, I did not put them out.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
If you mean furnished to the members of this committee and other members of the council?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Yes, I did that.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It's my responsibility.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Did you order them put the members of the council?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Yes.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
When did you order them?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I think it was on the 10th of March.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
And the far east you knew no one in the executive and anything you do was on?

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
Well, as I said, I conferred with the Department of Defense officials.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
You referred to this other meeting of the 21st.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
Certainly, there was consultation and bias.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
But the responsibility is mine.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
But you did get advice from the executive.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
You get advice from the executive?

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Yes.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
You read it correctly in the order that you tried to do.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Well, that's right.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
I talked to Mr. Brown and Mr. Hensel's office.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Does that extend?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Yes.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Talk to Mr. Hensel too.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
Did you get advice from anyone in the executive department?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Well, I think so.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
I can get the department.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
Other than the witnesses, I tell them Mr. Hensel is the Brown.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Very likely, there.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Food.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
I...

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Food.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
That's it.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
I'll see you in the next one.

30:52.000 --> 30:59.000
Mr. Chavin, the question of course is the intention of the executive order.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
On the west of the testimony, which is the criminal tribute.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
Those are the calls of the sheriff under the ban on the interpretation.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
It's a bias to certain members of the executive department.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Not others.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
But the responsibility of the making the interpretation is to ensure it.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Well, could I have the question, Red Sley?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Sure.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
When you read the question again.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Food.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Food.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Food.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I'd like to have the one to handle that, Red Sley.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Maybe we better go back a little further from the ground.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
I think that's it.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
I ask you to go to the executive department.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
And I ask you if you have the responsibility to try to solve it.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I told you that I had bought...
