WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
was to be made available for familiar work, work of those committees, and for no other

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
purpose.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Her body is not in a fairly dischanged, satisfactory, instructional ideas for general law.

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
Did you know the private shines as the long weekend walk just by a Christmas?

00:28.000 --> 00:43.000
I've heard that since the beginning of the party evening and evening and Sunday night at this time, just around about 5pm, if you don't know the prior

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
time, I would try and have the long weekend of the year to come and give it.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Thank you very much.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Thank you, Pat.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I think it's very important for you to fight for it.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Yes, I've had a great important point about it.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
One I made before, I made the point, but council officials not testify to fight for their dispute.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I've been trying to make sure that it's not an incident.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
When council, I mean, you know, council employees.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I know it's been a burden, I know the pressure council is on this.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
But when council officials, did you know, did you learn certain facts, were ignorant?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
That means that using a right thing, they were ignorant.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Now, the only thing the secretary could have learned was the charges up to a right to a man.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I did it to part of order.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I was perhaps in there and leaving out the word allegedly.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I would try to inform that here.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
When you've learned on this, I'm going to try to challenge allegedly to not kick off the long weekend during the Thanksgiving series.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I learned that, my dear.

01:51.000 --> 02:02.000
I hope you will learn not if the leaders before take the highest of personnel will take off the weekend of Thanksgiving.

02:02.000 --> 02:13.000
And with remain on duty, the weekend of Christmas and the other high will take off with remain on duty during the Thanksgiving weekend and take off during Christmas.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Is that a knock attack?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't know, sir, I couldn't testify on that.

02:20.000 --> 02:31.000
Do you know whether or not, tragic shine, and I don't assume that it is a reason that you know that he took the long weekend of holiday?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
I heard later that he was off.

02:34.000 --> 02:44.000
Mr. Secretary, I would like to do whether or not General Ryan, who is recommending also a four-fix as we understand it.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
Committee, you might go over otherwise from time to time with reference to private chat.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I don't think he did, no sir.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
You know, he's a committee chief of the Seattle.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
He did?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
You were going far and far and far, that's all.

02:58.000 --> 03:14.000
I know that I heard that General Ryan was having difficulty with the case of private chat.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
I didn't hear any of the details that have been referred to here this morning, Mr. Duncan.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
He's no longer enough.

03:22.000 --> 03:31.000
Mr. Adams, by the way of the case with the committee, counter-run the signals of General Ryan.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
And we'll let the General Ryan to permit this special treatment for private chat.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
No sir, I don't know that.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
We'll be involved with Mr. Adams.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Mr. General Ryan, to permit these parties, these weekend.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm so worried.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
No sir, I don't.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
For what?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
When a person is being filed by a dear, no more?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
No, I don't.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Mr. Adams, you're looking for a committee chief of the committee.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Mr. Adams, here you go.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
Mr. Adams, tell me, from time to time that he has talked with General Ryan, or one of the staff down there, just but...

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
I have a very limited knowledge of these things that you're talking about until a long time after they happen.

04:15.000 --> 04:30.000
Mr. Secretary, these special distance relations for China, if they were any of the important things to do in the other place, will they not have parted in?

04:31.000 --> 04:45.000
For the purpose of the TSU, the commission of the county, and the unit came to this very meeting from the federal investigation of the human location of the rich department.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Absolutely and completely not.

04:48.000 --> 04:59.000
My instruction was that private China was to be made available for committee work, and for committee work along, provided it did not interfere with this claim.

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
That was as a sample, instruction, the capital to carry out, and it would have absolutely nothing to do with.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
I think it's not anything else in connection with this committee except to make it available for committee work, just for committee needed.

05:14.000 --> 05:24.000
Mr. Steven, you have to decide that it looks to the burden of the state, and it will be for two-hour hours with the full amount of on-off to the 20th.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Mr. Steven, is that correct? Yes, sir?

05:26.000 --> 05:35.000
I need to let these people know that the whole situation by officers and other personnel are full days on after the plane.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
That's correct, Mr. Steven.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yes, sir?

05:38.000 --> 05:48.000
I need to let all of them know that statement you made in the presence of some 20-odd men to Mr. Steven, called on my attention.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
What he is concerned with is the policy or not.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
That I have to be especially missected.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
The police can make the border or not on October 21st.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
The day I do the good monmer of use of it, in which Mr. Coles' name is being directed.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
When they're not on the CCTV, they are October 21st.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
You call David Shion, for any purpose.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
My recollection is, he called me.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Where were you when he called?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
In my office.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
30, Shion.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I don't know where he was, but take this to New York.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Watch this.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Watch this, he called me to get all of his information.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
I can't recall all the details of everything I've been talking about.

06:40.000 --> 06:49.000
Coming up, I found that the pilot that's David Shion was not happy about his work coming in the direction.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
And when he was in the direction of David Shion, what he called me was what he called me.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I recollection first clearly, he called me.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I found a certain amount.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
You're not very interested in that, sir.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And it is.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
The pilot's doing his job.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Who was not ready to be armed with all this?

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
You're saying, how are you doing with the subject?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
I mean, the high-speed and low-speed, the armed.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
But you're not ready, I'm not going to find further.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
The pilot, as you were saying, he was not happy over his perfect obedience.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
That is it. That's what you're saying with the subject?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I'm not sure about some, but I'm not sure.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
For you, that most of you.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
That's the pilot.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
A pilot is still.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
A pilot is still.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
I do, but you're not ready.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
From Mr. Jenkins, I was the highest officer in the army.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And take up your valuable time.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
And since you're not ready, you're not the first reason you can buy me this.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You're not ready to leave this place.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
That's my recollection.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, I wish to you that the week is right on 14th of October when I was in New York.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
But I have quite a discussion with David Shine, riding down town with him and his car.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
And that I have attempted to say this to get over today.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
The opportunity that was really here to come in at the time, me and so do you, David.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
And this is all here. This call, a list call, and shine to you in New York, sitting on my foot a couple of hours.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
That you think you're nothing but take it on on November 6th.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
That's great at that time.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
And as I was calling the 30th statement, I was immediately.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
But you do not know anymore, not now, for this coming.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
Whether or not on November 6th, you think you should have as one of you.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I was living in the place.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I think the arrangements were made by members of my staff.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I cannot testify on exactly who was invited.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
What's that news at the time of my father here?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Mr. Cohen, we're coming and nothing.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I knew him, Mr. Carl is coming.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Now, where is Dave Shine?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
I only have a member of the staff.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
My name is Dave and I don't actually know at this time.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
The lady says, you need to start a little cheer on November 6th.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
There is a patient chair at the table.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I just keep going.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't think you like the shine of the lady with me.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
But you don't like the smell of the lady.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I don't think that's the call I make and share.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
But that is the reason for the call.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't think you like the shine of the lady.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I don't recall.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I did not recall having made any best statement.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Well, I think you first have a recollection about it.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I just write a letter.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I did not.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
But I cannot part of the statement.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I don't want to request to this committee.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
And I, I think Mr. Secretary, to read this in the letter,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
to report in word about the reason before I begin,

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
by holding my final 40th generation of the Secretary.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Secretary, I need you to write this.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm going to write this.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm going to put it on the table.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I'm going to put it on the table.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
We all have office of that.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I have one there, moment of order.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
I've not just been provided for members of the committee.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I know that he didn't provide the chair.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
We all have a moment of question.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I will ask this committee.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
There is just one copy.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Make sure five is informed by the Secretary of the Committee

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
that there is only one large-scale chair available.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
No, you.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm not going to comment on it.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
But there is one more chair available.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
They are available.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
We have a meeting.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm going to put it on the table.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I don't know.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
I don't think so.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't think so.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I don't know.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't know.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I don't know.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I don't know.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
You know, is there an office of our chair?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
You have a standing.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
That is the meeting.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
The governor in view of the circumstances under this 48-day

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
statement was left with the...

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
of the USA's pages.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
The authority.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
The charge of the public examination of the public.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
I would...

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I would not say to the imposter.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
I only thought it's fair to find out the purpose for which the paper would hand it to.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
sorrow.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
fit.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
I...

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
I do not know whether or not this witness rather be the officer if possible or not.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I had...

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
For the first gear I am going so never give a witties.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I have no babysitter on my own.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Would you like work?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
No.

12:58.000 --> 12:58.000


12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Look at that.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Is the sevenon cubed by three.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Now's talking to the one Lovey- shorts and those chairs over there.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Turn them out with the stays fair.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
This manager hasfrigged eight point for eight of eight-year wage쓰!!

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Up for the ladies to choose a seat by the car.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Get the seat to the seat.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Mr. Allen, with the ladies who can finally move to the time to go out of room.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Give you that.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
He had just gone to the front of the seat.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
The front of the front of the car and then I had come.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I suppose you'll be all in take.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
What's in my bag?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
We find out now is not what the seat gives me.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
But that is not what it is.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Mr. Allen is especially sweet.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
For the ladies to be able to move to the car.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
At four times of information to be true about.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
20th of the time to move to the second car.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
See how it is.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Okay.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
May I ask you one other question?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Mr. C. L. P. Sir.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
You guys know.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And that is it.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Before we're in our statement.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It's true.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Being in written statement.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
All the power will be gathered.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
On the river in the middle of the yellow line.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
So it will be from 40.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
And to the other road from the front committee's tower.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
Far along the end type of shines with the impact of the human being.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I hope to the target area of an hour.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
And this is the first time that I have 15 years to see me.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
In fact, you have the full confidence here to me.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Here's the question, let's go ahead and keep the resource line.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.860
5, 8,8,4, 156,8,4, 156,8,9,

14:39.860 --> 14:42.860
OK, this hand wants to go and slide.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.060
Where's the prize?

14:44.060 --> 14:45.840
4, 156,1848,

14:45.840 --> 14:48.840
454, 151000,

14:48.840 --> 14:52.660
32 Program.

14:54.160 --> 14:58.060
54, 188,

14:58.060 --> 15:01.180
158

15:01.460 --> 15:03.240
Question run,

15:03.240 --> 15:06.440
hello, the crown doesn't matter.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.240
ヒラ 98.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.600
Shatter.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.960
I can start,

15:11.960 --> 15:13.600
learning about that.

15:13.600 --> 15:26.080
interesting the

15:26.080 --> 15:28.820
direction that he competition

15:28.820 --> 15:31.060
specify at

15:31.100 --> 15:42.560
on

15:42.560 --> 15:46.340
a

15:46.340 --> 15:53.420
way into

15:53.420 --> 16:15.700
pandemic

16:15.700 --> 16:19.420
understandцию

16:19.420 --> 16:28.520
wisdom

16:28.520 --> 16:36.340
hospitals

16:36.340 --> 16:39.540
pretty

16:39.540 --> 16:46.540
I did that I said provided it was in connection with the business of its committee.

16:46.540 --> 16:53.540
Now Mr. Stevens that is all I ask you if the request is a committee to reach your

16:53.540 --> 16:54.540
report.

16:54.540 --> 17:00.540
First I have a dime specifically for the years for the committee and those who will be

17:00.540 --> 17:01.540
to the committee.

17:01.540 --> 17:07.540
If the short report is out with a hundred ahead of four months of case that is not the

17:07.540 --> 17:10.540
responsibility of Senator Jackson.

17:10.540 --> 17:14.540
Prepare by whom I miss that cake.

17:14.540 --> 17:18.540
It is prepared by members of my staff.

17:18.540 --> 17:23.540
I cannot identify them too if you want the information I don't have the right to move

17:23.540 --> 17:24.540
myself.

17:24.540 --> 17:31.540
So after the start of the second decade as I have published the committee 30,000

17:31.540 --> 17:36.540
months and 40 have been suspended since the 19th of all the 19th 33.

17:36.540 --> 17:43.540
I will be very sure you have been suspended by the 30th month power.

17:43.540 --> 17:50.540
The pilot staff of its very small case will give us power to restore the community with

17:50.540 --> 17:51.540
both the children.

17:51.540 --> 17:52.540
Why?

17:52.540 --> 17:57.540
Restores the non-span for the community having further investigation.

17:57.540 --> 17:58.540
Now resign.

17:58.540 --> 17:59.540
3.

17:59.540 --> 18:00.540
Still under suspension.

18:00.540 --> 18:01.540
22.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.540
Are the complicated cases still under suspension?

18:02.540 --> 18:03.540
15 of them.

18:03.540 --> 18:10.540
The first time securing a hearing board.

18:10.540 --> 18:15.540
And these cases have been forwarded for the larger pilot of the hearing board.

18:15.540 --> 18:21.540
So the office of the second hearing board for finalist position.

18:21.540 --> 18:27.540
The two categories are the types of cases we will review due by the security of your board,

18:27.540 --> 18:34.540
namely cases in which available determination was released by the hearing board.

18:34.540 --> 18:40.540
I came into planning hearing board based on unsavable determination and in which the pilot

18:40.540 --> 18:45.540
he has reflected is further reviewed by the security review board.

18:45.540 --> 18:50.540
Whereas hearing board means the unsavable determination and the employee has not been

18:50.540 --> 18:57.540
requested to review by the security review board.

18:57.540 --> 19:01.540
It is here you will be made in the office of the second hearing unit, whether or not

19:01.540 --> 19:04.540
with the steps of recommendation of the hearing board.

19:04.540 --> 19:08.540
Till the name is indicated without a point to your life, children will be heard.

19:08.540 --> 19:13.540
It is an independent case that is first time in security hearing board will expose all

19:13.540 --> 19:16.540
the cases during the next month.

19:16.540 --> 19:22.540
An analysis of the carry-in issue to the employees still under suspension.

19:22.540 --> 19:27.540
Discovers are indicated more than one item of derogatory information was reported.

19:27.540 --> 19:34.540
The allocation may be up to 22 individuals, ranging to barriers, fundraising,

19:34.540 --> 19:39.540
although one of the spendgators has memberships in the Congress parties.

19:39.540 --> 19:45.540
One of those two cases involved was carried in 1930 to 34th floor,

19:45.540 --> 19:51.540
to balance the security regulations and accurately those authorities and managers

19:51.540 --> 19:56.540
indicated multiple pound of legitimacy on the point of majority.

19:56.540 --> 20:02.540
Some of the types of information that is in the portal are set for it to roll.

20:02.540 --> 20:06.540
If a few of them are there, many of these cases, there are a lot of derogatory information

20:06.540 --> 20:11.540
that is far from the unknown and there is information that has not been prepared.

20:11.540 --> 20:16.540
A, has memberships in authorizations, cited by the Attorney General,

20:16.540 --> 20:18.540
has prominent or supported.

20:18.540 --> 20:25.540
The Association of Reconciliation, who has enacted an economist party,

20:25.540 --> 20:29.540
or has been authorizations, cited by the Attorney General,

20:29.540 --> 20:34.540
has been authorizing memberships or affiliations with authorizations,

20:34.540 --> 20:41.540
including for a file which has been required to be 100 nominated for control,

20:41.540 --> 20:48.540
these are self-fulfilling with relevant reporting to be acted in common of the payers.

20:48.540 --> 20:55.540
These, 90% of the nominated recipients or other citizens are considered by the nominee.

20:55.540 --> 21:02.540
Ed, description to the daily wearer of other commoners publications.

21:02.540 --> 21:07.540
It may be a hint to relate the action cited by the timing and the paid file

21:07.540 --> 21:10.540
and cases under the Judgment File Committee.

21:10.540 --> 21:16.540
On the 30th floor, the employees involved, 25 and 38 by the committee,

21:16.540 --> 21:21.540
are 25 with the spend and price periods of the bottom order.

21:21.540 --> 21:30.540
19 of all of us won 29 September, four and a very strong 48 who would not call by the committee

21:30.540 --> 21:39.540
with all of the spend and of 29 September, are so rich 19, that will allow us won 25.

21:39.540 --> 21:45.540
Not to be interviewed to a 48-month employment after timely call before the committee

21:45.540 --> 21:50.540
to announce the Fifth Amendment, will be expected 19 employees who are presented

21:50.540 --> 21:52.540
during the month of October.

21:52.540 --> 21:56.540
The annual rate has derived from the ultimate achievement of every case.

21:56.540 --> 22:02.540
The rate of the implementation towards spending, these 19 cases in common with many of us,

22:02.540 --> 22:08.540
were the part of the real examination as required by 75 hours of federal lawyers,

22:08.540 --> 22:12.540
10,460 of April 20th of a 19 certain three,

22:12.540 --> 22:17.540
and the boys who are involved with the committee and the citizens of these 19 individuals

22:17.540 --> 22:20.540
have been made available to the party.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.540
No significant item of the rightful information,

22:23.540 --> 22:28.540
but the double-sided measure is from now already known to remain active at the party.

22:28.540 --> 22:34.540
In one official case, the committee gives it all up to certain derived information

22:34.540 --> 22:38.540
of a minor measure with the maximum of the early part of the party.

22:38.540 --> 22:42.540
The spending will occur in the afternoon with the date of one improvement

22:42.540 --> 22:48.540
or early development by a part of federal investigation and by the last of that

22:48.540 --> 22:53.540
and the part of the committee is made by the boy who was born in the early 30s.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.540
Because all these cases are the part of the last year chairman,

22:56.540 --> 22:59.540
I have been chairman, which is a part of the final meeting in action

22:59.540 --> 23:02.540
with the New York evidence and regulating the law,

23:02.540 --> 23:04.540
I'm a Richard Ridingan doctor.

23:04.540 --> 23:06.540
We all must take the power of it,

23:06.540 --> 23:10.540
where the rightful information is today to create it out,

23:10.540 --> 23:13.540
to apply some further to the new slide of the family,

23:13.540 --> 23:18.540
or apply some announcement to the work and to try to capture the classified information

23:18.540 --> 23:23.540
until the 30-minute early final will not be identified as an element.

23:23.540 --> 23:29.540
In every case, the effective work has on the effective work of new people.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.540
Through the high-level trial,

23:31.540 --> 23:35.540
by the end of the day, I am the one who is currently in power with power and power.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.540
The end of the day is Mr. Chairman.

23:38.540 --> 23:40.540
And in the caveat, I know that one of my lawyers,

23:40.540 --> 23:41.540
Chairman, I just do it.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.540
I'm not sure about it.

23:43.540 --> 23:44.540
I'm totally unique.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.540
Secretary, Secretary, I'm out for my money, I like it.

23:46.540 --> 23:51.540
I just have this good, I have one of the categories that you run with the secretary,

23:51.540 --> 23:54.540
which you cover, which is a little bit of a spend on the right-wing.

23:54.540 --> 24:00.540
So you can prove that the removal of our class is a secret to me that I have a right.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.540
I'm not sure about it, but I'll tell you on that.

24:02.540 --> 24:06.540
You've new regulations, you've read the information,

24:06.540 --> 24:08.540
you've really been trying to provide it.

24:08.540 --> 24:11.540
I have a message to make obvious statements,

24:11.540 --> 24:13.540
and then you will have a new dollar to read it.

24:13.540 --> 24:15.540
I'll text you out of the text.

24:15.540 --> 24:17.540
You'll have other things with the secretary,

24:17.540 --> 24:19.540
I think you'll have other things with you.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.540
I think you have another copy of the pair now, I'll tell you.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.540
Chairman, I have a charge for sure.

24:23.540 --> 24:25.540
I'll make sure we have something new in the future.

24:25.540 --> 24:26.540
You run in the future.

24:26.540 --> 24:29.540
You'll ask it, I just want to know where an argument is.

24:29.540 --> 24:32.540
I'll tell you that first, for the one of the guys who raised one.

24:32.540 --> 24:37.540
Yes, I'll tell you the removal of a secret material in the red-eyed lab.

24:37.540 --> 24:41.540
Chairman, that property comes up to the handing of close examination

24:41.540 --> 24:44.540
and signs of a highly-well-undoubtedly-allity,

24:44.540 --> 24:46.540
of the G2D-disrupted sub-divisor,

24:46.540 --> 24:48.540
of the Red-O-Saturday Night, just a minute, just a minute,

24:48.540 --> 24:50.540
just a minute, I just want to know what you said.

24:50.540 --> 24:54.540
Did you manage to tie it up to the state of Santa MacArthur?

24:54.540 --> 24:55.540
They both were sanctioned about.

24:55.540 --> 24:58.540
Chairman, did you include the financial office statement?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.540
I think you have to answer yourself.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.540
I think you have to carry the service of the area,

25:02.540 --> 25:03.540
if that's your type,

25:03.540 --> 25:06.540
who now has too many more consultations on their role.

25:06.540 --> 25:09.540
Now, I was supposed to trust the idea of leaving 50,000,

25:09.540 --> 25:12.540
so the waitations of two very terminal.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.540
Thank you.
