WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
in this day of the hearings as just the guy.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.880
Secretary of the Army Stevens, again on the weapon stand,

00:39.880 --> 00:41.880
there's some speculation as to whether the committee

00:41.880 --> 00:45.280
will be able to finish with Mr. Stevens today, if so.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.640
The next weapon is tomorrow is expected to be John Adams,

00:49.640 --> 00:51.680
the Department of the Army counselor,

00:51.680 --> 00:54.840
who is one of the principals in this controversy

00:54.840 --> 00:56.080
with Senator McCarthy.

00:56.080 --> 00:56.920
All of us.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.160
Senator Muim, the acting chairman of the Senate

01:00.160 --> 01:04.440
investigating subcommittee, I just call the session

01:04.440 --> 01:07.680
to order has been making a couple of announcements.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.680
So let's turn to the chairman's seat at this time.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.880
Any members?

01:13.880 --> 01:17.600
Level there in the rockatories directly at the point of issue.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.200
And I think we'll move in the direction of speeding the hearings,

01:21.200 --> 01:22.960
which is certainly an eventuality,

01:22.960 --> 01:27.120
which all members of the committee equally share.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.860
So now let me ask you first of all,

01:30.860 --> 01:34.640
Mr. Secretary, after refreshing your memory

01:34.640 --> 01:37.640
and giving us new thoughts and solving

01:37.640 --> 01:41.040
with whoever you don't should consult last night,

01:42.040 --> 01:46.880
whether you prefer to add just any specific allegations

01:46.880 --> 01:49.720
of him's offer conduct,

01:49.720 --> 01:53.200
or those which you had made in survival, Mr. Carter.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.920
And if the chair is correct in his memory at the moment,

01:56.920 --> 01:59.160
those allegations are twofold.

02:00.400 --> 02:05.480
One, that he sat in the presence of the senator

02:05.480 --> 02:08.880
and the ordinance before when they were talking to you

02:08.880 --> 02:11.960
about China and did nothing to stop them

02:11.960 --> 02:14.280
from talking to you about China.

02:14.280 --> 02:17.520
And the other that you object to a statement

02:17.520 --> 02:21.680
which he made in the memoranda, which has been printed.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.400
And since the memoranda were printed,

02:23.400 --> 02:27.360
it's subsequent to your original 34 charges of violation.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.440
You have that with not one of the allegations

02:29.440 --> 02:32.400
you were making against Mr. Carter, original.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.280
Now, will you answer the question from whatever data

02:35.280 --> 02:38.160
and the reference you may have been able to gather

02:38.160 --> 02:42.040
from the on-demo agent, specifically concerning Mr. Carter,

02:42.040 --> 02:45.720
both before and after the induction of private shine,

02:45.720 --> 02:47.280
and I shall ask you the same questions

02:47.280 --> 02:50.920
from Shining-Centen and McCrathy and Mr. Carter.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.880
Mr. Chairman, you have asked me to summarize

02:54.880 --> 02:58.040
and segregate my testimony with respect

02:58.040 --> 03:01.920
to the improv of means which were, to my knowledge,

03:01.920 --> 03:05.000
used by Frank Caw, executive director

03:05.000 --> 03:07.480
of the staff of the subcommittee,

03:07.480 --> 03:12.000
to obtain preferential treatment for a G-David Chan.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.600
Yesterday, I stated in substance,

03:14.600 --> 03:17.200
that if the only evidence produced in these hearings

03:17.200 --> 03:20.920
against Mr. Carter was he's turned up to my office

03:20.920 --> 03:25.920
on a provost act of 1953, I will put it if I was just.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.800
However, I believe that before these hearings are concluded,

03:31.800 --> 03:34.640
substantial evidence implicating Mr. Carter,

03:37.200 --> 03:39.680
in the course of time that pursued by Senator McCaw,

03:39.680 --> 03:42.320
the endist staff, will be brought forward.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.000
In addition, I do not believe that if it's possible,

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
you'll find it right.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.400
Yes, I'm one of what it was determined.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.480
I just like interrupting the secretary,

03:51.480 --> 03:56.720
but since one of the very important matters

03:56.720 --> 03:58.640
to decide about the committee is probably not

03:58.640 --> 04:01.640
the secretary's memory is correct

04:01.640 --> 04:03.280
when he recites us, recites us,

04:03.280 --> 04:06.400
Ghana, months ago, I think of his crop

04:06.400 --> 04:11.120
on now to show that after he's expressing his recollection

04:11.120 --> 04:13.040
of the last night that he's still

04:13.040 --> 04:17.120
retestifying from memory, he is now reading

04:17.120 --> 04:20.040
to my doctor about how that's going to declare in the record.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.280
I think that's proper, and I'll do that to show

04:22.280 --> 04:24.640
that that isn't according to the fact that the record is

04:24.640 --> 04:25.960
absolutely correct.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.240
You may continue to read, I worked on it.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.480
It's very good.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.280
Very good.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.480
This is your document with you preparing yourself.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.480
Mr. Secretary.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.840
In compenetour, my counsel, company with you, doctor.

04:36.840 --> 04:44.520
Will you be in addition, I do not believe that it's possible

04:44.520 --> 04:49.680
to segregate Mr. Carr's conduct from bad news associates.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.960
However, I was a question which you must

04:51.960 --> 04:54.440
call him at least a thought.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.680
Mr. Carr pulled on me with Mr. Roy calling on our 4th

04:57.680 --> 05:00.120
second 1953.

05:00.120 --> 05:03.080
When they were in my office that day,

05:03.080 --> 05:06.680
I considered that they was there for a common purpose.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.040
And that Mr. Carr was faced with on the half of Sean.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.160
That was Mr. Carr's approval.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.480
As I have said before, Mr. Carr did most

05:15.480 --> 05:19.760
of the talking on this occasion, as well as on others.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.000
But at no time during the conversation,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.800
did Mr. Carr take exception to Mr. Carr's action?

05:25.800 --> 05:28.520
Or in any way, it has to disassociate himself

05:28.520 --> 05:32.840
from the subject of the special assignment for Mr. Sean.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.320
It's a very fast, but he was the executive director

05:36.320 --> 05:39.680
of the subcommittee's fire and did not object,

05:39.680 --> 05:42.840
and now it's not for the convenience of the subcommittee

05:42.840 --> 05:44.920
to make a special assignment for one

05:44.920 --> 05:47.720
of the support, one of his supporters.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.520
That's me with a definite question that he fully

05:50.520 --> 05:54.040
concurred in Mr. Carr's position.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.280
Mr. Carr, Mr. Truman, you're a pilot.

05:58.280 --> 06:02.600
Is this a new theory of guilt by fellow employees?

06:02.600 --> 06:04.600
I think that's a proper question for the subject

06:04.600 --> 06:06.840
of the interviewer asking he's on top.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.440
I would appreciate it if no experience

06:10.440 --> 06:13.400
to close the unless we have to counsel points

06:13.400 --> 06:16.200
of origin would be made to interrupt the interagency

06:16.200 --> 06:17.840
of the time the relevant to engage.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.360
We'll be the subject of that.

06:19.360 --> 06:19.880
Mr. Chairman.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.280
Finally, what is the little bit of an assay of a...

06:23.280 --> 06:26.600
There's no one who feels more strongly about us going on.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.280
I can assure you there will be no interruptions.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.040
And last but not least, I think it's important.

06:31.040 --> 06:31.880
Thank you, man.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.120
I do think it's important now to make a point of order

06:34.120 --> 06:38.720
that the secretary is trying to impute guilt

06:38.720 --> 06:41.080
by his violence, Mr. Carr.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.200
I will cover it in my cross-examination.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.600
I don't have to tell everyone.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.840
Let's check it out.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.280
I never thought that would be correct.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.480
If we're all going to make speeches,

06:50.480 --> 06:53.840
then I'm going to reserve the right to make one too directly.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.000
Now, I hope we can proceed with the expedition

06:58.000 --> 07:00.720
of the business of hand, but this interrupt

07:00.720 --> 07:05.480
that's to make speeches is not calculated

07:05.480 --> 07:09.680
to expedite the hearing of Mr. Carr.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.880
I've been chairing what it means with the dismissal

07:11.880 --> 07:13.080
of Mr. Herrmann and the McClellan.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.000
And I think that the last point of order

07:15.000 --> 07:18.120
is that the time that the European is made

07:18.120 --> 07:20.560
is to tell what have to discontinue the practice

07:20.560 --> 07:23.840
of recognizing time to show a council on close to work.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.160
Mr. Carr, we have an misleading responsibility

07:26.160 --> 07:28.560
to complete the fair of the patient.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.120
If the letter is a bunch of letters,

07:30.120 --> 07:32.280
I'm sure the councilman's done it.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.880
And no one else from the following case

07:33.880 --> 07:36.600
back down to have some report idea at least

07:36.600 --> 07:38.520
by the father's order actually hits.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.480
Mr. Carr, I'm in the company.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.920
Mr. Carr, I'm in the office.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.160
I do intend to interrupt.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.560
Whenever I find a place with dishonesty

07:48.560 --> 07:51.400
in the part of a witness, but at that point of order

07:51.400 --> 07:53.600
and outfit, Mr. Carr moves me out of the car.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.440
If you were out of the room, then I don't have time.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.720
You may not, because you rules of the committee

07:58.720 --> 08:01.680
are very clear that there ought to be no interruptions

08:01.680 --> 08:04.040
at any time except on points of order

08:04.040 --> 08:06.520
dealing with relevancy and matured of it.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.120
We are equally clear that the senator

08:08.120 --> 08:10.920
will have his turn at last for 10 minutes,

08:10.920 --> 08:13.840
but he can ask the question that he thinks should be asked.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.640
Mr. Carr, we have Mr. Senator Kim Jeren

08:15.640 --> 08:17.880
as the right to ask the question to the council.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.920
He wanted to have asked, and to get the answers he desired.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.760
Mr. Carr, on the chair, does that propose

08:22.760 --> 08:24.440
to be interrupted by points of order,

08:24.440 --> 08:27.240
which are not in fact the right to question.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.080
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.600
Mr. Pointer, on the other hand, I am back to watching

08:33.600 --> 08:36.800
to my thoughts with the office rules.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.600
I didn't know, as we adopted a rule,

08:40.600 --> 08:44.480
that a senator just firmly bring up the point of order.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.320
I thought that when we wanted to ask the chair,

08:46.320 --> 08:49.960
a question, we had the right to do that.

08:49.960 --> 08:53.000
I can see no reason why we should not

08:53.000 --> 08:53.840
be discussing.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
We have a question.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.000
Mr. Jackson, may I have a chair,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm listening.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.800
You can't listen to both of them once.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.800
I know that the two areas that can listen

09:01.800 --> 09:02.640
to both of them once.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.280
I see no reason why I should clarify.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.200
Mr. Chairman, this will matter of

09:08.200 --> 09:10.160
the amount of importance to me and my staff,

09:10.160 --> 09:12.360
and I don't think anyone can hear us

09:12.360 --> 09:14.920
when you're interrupting unless it's very,

09:14.920 --> 09:15.760
but I do.

09:15.760 --> 09:19.920
I see how you're going to do with the council,

09:19.920 --> 09:21.840
Mr. Bruce.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.920
I do listen to Chairman.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.560
Thank you for the privilege of being with us.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.000
I do think that number one,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I should be able to raise the point of order.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.280
Number two, when I have a question of the chair,

09:37.280 --> 09:38.880
I think it should be able to ask that question.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.240
I sure would say that there will be no questions

09:43.240 --> 09:45.240
and ask unless I think they're important.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.480
But I think we should have a right.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.520
Mr. Chairman, if the chair may respond like you say,

09:49.520 --> 09:52.600
it is quite clear that the rules of our committee

09:52.600 --> 09:55.040
were adopted with meetings of which the senator

09:55.040 --> 09:57.000
was not heard, because he was not

09:57.000 --> 09:59.360
a voting member of the subcommittee.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.160
But the rules of the committee are quite clear.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.560
They have been published.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.960
I'm sure the senator has a copy of it.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.800
All the chair can do is to enforce

10:07.800 --> 10:10.000
that we're adopted unanimously.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.960
They state very specifically that we should rather

10:11.960 --> 10:13.720
clear-cut in.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.960
That there should be no interruptions at any time,

10:15.960 --> 10:18.120
except on points of order.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.120
And the points of order are to be limited to relevancy

10:21.120 --> 10:22.760
and materiality.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.480
So for that reason, the chair feels

10:24.480 --> 10:27.760
that when members of the Senate or a council

10:27.760 --> 10:29.520
is adding interruptions to the point of order,

10:29.520 --> 10:31.080
they can state that point of order.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.840
So we can tell whether or not it is in fact

10:32.840 --> 10:36.280
the point of order to be heard briefly on it

10:36.280 --> 10:38.000
at the pleasure of the chair.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.040
And then the ruling will have to be made.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.160
And if all of us will be trained ourselves accordingly,

10:43.160 --> 10:45.160
we can expedite the hearings.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.080
We think the thing completely fair,

10:47.080 --> 10:50.200
we provided that every member of the Senate

10:50.200 --> 10:53.360
and all of us would have 10 minutes in which he

10:53.360 --> 10:55.520
in-train could receive that interruptions.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.960
And that's that.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.800
Round table of procedure would continue until all

11:00.800 --> 11:02.520
interrogations had been made.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.640
Mr. Chair, Senator Jackson.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.640
Senator Jackson.

11:05.640 --> 11:10.440
I want to commend the chair for the point of order, Mr. Chairman.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.120
All right.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.680
I'll say the point.

11:12.680 --> 11:13.960
If he's ready to commend the chair, please

11:13.960 --> 11:15.160
go ahead and vote for him.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.160
I vote for him.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.160
I vote for him.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.160
I vote for him.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.160
He's a few.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.160
I vote for him.

11:21.160 --> 11:22.160
I vote for him.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.160
I vote for him.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.160
I vote for him.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.160
I vote for him.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.160
I vote for him.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.160
I vote for him.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.160
I vote for him.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.160
You think your fire is going to work on this.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.160
I have no idea.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.160
All of the objections to this.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.800
Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that the

11:38.800 --> 11:40.360
distinguished chairman of the Senate

11:40.360 --> 11:48.360
heard from South Dakota as we stated the rule that apply in

11:48.360 --> 11:49.360
this year.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.360
Am I correct?

11:50.360 --> 11:51.360
That's correct.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.760
And the chair I'm against.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.360
And I hope that those rules will continue to be

11:57.360 --> 12:01.360
adhered to as the chairman has so effectively stated to

12:01.360 --> 12:02.360
me.

12:02.360 --> 12:06.360
I for one want to back him up 100% and say to us that they

12:06.360 --> 12:10.560
are carried out in the interest of expedition of Newter.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.560
Thank you very much.

12:11.560 --> 12:15.560
And the chair will endeavor to do his best.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.160
By the border of underfunded.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.960
I'd like to make it short observation.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.960
And that ends it.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.360
The fine statement you may cannot.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.880
Does not result in these hearings proceeding in the

12:27.880 --> 12:30.560
foiled lay in expeditious fashion.

12:30.560 --> 12:34.960
But when we meet together tomorrow at 10 o'clock, as a

12:34.960 --> 12:38.560
committee would counsel, we discuss changing the rule so

12:38.560 --> 12:41.560
that the hearings can proceed in an orderly fashion.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.560
Mr. Chairman.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.560
Yes, fine.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.960
I'd like to bring forth a point where some of her findings

12:46.960 --> 12:49.760
and doubts suggest that the change of the ground rules that

12:49.760 --> 12:51.560
went through the game.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.160
As the chair will know.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.560
I went through from this committee on a point of someone

12:56.560 --> 12:59.160
to take my place.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.760
On conditions that we adopt certain ground rules of those

13:02.760 --> 13:05.160
rules not to change.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.960
And any attempt to change the ground rules halfway to the

13:08.960 --> 13:10.160
game.

13:10.160 --> 13:14.160
After the clear subject, understanding that with Mr.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.560
Simonton was corrupt, I think would be completely

13:17.560 --> 13:19.760
improper and disunct.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.760
And the chair said that he had no intention at the moment

13:22.760 --> 13:24.560
to change in the ground rules.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.360
He does want to try to make him approach them as big as he

13:27.360 --> 13:30.060
was possible to be allowed to be scared of all parties in

13:30.060 --> 13:31.060
certain.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.960
And one way to make them work effectively is the members of

13:33.960 --> 13:37.260
the committee and counsel will refrain from making any

13:37.260 --> 13:39.360
more points of words than they do at absolutely

13:39.360 --> 13:40.360
attention.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.860
Mr. Chairman.

13:41.860 --> 13:44.660
I would like to make a comment.

13:44.660 --> 13:48.560
It is my understanding that the members of the committee.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.260
But trying to live up to the rules.

13:52.260 --> 13:56.360
If we do live up to the ground rules, they've been called.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.660
As they have been set prior to the start of these hearings,

13:59.760 --> 14:02.960
I am hardly in favor of those ground rules.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.460
There's been an individual or any member of the committee

14:05.460 --> 14:09.960
or anybody else attempts to violate those rules.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.960
And if I may respectfully say so, sir, I believe the

14:13.960 --> 14:17.760
chairman and the committee and the council to take those

14:17.760 --> 14:21.260
necessary to say that the rules are carried out.

14:23.260 --> 14:24.260
I'm pleased with the test.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.460
I mean, I'm sorry.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.060
I'm highly pleased about the question.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.060
I'm glad.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.460
Well, I'm glad to have you.

14:30.460 --> 14:31.460
I'm glad to have you.

14:31.460 --> 14:32.860
We're making a statement here.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.260
But you can make it out.

14:34.260 --> 14:36.260
It's beginning of the paragraph with a sentence.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.660
So we can get the continuity and continue.

14:38.660 --> 14:42.660
So before I do, Mr. Chairman, I say with the very

14:42.660 --> 14:47.560
deepest conviction that I deeply resent the suggestion

14:47.560 --> 14:52.260
by the senator from Wisconsin that the duty is born with us.

14:52.260 --> 14:55.860
I am taking what he called guilty of.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.260
I have a way to resolve this.

14:58.260 --> 14:59.260
I object to that.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.260
I think you should proceed now.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.260
I just need to.

15:03.260 --> 15:09.260
What the car is buried in what transpires during that

15:09.260 --> 15:11.860
conference is a matter of record in Houston, M.M.

15:11.860 --> 15:14.860
and of the state, which has been released by a certain

15:14.860 --> 15:16.260
member of the car.

15:16.260 --> 15:17.860
In that number, M.M.

15:17.860 --> 15:21.860
Mr. Car makes smaller attempts to just associate himself

15:21.860 --> 15:25.260
from Roy Colm or from any part of the discussion of the

15:25.260 --> 15:28.460
Army future of Mr. Sean.

15:28.460 --> 15:33.260
Again, on November 6, 1953, Mr. Car was present in my

15:33.260 --> 15:37.660
office this time with Senator McCarthy and Roy Colm.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.860
The matter and I'm released by Senator McCarthy

15:39.860 --> 15:43.060
concerning this conference again makes no efforts to

15:43.060 --> 15:46.660
disassociate Mr. Car from the others present.

15:46.660 --> 15:49.660
Now, was I given any reason to assume that he was there

15:49.660 --> 15:52.060
for any different purpose?

15:52.060 --> 15:54.660
It was at this conference that a request was made to

15:54.660 --> 15:57.660
make private-shine available for subcommittee business

15:57.660 --> 15:59.860
while at 4.6.

15:59.860 --> 16:03.660
I am not now able to give any exact statement made by

16:03.660 --> 16:06.060
Mr. Car on this occasion.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.860
But I am cleared that the indicators know this approval of

16:08.860 --> 16:12.860
the position taken by Senator McCarthy and by Mr. Colm

16:12.860 --> 16:15.260
with respect to part of the Sean.

16:15.260 --> 16:19.860
And I'm also cleared of Mr. Car in his official capacity as

16:19.860 --> 16:23.260
executive director of the staff of this subcommittee.

16:23.260 --> 16:26.060
If he had not agreed with Senator McCarthy and Mr. Colm

16:26.060 --> 16:28.860
as to the subcommittee's needs for private-shine,

16:28.860 --> 16:31.460
he would have expressed his disagreement.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.260
This he did not do.

16:34.260 --> 16:39.460
My next problem is to call at a luncheon with Senator McCarthy

16:39.460 --> 16:42.860
at the Cal Arms Hotel on December 10.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.660
On this occasion, Senator McCarthy requested that

16:45.660 --> 16:49.460
I assign private-shine to New York City after eight

16:49.460 --> 16:51.660
weeks of basic training.

16:51.660 --> 16:54.660
In order to provide the Sean, Mike, and another thing

16:54.660 --> 16:58.460
the examined textbooks used at West Point.

16:58.460 --> 17:01.460
During this luncheon, Mr. Colm, Mr. Car again remained

17:01.460 --> 17:03.460
relatively silent.

17:03.460 --> 17:06.460
However, I considered that he was present at the request of

17:06.460 --> 17:09.860
Senator McCarthy as executive director of the subcommittee

17:09.860 --> 17:13.460
staff, and again, he expressed no disapproval of what

17:13.460 --> 17:15.260
the senator said.

17:15.260 --> 17:19.260
I considered that all of these acts were part of a pattern

17:19.260 --> 17:24.060
of pressure being exerted under the form of the arm

17:24.060 --> 17:27.660
to obtain special treatment for Mr. Sean.

17:27.660 --> 17:30.260
I am sure that Mr. Carl will be given every opportunity

17:30.260 --> 17:34.260
for the final conduct and to display him any responsibility

17:34.260 --> 17:38.660
for or concurred in the conduct that his associates

17:38.660 --> 17:40.460
if he so does not.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.860
And I think he should be given that opportunity in respect

17:43.860 --> 17:46.660
to each of the occasions on which he is alleged

17:46.660 --> 17:48.460
to have been a participant.

17:48.460 --> 17:49.660
But the unimized statement.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.660
You know, that is one of the statements that you appeared

17:52.660 --> 17:56.260
in your presentation today for 13,

17:56.260 --> 17:59.060
unless in the conclusion that you failed to hear,

17:59.060 --> 18:02.260
you did not refer to the meeting on November 60,

18:02.260 --> 18:04.660
where you were raised in that statement to honor about

18:04.660 --> 18:08.860
November 16, 1953, Mr. Colm and Mr. Car.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.360
We knew the facts that I was cited in terms of you,

18:11.360 --> 18:14.660
leveled above this time directing them to respect the

18:14.660 --> 18:15.660
current statements.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.860
That's what they said.

18:17.860 --> 18:21.260
But that's item number 12 of this specification.

18:21.260 --> 18:24.660
On page three, November 16.

18:24.660 --> 18:27.460
Well, you know, the eyeing that then,

18:27.460 --> 18:29.460
and you're almost coming to make it from that,

18:29.460 --> 18:32.260
or Chairman, I was given a great deal of mindboards

18:32.260 --> 18:33.660
for those.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.460
I'm so of my desire.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.460
And we might have made an omission.

18:37.460 --> 18:39.660
If we have, if the system is played over site,

18:39.660 --> 18:41.260
my life will have to have some little share.

18:41.260 --> 18:43.460
Would be very happy to have you testify on this one,

18:43.460 --> 18:45.660
then for me, because if you do it most of the night

18:45.660 --> 18:49.060
to try and review the situation and bring it back

18:49.060 --> 18:50.460
until the fourth one of your mind,

18:50.460 --> 18:52.460
I would think you should testify on this incident,

18:52.460 --> 18:53.460
perhaps for a member.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.260
I know the finding climate and sincerity

19:07.260 --> 19:08.260
have won a heavy mind.

19:09.260 --> 19:10.260
Great.

19:15.460 --> 19:18.660
Well, I have testified in regards to that meeting

19:18.660 --> 19:21.660
at last, the first out of the month.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.660
I don't want you to be back into the meeting except in

19:23.660 --> 19:26.260
Safari, Mr. Carr, present to you.

19:26.260 --> 19:28.060
That's as I was hearing this charge.

19:28.060 --> 19:30.060
I'd like to have you know whether you can give you a

19:30.060 --> 19:34.260
audible test or a physical test or by gesture,

19:34.260 --> 19:36.060
or whether it was just a test,

19:36.060 --> 19:37.860
or you don't even know the fact you were present

19:37.860 --> 19:39.860
in that time.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.260
He didn't sit strong.

19:41.260 --> 19:42.260
Very well, I did anything.

19:47.460 --> 19:55.260
Well, this was, this meeting on the 16th of November

19:55.260 --> 20:00.660
was, came a thousand, the first instance.

20:00.660 --> 20:05.260
Those are the first conference that I held on the 12th

20:05.260 --> 20:07.460
November.

20:07.460 --> 20:11.460
And let's do a little bit.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.460
Call on.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.460
Mr. Carr.

20:16.460 --> 20:23.460
Call on me.

20:23.460 --> 20:26.860
And for a major academy, Safari, I would have to be

20:26.860 --> 20:27.860
very good at that.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.860
I'd love to get my fellow fellow out of my mind.

20:29.860 --> 20:32.660
Yes, I would have answered this question before you.

20:32.660 --> 20:34.460
Mr. Martin, higher.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.860
I'm a man.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.860
Social man.

20:37.860 --> 20:40.860
Which is about a three four.

20:40.860 --> 20:44.060
When we were still at some 13 hours in the school,

20:44.060 --> 20:46.860
three three times before my time comes on again,

20:46.860 --> 20:48.860
you'll have about another hour.

20:48.860 --> 20:51.260
And I'm afraid nothing is going to hurt the people.

20:51.260 --> 20:52.260
Thank you.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.260
Have another hour.

20:53.260 --> 20:56.260
I'll send him a phone.

20:56.260 --> 21:01.060
Mr. Secretary, you say you have been with a well occupied

21:01.060 --> 21:03.260
during the last evening.

21:03.260 --> 21:06.060
That's the one we recess.

21:06.060 --> 21:11.660
I ask you if you might get up for us the number of man hours

21:11.660 --> 21:15.860
that have been consumed on the part of the army by reason

21:15.860 --> 21:21.180
of this controversy, by reason of your allegations

21:21.180 --> 21:25.540
that undue pressure has been applied in order

21:25.540 --> 21:29.060
to secure preferential treatment for Mr. Sean.

21:29.060 --> 21:33.060
Did you, were you able to work on that last night?

21:33.060 --> 21:35.660
What I would have accomplished at a time was then.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.660
Then, as a secretary, if you're not

21:37.660 --> 21:41.140
having been able to complete it, I would have far

21:41.140 --> 21:44.660
met him for such time as you may be able to supply.

21:44.660 --> 21:48.460
In the meantime, in the interest of expediting these hearings

21:48.460 --> 21:52.660
to open inclusion, I shall not ask any other questions.

21:55.860 --> 21:58.860
I'm going to ask the chairman of his eyes.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.660
He's telling you, he's temporarily detained on the floor

22:01.660 --> 22:04.060
that he does have some applications for Secretary Stevens

22:04.060 --> 22:05.860
and will be here shortly.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.060
And go ahead and have a second rejection.

22:11.660 --> 22:17.660
Secretary, the secretary, to report to the agreement

22:17.660 --> 22:23.660
that for date was referenced to the granting of taxes

22:23.660 --> 22:24.660
to private China.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.460
In fairness to some of them, a private aid

22:31.460 --> 22:37.460
can you say that he necessary knew about all of the requests

22:37.460 --> 22:44.260
from Mr. Colme and or Mr. Carp for his release.

22:44.260 --> 22:49.780
Mr. Sean, private China's release from the from court

22:49.780 --> 22:54.140
dates from time to time in connection with committee bill.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.780
No, Senator Jackson, I could not make that statement.

22:56.780 --> 23:00.860
So that it's configurable that Senator McCarthy might not

23:00.860 --> 23:05.860
have known about the various requests made on the base

23:05.860 --> 23:10.060
to mangrove and indoor officers at four days.

23:10.060 --> 23:13.860
That's perfectly possible.

23:13.860 --> 23:17.860
And then by a tool, and that's why you sent Mr. Adams

23:17.860 --> 23:21.860
to the seat center of the McCartney about the Hugh Hunter

23:21.860 --> 23:23.660
Lawton.

23:23.660 --> 23:25.460
Oh, yes, I heard about it.

23:25.460 --> 23:29.260
And Mr. Adams was sent to the seat center of the McCartney.

23:29.260 --> 23:31.260
All right.

23:31.260 --> 23:34.060
I'd hear what had to testify on that.

23:34.060 --> 23:35.460
You don't know, I don't know.

23:35.460 --> 23:37.260
I believe that was what I was in the 40s.

23:41.260 --> 23:43.940
Now, there's one other matter that I would like to see

23:43.940 --> 23:50.860
if we can't, as possible, get cleared out.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.540
There's been a lot of thoughts here

23:52.540 --> 23:56.980
and in response to questions about the suspension

23:56.980 --> 24:01.060
of hearings or investigations in connection

24:01.060 --> 24:02.380
with the Ford Mama's matter.

24:05.580 --> 24:08.860
Am I correct in understanding from all of your testimony

24:08.860 --> 24:15.300
up to now that you never requested a suspension

24:15.300 --> 24:20.020
of the investigation by Senator McCarthy's committee?

24:20.020 --> 24:23.660
Well, Senator Jackson has the meeting

24:23.660 --> 24:27.060
and we are on our film of 40.

24:27.060 --> 24:35.660
I got the impression that Senator McCarthy was about to turn.

24:35.660 --> 24:38.460
A little bit to the arm.

24:38.460 --> 24:43.060
And back to the next slide.

24:43.060 --> 24:46.060
An incorrect infighting.

24:46.060 --> 24:53.460
Homestactory, in your mind, did you make a distinction

24:53.460 --> 24:58.060
between the suspension of an investigation

24:58.060 --> 25:01.140
and the suspension of a hearing?

25:01.140 --> 25:02.460
I certainly did.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.860
All right, would you explain what best distinction is?

25:04.860 --> 25:08.940
I just try and clarify this record if it's possible.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.620
Well, the difference in my mind was

25:10.620 --> 25:14.740
that the committee of Congresses embarked on investigation,

25:14.740 --> 25:20.060
that type of investigation ought to run just as long as the committee

25:20.060 --> 25:22.860
wants it to run without any interference

25:22.860 --> 25:24.540
or suggestion by anybody.

25:24.540 --> 25:26.780
Then I assume that you have no objection.

25:26.780 --> 25:27.660
Is that right?

25:27.660 --> 25:29.380
I have no judge of the investigation.

25:29.380 --> 25:30.580
That's right.

25:30.580 --> 25:31.700
None whatsoever.

25:31.700 --> 25:34.980
The thing that I objected to was the type of hearing

25:34.980 --> 25:39.660
that was being held, which was resulting in very exaggerated

25:39.660 --> 25:42.780
headlines that had little relation to the facts

25:42.780 --> 25:44.660
that were being developed at Sportmont.

25:44.660 --> 25:45.820
Well, how did that result?

25:45.820 --> 25:48.300
Will you just explain how did the hearing,

25:48.300 --> 25:50.540
it was an executive hearing, I understand,

25:50.540 --> 25:51.460
that was being held.

25:51.460 --> 25:56.220
How did that result in what you referred to as an exaggerated result?

25:56.220 --> 26:01.140
Well, it's from Senator McCarthy's summary

26:01.140 --> 26:04.740
of what transpired as the executive hearing

26:04.740 --> 26:08.900
when he came out of the hearing and addressed the press.

26:09.580 --> 26:13.860
And they would take, naturally, what Senator McCarthy told him.

26:13.860 --> 26:16.540
That would be the basis of the story.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.580
And it gave indication, for example,

26:19.580 --> 26:23.780
that quite a bit of S.B. Anage was going on at Sportmontment.

26:23.780 --> 26:27.940
As I repeatedly testified, I did not.

26:27.940 --> 26:30.900
In November, no of any conduct at Sportmontment,

26:30.900 --> 26:32.740
and I did not know.

26:32.740 --> 26:36.740
Well, then, do I understand your testimony correctly

26:36.740 --> 26:43.740
that what you wanted was a suspension of that type of hearing,

26:43.740 --> 26:46.660
which resulted in those summary statements

26:46.660 --> 26:49.220
to the press after an executive session?

26:49.220 --> 26:50.020
Is that what you wanted?

26:50.020 --> 26:51.060
That's what I wanted.

26:51.060 --> 26:54.700
I wanted to stop this famine over the head of the heart.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.940
And you did not ask for a suspension, termination,

26:58.940 --> 27:01.860
or the investigation by the government.

27:01.860 --> 27:04.100
No, sir.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.940
I'm sorry.

27:05.940 --> 27:07.580
Senator Potter.

27:07.580 --> 27:12.820
Mr. Secretary, and reply to question by Senator Jackson,

27:12.820 --> 27:17.380
who stated that, if your impression of S. Sunday McCarthy

27:17.380 --> 27:21.860
had more or less agreed to turn over the investigation of

27:21.860 --> 27:25.100
Sportmontment over to the arm, is that?

27:25.100 --> 27:26.420
I got to have him question.

27:26.420 --> 27:29.060
Now, what behavior that impression was it?

27:29.060 --> 27:30.060
Well, yes.

27:30.060 --> 27:34.900
He had his hearings had been going for about a week.

27:34.900 --> 27:39.180
And I think that he felt that he'd gotten the thing started

27:39.180 --> 27:41.660
from the standpoint of this committee.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.940
And he would be satisfied to have the Army carried along

27:45.940 --> 27:48.580
and report to him on progress.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.500
And he would undertake something else.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.980
Now, that was my impression.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.540
Can you recall any conversation that you had

27:54.540 --> 27:59.540
to send to McCarthy concerning this meeting, concerning the committee?

27:59.540 --> 28:03.140
I've read an along the Army to carry on his high expectations.

28:03.140 --> 28:06.900
I can't recall the actual language he was to Senator Potter.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.940
No, I've received that impression.

28:09.940 --> 28:12.940
But you don't know whether you can't justify.

28:12.940 --> 28:16.060
That's then the McCarthy said, well, you can carry on

28:16.060 --> 28:18.660
the investigation and will step on the picture.

28:18.660 --> 28:23.100
No, I don't think he said it that way.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.140
Mr. Chairman, it's good by me in order to expedite

28:26.140 --> 28:28.780
the this hearing.

28:28.780 --> 28:32.180
I looked just on the second hearing,

28:32.180 --> 28:34.620
continuing with the documents that he was reading the jury

28:34.620 --> 28:35.620
request.

28:35.620 --> 28:37.220
That's a terrible idea.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.620
You present a happy ending?

28:38.620 --> 28:40.980
I'll help you in the information out.

28:40.980 --> 28:46.460
Mr. Secretary, I've made the due completed your summation

28:46.460 --> 28:52.460
of these specific charges concerning Mr. Car.

28:52.460 --> 28:57.340
I mean, with the exception of this one that has been omitted,

28:57.340 --> 28:59.580
one being unethanomitted, right?

28:59.580 --> 29:02.180
Now I'd like to ask you if you cared

29:02.180 --> 29:06.300
or if you'd report on these specific allegations

29:06.300 --> 29:09.980
made concerning Mr. Car.

29:09.980 --> 29:14.820
That was a half of Mr. Shine.

29:14.820 --> 29:24.380
These great statements are, of course, Mr. Chairman

29:24.380 --> 29:26.580
and Senator Potter, an attempt that

29:26.580 --> 29:30.780
has synopsis and segregation of testimony

29:30.780 --> 29:32.700
concerning these individuals, because I've

29:32.700 --> 29:34.700
testified of great lengths with respect

29:34.700 --> 29:37.060
to my personal knowledge of all of these matters.

29:37.060 --> 29:40.420
And it's very hard to put the boil it all down

29:40.420 --> 29:41.620
to a very simple statement.

29:41.620 --> 29:42.860
But I have a time for to do that.

29:42.860 --> 29:43.060
This is a very personal statement to the

29:43.060 --> 29:44.620
President's brief time that's been available.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.700
Synopsis and segregation of testimony

29:51.700 --> 29:54.140
concerning Mr. Car.

29:54.140 --> 29:58.280
Roy Car was probably the principal force of the pressure

29:58.280 --> 30:00.360
brought upon the Department of the Army

30:00.360 --> 30:04.300
to obtain special treatment for G. David Shine.

30:04.300 --> 30:07.140
Most of the pressure was brought to bear upon other members

30:07.140 --> 30:09.100
of the Department of the Army, who

30:09.100 --> 30:13.340
reported his efforts to me from Pond to Tom.

30:13.340 --> 30:17.780
My first personal contact with Colin on the subject of Sean

30:17.780 --> 30:20.900
was on October 2, 1953.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.300
He and Frank Car visited my office.

30:23.300 --> 30:24.300
Mr. Chairman.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.100
At that time, Mr. Colin was present

30:26.100 --> 30:29.500
as being able to assign Sean to the New York City immediately

30:29.500 --> 30:33.100
upon his induction in the Army without any basic training.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.900
I finally send him a copy of when you were in the US.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.900
I just wonder if they have time for a quick time.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.380
Now please report her.

30:41.380 --> 30:43.380
Show it all to my many witnesses.

30:43.380 --> 30:44.580
Readings for documents.

30:44.580 --> 30:46.860
Please test the time without a document.

30:46.860 --> 30:49.420
I think that may be very important later on.

30:49.420 --> 30:51.620
The course is complete.

30:51.620 --> 30:53.780
I'm currently present when you report a note

30:53.780 --> 30:54.780
that you were talking about being

30:54.780 --> 30:56.700
registered for entities.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.100
Reaching.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.380
I'm not interested in the PR.

31:02.300 --> 31:03.900
October 27.

31:03.900 --> 31:06.620
Mr. Colin called me from New York.

31:06.620 --> 31:10.860
And after telling me that Sean was to be inducted on November 3,

31:10.860 --> 31:14.460
I asked me to grant Sean a two-week follow.

31:14.460 --> 31:16.780
During his call, Mr. Colin also suggested

31:16.780 --> 31:21.380
that Sean might be used by the Central Intelligence Agency.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.900
As a result of this and another call with Mr. Colin

31:23.900 --> 31:28.380
on October 31, Sean was given two-week temporary duty

31:28.380 --> 31:31.100
as soon as he was inducted.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.620
The length of this duty was subsequently reduced

31:33.660 --> 31:36.860
at the request of Senator McCarthy.

31:36.860 --> 31:39.940
On November 6, Senator McCarthy, Mr. Colin and Mr.

31:39.940 --> 31:43.620
Colin were in my office for an extended conference.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.700
Mr. Colin participated in the request

31:45.700 --> 31:48.380
that Sean be made available for committee business

31:48.380 --> 31:50.940
while at court did.

31:50.940 --> 31:54.180
Following this, I believe that the context

31:54.180 --> 31:56.700
of Mr. Colin regarding Sean, we're

31:56.700 --> 32:00.020
by Mr. Adam and other personnel in the Department of the Army.

32:03.620 --> 32:08.620
Mr. Colin, I'm sorry.

32:08.620 --> 32:20.620
Mr. Colin, I understand you also have a synopsis of your conversations

32:20.620 --> 32:23.220
with Senator McCarthy on the same issue.

32:23.220 --> 32:23.980
Is that correct?

32:23.980 --> 32:25.180
Yes, sir.

32:25.180 --> 32:28.540
And you're also a little bit reading something.

32:28.540 --> 32:30.780
The documents that are cited.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.940
Chairman, order to ask the director here to introduce

32:32.940 --> 32:37.020
if you give that to him.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.220
Synopsis and segregation of testimony

32:39.220 --> 32:42.100
concerning Senator McCarthy.

32:42.100 --> 32:44.340
I shall attempt to summarize my testimony

32:44.340 --> 32:47.100
with respect to what I consider the improper pressure

32:47.100 --> 32:49.900
brought upon me by Senator McCarthy in order

32:49.900 --> 32:52.260
to obtain special treatment for David Sean,

32:52.260 --> 32:56.100
both the boy of conduction and the Army and their after.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.180
My first contact with Senator McCarthy,

32:58.180 --> 33:01.780
at which the presence of David Sean was discussed,

33:01.780 --> 33:06.500
was on September 16, 1953.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.940
On this occasion, the Senator asked me

33:08.940 --> 33:12.540
for a direct commission from Mr. Sean, even though it had previously

33:12.540 --> 33:13.900
been the challenge that he would not

33:13.900 --> 33:16.660
qualify for a direct commission in the Army.

33:16.660 --> 33:19.180
On this occasion, Senator McCarthy also suggested

33:19.180 --> 33:23.820
that Mr. Sean be made a special assistant.
