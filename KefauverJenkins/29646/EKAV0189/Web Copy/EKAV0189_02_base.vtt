WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
And also a member of the armed services committee and the morale of the United States Army in

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
this world today is a matter of vital concern to me.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.500
I thought it only proper that I should tell this committee and also serve the McCarthy that

00:17.500 --> 00:23.000
I had had these conversations with the Secretary of the Army.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.500
The chair in charge of the remarks just made by his colleagues in front of the heading of

00:27.500 --> 00:31.100
the point of personal privilege rather than the point of order I take it to another

00:31.100 --> 00:33.100
section of the questions.

00:33.100 --> 00:40.100
I will take any point that the chairman will let me take which will get the facts on the table.

00:40.100 --> 00:44.700
Yes, I, first of all, do you encourage any of the point of personal privilege your name

00:44.700 --> 00:48.100
has been mentioned and I take it to you I'm not lodging your protest against the asking

00:48.100 --> 00:49.100
of the question.

00:49.100 --> 00:54.100
Any question which will bring out any proof with respect to this in my health, procedure

00:54.100 --> 01:00.600
and these issues is exactly what I have been trying to get and hope that we will get

01:00.600 --> 01:01.600
in these areas.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.600
From the car if you will proceed then and direct his questions to these conversations.

01:06.600 --> 01:13.700
With regard to the point that issue as to whether or not they had anything to do with the

01:13.700 --> 01:17.600
instigation of the charges which you had a thing to which the Secretary just decided

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
this morning.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.600
The chairman is to watch a strike season the senator's description of the conversation

01:24.600 --> 01:26.600
having to do with the record incident.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.100
There is always a mouth side that's called with the limited inquiries that we're now engaged

01:30.100 --> 01:31.100
on.

01:31.100 --> 01:36.100
We can determine how that I presume as the Secretary of the Board to answer these questions

01:36.100 --> 01:37.100
which have not yet been asked.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.100
I don't know what the gentlemen are.

01:38.100 --> 01:46.100
I, by no means, want to infer these conversations only had to do with General Twicker.

01:46.100 --> 01:52.400
These conversations had to do with Secretary Stevens' opinions as to what was happening to

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
the United States Army.

01:53.400 --> 02:00.400
As a member of the armed services committee I was glad to receive any comments that he had

02:00.400 --> 02:02.400
and I was glad to talk to him about it.

02:02.400 --> 02:08.100
I just didn't want to counsel for the Secretary to think that in any way these conversations

02:08.100 --> 02:09.600
were limited to General Twicker.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.600
Thank you for that kind of assignment and still remains true.

02:12.600 --> 02:17.900
I think to this outside the scope of inquiry about the festively that the Secretary needs

02:17.900 --> 02:18.900
that week.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.400
And by the wrong, of course, we wanted in.

02:20.400 --> 02:27.600
At no time since it was decided to have these hearings, have I been in touch directly or

02:27.600 --> 02:34.600
indirectly in any way shaped or formed with Secretary Stevens or with any other principles

02:34.600 --> 02:41.800
in these hearings except Senator McCarthy and Mr. Cohn and you and the others when they

02:41.800 --> 02:45.800
came before this committee, an executive hearing or open hearing.

02:45.800 --> 02:49.800
I just suggest to Senator McCarthy proceed with his questions on this.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.800
Mr. Welch was on the signing window.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.800
Anybody else around the table raises a point of order?

02:53.800 --> 02:58.800
We will discuss the particular point of order with this relationship to the specific question.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.800
Man, I said before I asked the question.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.800
And there's any objection from the part of any senator?

03:05.800 --> 03:11.800
Tomorrow I ask Mr. Stevens about conversation with President Sunford.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
I will do this.

03:12.800 --> 03:19.800
I think that I should not, this time, would a conversation lift the front of her?

03:19.800 --> 03:23.800
Across the object by a gallery of under-assigning and as an objection.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
That's right.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.800
Two.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.800
You know, first piece, there's a question.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.800
Find out whether an objection would have one direction to that.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.800
Or if a repeat is questioned, I would be addressing me.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.800
Yes, I say that if you or any senator have objects in mind,

03:39.800 --> 03:44.800
questioning the secretary about conversation he's had with you,

03:44.800 --> 03:45.800
I shall do this.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.800
I think whoever it's important to me to ask him questions,

03:48.800 --> 03:54.800
that's whether or not the conversation with you had anything to do with the issues of the charges.

03:54.800 --> 03:59.800
I'd like to get that simple answer from the secretary and I understood you did not object to that.

03:59.800 --> 04:05.800
Well, in as much as you detail in Senator, I would like to say that I, myself,

04:05.800 --> 04:13.800
asked the secretary of the Army to give me the charges that has been made with respect to Mr. G. Davis.

04:13.800 --> 04:14.800
Look on, I'm sorry.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.800
When I go on, I'll start to get just a minute.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.800
You've brought it up and I want to tell you the facts.

04:17.800 --> 04:22.800
And on the telephone, I discussed that with him.

04:22.800 --> 04:29.800
And later, I received a letter from somebody in the Army.

04:29.800 --> 04:36.800
I do not believe it was a secretary stating that in accordance with the request of Senator Potter,

04:36.800 --> 04:41.800
they were furnishing me the report with respect to Mr. G. David Chine.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.800
So I believe that covers that point.

04:44.800 --> 04:51.800
However, I want to bring out another point and that is that if I had any conversation with the secretary of the Army,

04:51.800 --> 04:58.800
they, for his testimony, those conversations would be monitored along with yours,

04:58.800 --> 05:02.800
your principals and the other members of this committee.

05:02.800 --> 05:08.800
And for some days, I have been trying to get those monitored conversations before the public,

05:08.800 --> 05:11.800
let the chips pull all the way where they may.

05:11.800 --> 05:18.800
And therefore, it seems to me a little incongruous to be discussing one or two of the monitored conversations

05:19.800 --> 05:27.800
and not all of them in the chronological order that you requested, David, in the beginning.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.800
What's the other new address?

05:30.800 --> 05:36.800
This little is no doubt left in the mind of anyone as to the request of the monitor calls.

05:36.800 --> 05:42.800
The toll happens before the public and members of this committee have requested that their monitored conversations

05:42.800 --> 05:47.800
be made available to the check council, Mr. Duncan.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.800
The cost and the roles that's running out, they could be put in evidence.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.800
Mr. Wells, your testimony raised the cost of security.

05:54.800 --> 06:01.800
I understand that Mr. Duncan's have made arrangements not to go over the monitored conversations with the justice department,

06:01.800 --> 06:03.800
beside what should be deleted.

06:03.800 --> 06:09.800
And what can safely be introduced, interfering with any security regulations.

06:09.800 --> 06:19.800
I know all of the senators from Missouri, the signings and realizes that unless until he does a plain thing that the Republican senators have done,

06:19.800 --> 06:25.800
Mr. Duncan can ask the officials for the justice department to not eliminate the security matter.

06:25.800 --> 06:38.800
And the entire question getting one of her phone calls in his signing, I sincerely hope that any Democrat members who have had phone calls

06:38.800 --> 06:46.800
will be defense department, make the claims, type of requests that we did.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.800
So Mr. Duncan has the phone call.

06:50.800 --> 06:55.800
The meantime Mr. Steven, Mr. Chairman.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.800
You're fine, I have a point of whatever you would like to have at least.

06:59.800 --> 07:04.800
I would like to make some comments with respect to those comments.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.800
Chair, believe we shouldn't proceed with the question well.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.800
The comments around the table were not going to make my head wait.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.800
Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of personal privilege.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.800
You may do so.

07:17.800 --> 07:29.800
Mr. Chairman, when we first signed a paper according to Senator Potter and according to me and according to my understanding,

07:29.800 --> 07:36.800
we were signing a paper which took these calls into the public record we thought.

07:36.800 --> 07:43.800
It developed that what we signed simply gave the right of Mr. Jenkins and his councils,

07:43.800 --> 07:52.800
Senator McCarthy and his councils, and the Army, Senator Secretary Steven's and his council to look at the call.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.800
I understand that all three have looked at some of the calls.

07:56.800 --> 08:04.800
Now, there was a general feeling around that because they had signed that paper,

08:04.800 --> 08:13.800
the Republican senators, which did not in any way prophesy, predict or stipulate that the calls would be made public.

08:13.800 --> 08:19.800
Nevertheless, there was a general feeling that because they had signed it, the calls would be made public.

08:19.800 --> 08:24.800
And because they hadn't signed it, the calls wouldn't be made public.

08:24.800 --> 08:33.800
Now, I do not want to discuss what happened in executive sessions with respect to these telephone conversations unless it becomes necessary.

08:33.800 --> 08:46.800
Therefore, I say first, I am very glad now to have Senator McCarthy as any question of any kind that he would like to add of the Secretary of the Army

08:46.800 --> 08:54.800
with respect to any discussions of any kind that I have ever had with him at any time in the last 50s been on the job.

08:54.800 --> 09:00.800
I have had no discussions with him of any kind since it was decided to hold these hearings.

09:00.800 --> 09:08.800
But I want to remind the Chair and April Council that we are now going in to the discussion of monitor telephone conversations

09:08.800 --> 09:21.800
and unilaterally to fight the fact that the only people to the best of my knowledge will sign anything with respect to publishing those telephone calls or the senators on the Democratic side of this committee.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
What's your secretary?

09:22.800 --> 09:30.800
Well, that's the correct directive at that point to Chair would like to say he has written a letter to Council Wilkins,

09:30.800 --> 09:43.800
special delivery to him at his office, in closing the statements signed by the Democrats and calling a text into the statements which was signed in his suggestion by the Republicans.

09:43.800 --> 09:56.800
And if said to Mr. Wells, we hope that you can interpret this to be adequate to deliver these monitored phone calls and response towards the Pee-Nee to Council thinks Mr. Wells told me this morning he had been in Boston.

09:56.800 --> 10:06.800
While he arrived last night, he did not go to his office until this morning. He had not had a time to read my letter and to make a reply to it.

10:06.800 --> 10:13.800
That's the soon as he does that Chair will act in conformity with that letter. If he does as I hope he can, that's just enough.

10:13.800 --> 10:19.800
We can deliver them to Council Jenkins, so be it. If he doesn't say that, that Chair hope he will be in writing.

10:19.800 --> 10:24.800
So have it in a record. Say exactly what he does want to have now.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.800
I'm Mr. McCart.

10:26.800 --> 10:39.800
Just before I asked the President, Mr. Secretary, could I have this cleared up on the work of understanding that Council Jenkins already has all of the monitored phone calls of any Republican members.

10:40.800 --> 10:45.800
The monitor phone calls with the phone with Mr. Carb with none with the Democratic members.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.800
That's correct.

10:47.800 --> 10:48.800
Just for another.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.800
I don't think that's correct, but you could have the Council. I think that's an error.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.800
So I have that statement up for the record.

10:56.800 --> 11:06.800
Mr. Chairman, we have only the monitor telephone calls between the Army and the McCarthy staff.

11:06.800 --> 11:13.800
Those are been examined by Mr. Welch's staff, by the committee staff and by your staff.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.800
And also the conversation with me.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.800
That is correct.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.800
I think you only get that statement up.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.800
I hope the monitor seems to be able to answer the report.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.800
You may take it.

11:26.800 --> 11:30.800
We're asking the Carb for the committee.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.800
Yes.

11:33.800 --> 11:46.800
Those monitored telephone calls that you have in your perception are now available for the inspection of other members of this committee under the order to choose out.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.800
On a legitimate, Mr. Chairman, I'm Mr. McCart.

11:52.800 --> 12:09.800
We have specific concerns on the part of Mr. Welch and on the part of the Army to disclose those monitored records to myself, to Senator McCart.

12:10.800 --> 12:20.800
The committee and the Council for the Army, that is the limit of the permission given us, to be seen by the Army.

12:20.800 --> 12:29.800
And by the McCarthy staff, there was no consent given to those monitored records, which would be shown to the committee as a whole.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.800
I want to make it perfectly clear, Senator McCart.

12:33.800 --> 12:43.800
As far as I am perfect as personally concerned, I would be happy for each member of this committee to see those calls and those records.

12:43.800 --> 12:51.800
But today, I have only this consent to see those myself in the presence of Mr. McCone and Mr. Welch.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.800
Is that right, Mr. Welch, your understanding?

12:54.800 --> 13:23.800
Well, I don't know at the moment what the titelite says, but Mr. Jenkins, I'm sure that you know and that every member of this committee knows that it is the desire of the Army and of Mr. Adams to have every monitor telephone call between the Secretary's office, the Senator McCart, the his staff, and if you gentlemen, waste his call between the office and you senators, admitted in evidence in this hearing, and we will sign any censor for this.

13:24.800 --> 13:36.800
I am under the impression we have already signed such a paper, but in any event we stated repeatedly in this room that that is the result we desire.

13:36.800 --> 13:41.800
Mr. Welch, I don't believe you answer my question.

13:41.800 --> 13:59.800
You state that it is your desire to those calls we put in the records. How we understand that perfectly. But I am asked to Senator McCullen, why the members of the committee, these seven members have not seen those monitors calls and the record office.

13:59.800 --> 14:21.800
My answer to him was that I had your consent in the consent of the McCarthy side of this controversy. For me as general counsel for the committee, for you representing the Army and for Mr. Cohen representing Senator McCrathy to see those calls, and that there was no consent that they be shown to the members of the committee.

14:21.800 --> 14:29.800
Mr. Welch, I will let Mr. St. Claire answer that. You have the government. Can you answer the question?

14:29.800 --> 14:34.800
I hope that I will be hearing it as well.

14:34.800 --> 14:51.800
My memory of this is that we produced those calls. The question arose as to whether or not the adverse party would be willing that they go in evidence before they had a chance to look at them and the answer that I recall wasn't they would not be willing.

14:51.800 --> 15:04.800
We then agreed that at least we should agree that you consent. It was no effort on the part of the Army to limit their distribution if there was any such effort. It came to the other side of the table.

15:04.800 --> 15:13.800
There was no agreement on the part of the Army that they would say that the members of this committee could see the little monitors. We are perfectly happy to have that.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.800
Mr. Welch, if you were to say that, you would not be willing to do it now. And where is that? And where is that?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.800
Would you say it over and absolutely?

15:20.800 --> 15:23.800
Would you recall the other side of the table through the line?

15:23.800 --> 15:27.800
Very well. Very well. Now Senator McCrathy, that's answer your question.

15:27.800 --> 15:35.800
I do not have the permission according to Mr. St. Claire. I'll let Mr. Cohen and Senator McCrathy to show you those monitor calls.

15:35.800 --> 15:44.800
So I repeat that personally I was not today. I cannot break spaces and agreements that I have made to this report.

15:44.800 --> 15:56.800
What I want to ask is what another question now. Are the fellow monitors telephone calls with members of this committee be ensured to the parties who were supposed to be?

15:56.800 --> 16:07.800
I have not seen them. They have not been delivered. Now I likely can say that another time Mr. Welch has time to answer the letter I can see him last week.

16:07.800 --> 16:12.800
I will get it because he was involved. I'm sure that by tomorrow morning Mr. Welch will have a reply to that letter.

16:12.800 --> 16:19.800
I'm perfectly aware of it. I want to say this to them. I have a full visit. Talk to you about the minutes you sent to me this time.

16:20.800 --> 16:28.800
And it does not give this committee the right to see any of them. For that reason, when I did not agree to it, I'm willing to be committed to have all of them.

16:28.800 --> 16:35.800
And for every one of them, irrespective of those who are going to recognize me about this about effect this morning.

16:35.800 --> 16:44.800
Mr. Chair, I would like to say to Mr. St. Claire, that Senator St. Claire has introduced the paper this morning. I thought it unlocked all doors.

16:45.800 --> 16:58.800
But I thought the council for the minority members before we tied up the empty list and pointed out to him that I thought the phasing of it was not quite happy to achieve the result that this table would like to see a key.

16:58.800 --> 17:04.800
Chair, I would like to thank Mr. Chair. I have a discontinuation of the conversation which is very time consuming.

17:04.800 --> 17:11.800
Mr. Welch, I'm sure that I wrote him last week. But you're sure to me. He would answer the morning as per seems to be questions.

17:11.800 --> 17:26.800
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, before we just go to this telephone call, this is a man's project. It seems to me that every one of these is individual in charge of this.

17:26.800 --> 17:37.800
And Mr. Welch, if you get up some good Boston language that will follow the junior senator's familiarly devised and bequeathed all these calls that I may have made, get him out of the table.

17:37.800 --> 17:44.800
You can put him in the record right now. Now I see no record signing a mass document with everybody's name on it.

17:44.800 --> 17:52.800
You are free to release any telephone call that I have made and you're free to read it in this room as far as I'm concerned.

17:52.800 --> 18:00.800
And if everybody else wants to do like life, that's all I have to say. And if nobody wants to do it, it's still all right with me.

18:00.800 --> 18:10.800
So you can go into the office and put him in the record because as a general population telephone calls are not very reviewing and a high-dose feature as much as paper.

18:10.800 --> 18:15.800
And if anybody wants to see this question, please.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.800
I'll go over talking about that.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.800
Anything but telephone calls.

18:22.800 --> 18:34.800
Mr. Steven, I understand you had several telephone conversations with Mr. Femmington before these charges were made public.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.800
Is that correct or given to the son of a?

18:37.800 --> 18:41.800
Yes, I talk with the senator Femmington on a number of subjects.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.800
Mr. Chairman.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.800
Mr. Femmington, can you come in?

18:45.800 --> 18:48.800
I have a point or something.

18:49.800 --> 19:06.800
I want to point out to the chair and to eminent counsel that now, despite the fact that some of us have signed a general lease of all monitor telephone calls without a lot of legal double thought around them.

19:06.800 --> 19:20.800
And some happen that the chair is now permitting senator from Wisconsin to interrogate the witness with respect to some of the telephone calls and not all of them.

19:20.800 --> 19:35.800
If the chair and the counsel thinks that proper, it's all right with me because I certainly have never said anything with respect to the army, to the secretary of the army that I won't stand behind.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.800
Excuse me.

19:39.800 --> 19:47.800
The director makes this statement with reference to the statement just made by the senator from Missouri.

19:47.800 --> 19:59.800
The senator from Missouri is under the impression that the calls these conversations with the secretary of the army was publicly monitored by his conversations with the monitors.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.800
The secretary should not be now be questioned about them.

20:03.800 --> 20:14.800
That is in the point that, besides the points that they have fact that they were monitored does not preclude the secretary of the army from testifying the reference to those conversations.

20:14.800 --> 20:28.800
The man who did the monitoring of not coming to court and testifying before this committee without a course the consent of senator Femmington, the fact that they are monitored does not in any way.

20:28.800 --> 20:34.800
In any way, the secretary from the voting, the contents of those conversations are soon.

20:34.800 --> 20:48.800
That they are relevant to the person's issue and that is whether or not senator Femmington made any suggestions or had any influence with the secretary in the preparation or release of these charges.

20:48.800 --> 20:53.800
The inquire being confined to that sort of a moment.

20:53.800 --> 21:07.800
Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that the best evidence of what is going to be asked of the memory of the secretary of the army will be in the monitor and conversations themselves.

21:07.800 --> 21:18.800
And I would also like to say that at no time and no way did I ever suggest that any charges were to be made against anybody.

21:18.800 --> 21:31.800
Mr. Secretary, I am a catcher. If you have any question before us in detail about any conversation you might have had with me, I am now asking you about some conversation with senator Femmington.

21:31.800 --> 21:39.800
I can put it up completely proper. I don't think that one senator has any special problem in another senator does not have.

21:39.800 --> 21:54.800
Now, the person is this. No. 1, did you have conversations with senator Femmington prior to the issuance of the charges against phone charge or repair.

21:54.800 --> 21:59.800
I have to convert the senator Femmington a good money time by sight and by took office.

21:59.800 --> 22:15.800
How many of those conversations have anything to do with the charges against Mr. Femmington?

22:15.800 --> 22:23.800
I personally recall it coming up only one time. How about the telephone conversation?

22:23.800 --> 22:28.800
The telephone conversation that I remember were on a entirely different subject.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.800
In other words, you had no telephone conversation with senator Femmington.

22:32.800 --> 22:43.800
So had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Femmington, I can't say that senator. I just don't remember right at the moment. Could have been mentioned.

22:43.800 --> 22:54.800
Would you have any ideas on how many times in telephone conversations you could have mentioned Mr. Femmington, the charges against Mr. Femmington?

22:54.800 --> 22:58.800
I refer you times before the charges were made public.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.800
Well, I would think it would be very, very limited. Very limited.

23:02.800 --> 23:07.800
Well, I don't, I don't want to pin you down if your memory is bad. Would you say one time, two times, five times?

23:08.800 --> 23:14.800
I'm sure it wasn't five times. I'd say I don't remember any of it on the telephone, but it could have been mentioned.

23:14.800 --> 23:20.800
I think. Now, when you came up to see Mr. Femmington, did you discuss it that time?

23:20.800 --> 23:25.800
The charges against Mr. Carbistro-Cooner, against me?

23:25.800 --> 23:33.800
I think on one occasion it was mentioned. I came up to see senator Femmington in regard to the General's worker case.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
He discussed the...

23:34.800 --> 23:40.800
My recollection is, before I left the office, the subject of Sean and Colin came up.

23:40.800 --> 23:45.800
Mr. Femmington, only a million of that time.

23:45.800 --> 23:55.800
Well, that was on, that was, if my memory is correct, that was then on about the 19th of February.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.800
He was on the committee, wasn't he at that point?

23:59.800 --> 24:04.800
I'm sorry, Mr. Femmington. I'm the judge of the committee. I'm the 26th of January.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.800
Yes.

24:05.800 --> 24:11.800
And did you discuss with Mr. Femmington that, across Newfutter North, you're going to make public pay charges of you, Mr. Femmington?

24:11.800 --> 24:14.800
I don't recall having to shut that.

24:14.800 --> 24:23.800
In other words, you don't recall, ever having to discuss with some person, because they cross with other North, you make public pay charges.

24:24.800 --> 24:31.800
I don't recall that. I certainly know that senator Femmington had nothing to do whatever, with what finally transpired.

24:31.800 --> 24:35.800
I just know when he was remotely accused, he was being accused.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.800
Did you tell him charges were being prepared?

24:38.800 --> 24:40.800
No, I don't think so.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.800
Did you tell any singers the charges were being prepared?

24:43.800 --> 24:45.800
I don't think so.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.800
Do you know?

24:47.800 --> 24:49.800
Do I know?

24:49.800 --> 24:55.800
I'd say, I remember one case in talk with Thunder Symes, and the matter came up to me following Sean.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.800
I don't remember anything about any charges.

24:58.800 --> 25:10.800
Mr. Chairman of this morning, I call the Secretary of the attention of the fact that his trust in money under oaths on two different occasions was directly opposite.

25:11.800 --> 25:22.800
I pointed out that unless he had a bad memory, this would mean that Treasury was convicted as a Treasury one, okay, to the other.

25:22.800 --> 25:33.800
He resented that very much to ask the justice in proper, and of course it would be improper, but it's true that it's not improper, so I intend now to read the testimony.

25:33.800 --> 25:40.800
All the Secretary is on the stand and see if he agrees with me that it's completely contradictory.

25:40.800 --> 25:45.800
But one time either was in error, and I assume that's what it is.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.800
I assume he was in error, I can see his memories in very bad.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.800
Mr. Chairman, or that there was a Treasury. It has to be one or the other.

25:53.800 --> 25:58.800
I shall now read the testimony and ask the Secretary to hear his comment on it.

25:59.800 --> 26:09.800
I have a point of order. The record is the record. It says the thing which witnesses committed surgery, the record goes to the department.

26:09.800 --> 26:20.800
To the Attorney General's office for proper action, there is no point in contrasting, but it says on one page now, what it says on another, that's for the Attorney's done.

26:20.800 --> 26:29.800
Chair is unable to anticipate the question about CBS by the fact that Senator Thomas Johnson will have to wait until the question is asked before he can go on a point of order.

26:29.800 --> 26:33.800
I have a number of Secretary and I'm going to read you your testimony.

26:33.800 --> 26:40.800
From page 14 in 1949 on page 6, 1964.

26:40.800 --> 26:48.800
Senator McArthur, did you order them put out? We're applying the charges just now that time.

26:48.800 --> 27:07.800
Answered? No sir, I did not order them put out. Then May 24, 1954, page 32, 14. Secretary Steven, the responsibility for these charges being put out is mine complete place.

27:07.800 --> 27:15.800
From the Attorney General's office. You just told me you ordered them put out Mr. Secretary. Now did you or did you not?

27:15.800 --> 27:26.800
Secretary Steven, yes sir, I did. From the Attorney General's office. When did you order them put out? Are you 50 corrects? Secretary Steven, Mr. Welles, what's the definition?

27:26.800 --> 27:32.800
The Secretary gives the question. The Secretary is comparing the back and getting it to the parking.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.800
I paid Mr. Welles, was this good? 32? No, it's not.

27:35.800 --> 27:41.800
32, 14, page 32, 14.

27:41.800 --> 27:47.800
Let me get the complete transcript. The time out of the work.

27:47.800 --> 27:53.800
The wireless time is out. Let's return to our studios across the country to permit us patients to identify themselves.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.800
This is ABC Television Network.

28:02.800 --> 28:09.800
Miami was national headquarters for the mob until the police drove out the V-shape. Mash the horseroom.

28:09.800 --> 28:14.800
Fire back at the murder man and chop the big shots into the sea.

28:15.800 --> 28:23.800
See to Miami story now at the time on St. John's Square.

28:23.800 --> 28:32.800
All Baker meets Joe Baxi in the heavyweight man of that embossing location, Parkway, United Camp, all took a power of 7.

28:32.800 --> 28:41.800
Secretary Steven, yes sir, I did. The question, when did you order them put out? Secretary Steven, well we put them out.

28:42.800 --> 28:46.800
We sent them up to the committee here. I think it's on the 10th of March.

28:46.800 --> 28:51.800
I will decide to Mr. Welles, so when he said I skipped a question, he is an error.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.800
If I skipped a question, having read it to me.

28:54.800 --> 28:59.800
If it's the last one, Senator, that I thought you skipped, I may have been an error sir.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.800
Well, the dollar agreement is that there is no skipping of questions and let's proceed.

29:03.800 --> 29:08.800
Will the reporter read back my original question? I don't like to be accused of skipping a question.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.800
Mr. Welles, we track, so that I understand the allegation to skip the question.

29:12.800 --> 29:16.800
Am I right Mr. Welles? I do. I don't know whether you did or not. I was under the impression that you did.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.800
I would not wish to do you all wrong.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.800
Thank you very much. Very well. The record stands. No question was skipped. proceed. Please.

29:22.800 --> 29:33.800
That was this morning, later this morning, and page 3234, Mr. Cooen was trusting the record.

29:33.800 --> 29:41.800
Have you got that transcript of the controls? Yes. Page 32 to 34. Mr. Cooen is quoting...

29:41.800 --> 29:45.800
I don't know. Paul would need it.

29:45.800 --> 29:51.800
Well, it started from the beginning of this. I'm sure that Mr. Cooen is, I'm sure that sir and I'm very sorry that this has taken so long.

29:51.800 --> 29:58.800
But we still don't have the answer for a very crucial question that draws this committee to adjourn for a full week.

29:59.800 --> 30:05.800
The question is, who did give the order? You were deaf enough when you were here the last time.

30:05.800 --> 30:11.800
I might read this to you to refresh your recollection, but then Mr. Cooen, close to a previous record.

30:11.800 --> 30:15.800
Did you order them put out? That was a question by Senator McCrathick.

30:15.800 --> 30:20.800
Then he quotes the answer of Secretary Stevens. No sir, I didn't order them put out.

30:20.800 --> 30:26.800
Secretary Stevens, I make the answer this morning. We did not put them out, Mr. Cooen.

30:26.800 --> 30:31.800
And I have explained that at least 25 times. We did not put them out.

30:31.800 --> 30:40.800
Mr. Cooen, after reading the testimony of May 6th, when Mr. Stevens was no sir, I didn't order them put out.

30:40.800 --> 30:44.800
The testimony of this morning, when he says yes sir, I did.

30:44.800 --> 30:50.800
The testimony about an hour later, when he says we did not put them out, Mr. Cooen.

30:50.800 --> 30:59.800
I confess, I must throw up my hand and see nothing to be gained by further examining this witness.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.800
Sirius.

31:03.800 --> 31:06.800
You can try to understand, you concluded your interrogatory of the witness.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.800
I go for Mr. Cooen.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.800
As you go for the members of the committee, the council.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.800
You're dismissed, Mr. Stevens.

31:14.800 --> 31:19.800
May I say, if you are still under oath, because we have that one question you agreed to bring back,

31:19.800 --> 31:22.800
we're applying to the bus to the police report.

31:22.800 --> 31:27.800
If you will do that, it's probably possible we can dismiss you from this.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.800
Mr. Council, you will call on next.

31:30.800 --> 31:38.800
I believe you're out of the stand. Mr. Chairman, let me call Mr. D. Cooen.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.800
I'm a Councillor John A. Van Aukum.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.800
Mr. Chair, I understand it.

31:42.800 --> 31:49.800
You were dismissed because of the developments around the executive party, but you were not unspoiled.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.800
If you are understanding, I was not unspoiled.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.800
So you're continuing to testify on note, Mr. Council.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.800
I have no further questions at this time.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.800
No, I have the chair. How about I come across as a last one?

32:00.800 --> 32:03.800
I'm going to make a comment.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.800
I'm going to make a comment.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.800
I want to ask you one question, Mr. Adams.

32:10.800 --> 32:18.800
After conclusion, if you're testimony last Monday, or during your testimony last Monday,

32:18.800 --> 32:27.800
I ask you specifically whether after that meeting on January 21st,

32:27.800 --> 32:32.800
the responsibility shifted from the Army

32:32.800 --> 32:39.800
to the conduct that there are actions regarding this controversy.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.800
You at that time...
