WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Yes, that's your answer to the Navy and the Air Force.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
That's right.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
No, that's right.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
No, I'm talking about the jobs you made again start.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
The second part of that paragraph, where you said the issue raised by the Senate of

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Potter's letter as to whether unbode informs with you by the Senate of McCarthy in his

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
stance, the same self-righteous reason for private time.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
You said that, didn't you?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Yes.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
That was one of the letters that was raised in that happened to bring the thing pretty

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
much to a head because this thing had been going on for many weeks and when Senator Potter's

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
letter was directed to the Secretary of Defense came in and it just released that air

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
point when the thing just started reached the high line.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
That's your Secretary.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
I concluded my last interview with the Secretary around the particular subject and I pointed

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
out to you your testimony which you stated, but it was set it up by Senator Potter's

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Foreign Office, I think we all agree to you.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
We're emphasizing the fact that it was Potter's letter that was set up their release.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
And after the time you were discussing that on the road, did you then know that a

01:15.000 --> 01:22.440
member of the executive, other than someone in the Pentagon had turned back to Senator

01:22.440 --> 01:26.000
Potter, had suggested to him that he write this letter.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Did not know that then and don't know it now.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
Have you ever heard that someone from the executive who knew about the meeting of the

01:38.500 --> 01:44.000
governor's office in January knew that the suggestion was made there that the charges

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
be formalized and readings.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.980
Then gotten states with Senator Potter and said, would you write to the Pentagon and ask

01:51.980 --> 01:53.980
that the charges were released.

01:53.980 --> 01:54.980
Did you know that?

01:54.980 --> 01:56.980
The first time I ever heard that was this morning.

01:56.980 --> 01:57.980
But do you know it now, don't you?

01:57.980 --> 01:59.980
I do not know.

01:59.980 --> 02:00.980
Do you heard Senator Potter say it?

02:00.980 --> 02:01.980
The first time I hear that.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.980
What's the one thing on the line with Senator Potter used if you will refresh my memory

02:05.980 --> 02:06.980
on it?

02:06.980 --> 02:07.980
That was the first indication that I had of it.

02:07.980 --> 02:11.980
Well, you know that Senator Potter said he did get a call from someone who was executive.

02:11.980 --> 02:14.980
I say I did not hear all of what Senator Potter said.

02:14.980 --> 02:16.980
Did you hear it Mr. Wells?

02:16.980 --> 02:17.980
I want to keep it refreshed.

02:17.980 --> 02:21.980
The secretary is right about this and rather important, we have a sequence of the events

02:21.980 --> 02:22.980
here about the trust we have about.

02:22.980 --> 02:27.980
Well, isn't the important thing Senator that I never heard of it until it's mine?

02:27.980 --> 02:28.980
No.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.980
So many things you have heard that didn't hear of Mr. Secretary.

02:32.980 --> 02:43.980
We are concerned here with who instigated the charges which resulted in the complete

02:43.980 --> 02:49.980
wrecking of this committee's normal function and tied it up on this work for a week.

02:49.980 --> 02:56.980
We have here a statement to the press that the other decisions are made solely by the Army.

02:57.980 --> 03:06.980
We have Mr. Adam Sustamone of the effect of the decision to make the charges formal and

03:06.980 --> 03:11.980
coming to the centers to derive that out of a justice department meeting to fight out

03:11.980 --> 03:12.980
trust personnel there.

03:12.980 --> 03:13.980
I thought a gray now.

03:13.980 --> 03:14.980
Let me finish.

03:14.980 --> 03:16.980
We now know that the rudder.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.980
But he said, headed up the matter.

03:19.980 --> 03:23.980
In effect, for us to finally put out the charges.

03:24.980 --> 03:29.980
For us instigated by someone from the executive.

03:29.980 --> 03:35.980
Without information do you still want to stand by your statements that are recorded?

03:35.980 --> 03:42.980
I wish to make it perfectly plain that the decisions on the act on the part of the Army concerning

03:42.980 --> 03:48.980
the controversy, probably being heard by the Senate subcommittee, were the decisions and the act

03:49.980 --> 03:50.980
of the Department of the Army alone.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.980
I do. I stand squarely on that.

03:52.980 --> 03:55.980
You must have said that no one else had anything to do with it.

03:55.980 --> 03:58.980
I have explained to you at length the discussions with the Department of the Army.

03:58.980 --> 04:04.980
Do you say that no one has stepped into the Department of Army had anything to do with

04:04.980 --> 04:10.980
the making of these decisions for the act?

04:10.980 --> 04:15.980
I have explained to you that the Senate and the Classics just have a decision which is made

04:16.980 --> 04:20.980
and a way that lots of decisions are made in the executive branch of the government or in the

04:20.980 --> 04:21.980
operation of a business.

04:21.980 --> 04:25.980
I don't know where, where some people have got together and the stuff matters.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.980
Mr., there would have no written or issue.

04:27.980 --> 04:33.980
Mr. Stevens, I am getting awfully weary of this attempt to get a few simple facts from you

04:33.980 --> 04:40.980
that overflowing teeth we've sent just a vast amount of time here trying to get answers to

04:40.980 --> 04:41.980
some simple questions.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.980
I have frankly given up and trying to get you to tell us whether or not you wish you

04:45.980 --> 04:48.980
had the order because your testimony is still counter-dictated.

04:48.980 --> 04:49.980
I can't reconcile.

04:49.980 --> 04:50.980
I'm now on another question.

04:50.980 --> 04:51.980
Question is this.

04:51.980 --> 04:53.980
You made a statement this morning under rule.

04:53.980 --> 04:58.980
You say I wish to make it perfectly clear that the decisions and the acts on the

04:58.980 --> 05:02.980
Department of the Army concerning the controversy are closely being heard by the Senate subcommittee

05:02.980 --> 05:07.980
where the decisions and the acts of the Department of the Army alone.

05:07.980 --> 05:10.980
Now, do you still stand by that statement?

05:10.980 --> 05:11.980
I do.

05:11.980 --> 05:19.980
Do you, do you, say that John Adams was not telling the truth when he said that the decision

05:19.980 --> 05:25.980
out of 40 testimony of meeting finally concluded with the decision that I should call on our

05:25.980 --> 05:28.980
Republican members in investigating subcommittee.

05:28.980 --> 05:32.980
The Democrats members were not members of the committee and pointed out to them that two problems

05:32.980 --> 05:34.980
which I had discussed in the attorney's journals off.

05:34.980 --> 05:39.980
And before you answer that, Mr. Secretary, you understand here is your chief legal counsel

05:39.980 --> 05:48.980
for saying that the decision, the decision, the decision to bring the shame-corn matter

05:48.980 --> 05:53.980
to the attention of members of the committee to bring in to them in connection with the attempt

05:53.980 --> 05:59.980
to get us to call off the hearings on the loyalty board that had been clearing comments.

05:59.980 --> 06:06.980
He said that decision was made in the Justice Department with White House Aid's presence

06:06.980 --> 06:10.980
with the Attorney General Presence, the Deputy Attorney General Presence, and Ambassador

06:10.980 --> 06:11.980
to the UN President.

06:11.980 --> 06:16.980
Now, I'm sure that any man who can add two and two Mr. Secretary will agree that that

06:16.980 --> 06:20.980
completely contradicts your statement that all decisions or the decisions of the Department

06:20.980 --> 06:25.980
of the Army alone, I wonder if you want your sworn testimony this morning just stand as a

06:25.980 --> 06:26.980
case or not.

06:26.980 --> 06:27.980
I want it to stand.

06:27.980 --> 06:33.980
You say that I, and I explain before I turn to my colleague in another very, very long, I

06:33.980 --> 06:36.980
won't call it a question or a call of speech that you just made.

06:36.980 --> 06:41.980
So what you move, and I can't remember at all, but I do remember part of it, which I've

06:41.980 --> 06:46.980
covered before and that was with respect to the use of the word by Mr. Adam, something

06:46.980 --> 06:47.980
was concluded.

06:47.980 --> 06:53.980
And I say again that when you sit on this checklist, witness chair, stay up today, do the best

06:53.980 --> 06:54.980
to kind of answer questions.

06:54.980 --> 06:59.980
You may have easily used the wrong word, and my guess is that Mr. Adam probably used the wrong

06:59.980 --> 07:02.980
word because I'm satisfied that his action wasn't independent.

07:02.980 --> 07:07.980
Mr. Steven, you complain about being on the stand day after day.

07:07.980 --> 07:11.980
We gave you a rather long vacation, but you take a trip out the Montana and make speeches.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.980
You should be refreshed now so you can tell us the truth.

07:13.980 --> 07:14.980
It's a chance of being.

07:14.980 --> 07:16.980
I'll read that backly, Mark.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.980
I tell the truth.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.980
And I don't think the chairman ought to allow that kind of excitement to be made.

07:22.980 --> 07:23.980
Well?

07:23.980 --> 07:24.980
Well?

07:24.980 --> 07:27.980
Well, let's see if he can make it.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.980
Let's see what the thing's up there now.

07:30.980 --> 07:31.980
The truth is, the falsity.

07:31.980 --> 07:34.980
Let's see what the thing's up there now.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.980
He's talking to him and telling the truth from both days.

07:36.980 --> 07:40.980
If he had a mental lapse, so he can tell us that.

07:40.980 --> 07:41.980
But let's wait.

07:41.980 --> 07:49.980
They tell him only the two days, and I don't enjoy seeing the secretary come up here and counterdict himself on the road.

07:49.980 --> 07:51.980
But counterdict himself, he's here.

07:51.980 --> 07:52.980
He's out there.

07:52.980 --> 07:54.980
Counterdict himself, he has, and he'll point out the counterdiction.

07:54.980 --> 07:58.980
And see whether, but he's out of the way and telling the truth with the secretary in both days.

07:58.980 --> 07:59.980
Will you listen to carefully?

07:59.980 --> 08:05.980
He agrees that testimony of the first testimony.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.980
One eyed Mark.

08:07.980 --> 08:10.980
You'll both be for a moment with the secretary of guess.

08:10.980 --> 08:11.980
You're testing when he marks.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.980
You're the person in part, so then.

08:13.980 --> 08:17.980
The carbon copy of the students by Mark's.

08:18.980 --> 08:21.980
If you look up, let me read this to you, Mr. Secretary.

08:21.980 --> 08:26.980
And I wouldn't go over this again except you resented the fact that I told you that you couldn't be doing the truth.

08:26.980 --> 08:27.980
Both times.

08:27.980 --> 08:31.980
I would say that, all right, I would say that the result of the result is justified.

08:31.980 --> 08:35.980
And if it was a case of a bad memory, you can tell us if you were too tired of the time.

08:35.980 --> 08:36.980
You can tell us that.

08:37.980 --> 08:38.980
Um.

08:43.980 --> 08:46.980
Former McCarthy, do you know who you did or not?

08:46.980 --> 08:52.980
You did all the important Mr. Secretary to know, and I made him payed 1458 to 61.

08:52.980 --> 08:56.980
All right, it's all the important Mr. Secretary to know how common this particular night.

08:56.980 --> 09:01.980
Well, apparently, we've conceived the idea for this American pan against my staff.

09:01.980 --> 09:04.980
And I'd like to know who originated and who talked to whom.

09:04.980 --> 09:05.980
Like there is Steven.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.980
The effect was the origin of the land or any other time which I very much dealt.

09:09.980 --> 09:10.980
I have no knowledge of it.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.980
And I had nothing to do with it.

09:12.980 --> 09:13.980
Former McCarthy.

09:13.980 --> 09:14.980
I said, I had come that.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.980
That was just you were talking about.

09:16.980 --> 09:17.980
And I have no part of it.

09:17.980 --> 09:21.980
First of the rest of the day, we're actually talking to a, the do something much better.

09:24.980 --> 09:27.980
Both of you, you say you had, you had nothing to do with it?

09:27.980 --> 09:28.980
Absolutely nothing to do with it.

09:28.980 --> 09:32.980
It was your turn to know that I'm not a smear and I had nothing to do with it.

09:32.980 --> 09:36.980
Otherwise, you were throwing you an absolutely nothing to do with it because I used the word smear.

09:36.980 --> 09:37.980
That's the word you used.

09:37.980 --> 09:38.980
Right.

09:38.980 --> 09:39.980
It's a powerful word.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.980
That's what you want to put for a very much as pride.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.980
We'll have to run around the table Mr. Dickens.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.980
Chair passes, send us in my left.

09:45.980 --> 09:46.980
Wow.

09:46.980 --> 09:47.980
Send us in my right.

09:47.980 --> 09:50.980
So, well, for the McCarthy, we may continue.

09:50.980 --> 09:57.980
Now, the chair suggests that we have just about just 10 minutes left between now and the recess time

09:57.980 --> 10:02.980
and hopes that the question is going to be asked and the answer is obtained in that 10 minutes if possible.

10:02.980 --> 10:05.980
And Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

10:05.980 --> 10:12.980
This is somewhat out of character for Mr. Wells, but I would like to suggest that we continue until we do conclude with the lessons on that chair.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.980
We can, we'll have to put up the 10 minutes to go to Senator's have appointments after that 10 minutes.

10:16.980 --> 10:24.980
Mr. Chairman, could we ask the chair to order the official reporter to type up all the tests when he's taking this for a noon

10:24.980 --> 10:33.980
and get that to the earliest moment so we can put into the record the specific contradictions on a part of Mr. Stavon's contradictions on his seven lines.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.980
Can I have that available?

10:35.980 --> 10:37.980
Councilor Saez, anything else?

10:37.980 --> 10:40.980
We always can see the transcripts of the morning session before the after-intention begins.

10:40.980 --> 10:41.980
Very good. Thank you.

10:41.980 --> 11:07.980
Mr. Secretary, did you discuss with Mr. Adams the first that he had consulted with four newsmen on these charges before there were made available money centers?

11:08.980 --> 11:10.980
I think that was outside the...

11:10.980 --> 11:20.980
Mr. Wells is entirely correct. You remember Senator that this inquiry is confined to the state of the Secretary of May 19th?

11:20.980 --> 11:24.980
And that is outside of the scope of inquiry?

11:24.980 --> 11:26.980
We have point of the...

11:26.980 --> 11:34.980
And we have heard of my new father, Senator, that Mr. Stevens will appear later as a general witness that we signed this question, maybe probably has.

11:34.980 --> 11:44.980
I assume that the gentlemen did not get the import of the question. My point is that I'm telling him prior to uttering up those four newsmen who are jointly responsible.

11:44.980 --> 11:50.980
Their advice was sought. If you can testify on her oaths that they have been at three of them have enemies of mine.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.980
The other paper has been a trauma poem.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.980
Paul, is that question would be proper?

11:55.980 --> 11:57.980
That's the plan when you're in for this thing.

11:58.980 --> 12:10.980
Mr. Stevens, I'd like to ask you now whether or not you discuss with Mr. Adams.

12:10.980 --> 12:18.980
The fact that before he made these charges for the written up, while everything was written up, he discussed the matter with four newsmen.

12:18.980 --> 12:21.980
He discussed that with me.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.980
You asked me the other day, so I'm fine.

12:23.980 --> 12:26.980
Now, this is repitious again, but let's go into it.

12:26.980 --> 12:31.980
You asked me all about this the other day, and I testified at all in the record, and if I may, I'd like to stand on the advantage.

12:31.980 --> 12:36.980
Well, your testimony, the other day, Mr. Stevens, was that he had only talked to L. Claw, by the way.

12:36.980 --> 12:43.980
Since then, Mr. Adams has testified, instead of being told he discussed the matter with Mr. Homer Bigger, the New York paper.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.980
He did. I didn't finish.

12:46.980 --> 12:59.980
With Mr. Murray Murder, Mr. Phil Potter, and he just about also took a trip with Mr. Al Friendly of the local daily worker.

12:59.980 --> 13:05.980
Now, my question is, did you discuss with him?

13:06.980 --> 13:16.980
Why he had these conferences with individuals, all of whom is papers, have consistently opposed any exposure of communism,

13:16.980 --> 13:22.980
consistently opposed any investigating committees, and have consistently attacked the chairman of this committee.

13:22.980 --> 13:27.980
Well, you're curious, no point he sought their advice. I don't believe he sought their advice.

13:27.980 --> 13:30.980
Well, did you discuss the matter with him?

13:31.980 --> 13:35.980
Well, anything about it until a long time afterwards, and we covered that in my testimony the other day, Senator.

13:35.980 --> 13:38.980
Did you discuss the matter with Mr. Secretary?

13:38.980 --> 13:46.980
And I know, but Mr. Adams was told me if he had sought any advice. I'm confident he did not.

13:46.980 --> 13:50.980
Did you discuss the matter with Mr....

13:50.980 --> 13:55.980
No, I didn't discuss the matter with Mr. Adams until a long time afterwards, which I covered with my testimony with you the other day.

13:55.980 --> 13:57.980
But then you did discuss the matter with him the other day afterwards?

13:57.980 --> 14:02.980
I mean, he told me a long time afterwards about Mr. Al's talk.

14:02.980 --> 14:06.980
I just testified on that, it's all in here somewhere, Senator.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.980
Did he tell you about the other three?

14:08.980 --> 14:12.980
I don't recall what he did, no. One name is the only thing I remember.

14:12.980 --> 14:18.980
Would you say that he was violating his position here at Legal Council?

14:19.980 --> 14:24.980
If he discussed with foreign newsmen who is sworn...

14:24.980 --> 14:30.980
It's like that for me, he testified he knew where enemies of mine, and he's just been there writing against me.

14:30.980 --> 14:34.980
Would you say he's violating his trust to go to them and get advice on how to prepare charges?

14:34.980 --> 14:37.980
I don't believe he did, though, for so-and-for advice.

14:37.980 --> 14:38.980
Did you ask him?

14:38.980 --> 14:39.980
I think we ought to ask him.

14:39.980 --> 14:40.980
I hear on this panel, they did.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.980
Did you ask him whether he got advice on it?

14:42.980 --> 14:43.980
No, I didn't.

14:44.980 --> 14:49.980
Did you ask him what Mr. Al's talk was doing in his office examining the files?

14:49.980 --> 14:51.980
No, I didn't.

14:51.980 --> 14:53.980
Have you seen Mr. Al's talk testimony?

14:53.980 --> 14:54.980
No, I have not.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.980
Don't you think that you should see Mr. Secretary?

14:56.980 --> 14:58.980
I have so.

14:58.980 --> 14:59.980
Is it available to me?

14:59.980 --> 15:00.980
I have.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.980
I have so much to ask.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.980
Mr. Al's talk hasn't.

15:06.980 --> 15:11.980
Now, I understand your testimony, but you did not discuss with him his conversation with a bigger than anybody else.

15:11.980 --> 15:12.980
That's right.

15:13.980 --> 15:18.980
Now, you said that you made suggestions for the preparation of the charges.

15:19.980 --> 15:20.980
That's right.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.980
Please do make this a suggestion, too.

15:22.980 --> 15:30.980
I had him to Mr. Baum and Mr. Adams mention, too.

15:30.980 --> 15:33.980
No, I'm asking this, Mr. Secretary.

15:33.980 --> 15:40.980
If suggestions seem to Mr. Adams from a conference of White House aid, the Attorney General,

15:41.980 --> 15:43.980
would you consider them in a nature of an order?

15:43.980 --> 15:44.980
I would not.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.980
Would you consider a suggestion by Sherman Adams in a nature of an order?

15:50.980 --> 15:51.980
I would not.

15:51.980 --> 15:56.980
You know that Mr. Adams acted upon those suggestions.

15:58.980 --> 16:00.980
I wish Mr. Adams were talking about, kind of.

16:00.980 --> 16:02.980
Mr. John Adams.

16:03.980 --> 16:04.980
Will you repeat the question?

16:04.980 --> 16:08.980
You know that Mr. John Adams acted upon these suggestions of Mr. Sherman Adams.

16:09.980 --> 16:14.980
Remely that the charges be put in writing, may go and visit these countries.

16:14.980 --> 16:16.980
I don't know whether he did or not.

16:16.980 --> 16:21.980
I know if I've testified here this morning, but as a good lawyer, he's put down some memorandum.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.980
Got his thoughts together in the form of a file of notes.

16:25.980 --> 16:29.980
You know that he did not do that as a good lawyer in the White House conference?

16:31.980 --> 16:32.980
I didn't hear it.

16:33.980 --> 16:35.980
I didn't say you knew that as a good lawyer, as you say.

16:35.980 --> 16:37.980
He did not do that as a last of the White House conference.

16:38.980 --> 16:40.980
There was no White House conference, but I know anything about it.

16:40.980 --> 16:42.980
I mean the Justice Department's Secretary.

16:43.980 --> 16:46.980
It's he bought two or three days after that as I understand it, but it's down.

16:48.980 --> 16:53.980
You know that that was an independent action on his part as a result of a suggestion, probably.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.980
An independent action as a result of a suggestion.

16:56.980 --> 16:57.980
That's right.

16:57.980 --> 17:02.980
Did you know that Mr. Rogers told me when suggested you see Senator McCollum?

17:03.980 --> 17:04.980
I'll end that later.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.980
You know I came home from the Florey's.

17:06.980 --> 17:10.980
Do you think then he went to see Mr. McCollum as an independent action immediately?

17:10.980 --> 17:11.980
I do.

17:11.980 --> 17:16.980
In other words, there was no connection between the two.

17:17.980 --> 17:23.980
I'm sure Mr. Rogers would be the first to say that he wouldn't order Mr. Adams or Mayor or anyone else over there to do anything.

17:24.980 --> 17:29.980
Mr. Secretary, you know that your legal counsel followed all the suggestions made of that meeting.

17:30.980 --> 17:35.980
You know that when Bill Rogers told him up and said I'll make an appointment with Senator McCollum?

17:35.980 --> 17:37.980
The appointment is May.

17:37.980 --> 17:39.980
Adams went to see Senator McCollum.

17:40.980 --> 17:44.980
Did you think with some millions of American people listening to you,

17:44.980 --> 17:47.980
you want to know as the Secretary of the Army said there was no connection?

17:48.980 --> 17:51.980
But he just had that meeting over there and then made all the decisions himself.

17:52.980 --> 17:53.980
It was a miracle incident.

17:53.980 --> 17:55.980
But he started to prepare the charges.

17:56.980 --> 17:58.980
Which of the result of me hearing after the meeting?

17:58.980 --> 18:01.980
He expected anyone to announce the brand to believe that.

18:02.980 --> 18:05.980
Senator McCollum, I've been over and over and over on this subject with you.

18:06.980 --> 18:11.980
And my attention is that Mr. Adams received certain suggestions.

18:11.980 --> 18:12.980
They were not orders.

18:13.980 --> 18:18.980
And I'm sure that nobody that attended those meetings would say that they were orders.

18:19.980 --> 18:21.980
I'll be on the right at him to punish.

18:21.980 --> 18:25.980
How many suggestions were I meant for Sherman Adams if any? Did you ever ignore?

18:26.980 --> 18:27.980
What's that?

18:28.980 --> 18:30.980
Did you ever ignore any suggestions from Sherman Adams?

18:30.980 --> 18:31.980
I imagine I have.

18:32.980 --> 18:33.980
Did you name one?

18:35.980 --> 18:36.980
I think that's the only thing I can do.

18:36.980 --> 18:41.980
I deal with the issue at hand if he had other suggestions than other matters and ignore it.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.980
Did you do it for the credibility of the Westerns?

18:43.980 --> 18:49.980
He says that after this conference, which Adams says that the decisions were made,

18:51.980 --> 18:53.980
for some reason others, the Secretary says no decisions were made.

18:53.980 --> 18:55.980
There's nothing to do with the subsequent act.

18:56.980 --> 19:01.980
The Unifact says that the suggestion from the Justice Department was not considered in order from Sherman Adams with no.

19:01.980 --> 19:02.980
I think the test is credibility.

19:02.980 --> 19:06.980
I'd like to know if one thing was in order for suggestions from Adams who...

19:09.980 --> 19:14.980
Mr. Gerrard, if John Adams had decided that he did not want to go see Senator McCollum,

19:14.980 --> 19:18.980
he would not have gone and nothing would have happened.

19:18.980 --> 19:23.980
Did you ever ignore a suggestion made by Mr. Sherman Adams in White House?

19:24.980 --> 19:26.980
I say I'd take a spot in White House.

19:26.980 --> 19:27.980
Did you think of one?

19:27.980 --> 19:28.980
No, I can't think of it.

19:28.980 --> 19:31.980
My question was, would the property at this point bring it out?

19:31.980 --> 19:33.980
Mr. Perry, let's go to the case.

19:40.980 --> 19:45.980
Now, Mr. Secretary, are you familiar with Mr. Adams' testimony?

19:45.980 --> 19:47.980
I might withdraw that and say this.

19:48.980 --> 19:59.980
You know that Mr. Adams sought with Mr. Joseph Alsoff, a columnist who was consistently written articles on favorable to the Senate of McLaughlin and everybody else investigating time units.

19:59.980 --> 20:03.980
You know that Mr. Adams showed that Mr. Alsoff was filed for this matter, don't you?

20:03.980 --> 20:05.980
You told us about the other day.

20:05.980 --> 20:06.980
I know that he's...

20:06.980 --> 20:08.980
He told Mr. Alsoff to talk to him about it.

20:08.980 --> 20:10.980
It's what he did when he was in shock.

20:10.980 --> 20:13.980
I don't know exactly what transpired. I wasn't there.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.980
Well, you know that you're taking Mr. Adams' work, right?

20:16.980 --> 20:17.980
I was.

20:17.980 --> 20:18.980
What?

20:18.980 --> 20:19.980
Well, Mr. Adams was dead. That's...

20:19.980 --> 20:22.980
He showed Mr. Alsoff. I believe it's entire portfolio in the matter.

20:22.980 --> 20:23.980
Without a proper act?

20:23.980 --> 20:25.980
If he said so, then he'd undoubtedly did.

20:25.980 --> 20:27.980
Without a proper act, sir.

20:27.980 --> 20:28.980
Was it a proper act?

20:28.980 --> 20:42.980
Yes, to take Army Memoranda and Army files and hand them over to a newsman who was possible to a Army Memoranda about a congressional committee in turn to move to a newsman writing article, or a possible threat to me.

20:43.980 --> 20:44.980
Was that a...

20:44.980 --> 20:46.980
In your opinion, the Secretary of the Army has proper act.

20:46.980 --> 20:47.980
Well, first...

20:47.980 --> 20:49.980
First, my guy wasn't doing anything like that myself.

20:49.980 --> 20:50.980
Doing something.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.980
How is expiring?

20:52.980 --> 20:55.980
All time is expiring for the money that we've just until 2 p.m.

21:01.980 --> 21:03.980
You have job search, Garmin, mother and aunt.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.980
Where you'll keep coming, do I do?

21:13.980 --> 21:19.980
Sheriff, we're starting by advising our guests that we're happy to have you here.

21:19.980 --> 21:23.980
As I guess, pending the conduct of public business.

21:23.980 --> 21:29.980
The Sheriff's field, he should advise you as he has advised your predecessors who have listed the chambers.

21:29.980 --> 21:35.980
That you come here in conformity with a standing rule of this committee,

21:35.980 --> 21:40.980
which is that there are to be no manifestations of approval or disapproval of any time,

21:40.980 --> 21:43.980
at any time, on the part of any of the members of the audience.

21:43.980 --> 21:48.980
The officers and the plain clothesmen and the audience have standing instructions from the committee

21:48.980 --> 21:55.980
to immediately and politely remove from the room anybody at any time who violates those instructions.

21:55.980 --> 22:00.980
Because you will then have canceled the agreement by which you came here as I guess.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.980
The audience is a beneficent.

22:02.980 --> 22:04.980
We trust they will continue to be so.

22:04.980 --> 22:15.980
The committee continues to appreciate the very splendid service rendered in that connection by the officers who are in control of the decorum in the rear of the room.

22:15.980 --> 22:26.980
I believe that F.C. conclusion of the morning meeting, Senator McFratty and Mr. Cohn had just concluded a 10 minute period.

22:26.980 --> 22:31.980
And with that conviction, I begin by asking Council Jenkins whether he has any questions at this time.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.980
Chairman, I have no further questions.

22:33.980 --> 22:37.980
The Chair has none to any of my colleagues at my list have any questions at this time.

22:37.980 --> 22:42.980
Chairman, I have received a copy of the White House press release of December 14th,

22:42.980 --> 22:44.980
which probably should be included in the record.

22:44.980 --> 22:47.980
You might have been a properly distributed member and included in the record.

22:47.980 --> 22:49.980
Any questions?

22:49.980 --> 22:53.980
No questions at my list? Any questions at my right? Mr. Welch, any questions?

22:53.980 --> 22:54.980
No.

22:54.980 --> 22:56.980
Senator McFratty, you are Mr. Cohn.

22:56.980 --> 23:00.980
Mr. Cohn, we will put the record I would like to see at the first of on the news.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.980
The copy of the White House release is another copy of 10 ejections.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.980
We will send it down the end of the day.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.980
I have only one copy.

23:10.980 --> 23:13.980
Mr. Mani will bring you a copy.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.980
Which one is it?

23:15.980 --> 23:17.980
No. That's the other release of Mr. Mani.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.980
He wants to one that Mr. Jackson had just applied for the record.

23:21.980 --> 23:25.980
Mr. Welch has concluded a cabinet in our meeting.

23:25.980 --> 23:30.980
He is coming in our weekly pass of action to pay gladden that we can pass it around with the committee members.

23:30.980 --> 23:32.980
And the other comes.

23:32.980 --> 23:34.980
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman?

23:34.980 --> 23:36.980
Yes, it's quite, it's quite strong.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.980
I will be back in the record press.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.980
I suggest Mr. Jackson to meet you.

23:42.980 --> 23:50.980
This is in response to the request that I made this morning of Mr. Welch,

23:50.980 --> 23:53.980
or whoever was produced.

23:53.980 --> 23:58.980
The final immediate release, dated December 14, 1953, James C. Haggard,

23:58.980 --> 24:01.980
the press secretary to the press in the White House.

24:01.980 --> 24:05.980
During the present recites of the General Assembly of the United Nations,

24:05.980 --> 24:11.980
Ambassador Henry Cavillard Jr. will serve here at the White House as special adviser to the President

24:11.980 --> 24:14.980
on United Nations and other matters.

24:14.980 --> 24:18.980
Ambassador Lodge will have an office and executive office for the press.

24:18.980 --> 24:22.980
He will, of course, continue to the United Nations duty duties,

24:22.980 --> 24:25.980
of the security confl and any other sessions that might be held.

24:25.980 --> 24:28.980
Very good.

24:28.980 --> 24:33.980
You can't demonstrate it now, Mr. Coil and I send them a question.

24:33.980 --> 24:38.980
Mr. Chairman, I have just a very few questions to ask.

24:38.980 --> 24:42.980
I frankly don't know until their ask, but they're not the,

24:42.980 --> 24:50.980
will be pertinent to the circumscribed carry of the recovery today.

24:50.980 --> 24:55.980
For the benefit of counsel, Mr. Chairman, may I say that I propose to ask Mr. Steven

24:55.980 --> 25:03.980
about the conversations he's had with certain centers in regard to putting out the chart.

25:03.980 --> 25:07.980
Until the answer comes, I won't know whether or not those conversations

25:07.980 --> 25:12.980
had to do with putting out the charges or whether they had to do something else.

25:12.980 --> 25:17.980
Specifically, I propose to ask him about the two conversations that he had with

25:17.980 --> 25:19.980
the intersiming.

25:19.980 --> 25:22.980
Now, lastly, I don't have any idea what is discussed.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.980
I don't know whether anything's going to be putting out the charges or not.

25:25.980 --> 25:28.980
I would just like to ask you two questions on that.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.980
Mr. Chairman, may I have a point of order?

25:30.980 --> 25:32.980
I want you to find a point of order.

25:32.980 --> 25:39.980
I would like to say that the reason that the questions, the conversations that I had

25:39.980 --> 25:46.980
with Secretary Steven are known is because I told this committee

25:46.980 --> 25:50.980
that I had had several conversations with Secretary Steven,

25:50.980 --> 25:54.980
resulting from, as I remember, two visits with me.

25:54.980 --> 26:00.980
One, when he came to CME, but with General Ridgeway, the Chief of Staff of the Army.
