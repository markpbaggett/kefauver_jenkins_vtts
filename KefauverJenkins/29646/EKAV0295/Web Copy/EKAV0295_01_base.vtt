00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
I'm not a musician but I'm a fan of the sketch geek for the nationwide science.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
He's the fool who's meaning to be the best.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Can I speak over?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
You must have been making a spring time.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Well, maybe that's the first piece I've just had much nearer adjournment than a little rest, Jonathan.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
That is, unless the study gets around to putting an old day on the crime investigation.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
But if that's done, the first big math time off we've had old summer fall and I'm afraid you're in the winter.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
That's what you're having at the heaven and frozen risk of stuff you've asked me about.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
And what's the first time you're attending this summer?

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
If you're gonna keep on, I know you like to include as many items possible on this program.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
So, just taking the energy to the people's history.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
You're out about a full smash of animals.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Just mail to the religious heritage.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
You just about everybody in here.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Everybody seems to be in ten.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What do you think of his act?

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
The Charlie, not only gets everybody in every kind of city and town, but of course there's a lot of interest all over the United States.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
As you say, Charlie, this order affects just about all of us who live within a city limits.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
But we have a real problem here.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
The post office department is present operating at a loss of a little more than $500 million a year.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
The postmaster general, Mr. Jessica Donnellson, who used to live at Chattanooga by the way,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
is a very sincere man trying to do a good job in my job.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
He's a career man having come up through the ranks and a local post office to follow you through the top position.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
General Donnellson has stopped the balances budget by asking times to raise post office rates.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
But this office so far has not been successful.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
So to meet in plain for this operating deficit, Mr. Donnellson thinks we've been got along with 10,000 fewer employees.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
With one mail delivery each day is all the residents who see the fair folks.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
It might be intended that one mail a day is sufficient for American homes, but I started the people going to be happier.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
We must do something and right now, first of all, to meet up.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
The only thing we can do is to go to some increased and post-group rates.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
The Internet is going to be for increased and recrimination is not being addressed.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Yes, but included many recommendations.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
The recommendations were that the post office department put on a modern business-like place.

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
The recommendation provided for our new accounting system, which would enable us to move across to the various services.

03:05.000 --> 03:15.000
I always thought that it might be an error to start the subsidies of the government that the government pays to airlines and railroads for falling mail to the post office of the department.

03:15.000 --> 03:23.000
The Google Commission estimates that about $200 million a year to be saved if this recommendation were adopted.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
What's your opinion about these recommendations because we can take smooth measures to get that a politics?

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
Well, I don't know about that proposal yet, Carlos. The farest numbers of the cows will be most of the recommending to post-masters of concern.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
Sometimes I think they might have more than that if they were not to tell just like one from the list of three to fill these places.

03:43.000 --> 03:57.000
Somebody made the remark that when a Congressman considers the three names on eligible registers and appoints one of them as post-masters, he winds up the two of the applicants mad at him and won him drugs.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
But at least that has been the fellow who has met these many by the head, loud and deep and feathery and close to life.

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
At the same time, Charlie, the mere fact that an applicant makes the hash rate on the civil services examination does not not assert in mean that he would be the best post-master.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
A good postmaster not only needs education, training and experience.

04:18.000 --> 04:28.000
He needs also to be a good administrator to handle these tasks. To be a part of a good public relations man who got along with the people who adopted the search.

04:28.000 --> 04:38.000
I would say that they are a good argument on post-time. But as a past, no matter I have a serious task that the congressman will take away that type of power.

04:38.000 --> 04:48.000
Personally, I think we would be able to do better business in Congress if we didn't have the capacity to talk with an eye-blower much to see some kind of this some other work.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
Speaking of the who the recommendation center. What about these people who write who defend the time of their community?

04:55.000 --> 05:05.000
If you just want to meet about the role of the system of force, then they come along later, raising the scheme about who the support of these recommendations is really good.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
While they say the least, we began to doubt the validity of our recommendations in either instance.

05:10.000 --> 05:20.000
We do have a whole lot of that urgency and economy and it's the same time urging and appropriations to take care of some particular entries that they are concerned about.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
Everybody wants economy of course. We know that we cannot suspend you and definitely to operate in the rest.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
But renting economy and taking the necessary steps to get it are two entirely different things.

05:33.000 --> 05:44.000
It is a mistake for folks to read the headlines or listen to generalities on the radio about some of the economy's proposal and then to write us to adopt it without knowing more about it.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
For instance, one of the Hoover's commission recommendations is to subsidize certain of the operations of the Tennessee Valley Authority here in Washington.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
And take away the regional management. We think that's the purpose of this so much to keep the A's in stress.

05:58.000 --> 06:09.000
I would guess that 95% of the good Tennessee people who wrote us urging the whole hall to adopt some of the Hoover reports didn't appreciate the fact that this item was included in it.

06:09.000 --> 06:19.000
And also we have a lot of people writing us to adopt all of the Hoover recommendations and at the same time urging that we keep the core engineers as a separate entity.

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
I think the ought to be a separate entity but the Hoover report is recommendation once we put it under the interior of the bus.

06:28.000 --> 06:38.000
It's much better to take the Hoover recommendations one of the time bearing in mind that the object of the recommendations is to kind of not.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
And the mayor is seeking this in his office.

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
I noticed that the 21 ladies proposals to buy out should actually be more opposition than itself.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
I think we ever see complaints about just about every one of these proposals.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
And it's a difficult thing to discern what it is to people back home not us to do.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
That really is the best that we know how.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
Another thing was one of the most common 24 hours period that is with the thrust.

07:07.000 --> 07:16.000
There's a file of attention in the House on the forces to make direct interregional position and endorsements in relation to draft the state department.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
We might have to use those for the right to use them.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
I think it's very difficult for a person to come to the House for a decision of making the state of law.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
And since it became a decision of the Pacific State of the Blue, I know not only in its full law,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
but we are already in the war.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
It's right to be declared a decision.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
I thought she could gain so much time in the President.

07:43.000 --> 07:51.000
Yes, Charlie. I think more and more of us are realizing for the first time what Joe Stalin meant in 1945.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
And he said, Russia is the destructive series. This is not war, not peace.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
Charlie, I tell you, if we don't wake up and use this, it's hard to refuse such a small mistake we have to solve this situation.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
I'm afraid that we're going to be in part of very bad time.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
I don't want to alarm anybody unnecessarily. I don't believe in war, I'm just...

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Unless we take some bone and stuff and take them very soon.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Some incident is going to such a farce another competition.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
We made well faith that the Estritians took our heads in the stand like a monster, and those are ours to be ours.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
But then, what can we do?

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
I've thought that so many times I'm almost ashamed to stay here again.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
But if our nation is studying motion and machine-wrestling,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
and we're meeting up with three people who have negotiated their life as a country,

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
we will see some instruments immediately and we'll be at altitude in my opinion.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
Russia has every reason to believe that the United States is not going to do anything until she has forced them to.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
By that time, Russia will be ready for whatever we can do with our faith.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Well, if Russia has even an opinion, why doesn't she just plan war?

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Well, I should say, Charlie, we mustn't forget that Russia is a dictator.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
The government can do it as it seems in each time, as well as in war.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
The Communist have already overrun China.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
They have made rapid gains everywhere without using any other manpower or firepower.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Russia would be still hard to believe to invite him to tax by the firing war,

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
and he's making such great strides without doing such things.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
But, instead of the coal war, we have already undeclared war.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
At least so far, Russia is concerned. That's a good thing.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Yes, sir, that's what I'm saying. It's a fact that the mass in the coal war is big.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
Yes, how do you think you're meeting up with the United Nations before the possibility of settling the nuclear health net?

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
For this reason, Russia wants and must have time.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Time is what we are wasting and wasting the Russian benefit.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Being a dictator's gift is not such a force.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Russia can do everything in the absence of war, as he can do in the presence of war.

10:05.000 --> 10:12.000
We have never learned that full-calitarian government's bank heavily on the coal-moving actions of the mass.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Dictatorships being the advantage while we are making up our minds.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Now, if we get into another war, what will we do?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Or we will unite with our friends?

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
Russia doesn't want us to unite with our friends, but she doesn't declare war.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
That what we'll want to do is we begin to do the very thing as she fears most.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
If we start working out of time to set a rate, she will slow down her off of tension.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
She will begin to smile, where she now smiles. She will focus peace.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Hoping as she can lay us again into conflict.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Once we feel the dangers, the immediate dangers have.

10:48.000 --> 10:56.000
And it's likely to happen too, unless we continue to conclude this great plan for unification of the three people who the world.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
But there is a whole Russia's hidden three actions in the three countries.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
The whole of the Finland has started the best way to break up the federalization plans,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
what the attackers have been participating in.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, that isn't likely to happen.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
You have to remember, Stalin, as Russia is playing for time.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
The Finland was recognized and is not in a touch on any of these nominations,

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
which would be considered as the touch on all of them, by all of them.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
It's a relief. It's a relief for an immediate war,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
and Russia does not want to go at this time.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
The Soviet government has proved over and over again,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
that time is the commodity that she was willing to expand.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
Nearly ever proposed what that government is for a five-year plan or a ten-year plan.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
If they don't get it done in five or ten years, this plan may come probably with another long-range plan.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Now, this may be a far-fetched question.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
If you start any unprecedented actions of the year, a lengthy campaign,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
might invite a new fact and lead a war.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
You can say we're taking that case here.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
Or, naturally, our politicians have been unceded for answering questions like that.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
But you have asked it on behalf of not-seekful and actual answer it in that way.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
The underlying purpose of my land-becune in resolution is to do the very thing

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
while we are not at war that we would be forced to do if we were to.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
The my way of thinking is to keep me of step.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
We have been taking with the Marshalls program,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
the arms and implementation program,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
the Atlantic Shack and so forth,

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
are equally alarming to the Kremlin as well as the first motions for uniting economically, militarily,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
and in other ways, under master's rule.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
Honestly, because I think Russia wants more than anything else additional cheap times,

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
I doubt that anything we can do is short of taking some address and military action against them,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
with the vote for Russia's vote.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I'll tell you this.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
We are getting nowhere fast for the measures we are taking now.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I'm on our way to adopt the largest plan.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
They've voted for truth.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
That's limitedly kept our way of benefiting the future.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I'm willing to take for not people, for our children, for ourselves,

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
whatever the chance is in favor of making a real bid, for real peace, for a long time.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
The only way to keep them having more of war is to keep the situation to make the peace

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
as effective as possible.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
I'm willing to cite the peace, that's what I'm trying to do right now.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
And keep it as a positive thing, not just the absence of the vote.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
The gain of positive so we must take positive action.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
I want to use for our time and for all time, it's positive.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm willing to be daring if I need to leave the together.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
I doubt that we should get it in any other matter.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I doubt that we should have a great national bankruptcy,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
unless we strike down for a long time the greed of war.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
That's my answer to this.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Thank you very, very much for the good people.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Ladies and gentlemen, once again, we have heard that we should afford a significant deal

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
with the people.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
We invite you to be making a decision very next week,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
because that's the key problem we're trying to make.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
If you need to protect and don't advance,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
this is all I do to let.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Until that time, on the same day.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
This is actually a two-barber, and God in me say,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
so long for now, so you can do that for us.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
You're now, you're now.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I have to use our time to go ahead.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Very soon, so we'll have to take this.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Well, let's go over to the Capitol Tower, George.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
All right.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
There's all this to lunch, George.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Thank you, Senator.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Hello.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Thank you.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Three minutes.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Okay.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Two minutes.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Bye.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
George, if you need to decide to move a little ball game tonight, let me know.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I'll do this on the road.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Thank you.
