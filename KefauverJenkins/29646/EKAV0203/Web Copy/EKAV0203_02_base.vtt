00:00.000 --> 00:10.760
But there was working in the government's winning office in a room who had the secret not

00:10.760 --> 00:15.440
only of the army and navy, but of just about every sense of government agency and existence.

00:15.440 --> 00:20.400
But there was working in the composition room at the government's winning office, a man

00:20.400 --> 00:27.080
who had been not only a communist, but who had taken papers and secrets from the government's

00:27.080 --> 00:31.560
winning office, that night taken him home with him without authority.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.920
Those facts were developed by Senator Dirtchen in executive session.

00:34.920 --> 00:38.960
Public hearings were held and this man Edward Rothschild, his name was Dirtchen claimed

00:38.960 --> 00:42.320
the Fifth Amendment before the Fifth Amendment, while currently working for the government's

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
winning office.

00:43.320 --> 00:49.080
He claimed the Fifth Amendment has to whether he was currently in 1953 engaged in SDNG against

00:49.080 --> 00:51.280
the United States in the government's winning office.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.920
On the ground that if the answer questions had answered might tend to incriminate him.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.600
There was a suspension of an army to call them, let's don't go in the certificate.

00:58.600 --> 01:09.920
There is no part of the duty of the army to investigate the government winning office,

01:09.920 --> 01:11.480
but it's none of the office.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.360
That is an entire distinct and separate agency.

01:14.360 --> 01:19.960
The only part of the army that happened is that the government planning office is a considerable

01:19.960 --> 01:23.240
amount of secret work or classified work for the army.

01:23.240 --> 01:28.120
I know that a couple of other agencies, which since they worked over to the government's

01:28.120 --> 01:32.200
winning office, they came very much concerned as our investigation got underway and the

01:32.200 --> 01:33.440
Fifth Amendment remains to be made.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.440
I don't recall that we heard any.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.280
Now, where are the suspensions in the government winning office?

01:37.280 --> 01:39.480
There were a call and number.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.640
I think that I want to check this.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.640
I think there was 13 or 15 and there was a lot more than suspension.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.680
By the way, I said we can't want to ask you this question, Mr. Koon.

01:48.200 --> 01:53.440
During the period, this obvious investigation of the government winning office, those

01:53.440 --> 01:56.440
were an option of the McCarthy and you are you.

01:56.440 --> 02:01.360
Calls to be subpoenaed and appeared in the service and the required to appear in the

02:01.360 --> 02:04.480
secretary's station, members of the lawyelry board.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.360
They appeared not only in executive session, but they had been testified fully in both executive

02:09.360 --> 02:10.360
and public sessions.

02:10.360 --> 02:15.560
With any question raised at that time about your authority, they had the members of the

02:15.560 --> 02:19.200
law in the board, so could you none of all.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.520
Was there any presidential or other directly for anything such as being Mr. Koon?

02:23.520 --> 02:28.360
No, a situation of any presidential director or a blackout order or anything else was made.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.360
They all changed.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.680
They all testified and the head of the government's printing office gave us not only

02:33.680 --> 02:37.000
looked at the service, but so in complete cooperation.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.440
Now Mr. Koon, in order to channel our course of investigation, let's have you here for

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
a moment.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
The target.

02:46.440 --> 02:57.280
The target being now as I have a himmdom to be first, that the army of Mr. Koon and Mr.

02:57.280 --> 03:04.120
Adam, talk to the spreaders, the work of the importance of the work of the McCarthy

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
Committee.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.120
Right or not?

03:06.120 --> 03:07.120
The search.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
Number one.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.120
You saw the open saying the army and I wonder if I might say this.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.120
I see it, I'm not.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.120
I'm just just the even on.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.120
I want to say it.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.120
I'm not going to get one.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.120
I'm going to say it again.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
There are any hearings.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.720
This committee never investigated the United States Army as such.

03:20.720 --> 03:25.800
I know the Committee has chairman, as members in myself, other secret respect for the United

03:25.800 --> 03:28.800
States Army as they have the government of which it's applied.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.120
We have no respect for the communists who have infiltrated this.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
No proof of communists.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.360
We have infiltrated that great army, all for the people in that great army who have covered

03:38.360 --> 03:39.360
up this communist infiltration.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.360
And that is what we investigate.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.360
They were not the army.

03:41.360 --> 03:46.360
That's the huge number one charge in the specifications of Mr. Koon and Mr. Adam.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.360
That's the way.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.360
I have a number one charge in the McCarthy Committee.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.760
So on that, we did not make charges.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.760
We gave an answer.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.960
We told us the facts were as we saw it.

03:56.960 --> 03:57.960
We did not make charges.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.360
We initiated nothing.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.360
We were going about out this.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.360
I know, ma'am, it's Koon and we're getting along wonderfully now.

04:04.360 --> 04:09.360
If you just move me directly, thank you, sorry, I'm sure that I think it'd be the greatest

04:09.360 --> 04:12.360
ex-provider that's ever thought about in this case.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.360
All right, I'm doing it so far and I compliment you for doing it.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.360
Thank you.

04:16.360 --> 04:22.760
But number one charge, our number one allegation or statement, we're not going to different

04:22.760 --> 04:23.760
NJs between those words.

04:23.760 --> 04:29.360
Any document prepared as my request to the Johnson for this committee is that Mr. Steven

04:29.360 --> 04:34.360
and Mr. Adam thought to this committee the words are the importance of the words of the

04:34.360 --> 04:36.360
McCarthy Committee is that right or not?

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
Suspension.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.360
Suspensionally, yes, there was public.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.360
Number two.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.360
When you made a statement, what the public should do?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.360
I don't know if there are any allegation.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
What I'm trying to do is dismiss the charges.

04:46.360 --> 04:51.360
I would like to give specific facts, specific statements, and try to avoid characterizing, generally,

04:51.360 --> 04:57.360
what people's sounded like or what their emotions were, things that I can write.

04:57.360 --> 05:04.360
Number two, it is a label to be stated in the documents prepared by you and Senator McCarthy

05:04.360 --> 05:12.360
that Mr. Steven and Mr. Adam thought to this event or bring about a miscontinuous hearing

05:12.360 --> 05:20.360
vestigation of size, subversive, and persecuted in the Army, in that case.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
I did.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
And particularly, a Ford Mama.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
That is true.

05:24.360 --> 05:32.360
And, certainly and likely, that there was an attempt on the part of Mr. Steven and Mr. Adam.

05:32.360 --> 05:39.360
Perhaps you'll see the documents a substantial attempt to prevent Senator McCarthy and Mr.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.360
and the Investigating members of the Lawyer's Board.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.360
Is that right?

05:43.360 --> 05:44.360
That is true.

05:44.360 --> 05:50.360
Now, two of those three statements are charges and I'll probably refer to Mr. Chigley's

05:51.360 --> 05:57.360
In place in the main, the allegations of Senator McCarthy and Mr. Cohn, I guess Mr.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.360
Steven and Mr. Adam.

05:58.360 --> 06:02.360
So, certainly, essentially, an essential part of the pick list.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.360
All right.

06:03.360 --> 06:14.360
Now, then, Mr. Cohn, as I say, for the purpose of the right to die in the James, we want to channel our confession within the area and bounds of those three allegations.

06:15.360 --> 06:29.360
When the Democratic Committee began investigating the infiltration of subversive fires of furlough in the United States Army, very shortly after the committee was organized, I would say it's our February of 1950s.

06:29.360 --> 06:32.360
I was the nature of that work.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.360
Well, I didn't really need to know this.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.360
Not at all.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.360
I wanted to give you all the information.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.360
The thing came about in this way.

06:42.360 --> 07:01.360
We received information, various members of the Fair Freed, these information, that the Communist Party in this country, as another country, was trying to and has succeeded to some extent in infiltrating the United States Army and various of its installations.

07:01.360 --> 07:05.360
That was a historically known fact that they were trying to do that.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.360
I don't think they can be any bad about it.

07:07.360 --> 07:14.360
And on that point, there is just one paragraph I wanted to read to you, which I think makes this picture quite clear.

07:14.360 --> 07:27.360
You need to know that paragraph, Mr. Jenkins, comes from the 21 conditions of admission into the Communist International, which is this worldwide communist conspiracy, thinking the destruction of this nation and every other nation.

07:27.360 --> 07:34.360
And that paragraph concerns the Communist plan to infiltrate armies in three countries of the world and it reaches the obvious.

07:35.360 --> 07:44.360
The obligation to spread communist ideas includes the particular necessity of persistent, systematic, top-against in the UN.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.360
For other top-against is forbidden by exceptional laws.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.360
It must be carried on illegally.

07:50.360 --> 08:03.360
The abandonment of such work with the equivalence of the trail of revolutionary duty and is incompatible with membership in the third international.

08:04.360 --> 08:14.360
The, that and the revolutions of the 6th world congress, one sentence of which we, revolutionary work in the army must be organized and openly advocated.

08:14.360 --> 08:26.360
I think make it very clear that a day of historical matter, down through the years, up through and including the present day, one of the principal aims of the communist conspiracy has been the infiltration of our military.

08:27.360 --> 08:35.360
And you say that the poem that you started to ground or space words in the early part of 1953 is the best I can find.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.360
Did you actually participate in that?

08:37.360 --> 08:39.360
Yes. Are the members of your time?

08:39.360 --> 08:41.360
Yes. And it turns into a kind of defense?

08:41.360 --> 08:42.360
Yes.

08:42.360 --> 08:47.360
When did you first start hearing some information of the virtues in the army?

08:47.360 --> 08:55.360
Well, before we had hearing, sir, we conducted what's known as a preliminary investigation and assembled the general areas of information on ground.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.360
We interviewed with the chief.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.360
Yes, sir. We interviewed with the chief.

08:59.360 --> 09:06.360
Yes, sir. We interviewed with the chief. Yes, sir. We interviewed with the chief. We interviewed various documents and information and we came to, I would say, three or four brief concludes.

09:06.360 --> 09:18.360
Mr. Cohn, if you know about a new and different set up in the form of a presidential direct directive of April 27th, 1953, under new administration, I did.

09:18.360 --> 09:33.360
I would ask you what the effect that has with respect to your investigation in so far as it related to a broadening of the area of your investigation, are a relaxation of previous rules pertaining to your investigation?

09:33.360 --> 09:40.360
So I believe you refer to the directive of the President Administration issued by President Heisenhard, which provided for a chain.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.360
I'm not talking about the one now, May 17th.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.360
No, sir.

09:43.360 --> 09:56.360
No, no, the one of April 27th. I've left here. Yes, sir. The directive, sir, which provided for some relaxation and for review of loyalty procedures and review of cases involving possible security risks and cuttings.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.360
I thought the directive came out.

09:59.360 --> 10:08.360
And as a result of that, you say that you had, which I would say, is through your hand with respect to conducting your investigation, so some extent.

10:08.360 --> 10:17.360
Yes, we did. Now you were telling about the work you were doing prior to your hearings, when I intellect you give, you may proceed along that line of direct testimony, if you will.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.360
So, I'll decide.

10:18.360 --> 10:26.360
Time, I think what I'd like to do is to deliver a few minutes to Jenkins, to summarize the areas of information which reached the Sun Committee and the Cross of the Civil and Military Investigation.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.360
You may now do so.

10:29.360 --> 10:50.360
Pretty soon as the February, in fact, I think around the beginning of March, the staff obtained from people who had formerly been in the Communist Movement, specific details about what the Communist Infernoity had done to infiltrate the United States Army and to place Communists and keep places sensitive places in the Army in this country.

10:50.360 --> 11:06.360
The Civil and Civilist Submitted Committee, a somewhat detailed memorandum which I have here, and will not be found, containing information about the number of Communists in the military, containing information about various things the Communists had done.

11:06.360 --> 11:21.360
We get their members in the military, in radar laboratory, and explaining why it was essential for the Communists, for purposes of SD and IRG, fabricized, for the purposes of recruiting other people in the military into the party to bring about this infiltration.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.360
The Crown Pardon me in the Reption.

11:24.360 --> 11:28.360
Would you share your style of the document to which you just referred as the Illuminati Assembly?

11:28.360 --> 11:30.360
I would be very glad to do that.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.360
If you would not be, you would not be, you would not be, you would not be, you would not be speaking.

11:33.360 --> 11:39.360
Sir, I would like to go over that with Senator McCarthy during the noon hour. My opinion is that we will be glad to go under the Constitution.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.360
I would like to continue with you, Director.

11:41.360 --> 11:41.360


11:41.360 --> 11:47.360
After receiving this memorandum in March on Communists, that's entitled Communists Infiltration of the American Armed Forces.

11:47.360 --> 11:56.360
After that was submitted to us in March, the staff interviewed a number of witnesses, went over a lot of documents and came...

11:56.360 --> 12:03.360
Well, this callatory is going on between Senator McClellan and Mr. Jenkins,

12:03.360 --> 12:07.360
let's return to our studio at the cost of the country to prepare our stations to identify themselves.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.360
What is it?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.360
Let me go out here, Mr. Coz.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.360
Yes, sir. I didn't get you my statement. I'm sorry.

12:21.360 --> 12:30.360
I don't know what I was, so I think I said that after that memorandum was submitted to the committee that memorandum clarified and re-paid at the time.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.360
Let's remember them. Let's just switch to just before.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.360
Yes, timing is simple.

12:34.360 --> 12:39.360
Senator McClellan is interested in knowing a little more about it. Now whom was that memorandum prepared?

12:39.360 --> 12:41.360
I would like to ask this if I may.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.360
Now I've got a thing to tell you.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.360
You say you want to consult with Senator McClellan before you do so.

12:46.360 --> 12:51.360
I'm a questioner by whom I want to prepare and on the questioner following and by the professor of Senator McClellan during the noon hour,

12:51.360 --> 12:53.360
I think that I will be able to...

12:53.360 --> 12:58.360
I don't know if this was submitted document.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.360
I mean, is it a committed document?

13:00.360 --> 13:03.360
I'm asking you not to come across it.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
You all know.

13:04.360 --> 13:09.360
I was talking with the Minister of Justice, sir, and I submitted it to the chairman of the committee.

13:09.360 --> 13:13.360
Now, if it is a committed document, I thank you for the medical statement, sir, for the little things.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.360
I'm just a small piece of work, sir, of course, and just a large piece of work.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.360
Brother Paul, we can start.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.360
I'm sorry, sir. I'd be very happy if you wanted to join us to lead with the professor,

13:23.360 --> 13:26.360
and maybe anybody else, under the cloud enough, anyone's the judge, and go over this question.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.360
I'm sure that we will make the document available.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.360
A little bit.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.360
There is a specific committee document, might we not look at it?

13:33.360 --> 13:35.360
I was not very as careful in that.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.360
The first time there was a few moments ago, I have not seen it.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.360
I don't know the common name.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.360
As I am the candidate, Cohn, I've been there for the second, the second, the second, the second.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.360
I've been there for the second.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.360
I'm the candidate, sir.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.360
Two of you are here.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.360
Two of you, sir.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.360
I'm going to ask you a question.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.360
If you come in the origin of that document, I'm not about the high-end appeal.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.360
I will work with you.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.360
I'm here.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.360
I'm going to ask you a question.

14:05.360 --> 14:15.360
We are going to be a brief resource here for about two minutes while I'm a spirit.

14:15.360 --> 14:21.360
Cohn and Senator McCarty leave the caucus room for sharing the extended requirements of the way.

14:21.360 --> 14:25.360
We were trying to read on the telephone a gentleman who prepared this,

14:25.360 --> 14:28.360
a request of a committee back way at Smarge, to get his permission.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.360
We have that permission.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.360
We will be very happy to submit that document to the committee to tell you who wrote it

14:33.360 --> 14:35.360
and to tell you what the second thing was about work.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.360
And I might say this is the Jenkins' conclusion on this point.

14:38.360 --> 14:46.360
There's a purchase of one of a large number of informational sources and documents which we obtain,

14:46.360 --> 14:50.360
as far as this particular one is concerned, that is available.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.360
Turn this on.

14:52.360 --> 14:56.360
We found a coalition that's with our own known man, that is a committee document.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.360
I'm sure it is, and it's because of yours, yours, yours, it is.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.360
Yes sir, have members of this committee ever seen?

15:01.360 --> 15:03.360
It has been available to them sir.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.360
I don't know whether they have gone down to look at it.

15:05.360 --> 15:10.360
Where has it been in the regular files of the subcommittee found in room 101,

15:10.360 --> 15:13.360
on the subcommittee office, and it's much, very smart.

15:13.360 --> 15:17.360
As any member of this committee has been applied, what have you questions about this?

15:17.360 --> 15:21.360
I don't think there was any specific applyable and this particular memo I am interested.

15:21.360 --> 15:25.360
I know that during the month when the investigation got underway,

15:25.360 --> 15:28.360
there is a 50,000 in my area.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.360
Why are there not the committee's subcommittee's?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.360
We have just been to the press.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.360
Let's turn it over to the committee.

15:35.360 --> 15:39.360
We receive and we have literally, I believe, hundreds of over a thousand files.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.360
We have all sorts of documents and memorandums.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.360
I don't think it's ever been a practice to bring all of them up to each member of the committee.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.360
What we have is all the same.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.360
We know what else is about it.

15:50.360 --> 15:58.360
Yes, but to turn them, they have heard of Martin's on all of them.

15:58.360 --> 16:01.360
He needs to call the exact sums of himself and the committee.

16:01.360 --> 16:06.360
Well, the way that's enough, Matthew, so if they have returned,

16:06.360 --> 16:10.360
they work at the committee and have been specifically held up.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.360
Mr. McPhall knows that he won't go down to the room.

16:14.360 --> 16:19.360
With the file done, and if anybody wants to see, he knows that life's last and not.

16:19.360 --> 16:25.360
That is why I'm running up to the office of Francis and giving this committee a day

16:25.360 --> 16:29.360
to follow the last amount of information we have.

16:29.360 --> 16:33.360
We have, and I'm sure this is a fair share of the residents we never agreed to.

16:33.360 --> 16:38.360
We already have a council, so we go through those files that will.

16:38.360 --> 16:43.360
And give any information to the... we're not in number.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.360
Thank you, sir.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.360
I've... I've made this, and what's wrong?

16:46.360 --> 16:49.360
He's saying you can't send them to the members of the committee.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.360
You have a staff member that has nothing else to do with.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.360
Just make copies of the letters to them and give it up.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.360
No, sir.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.360
You do have a staff member?

16:57.360 --> 16:59.360
Yes, I have a lot of money to do, then.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.360
Make copies of them and ask them.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.360
That's a problem, and they didn't know what's going on.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.360
They have a lot more to do besides that.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.360
Yes, sir.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.360
They still make that, as they say.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.360
That is a negative document.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.360
And you get the wants of themselves for members of this committee.

17:10.360 --> 17:13.360
You have that, so it means that they have a good number to send it from a cart here.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.360
They're sending them a copy of the chairman of the committee.

17:15.360 --> 17:18.360
I understand, but do some others have the wants to work beyond this committee?

17:18.360 --> 17:19.360
I'm sure of it.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.360
And you didn't want to come so far for that?

17:21.360 --> 17:22.360
And you didn't?

17:22.360 --> 17:23.360
Sir, I'd be properly honest.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.360
I thought you was honest.

17:24.360 --> 17:29.360
Mr. Coombe, before producing that document in evidence and filing it,

17:29.360 --> 17:32.360
till it's precisely what it is, hundreds of them raised.

17:32.360 --> 17:37.360
So all that says is that one of a number of informational forces it embraces

17:37.360 --> 17:41.360
various facts about a tent from the part of the Communist Party.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.360
So infiltrate the United States Army.

17:44.360 --> 17:49.360
It contains an estimate made by the author of this document who was a communist himself

17:49.360 --> 17:53.360
for a long period of time, specifically concerned with communist plans

17:53.360 --> 17:55.360
to infiltrate the United States Army.

17:55.360 --> 18:01.360
It contains estimates by him of the number of communists still in the United States Army

18:01.360 --> 18:03.360
and some of its installations.

18:03.360 --> 18:08.360
And other informational and historical facts about communist plans

18:08.360 --> 18:11.360
to infiltrate the United States military establishments.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.360
Now I have something of a shaking thing of the day.

18:14.360 --> 18:19.360
And you just say that you have no objections to receiving the name of the person who prepared that document.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.360
I have no objection.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.360
I've talked about this yesterday.

18:21.360 --> 18:25.360
The thing that the document was prepared as a reference of a fair filing

18:25.360 --> 18:32.360
served four crowds who was currently a consultant for the immigration and naturalization service.

18:32.360 --> 18:37.360
The United States government who has worked for the government both under the last administration

18:37.360 --> 18:42.360
has been a witness before a grand jury and a trial.

18:42.360 --> 18:48.360
I might say he was a witness of the Remington trial and which I played a part

18:48.360 --> 18:52.360
and he's currently an employee of the United States government.

18:52.360 --> 18:56.360
What is this document that you are about to tell together with other documents?

18:56.360 --> 19:04.360
Yes, I mean, there's a basis of only two conducted and investigation of some persons in the Army.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.360
This was one of many things.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.360
I'm Mr. Jenkins.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.360
The main and four.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.360
The long ones are the basis for your investigation.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.360
Yes, this is one of the things I might say.

19:13.360 --> 19:20.360
The particular purpose of adherence to establish the date on which we were looking at the communist infiltration.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.360
Now what date is this?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.360
This is the establishment of March of 1953.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.360
March 1953.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.360
Yes sir.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.360
We do now.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
We do now.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.360
We do.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.360
We do.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.360
We do.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.360
We do.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.360
We do.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.360
We do not prevent the emergency exit, let's keep them now.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.360
What's the time?

19:36.360 --> 19:37.360
Of course I'm following that.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.360
I assume that's available to every member of the committee.

19:39.360 --> 19:45.360
We have no opportunity to know it in advance unless we have the opportunity to see it.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.360
It may be perfectly all right.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.360
I'm not trying to keep the document out.

19:48.360 --> 19:56.360
But I am trying to get the support and consideration for those over here on the minority side of this committee

19:56.360 --> 20:01.360
who are not a part of the proceedings and is left and what's going on.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.360
We'll have to study our enitment to file that to survive.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.360
We'll go to justice, we'll be seen.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.360
And that's the event is in my own way.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.360
Now we just have to get through these files.

20:09.360 --> 20:13.360
It will not be by the federal law and I'll go into it and submit anything you want me to.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.360
I will submit that.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.360
Let's see if that's the right-hide thing I'm going to submit.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.360
So I'll sign the following.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.360
We have a hearing sentence.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.360
Yes.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.360
Chairman.

20:23.360 --> 20:33.360
And I'd like to say that if there's any lack of these any criticism because we have not made copies of these incidents mentioned with guns.

20:33.360 --> 20:37.360
And giving copies to all members of the committee, that's all that's mine.

20:37.360 --> 20:46.360
I've been very much of the staff of the chair now and they have an order to send their time investigating some of the problems and drives for them.

20:46.360 --> 20:52.360
They file all of them to every member of the committee and I am a saying, uh, some of them.

20:52.360 --> 20:57.360
Unless the committee changes the rules, I am not going to order my staff the fun of time,

20:57.360 --> 21:02.360
typing out copies of all of them around them, sending it to all the members.

21:02.360 --> 21:06.360
They file for available any hundred and ground look to them and will.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.360
That's under rules and rather chairman.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.360
They are following the chairman.

21:11.360 --> 21:20.360
We have received the names and I assume they're in the file of the plain 133 commission about it and that's getting out of the floor.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.360
How about your criticism?

21:21.360 --> 21:23.360
You do it over a nine hundred.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.360
No, you'll better be an information available to you.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.360
So I don't know how I can edit except that.

21:28.360 --> 21:34.360
But you're talking about the 100-deerties, talking about others and there's three commission that you want investigate.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.360
And I have the name, but you have the name of the one of them yet.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.360
I have the eight schools. I have the right to work in that case.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.360
Mike, though I'd like to know some of them in advance.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.360
I'd like to have a meeting with my informations.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.360
I'm a poem man.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.360
But I haven't fired up here day and night with this investigation.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.360
I've honestly no time of the time.

21:52.360 --> 21:55.360
Now that's one of the three of my objectilists.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
I'm sure the president will continue to know.

21:57.360 --> 22:02.360
As soon as we get to this, I'm sure the 100 mark-in-one knows that I haven't always completely signed with him.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.360
He can have everybody picked with him.

22:04.360 --> 22:09.360
It's all happened because you know I'm going to be responsible for the center of my concern.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.360
I hope that I get a little bit of a picture of you now.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.360
I think you know I never wanted to say, you know what's there.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.360
And I thought I'm asking that.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.360
You will have every piece of information done.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.360
I'm very glad that you got brought up the question.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.360
I'm here to meet you.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.360
I hope you can be soon.

22:23.360 --> 22:24.360
Yes.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.360
Let's get on it.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.360
I hope we're not going to engage now.

22:29.360 --> 22:33.360
One, two months' additional call up wheel on our colleagues, because one statement came through it.

22:33.360 --> 22:37.360
And she told another Mr. Chair, Rick, Nancy, and the president, Nancy, and one of my partners.

22:37.360 --> 22:41.360
The chairman has done it on all the likes of they, something, and he's here.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.360
That the chair doesn't point out until they meet here.

22:45.360 --> 22:50.360
If all I would suggest you to make an appointment with him in the committee, is he going to make some statement whatsoever?

22:50.360 --> 22:56.360
I would repeat a case and the chair, so I'll go to the police secretary, and pretend that I'm not a man.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.360
The reason I asked you is to make my phone, because I think it's first and foremost, you may make it.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.360
I can't stop it.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.360
I wouldn't try.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.360
I trust you wouldn't do it if you could.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.360
I don't know exactly how it would be.

23:07.360 --> 23:15.360
One thing I was trying to make sure was that the minority council tells me that he asked the committee for the name to be contested.

23:15.360 --> 23:19.360
And of course, the reason is that the statement came to stand at the hospital, and it's turned out.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.360
Thank you.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.360
We're going to turn them.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.360
Hello, my friend.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.360
I beg your pardon. The council tell me he was not in that.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.360
He just has not received me yet.

23:29.360 --> 23:32.360
Now I'd like to ask you money asked for it.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.360
They were asked for approximately 10 days a dollar.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.360
My name is James Brown.

23:40.360 --> 23:49.360
I've got a lot of the reasons why I want to get this hearing ended, just so that my staff can be in the position to find his son and her son and her father.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.360
Anyone else in the information that they are entitled to?

23:52.360 --> 23:56.360
But, uh, too. You know, you know, you know, the president of the president.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.360
We said it.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.360
Pull them tied up here.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.360
You've had time, we'll be live.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.360
You'll get today. Now he's back in his job.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.360
Well, is there any, is there any information?

24:04.360 --> 24:07.360
Well, if you want, you will get a period.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.360
Accept, man, say.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.360
Accept.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.360
You're the only six, but by one of my fellow colleagues the other day.

24:13.360 --> 24:18.360
But he would not hesitate to make no money of the informal.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.360
He's dealed with that.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.360
Uh, before I give any information to anyone.

24:23.360 --> 24:28.360
Even members of the committee, which was opposed, not those informants that I've taken up with the committee.

24:28.360 --> 24:36.360
I still have got a rather sacred trust on man who's been working government-given for my last specific job.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.360
Who was the only of that he had given that information?

24:39.360 --> 24:42.360
The private, and the last time it was on the 50th of summer.

24:42.360 --> 24:47.360
The other day when I took the time, the press arose, but I could get out and give out the name of this.

24:47.360 --> 24:53.360
Uh, I thought, uh, the strong man gave me the resume of the FBI file.

24:53.360 --> 25:00.360
Now I read a story on the paper about the first three days later, and again, I don't think it'll go in your response to the news reports.

25:00.360 --> 25:03.360
Goodbye, I think it'll be a great surprise for me to make sure that I don't have that information.

25:03.360 --> 25:11.360
Your statement, if I have a report, will be a fact that you've not perhaps not only the man who gave me the information about cabinet.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.360
But also some of them are passing.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.360
Might be guilty of a crime, you know.

25:16.360 --> 25:27.360
I repeat that statement, sir. I do not believe you can receive information that is obtained by criminal means and only in your possession without the authority of you to be in guilty thrice.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.360
Well, now, uh, anyone wants to indict you that you're innocent?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.360
Well, that's not a matter of legal opinion.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.360
Let me say this, Thunder.

25:33.360 --> 25:37.360
But this is not the restricted information that you have in any further committees.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.360
Uh, Thunder, let me say this.

25:40.360 --> 25:48.360
We now have you on record a thing that you feel that the man who gave me the information about tracing the government, but what's it?

25:48.360 --> 25:50.360
Nothing much, but he should be prosecuted.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.360
I didn't say that. I don't have to.

25:52.360 --> 26:02.360
If you're administration, the chief law enforcement officer's a land, he's looking for it and in fire and determined what action should be taken.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.360
The Sun's underline. I'm not passing on the final mayor's office.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.360
The Sun's underlifts. Let's get this to it.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.360
I'm getting a long way to wait on these questions.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.360
I know that. Let's tell my think we should have taken them out.

26:12.360 --> 26:18.360
And you were my assignment and I think my plan is being well taken care of when you say a little statement, it doesn't encourage a lot.

26:18.360 --> 26:23.360
Now, the chairman knew Thunder and McCullen sending me back to New Sun and McCullen's safe-muntly request.

26:24.360 --> 26:34.360
I'd like to make it clear that I think that the folks which every person of government takes to protect and defend this country is all enemy-torn and domestic.

26:34.360 --> 26:41.360
That's what powers power of any presidential sixth of the director.

26:41.360 --> 26:52.360
And I will continue to receive information such as I received the other day because you have time at the bottom of the safe-muntly field that it's safe time for someone to give me information.

26:52.360 --> 26:57.360
I am in duty bound not to give.
