WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
I know about your brother.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.280
兩個 please come Section

00:24.280 --> 00:31.280
I'm going to go to the committee room

00:31.280 --> 00:38.280
and call their attention to the standing committee room

00:38.280 --> 00:43.280
which is to the effect there ought to be no audible manifestations of approval

00:43.280 --> 00:48.280
or disapproval of any kind at any time during the first of these shirts

00:48.280 --> 01:03.280
and to admonish our guests and to caution them that the uniformed officers and the main postponement of the audience have been instructed by the committee to remove from the room at once

01:03.280 --> 01:12.280
politely but firmly any of our guests who violate the conditions under which they enter the room

01:12.280 --> 01:19.280
and those conditions were to refrain entirely from manifestations of approval or disapproval

01:19.280 --> 01:28.280
shall we like to apologize for being five minutes late because his colleagues friends from Illinois suggested that I was tired of this morning I was

01:28.280 --> 01:40.280
and might say I was detained today conference working on the farm problem and the chair still believes that probably the maintenance of farm prosperity is even more basic than the issues which we have here today

01:40.280 --> 01:42.280
he shall try not to delay the gap.

01:42.280 --> 01:49.280
Hunter Simonton has told the chair he wants to read a short statement at the beginning that it will not provoke any additional colloquially

01:49.280 --> 01:52.280
and the chair will be happy to hear some of this.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.280
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

01:55.280 --> 02:05.280
Mr. Chairman we have been considering the position in which these hearings have been left as a result of the action taken yesterday

02:05.280 --> 02:13.280
over the protests of the minority and also statements made by the chair and another members of the majority

02:13.280 --> 02:17.280
with respect to Mr. Hensel and Mr. Carr.

02:17.280 --> 02:26.280
It is absolutely unthinkable that these hearings should conclude without a thorough examination and cross examination of Mr. Carr

02:26.280 --> 02:33.280
who participated in and has personal knowledge of many of the critical facts.

02:33.280 --> 02:41.280
We propose Mr. Chairman at the appropriate time to again insist that Mr. Carr be called as a witness.

02:41.280 --> 02:48.280
There are other persons whose testimony is essential that the committee is sincere in trying to get to the bottom of this matter.

02:49.280 --> 03:02.280
The testimony of these people is essential to find the truth and also to establish whether a perjury has been committed or will be committed by any witnesses in these hearings.

03:02.280 --> 03:08.280
We are going to insist Mr. Chairman that all such other people be called as well.

03:08.280 --> 03:17.280
At the present time however we shall nearly reserve our rights to demand at the proper time in the future that these people be called.

03:18.280 --> 03:24.280
So that the examination of the next witness may now go forward without delay.

03:24.280 --> 03:39.280
Chair, a little bit of supply and the content of the so-called non-controversial statement, please be sure that's for the hearings and at the appropriate time we will meet the issues as they come up appropriately.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.280
Mr. Jenkins, you have a witness before you.

03:42.280 --> 03:48.280
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry but I'd like to say that on just that matter that the meeting was not controversial.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.280
It was a summary of yesterday.

03:50.280 --> 03:57.280
I would like the people to know that I offered to let Mr. Chairman read this statement which he didn't want to do.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.280
You are correct, I didn't try to read this statement.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.280
Mr. Jenkins, you may continue with your examination of the witness.

04:03.280 --> 04:08.280
Mr. Chairman, Mr. McCone, I believe you were sworn.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.280
Yes, sir.

04:10.280 --> 04:15.280
The benefit of the record is that you state your full name.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.280
I'm Roy M. Co.

04:17.280 --> 04:23.280
I must call you not quite alone, but I'm exiting there by yourself.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.280
You understand, of course, that you're entitled to counsel.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.280
Yes, sir, I understand that.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.280
And you are not obeying yourself of that privy.

04:32.280 --> 04:40.280
No, sir, I have served as counsel to this regular subcommittee and I hope I can give the facts here without any advice of counsel.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.280
You are representing yourself.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.280
Yes, sir.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.280
We might end your age as soon as possible.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.280
I'm 27, sir.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.280
What is your official position?

04:50.280 --> 04:56.280
Chief counsel of the United States Senate, permanent subcommittee on investigation.

04:57.280 --> 05:04.280
And is that the committee that we have been referring to here generally as the McCarthy Committee for purposes of identification?

05:04.280 --> 05:06.280
Yes.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.280
When did you come with that committee, Mr. Co.

05:09.280 --> 05:17.280
One Congress was reorganized in January of 1953.

05:17.280 --> 05:23.280
Now, approximately almost a year and a half goals, yes.

05:23.280 --> 05:29.280
In what line of endeavor were you engaged prior to coming to the McCarthy Committee?

05:29.280 --> 05:38.280
I have been with the Department of Justice, Mr. Jenkins, directly prior to coming, I was a special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States.

05:38.280 --> 05:43.280
There were usually stations located in Washington.

05:44.280 --> 05:50.280
It was thrown on, going to ask you this time to relate to the members of this committee.

05:50.280 --> 06:03.280
Your experience is unsit, particularly your experience is that our title fitted you for the line of endeavor in which you have been engaged since you have come into the McCarthy Committee.

06:03.280 --> 06:12.280
So something of your background, you may use your own judgment about what you want to cover.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.280
What do you mean you want to cover?

06:15.280 --> 06:26.280
But I'm asking you not particularly about your experience, your background, your qualifications for the line of work in which you have been engaged since being with the McCarthy Committee.

06:26.280 --> 06:31.280
You mean they're the cases which I have participated in in the Department of Justice?

06:31.280 --> 06:37.280
Well, first of all, I'll put the college, your colleges, or you'll grant you Columbia University College and Law School.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.280
And most whom?

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
Yes, sir.

06:40.280 --> 06:47.280
Now then, in what line of work, particularly where you engaged before you, that indeed you were the Senator McCarthy?

06:47.280 --> 06:58.280
Before I came with the Senate, right, I was with the Department of Justice and I had been working on cases involving the prosecution of Communists, spies and subverses for some time.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.280
How long were you with the Department of Justice?

07:01.280 --> 07:05.280
I was with the Department of Justice for some five or six years.

07:05.280 --> 07:17.280
Yes. And you say as an assistant Attorney General, well, first of all, I thought it off if I let Law School as a law clerk in the Office of the United States District Attorney in New York.

07:17.280 --> 07:32.280
When I was admitted to the bar, I became an assistant United States Attorney, I then became a confidential assistant to the United States Attorney, and finally was appointed Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States by Attorney General McGratter.

07:32.280 --> 07:44.280
Mr. Cone, in what particular line of work were you engaged as assistant United States Attorney?

07:44.280 --> 07:55.280
Well, at the beginning, sir, I thought the case is involving you as counterfeiters and self-fedlers and the usual run of business in that office.

07:55.280 --> 08:09.280
There came a time about 1949 when I began to work pretty much exclusively on the prosecution of cases involving Communism, Subversion and FDNH.

08:09.280 --> 08:20.280
And whether or not you engage in that particular line of work for some full five years or perhaps six years before coming with the McCarthy Committee, I've been about three or four years.

08:20.280 --> 08:27.280
Where was that now in Washington or in New York in both places with the Jason St. New York and then Washington?

08:27.280 --> 08:31.280
Was there not your experience along that line expensive or otherwise?

08:31.280 --> 08:33.280
Well, I don't know if that's right.

08:33.280 --> 08:41.280
I thought it had all of those facts and news if you appear to be a modest best bet all around, the Committee wants to know the facts.

08:41.280 --> 08:50.280
And about your experience and your qualifications particularly with respect to Communism, Subversion, or Security is...

08:50.280 --> 08:51.280
Oh, sir.

08:51.280 --> 08:55.280
Well, sir, well, if I may, Mr. Jenkins, the President, I think I know what you want.

08:55.280 --> 09:07.280
Both I list the cases in which I participated in some way and set the Committee not of any great length, but generally go out of here and list those cases.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.280
Are we getting to the VAT?

09:09.280 --> 09:12.280
No, just a report for the Wittler's best.

09:12.280 --> 09:18.280
I wonder if the young man with their five votes moved one place, but they moved between me which is not the best.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.280
I like to know.

09:20.280 --> 09:25.280
The list of the cases with the Jenkins, well, the first one was...

09:25.280 --> 09:30.280
By the way, sir, before I list these cases, I would like to say this.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.280
Thank you.

09:31.280 --> 09:38.280
In working on the prosecution of these cases, I was part of a seat.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.280
I never prosecuted anyone case along.

09:41.280 --> 09:46.280
There were always a group of fine people with me who worked long and hard on each of them.

09:46.280 --> 09:54.280
And as far as we were all concerned, what we did was to present the grand jury, the court, and the jury.

09:54.280 --> 10:01.280
The evidence and facts accumulated over a long period of time by the federal Bureau of investigation.

10:01.280 --> 10:12.280
We merely presented to the court what the FBI had dug up over years of intensive investigation of communists and espionage activity in this country.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.280
And the first of those cases, sir, was the...

10:16.280 --> 10:23.280
Which I had anything to do with the prosecution of the post-stream leaders of the Communist Party before Judge Medina.

10:23.280 --> 10:28.280
I did law work on that case.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.280
Well, this is what it's called.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.280
That was the prosecution's fur of the...

10:33.280 --> 10:38.280
Well, it took the come to be known, the first-stream leaders of the Communist Party of the United States.

10:38.280 --> 10:44.280
It was actually the members of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States,

10:44.280 --> 10:49.280
which is the governing body of the Communist conspiracy in this nation.

10:49.280 --> 10:55.280
So we're invited under the smith act for conspiracy to teach and advocate the violent over-sale of our government

10:55.280 --> 10:58.280
and were prosecuted before Judge Medina in New York.

10:58.280 --> 11:02.280
Well, then, the plan is to keep how many defences whether or not you go on.

11:02.280 --> 11:09.280
I think it's about 12 per cent, and the case was severed as to William D. Fourth to the National Chamber and on ground development.

11:09.280 --> 11:13.280
And 11, I believe, worked. Finally convicted.

11:14.280 --> 11:26.280
Well, there are other cases of consequence Mr. Cohn in which you actively participated as prosecutor or assistant prosecutor.

11:26.280 --> 11:31.280
Yes, sir, after the first trial of the first-stream communist leaders,

11:31.280 --> 11:38.280
I began to work with a list of families who have been courier for a communist firing

11:38.280 --> 11:41.280
and had gone to the FBI and furnished information,

11:41.280 --> 11:47.280
as to the identity of various communists who had infiltrated the United States government

11:47.280 --> 11:49.280
and conducted FBI activity.

11:49.280 --> 12:00.280
And I worked with Harry Gole, who had just at that time told the story of two participation in a Soviet firing in this country

12:00.280 --> 12:07.280
which had obtained Adam Lombon and other secrets and transmitted them to the Soviet Union.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.280
And they result of working with Mrs. Bentley and Mrs. Gole.

12:10.280 --> 12:15.280
They resulted in the prosecution of the next case, I believe,

12:15.280 --> 12:19.280
with the prosecution of Abraham Brooklyn and Mary and Martin,

12:19.280 --> 12:29.280
which was on charge of the conspiracy to obstruct justice in that they had covered up the gold,

12:29.280 --> 12:38.280
and bird's firing during the grand jury investigation in 1948 and has delayed the uncovering of that firing for a number of years.

12:38.280 --> 12:47.280
They were prosecuted for conspiracy to obstruct justice, I participated in that and they were convicted.

12:47.280 --> 12:55.280
After that, sir, I went into the prosecution of William W. Remington on charges of curtailing,

12:55.280 --> 13:00.280
and I believe, before some committee of this very committee,

13:00.280 --> 13:09.280
following his denial of membership in the Communist Party, Mr. Remington had been a commerce department official,

13:09.280 --> 13:17.280
and he had been one of Mrs. Bentley's communists at the NIH contact while he remiton with the United States government.

13:17.280 --> 13:22.280
He testified first before a congressional committee and denied this and was later,

13:22.280 --> 13:27.280
before a grand jury and then prosecuted a press jury, and I was in that case.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.280
It was a good prosecution.

13:29.280 --> 13:33.280
The result of the prosecution's error is that he was convicted by the jury.

13:33.280 --> 13:39.280
The conviction was reversed on a question of law by the United States Court of Appeals.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.280
We represented the evidence to another grand jury.

13:42.280 --> 13:50.280
He was re-indicted, reconfected, and his conviction has but recently been affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals,

13:50.280 --> 13:53.280
and he is serving a jail sentence.

13:53.280 --> 14:02.280
Other other notable cases, Mr. Cohn, in which you participated as a prosecutor?

14:03.280 --> 14:05.280
I will start after the Remington case.

14:05.280 --> 14:17.280
About three weeks thereafter, I participated in the preparation for trial, and in the prosecution of the Rosenberg case.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.280
Is that the Julius and the Rosenberg case?

14:20.280 --> 14:21.280
Yes, sir.

14:21.280 --> 14:31.280
That was the case in which the Julian and Ethel Rosenberg and Martin Soltzau were defendants on a charge of authority to commit post-DMI.

14:32.280 --> 14:38.280
In that, they, along with Harry Goll, out the splice, have� the jankin' dead guys.

14:38.280 --> 14:45.280
No, I'm just clear to mention that the use of strike case here at Mr. Cohn, I'd rather forget that as far as I'm concerned,

14:45.280 --> 14:51.280
so anyway, did you have to investigate and prosecute Julius and Ethel Rosenberg?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.280
Yes, sir.

14:52.280 --> 15:00.280
And that case was prosecuted, and they were convicted on charges of controversy to commit as the analogy giving Adam's secret.

15:00.280 --> 15:05.280
Adam's secret and other secrets to a communist firing.

15:05.280 --> 15:18.280
And after that, I believe the next thing was, I presented to the Federal Grand Jury in New York, the evidence which resulted in the indictment of the second string later.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.280
Pardon me interrupt you.

15:19.280 --> 15:29.280
I think one of the senators, who's risked to me and suggest that I ask you the outcome of the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case,

15:29.280 --> 15:37.280
and for the benefits of those, especially in the TV audience who don't know what you think they put through the final result wise.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.280
Sorry, final, sir.

15:38.280 --> 15:42.280
Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg, you say it was very final?

15:42.280 --> 15:43.280
Yes, I heard of them.

15:43.280 --> 15:52.280
In the case of Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg, there's over executed following a permit of their conviction by the Court of Appeals and denial of the Treasury by the Supreme Court.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.280
They were executed as Adam's fire.

15:54.280 --> 15:59.280
Mrs. Old Dall is serving a 30-year sentence in Alcatraz for his participation.

15:59.280 --> 16:04.280
Now you're returning about another key, so the consequence in which you were actively engaged, there's a project here.

16:04.280 --> 16:10.280
I believe right in with the Rosenberg case, sir, I presented to the Federal Grand Jury in New York,

16:10.280 --> 16:19.280
evidence which resulted in the indictment of the second string leaders of the Communist Party in the United States.

16:19.280 --> 16:32.280
In other words, after the first string leaders were convicted, they were replaced on the national committee of the Communist Party by a new group of communists who directed the conspiracy in this country.

16:32.280 --> 16:43.280
As soon as the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of the first string group, we incited the indictment of the second string leaders who were taken over.

16:43.280 --> 16:48.280
The active direction of the Communist Party of the United States, they were incited.

16:48.280 --> 16:53.280
And I might say, sir, that that indictment resulted in some further cases.

16:53.280 --> 17:03.280
In that four of the second string leaders, four indicted failed to surrender on the charges of conspiracy to teach and advocate over the fall of our government.

17:03.280 --> 17:20.280
And four of the first string leaders who had been convicted before Judge Medina jumped bail and became fugitives, which made it necessary for us to prosecute for a contempt of court, the people who had put up the bail for the fugitive communists.

17:21.280 --> 17:26.280
And that prosecution for contempt of court, Mr. Jenkins, was the next case.

17:26.280 --> 17:42.280
That was a prosecution of Frederick Van der Beelfield, St. John Hammett, W. L. C. Hunton, and Abna Greene, who were the trustees of the bail fund of the Civil Rights Congress, which had put up the bail for the fugitive communists.

17:42.280 --> 17:48.280
We prosecuted them for a contempt of court. They were convicted and given jail sentences.

17:48.280 --> 17:56.280
I remember that in the comments, or I argue the field of appeal before the United States Court of Appeals up in Connecticut.

17:56.280 --> 18:03.280
And that was that chain of events.

18:03.280 --> 18:12.280
In addition, Mr. Cohn, to the cases you have mentioned that have or not too prosecuted other cases without mentioning them specifically.

18:12.280 --> 18:19.280
Yes, sir. I think that there were from that point on very briefly there just two or three more.

18:19.280 --> 18:23.280
Would you like to mention those to the committee?

18:23.280 --> 18:25.280
Whatever you say, sir.

18:25.280 --> 18:32.280
In other words, you are not a defendant lawyer. I take this. You're a prosecutor, is that right?

18:32.280 --> 18:34.280
I have been up until it's proceeding.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.280
I've been doing this proceeding yet, sir.

18:37.280 --> 18:42.280
Like myself, you're playing a sort of a dual role. Well, it seems pretty one-sided.

18:42.280 --> 18:50.280
I do as well, so if you're experienced, Mr. Cohn, in investigating these days, cases you've mentioned to others.

18:50.280 --> 18:58.280
And presenting those cases to the grand jury and appearing in court in the role of, as far as you're using attorney,

18:58.280 --> 19:14.280
did you or not, but come, what we might call an expert on, communism, or a subversive, curious, if they're so or not, just give your own opinion about it.

19:14.280 --> 19:21.280
So I would say I was not an expert. I would say that in the court of these various trials, I had a read an awful lot of lunch that's been in this literature,

19:21.280 --> 19:27.280
and I had to learn the ins and outs of the communist conspiracy and the FBI and I's movement in this country.

19:27.280 --> 19:31.280
Have you made a considerable study of communism, Mr. Cohn?

19:31.280 --> 19:32.280
I have, sir.

19:32.280 --> 19:40.280
And particularly as it relates to the invitation of Communists in the United States, and is there any governmental branches and agencies?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.280
Yes.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.280
Could you give us a short definition of what a communist is?

19:47.280 --> 20:01.280
A communist third, one, who is under the discipline of the movement which stands for the overthrow by force and violence of the government of the United States,

20:01.280 --> 20:14.280
and if every other free government throughout the world, and the movement which works by criminal, deal legal means, by espionage and sabotage and every other foul-way, not a man, known to man,

20:14.280 --> 20:24.280
to bring about the day when the world will be under the control of the international communist movement, and when free governments will no longer exist.

20:25.280 --> 20:29.280
That's because you're not only threatening us to try and remove the communist party, is that right?

20:29.280 --> 20:30.280
I am not sure.

20:34.280 --> 20:38.280
There's nothing in nominating the editor of the bigy workers.

20:38.280 --> 20:44.280
No, sir, I have been referring to in the daily work, I very considerably, but I have nothing nominated by them for any say.

20:44.280 --> 20:47.280
You give us a short definition of espionage.

20:48.280 --> 21:10.280
I would say espionage, sir, is defined by law in title 18 of the United States code and involved generally the transition of or transmission of information vital to the national defense of the United States to a foreign power with intent that it be used against the interests of the United States.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.280
That's right.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.280
The law definition, of course, the exception of law speaks for themselves.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.280
What's the, what is the diversity?

21:18.280 --> 21:34.280
A subversive, sir, I would say as a person who is sedicated to the interest unfavorable, to the continuation of the free government under which we live in this country.

21:34.280 --> 21:41.280
Mr. Gold, what were the circumstances under which you've changed into the McCarthy Committee of January 1953?

21:42.280 --> 21:48.280
Well, sir, I have never met, I did not know. I might have met Senator McCarthy once at its dinner, casually.

21:48.280 --> 21:51.280
I did not know. I think you could have heard of it.

21:51.280 --> 22:08.280
I have heard of him, sir, and I might say that we all felt that our work and prosecuting communists were considerably hated by what Senator McCarthy was doing in allerting the nation and the world through the menace of communist infiltration in this country.

22:08.280 --> 22:13.280
I've very definitely heard of Senator McCarthy, and I admire very much what he was doing.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.280
I had never had this unfortunate talking with him.

22:15.280 --> 22:24.280
All right, now my question is, what were the circumstances under which you've changed into the McCarthy Committee in January 1953?

22:24.280 --> 22:29.280
Well, sir, Senator McCarthy, coincided me and asked me to come to Washington. He's heard of you.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.280
He has heard of you, sir, yes.

22:31.280 --> 22:49.280
He has to come to Washington and talk with him. When I came down, he asked me if I was come and served as Chief Counsel for this subcommittee, if he recommended my name and if my name were approved by the members of the subcommittee.

22:49.280 --> 23:06.280
I, of course, was deeply honored by that offer, more than I had hoped for, and I told the senators that as much as I was on it by it, I thought it might not be possible because I was a Democrat and he was a Republican.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.280
You were a Democrat, Mr. Coombe?

23:08.280 --> 23:13.280
Yes, sir. And I certainly want to hold that against you, Mr. Coombe.

23:13.280 --> 23:20.280
I don't consider it a, for any time, I'm proud of it.

23:20.280 --> 23:32.280
I hope to that link of the party, which is firmly dedicated to opposition to the communist movement in this country, as I know is the Republican party.

23:32.280 --> 23:36.280
I don't think, sir, that it is a party issue anyway.

23:36.280 --> 23:44.280
There are a lot of Democrats who join with the A.O. Republicans, or even the Supreme Court party system in this country.

23:44.280 --> 23:51.280
Yes, sir. And the political affiliation, certainly, and material, I'm sure, as well as every member of the committee is concerned.

23:51.280 --> 23:57.280
Senator McCawってy told me it was completely immaterial when I told to him he told me he did not care what my politics were.

23:57.280 --> 24:06.280
He wanted to know if he thought I could serve this committee, and particularly whether I could contribute anything on the communist investigation.

24:06.280 --> 24:11.280
Do you know how long Senator McCawってy has been chairman of the committee, Mr. Coombe?

24:11.280 --> 24:14.280
When I brought some, sir, he was actually chairman.

24:14.280 --> 24:26.280
I believe that the Republicans had won the election and were about to take over the throne of the Senate, and under the rules of the Senate, he was destined to become chairman, and he was making plans for setting up the committee's day.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.280
Yes, sir, if you have not been organized, no, sir.

24:30.280 --> 24:34.280
Do you know whether or not he was the first member had it to his stand?

24:34.280 --> 24:39.280
I don't know that, sir. There were two or three who came in pretty much at the beginning. I don't know whether I was.

24:39.280 --> 24:49.280
See that as it may, you were engaged on the occasion of your first conference, which is an obvious and first conference senator asked me if I was interested.

24:49.280 --> 25:03.280
I told him I certainly what. He told me he would recommend my name to the committee. He did that. I was approved by the committee, and I began my 30s, I proposed a few couple of days after the committee was organized in January.

25:03.280 --> 25:10.280
And you have served as chief counsel to the McCarthy Committee since that time, and up to the present time.

25:10.280 --> 25:16.280
The school, what are the duties of chief counsel to the McCarthy Committee? Are there many in very, sir?

25:16.280 --> 25:39.280
One duty is the questioning of witnesses at executive sessions and public hearings. The duties include working with the staff to develop material on the infiltration of Communists and to the United States government, into defense plan, material concerning corruption.

25:39.280 --> 25:55.280
The chief counsel of office and the assembly of those facts, preparation for public hearings, preparation for executive sessions, examining witnesses, consulting with the chairman and members of the committee, and generally working along with the committee.

25:56.280 --> 26:16.280
Can you give us without the regime secrets that should not be given to the public? The area in which you investigate for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not there are styles, communists, subversives in the country or in the army or in any government agency?

26:17.280 --> 26:31.280
The fourth is from the committee, generally speaking, yes, surely, sir. First of all, we get a good deal of information from people outside of government people who have been in the communist movements and are in the best position to know what the communists are up to.

26:32.280 --> 26:45.280
We get information from certain people in government who point out instances where communists are being covered up and where no action is being taken against communists despite FBI warnings.

26:45.280 --> 26:59.280
We get information served by going over old files, old records, documentation of people who are not in communist depictions and might later turn up in government from communications received by us.

26:59.280 --> 27:13.280
From many patriotic organizations from American goal around the country who gained this information and fit to furnish it to the committee, to the investigating committee of the United States Senate, both of which they deal with this office.

27:14.280 --> 27:28.280
The first call and wind is that the McCarthy Committee begins to investigate in the existence of persons of styles and subversives in any government agency.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.280
I would say we begin that right after the committee was organized, sir.

27:33.280 --> 27:38.280
As well as all of the information that you have is what you're saying, yes sir.

27:39.280 --> 27:44.280
What was the first agency of the government investigated for the McCarthy Committee?

27:44.280 --> 27:50.280
The United States, the first agency I believe, sir, well I think there was two actually.

27:50.280 --> 28:07.280
We held hearing on the filing system in the United States Department, which showed that, well I guess there was general confusion in the manner of keeping files which had operated to the benefit of certain people in the state department.

28:07.280 --> 28:25.280
The first time with subversives record shows that the operation of various forms in the state department, some of which had deleted unfavorable material on state department people with subversives records of communist affiliations from the file and things of that time.

28:25.280 --> 28:30.280
We conducted that investigation and after that the state department changed its filing system.

28:30.280 --> 28:45.280
We then held public hearing on communist infiltration and general inefficiency in the operation of the information program which included among other branches the Voice of America.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.280
This is not too ambitious to give the government a meeting office.

28:48.280 --> 28:57.280
That came a bit later, sir. I might say, well we were holding public hearings on the Voice of America and on the state department filing system.

28:57.280 --> 29:08.280
At the same time we were planning out what was to come next. We were gathering information and laying the groundwork for future investigations of the subcommittee.

29:08.280 --> 29:12.280
One of those was in D.C. government printing office.

29:12.280 --> 29:16.280
What was the investigation of the government printing office conducted?

29:16.280 --> 29:21.280
Well, we began to aspire to the time and decided investigating the Army in school.

29:21.280 --> 29:27.280
I would say the preliminary investigation was going on at the same time as the preliminary investigation of the Army.

29:27.280 --> 29:36.280
The public hearings were held just prior to the beginning of hearing formal hearings on communist infiltration in the Army.

29:36.280 --> 29:45.280
We understand that before the public hearing is had or even the executive hearing is had, you have conducted some preliminary investigation.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.280
Groundwork or statework is that correct?

29:47.280 --> 29:50.280
There's a lot of staff work that goes into these things.

29:50.280 --> 30:04.280
We have an executive session of public hearing and it means that before that our stays and weeks have been sent by the staff and gathering information, interviewing witnesses and determining the facts for presentation of the committee.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.280
I have an executive session or public hearing.

30:07.280 --> 30:14.280
Do you recall about how many witnesses the McCrackley committee has interviewed since its formation?

30:14.280 --> 30:19.280
I am the interviewer since the introduction of its most began.

30:19.280 --> 30:24.280
If you include statements of you sir, I would say faithfully well over a thousand.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.280
Well over a thousand.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.280
Yes.

30:26.280 --> 30:31.280
As was Dr. Cao-Bierre investigation of the government printing office,

30:31.280 --> 30:37.280
I would ask you whether or not any suspensions or dismissals resulted.

30:37.280 --> 30:43.280
Oh yes sir, when we began our hearing through the government printing office,

30:43.280 --> 30:51.280
I might tell you about that for a minute sir, I was hearing this summer, the early summer I believe when we began hearing.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.280
You
