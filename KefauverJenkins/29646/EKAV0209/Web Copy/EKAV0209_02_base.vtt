WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
And threats are usually made by people in the ring,

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
and it's so nerdy.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
That's the time when it's got to be made.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Certainly one of the times.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Surely one of the times I'm going to easily win this.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
That's when it's where the violence is made.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Sure.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
As I did, it's just...

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
And for all you know, in that bit of anger,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
you stay here now in the EU.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
That is why you know you neither admit there are many nights.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
That you say this is war with the army.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
It's got like a little further than that.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
I remember the substance of some of the things I said.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
I do not remember using those words and saying that.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
I have heard, or heard read into the record here,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
versions of what I did say by three army witnesses,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
each one of them, whom had a different version of what I said.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I have thought, was Mr. Rainbow and Mr. Jones.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
They say I did not say those words.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
And all I can do is tell you I was angry,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
give you the substance of some of the things

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
which I did say and tell you what happened on that occasion.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I cannot tell you there the exact words which I use.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
And I don't believe anybody else can tell you the exact words which I use.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Are you heard from the police?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I don't know, I said,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
and I read further from the testimony of the scone,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
saying they did the transcripts,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
putting the scone.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
I don't understand why you let communist work in here

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
and you won't let me in, did you say that?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
That sounds a lot more like me.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Sounds a lot like me.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
That sounds a lot more like me.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That's the declaration of war.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You mean that sound like Roy Coleman?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
No sir, what sounds like me when I'm mad?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
It is they let communist in here and they don't let us in.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yes sir.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Morning, Father.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
And the sea sounds like you.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
I have been cleared for classified information.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
That sounds like me and that was the word.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Where have you been cleared for classified information school?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Not only that sir, I had a specific secret clearance

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
from the Defense Department.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I have access to FBI files when they were when I was long.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
What's the agreement?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Did you say that?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Tenable row is a little bit mistaken in terminology sir.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
And I would like to ask,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
what's the most determined knowledge you have about the FBI?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I don't recall the exact statement.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I can't tell you this with the tankings.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
I did not say that I currently have access to FBI files

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
or that I can see them whenever I want them.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Neither does the information,

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm not going to get it word.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
What does it say?

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
I have access to FBI files from a Washington DCS.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I did not say I have access to FBI files when I want them.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Then I see what you did say.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And this is important for me and I hope I may be permitted.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
On this one, you are going to explain.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Any time I ask this, you are open.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
So, I don't mean you.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
You do not tell me.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I'll be there.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
He's coming down.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I want you to say that.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
No right or reason to call you down.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Sir, I'm going to answer every question.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
On this particular point,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
it is important.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
I did not say and I could not have said that I have access to FBI files.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Because, sir, since I have come with this committee,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I have not had access to FBI files

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
and I have never seen an FBI file.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
And I would like to make that very clear under hope

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
to end any statement by anybody.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
But I, while with this committee, have seen access

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
to FBI files or a patent, that is not true.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Before I came with the trust committee, sir,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I was with the Department of Justice

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
for a number of years dealing with the prosecution

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
of Communists and the persons file.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I did have access to FBI files.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I did use FBI files extensively.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
For not for FBI files, we could not have obtained a single conviction.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
What if I refer to the FBI to FBI files on medications?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I would have said I have had access to FBI files

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
or I have access to FBI files and,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
journaled below by being wrong about two letters.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
In one word, seven months later,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
my creation unfortunate impression.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
It was like, let's get you all to that.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Is the agent in the same state?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Is it doing the same to your agent to be listed?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
You could use a place list.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
And, sir, I have had access.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Can't be I had access?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
I say it is possible, but I said I had access to FBI files.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I say it is impossible, that I said I had access to FBI files

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
because that would not have been a true statement.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I'll read you further.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Who do you?

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
You're doing this just the best me.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
We will investigate.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
We'll make out of you.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Did you say that?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I don't recall.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You don't deny it.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I can come close to denying.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
That's the right thing I said because I thought the Bob Jones

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
are grateful to a witness throughout.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And, they say I did not say those things.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I'll be glad to tell you what they recall.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
They say sir and it's my recollection

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
so that they were with me throughout.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I was not the only one excluded.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
They were excluded along with me.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
And we did say we were angry too.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
But now, you're the only one excluded.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I did say you know nothing you did today.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
I not only know nothing, I'm sure there is nothing

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
and I'm sure he was doing so.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
That is the war and a lot of battle scars on him.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
It's my arm highly and I'm sure he was doing his very best

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
to get this recollection of the fact words

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
that were uttered seven months ago.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I believe some of them are probably right.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I believe some of them are probably a little bit wrong.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I have no problem with the fact that the substance

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
of what happened for the fact that I was angry

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
or the fact that in spite of the point that they got us up there

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
and wasted a day for us,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
they wouldn't let us in the place

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
which we were supposed to see.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And that's, I am doubly sad that they let Communists in

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
and they let Communists in, they kept us out

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
and I can tell you why I know I said that.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
From Mr. Coon, in short, I'm in tune.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
So, Medicaid, in the presence of high ranking officers

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
of the Army including the highest ranking ones,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
the Chief, the Secretary.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I mean the presence of high ranking civilians.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
You described war on the Army, didn't you?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
No, you did not.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
No, I did not.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
What did he say to you?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
He says it is war as it is.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't understand that.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
You don't remember saying that.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
And if these high-sized men who need to survive,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
including here the Secretary of the Army,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
the government's civilians,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
and which they have heard of,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
and which just in their office,

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
we shall as I say,

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
is that Royal Enthoes says that this is his war.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
We will investigate the heck out of the Army

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
and Mr. D.C. Army can now not be denied.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Yes, sir.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
You see, the Secretary says,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
as I heard his testimony,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
did not say that I said any of those things.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Very other ways to say that I said different things.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
You said different words, different terminology,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
different phrase, different thoughts, different ideas.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I saw it through Mr. Rainbow and Mr. Jones.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
See if they can remember exactly what was said.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
They can, remember exactly what was said.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
What an appeared we can all agree on is that I was angry

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
as they were because we have been invited up there

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
to do some work that might be useful to us.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
The doors were in our face for what seems to be no good reason.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And we had waited a day,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
and that I am sad as when the door was in our face,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
said I was angry and they'd taken to the effect

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
that they let the communists in and they keep us out.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And I don't know, I did make that particular statement

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
because I remember repeating it in a very humorous vein

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
at the lunch in which followed later on.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Mr. Polarius needs to prove that federal medications

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
are in this position.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
You demand this somebody give an automobile

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
and take you away from there and take you to New York?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
No, sir. I may know the management for an automobile.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
But if you made a real point, I should get...

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
No, what I said was this, sir.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I said what's the point about hanging around here,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
which is wasting our time.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
They fight us up here and tell us to come up

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
and then they shut the door and we're standing out in the grass.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I might as well be back and watching you and come work on your.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Did you interpret it as a request for an automobile

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
to make possible a thought which I'd express?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Mr. Polarius, did you ever,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
whatever you said, I'll say to you that.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Did the secretary of the Army missadden anybody of you

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
ever did he tell you?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
That they are at a later date.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
I apologize to the secretary of the Army for what she said.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
I never said anything in a fit of anger

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
to secretary Stephen on that

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
or on any other occasion, sir.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
If I had, I'm sure the Polarius and the apology were cold

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
or I would have spent it one.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I never said anything irrigatory concerning any of these other people

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
mentioned on that day.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
It was a very simple incident which was one of a few incidents

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
I would be glad to tell you about what you showed on that day,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
which added up to the fact to hold trip with a little bit ridiculous

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and we were wasting a lot of time and we were angry

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
and we were just like to get back someplace and do some work.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
Whatever was said, and I don't know what the committee is going to find out

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
what was said on that occasion.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
You think you were angry?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yes, sir.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
And do I understand you?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You think you don't remember all you say?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I don't.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
There are others right there that are angry.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I said, you don't have the moment to idea for everything you think.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Not for whatever it might have been, Mr. Colman.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
This huge that time I remember it's just a good time ever.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Offer any apology to the high ranking man,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
and the highest ranking man in the United States are me.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
So Mr. D.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
You are not, sir.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
No, and if I might explain that answer,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
will you be?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I don't say, Mr. Colman,

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
I just get an explanation.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
You did that.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Thanks, sir.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I don't think there was any experience, but I had said nothing.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
I had not displayed my anger so that,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
speaking front of Mr. Stevens in any way,

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
I had said nothing to him on that occasion or on any other occasion,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
which was called me to apologize to him, sir.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
I re-got it, Mr. Stevens, as they find gentlemanly,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
pretty as persons.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I feel so regardless of schools.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I re-got in a time,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
gentlemanly, pretty as persons, persons, persons,

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
these things are regardless.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
If we go back to the day prior to these hearings, sir,

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
I certainly feel just different from the mother.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I would say that I re-gotten as the Stevens,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
as they gentlemen,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
gentlemanly persons,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
and as a pretty as person.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yes, sir.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I never, in my contact,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
so discussions with him,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
he always treated me very politely, very kindly,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
and I can say nothing more than that.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
There was no heated discussions or any other kind of uncoorded incident.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
On any occasion when I was together with Mr. Stevens.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Did you ever tell the secretary that you didn't mean what she said

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
that you were in the city of Anger?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Here's what, well, I don't know how he said it.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
He said it and only, well, he did you not.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Let me tell you what happened, Mr. Stevens.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Well, I know how I was.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
How long did I get to do here?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I was telling him this, I was sick, I was mad, I was angry, I was insane, sir.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
I let all of those persons to believe a little while later

11:20.000 --> 11:27.000
that the incident was completely forgotten about by trying to make what might have been a court joke about it.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And if I might tell you that,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
what if you're trying to explain it?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Well, the first thing I might say,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
is that the evidence which plain is fully.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
That happened when we got out there on this trip,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
which we hoped to get a little work done.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But we get up to one building.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
And this was not the second building, this was the first one.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
And there was a great deal made about a big secrecy thing.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
We were saying something that nobody ever looked at before.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
A history of mankind and all that.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
And one of the officers, I don't remember what, came up to me and whispered to me.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
They're really, this is really a big deal.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
They're really showing you something here.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Russian military mission, which came to me,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and they showed them exactly the same thing.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I passed that along to Senator McCartney.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
And Senator McCartney airs out loud in front of everybody.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Well, this is very, very interesting, but that's how secret it is.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Isn't it a fact that a Russian military mission was shown the same stuff?

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
And there was a little discussion back in front between some of the Army people there.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
And I believe it finally developed that couple of years before.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Sometimes, prior to that, a Russian, a Soviet military mission

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
had been created by the state department and sent up the fort barnmouth for a visit

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
and had been taken through that area and shown these things.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
We next went on to the second building where Mr. Rainbow, Mr. Jones and I,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
were told we could not come in because I was sold.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I couldn't come in because I didn't have clearance.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I said, I did have clearance.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Well, I said, you can't come in anyway because we don't know that you have clearance.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
I couldn't do much more than tell them that I had clearance.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Mr. Jenkins said, kept us out and the three of us were,

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
we thought it was a pretty ridiculous thing to get us all the way up there

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
if they weren't going to let us in. They could have made up their minds about that before they pulled us up there.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
We then went into lunch, Mr. Jenkins.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
And during the lunch, I was sitting down at one,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
so at one end of the table, Mr. Stevens,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
the head of the table, Senator McCartney.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
A discussion came up about Aaron Coleman and Mr. Stevens,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Senator McCartney, and Senator Smith of New Jersey and a couple of others

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
were discussing the Coleman case.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
When all of a sudden a Colonel, or Lieutenant Colonel,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
I don't remember which, I think it was the full Colonel, chicken Colonel.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
From down at the end of the table, jump up and held up his hand

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
and ordered Mr. Stevens to be quiet.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
That surprised everybody.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Everybody looked up at this Colonel who had just told the Secretary of the Army to keep quiet.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And Mr. Stevens looked up at the Colonel.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
The Colonel said, Mr. Stevens, you're a secretary.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
You're discussing a case which is confidential

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
and you have no authority to discuss that case.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
Mr. Adamson looked at a little black book which he had in his pocket

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
and took the name of the Colonel and made some comments that the Colonel

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
would not be in that vicinity for a very long period of time.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I understand that he has nothing.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
The whole thing, sir, was filled, that whole day was filled with a bunch of ridiculous incidents.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
At the end of it, at the end of it, Mr. Stevens got up

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
and ordered a little talk, a very fine talk, a very gracious talk, in which he covered

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
a number of events about the investigation and the situation of Mondays and Marow.

14:43.000 --> 14:52.000
And said that he certainly hopes that Roy Cohn and Harold Rainbow and Bob Jones

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
would have, however else, might have been the object of this exclusion,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
would understand that the decision was made as if he could make it,

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
thought it was all for him, and it was very, very fine, very, very sweet.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
Then we went around the table and everybody at the table got up and said something.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
When it came around to me, I got up and said,

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
I recall, I expressed my appreciation to everyone present for their courtesy

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
and everything else, and I tried to make some generally pleasant remarks.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
And said as far as the incident to which Mr. Stevens referred,

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
that was all forgotten about on our part, that the only hope that Mr. Rainbow and Mr. Jones

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
and I had was that by the time the investigation was over, people who worked for the U.S. Senate

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
would be able to get in the laboratory, and that the communists would not be able to get in the laboratory.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
And that concluded that I came across a little newspaper account which reported that incident in 2008.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
Someone humorously threw a three-day lighter, and that's the way I recall the thing that was going to happen.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
The board of directors and shareholders, thanks for the announcement.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
The senior-ranking Democratic members under McCullough and necessarily absent this morning,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
and this afternoon, as well now, we said the purposes of specialization

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
meet the mandate to a clock saps now.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
You have Dr. Chairman not announced, that the next session of the hearings will be at 2 p.m. this afternoon.
