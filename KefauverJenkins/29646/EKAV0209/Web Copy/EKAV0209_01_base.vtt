00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Not to be record of those telephone calls.

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
But I would say that at the time that at time,

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
I received two and three telephone calls a day.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
And there were other days, of course, on which I received either one or no telephone call.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
But I received consistently throughout that case, possibly an average of two telephone calls.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Call.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Mr. Holmes, is that true or is it not?

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
So, it will difficult for me to understand that, exactly.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Why would this call me dating? You called him 40 times a day.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
About a commission for day's time, did you?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
A two or three times a day. That's just what I read as I recall.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
As I understood what you read, Mr. Daniel.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
You read, but I would say at times I received two and three telephone calls a day.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Now, did you not respond? I don't believe I spoke with General Reva two or three times on any day.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Well, are you in position to definitely deny her a pretty?

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Well, sir, I am in position to give you the general picture, and there's no hiding at all.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Just me about that.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
So, what do you say about whether or not you called him two or three times a day on Sunday?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I would say I don't think I did. You say you don't think you did?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
No, sir. You declined to be about it?

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
I can be almost positive about that, sir. I don't think the total number of times I thought the General Reva was much more than four or five or something like that.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Four or five or something like that. It should have been more.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Could have been more than four.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
All right. Now, you think you talked to him on D-line?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I think that was his first concern.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
I think. And if you talked to him four or five or more times, then that would be five or six times that he talked to this General about it.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
They shine during the month of July, wasn't they?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I think that's about the best lesson I can make, sir.

01:50.000 --> 01:59.000
I would ask him to call the weather and not ask her.

01:59.000 --> 02:07.000
You had exhausted every effort within your power to get a commission through General Reva?

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
You wouldn't win the General Reva. General Walter, please speak.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Other questions are exhausting every effort within our time to get a General Reva, sir.

02:15.000 --> 02:26.000
The General on the first occasion, when Sen. Cautley asked him if one would save shine experience with the fallow life for commission General Reva, unhezotatingly said he was sure that he would be.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
The Army Transport Service, the Work he has done with the Committee, doesn't experience other things.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
He was sure that he would be.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And Senator A. F. Meade to follow it up might did.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
And I call the General, and he seemed gradually to retreat from what he had originally said.

02:42.000 --> 02:56.000
Till at Gutsville Point, around the end of July, when he made it clear that there has been a change, and that shine would not get a commission.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
It was after that, I believe, sir, that I thought with General Smith.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You went to the State Department.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I did.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
And I hope to do all of these with the bad recognition for day shine, didn't you, my Jessica?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
How many times you talk to General Smith about his phone?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
One time, wait.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Nice to go and say why I talk to him.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
How the last two women and not you go, General Smith said.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
He, talking about Mr. Oikov, will tell that the Army of the Arities has not been cooperating.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
The General Reaper has promised to arrange for a commission to miss the shine, and it has not been so.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Did you tell that was his phone?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
What I recall telling General Smith is this, sir.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
And I think you might find it to be just about the same thing.

03:48.000 --> 03:58.000
I told General Smith that General Reaper had originally faced on the merits and the qualifications of shine said that there could be no doubt that he was fighting for a commission.

03:58.000 --> 04:17.000
That after where he retreated from, that original statement, that Sunday McCarthy has heard from somebody in the Pentagon that although General Reaper himself would find in, there might be some hard feelings by the General.

04:17.000 --> 04:30.000
Again, Mr. Shine resulting from an unfudged experience which Mr. Shine and I had had with the man who we did not then know, but who turned out to be General Reaper's brother.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
That brother worked for the state department.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I spoke to that point.

04:35.000 --> 04:44.000
I spoke to General Smith and asked him if he could find out whether or not, if he were generally the original statement, that China was clearly qualified.

04:44.000 --> 04:54.000
And if he were the change and if he were the fact that we turned out we had had this unfudged experience with General Manor, but General Reaper's brother, whether the application has been given a fair shake.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
That was a process that my conversation was. General Smith on that point.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
How long have he been human access to General Smith's testimony and ask you whether it's true or relevant to him?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Sure.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
According on page 147 of the record.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I have missed the phone way things have been.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
As I was the one who had actually no faith there.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
He was tied to the Army as I had been to have been cooperating.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
That General Reaper had promised to arrange for a commission from Mr. Shine and was not done so.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
The guy you are with senior officers in the Pentagon would know who the top point is.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Is that true or not, Miss Bill?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I was told that to the governor.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
The circumstances that I recall.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
And this is a different in detail as a matter of memory.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
I have a pirate section, General Smith.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
The way it happened was that the federal I know General Smith.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And I know that General Smith knew Dave Shine and his family.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I knew about him and about his qualifications.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I was talking to General Smith.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
General Smith called the office by police.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Got something or other.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
And I mentioned this situation to him.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
He said, drop over tomorrow morning or whatever it was.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
I went over and I told him about the situation.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
The reason for my talking with General Smith is that I don't expect him to have read my mind.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Where did he know me?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
He knew Shine.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
And he certainly knew a few folks over in the Army and was being a very good position to find out

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
whether the application had been treated on his nurse.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
But didn't you tell him when he said, well, why didn't you come to me? I'm not in the Army.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Didn't you say, by General Smith, you know everybody in the Pentagon?

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
You all the senior officers there and you would know who the top is.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
I certainly might have said.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I will be certainly mad at you.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
You won't be mad at me.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Of course, I do not.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Then you were not only not Mr. Colman.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Did you tell General Smith when you talked to him?

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
Obviously, if you lie, that you were just talking to him as Roy and Colman individuals.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
All right.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Did you...

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
This is so safe yourself in any way from your official position as the representative of the United States.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
You didn't do anything.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I didn't tell him now that I was just talking to him.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
You didn't tell him the future stars of individualism.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
You were the high as a representative of the United States General Winking Zone.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
So he came to send him a copy of General Rivers, I think.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Uh, that's important.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
If you're trying to get General Rivers, just be the processing of applications just like that for people on Capitol Hill.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I don't think any of us knew General Rivers or had ever heard of it.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
We...

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
And...

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Pull the man-wad, who's in handle, we've application.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
That's turned out to be General Reve.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
He stopped over the Senate of Matroski's office, I suppose, every day in the week.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
He or his step-stopped into the office, the other Senate in the building.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
And with talks with the Senate of Matroski about this, I think I came in at the pale end of the conversation.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
I did not say I am hereby just associating myself from...

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Do you know the word General Reve was talking to a United States Senator?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yes, I have stopped.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Sure.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Chairman of the Democratic House Committee, sir.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
I was talking to a chief counsellor, sir.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Sure.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And that is with the passive-imit colony, which you were supposed to be.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Water-beated, we have two issues.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Uh, that's a little bit more difficult to say.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Sir, I know General Smith personally, I did not know General Rivers personally.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
But when you went to him, it didn't say now General Rivers forgets the fact

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
that I am chief counsellor for the president of the party that's giving to the United States.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I didn't tell him to forget it or to remember it, sir.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
I don't.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
And for all who knew here was the union of President of the Representative of the United States Senator,

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
asking me a member of the State Department to use my influence to the Pentagon

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
over there to give me an opportunity.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I thought you were talking about General Rivers.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm sorry, sir.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm not going to be the same.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I'm sorry, sir.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
I had a very long talk with General Smith, not only about this, but about a lot of other personnel

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
and other things and a very sweet and strong, and I have a very high respect for him.

09:06.000 --> 09:14.000
And I talked to him as I always do, I hope, as, uh, as, who I am talking to, eh?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Man, I don't know if I have a good deal of respect.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
Mr. Corn, you think back to the General Rivers on the following day of our, uh, our General Smith on the following day, did you know?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
No, sir.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I saw General Smith only once.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
I talked with him only once, but if you could see whether this application has been treated properly.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Did you not talk to him on the telephone as a later date?

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
No, I talked to him the day before his Irish role, and I talked to him one day, and I started telling him the story of his telephone,

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
and he said, come around tomorrow morning on something like that, and I talked around to his office the next morning, and I talked to him.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
I believe I talked to him on the phone one, which the appointment was after the reign.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
I thought him one in his office, and I believe that that was back.

10:02.000 --> 10:13.000
And that is the first life the only time he ever talked to General Smith is about a commission or any dispensation for the challenge of what you say.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
I believe it is, sir, that's his recollection, according to his statement here, and that's mine.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't recall any other questions.

10:20.000 --> 10:33.000
Now Mr. Coon, I believe that there was a breakfast held on September 16th in the China Department of New York City, was there not?

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Who the thing is that breakfast?

10:38.000 --> 10:55.000
Senator Mustard, the secretary, my fellow Dave Shines, secretary Steven Fess, the meat Dave Shines, mother he did not know her, and he came in to meet Secretary of State of Humanities and spoke with him.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
And where was that meat in the hair? We had seen a picture in the legroom of something in the estimator.

11:00.000 --> 11:09.000
Where was that meat in the hair? We got meat in the tail. It was breakfast of the department, Mr. and Mrs. Shines, what day?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
We're not State Father, not State Father, not.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
We got on the wall of power in New York City.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Did you spend the night there?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
At I spent the night? No, he was I spent the night there.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But tonight, my house, was full.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
You were this boy that you chimed as a matter of fact now, where almost constant time used was good warm person of mine, Robert.

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
I have to say, today, sir, the show's as late, where and we are, good friend, he is one of my many good friends, I hope you will not ask me to.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
Dale, which one is they? Better friend, I have a lot of good friends, and I like them, and I respect them all.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
I will ask you when we're not Mr. Colinor and I'll take you.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
It's because there was a thief in the Shonda Hills.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Then the Maca-thee asked the secretary of the Army for the second time.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
No, for the first time, for the second day.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Gained the secretary's second to the state, and first to the secretary.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Far recognition for the day the child.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
He did not. He did not? He did not.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
It's full now, I want to read you what the secretary says about it.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I'll take you 109.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Okay, Jesus.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Yes, my recollections, the secretary of the Army.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
That does better than back one, that's it.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I got a very nice.

12:28.000 --> 12:35.000
My recollections, the secretary of the Army, the secretary of the Army, asked me for a commission for David Cheyne.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Since that was familiar with the fact that the application for commission for David Cheyne has been turned down.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
So we choose him.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
I move the way that this is rapidly as I could.

12:47.000 --> 12:54.000
By me, this is the north that time that a previous application on the part of Cheyne's commission has been denied by the Army.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
This is the secretary of the Army.

12:57.000 --> 13:07.000
Did you know all the information that at that time, which Jesus has made to very simply including General Reaver, Dennis Smith, and that's all that the members of the secretary of the commission have been saying in Cheyne.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
I knew about the cases that were being done in the region, Dennis Smith, yes sir.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Now we're talking about this breakfast from September 16th in New York City.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And you heard what the secretary said about this, Miss Combe?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I heard everything he said about that.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
You're really classified as a very legitimate.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
I heard him and the user says it on Medicaid units.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
So the number of cases is not the question of the secretary of the commission for Cheyne.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Hi, Joe sir.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
What was said on Medicaid?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
And I might say, sir, if I might explain that answer, hamplet buyers.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Mr. Steven Furthest said to him on the phone.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
I believe and I hope it's the wealth will correct me if I'm wrong, that he was very aby about the whole thing.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
But not sure what or anything was said about a commission on that vacation.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
And lots of things very much up in the air.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
I think I can help because I do have a clear recollection.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
And I know that on that occasion and on no other occasion in my presence,

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
the senator McCarthy, Eric Smith, and Steven for a direct commission for David Cheyne.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Well David Cheyne, how about that morning?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
He was.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Mr. Brown was there any discussion, whatever, on Medicaid?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
There was.

14:10.000 --> 14:18.000
By either you, our senator McCarthy, we respect the any special, misconcretionary assignments for David Cheyne.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
There was not any discussion concerning any special favor or dissonstations for David Cheyne.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Now you are in the secretary's place.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
That at least on one thing.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
The senator from Wisconsin asked him for a commission for any time.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
You heard that, didn't you?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
I did.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I'm in time.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
Even if he said that he wasn't, there was not definite issues with all the circumstances in New York City.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
And say you're taking about this, and if it's in this room, it's cold.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Did you ever, anytime, hear Senator McCarthy's asking me?

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
At the end, if that is no sudden, and I have the record, take too well.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Unintentioned.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Mr. James, if you're in mind, clear on that, or is it heavy?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Secretary, it is not clear.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
You say you're minding me, Sam?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I'm not, it's not heavy, I'm not, I just don't know.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
And if the secretary uses his best recollection, the secretary gets around September 16th,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
he uses his favorite secretary as an area.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I say he's made an character.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Did you talk with the colonel?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
To...

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Secretary, he's been...

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Oh, not through a second.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
I just...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
In New York City?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I just...

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I'm sorry.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Did you say New York City?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
It was hard to be clear.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
Anyway, on New York City, I was watching an end, Mr. Steven's office.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I decided.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Unless you were in my place, it's 10 times.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
It's been a month again.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
He was taken to out.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
I've elested Mr. Scol, whether or not I'm up for my second one.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
You and in the presence of Mr. Car, as the secretary, I mean, sorry,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Secretary, I mean, sorry, Secretary, I meant for you, David Chatton.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I did not.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
You did not?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Now, I want to introduce what's the secretary.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I need four of our sats at your store.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
And we're talking about the family of October, 1950.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
Mr. Gohm told me about the poor's training investigation of my work.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
And he said the general of the Canadian General of the Port Montenegro's installation has taken some action.

16:17.000 --> 16:25.000
The greatest gift of the staff and the senator of the country is to literally get the information they wanted by talking to the people they wanted to talk to the Port Montenegro's.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
And he finished with his campaign, made a bill of interest with the job.

16:29.000 --> 16:36.000
I said, well, I'm only the property of the committee, the very limited matter of the end, in their face, then and then.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I called General Law and the telephone.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
This is Lincoln.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
What did you think of General Law and the man that first told Mr. Scol,

16:45.000 --> 16:53.000
and that he was going to make available those people and his installations,

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
that the properly accredited representatives, the senator of the country's committee,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
is going to send him a review.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Do you have the secretary to sign my head, that secretary?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
This is your call, Mr. Scol.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Ah, that's a correct answer with this qualification.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Mr. Scol, I just identified the indirect examination.

17:13.000 --> 17:24.000
We stood up with Mr. Scol, and the fact that General Law and I did not know whether he could make personnel as whole available for interview by the testimony staff.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
And after we obtained clearance for him to make that possible from the Pentagon.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Mr. Scol and I brought that up with Mr. Scol.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
He was called General Law and say that from his standpoint, Mr. Scol,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
he was in charge of General Law and said,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
if he was complete cooperate, Mr. Scol,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
please call in our federal.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
I could hear only what Mr. Scol said in the federal law.

17:49.000 --> 17:59.000
Mr. Scol, General Law, so the cooperate was by making a single operation to make available throughout any personnel out of court limits.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
We wanted to introduce him.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
We had explained to Mr. Scol.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Mr. Scol, we all got an agent.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
That's certainly the army we want to follow.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
He told us that General Law and complete cooperation was to miss you any one of your folks.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
Then there was a long silence on Mr. Scol's behalf of the fall.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
While General Law and with apparently saying something, which I assumed to be,

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
is in service to the takin' of Mr. Scol's direction.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
When General Law and was finished talking, Mr. Scol said,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
no, no, I didn't mean that.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Don't give them that.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Mr. Scol and I looked at each other,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
but it's a very well-expective way of taking away.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
That is what I recall about conversation.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
I don't know what General Law and the secretary's thesis would show us,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
and what Secretary's thesis would be.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
But when he said, no, not that, I didn't mean that.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Don't show them that.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Whatever.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Over to our ice room, that kind of thing.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Go on, I want to read your brothers and your secretary's thesis.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
The secretary's gone to the secretary's room.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
Mr. Scol's mother, the mother of his new-savish child,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
and one of the know-how he couldn't be a time to New York City.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Now, that's the occasion when the secretary calls on the law commission.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yes, sir.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Where did the cooperate?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Yes, sir.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
And the secretary's here positively and in the room.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
That on that occasion.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
And in the presence of Mr. Scol's heart,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
you've ordered an enormous number of seconds,

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
approximately one month before this boy was inducted in there.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
You've ordered a certificate, David Cheyenne,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
and one of the know-how he couldn't be a time to New York City.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Did you receive any?

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Sir, I can answer that until you go back and let me tell you

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
about the first time the fire time the day he came,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
which I had with Mr. Steven's on the subject of day time.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Will you be back on the same date?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
I'll go with second.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
No, sir.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Confrontations, which were held on December 15th,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
and two specific ones, the 10th of December 16th, and the 10th of 21st.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
The 15th meeting being in there, and we shall have heard them.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
That's right.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Would you mind me saying that you got the certificate

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
about Day Shine on that occasion?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
That is, sir.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
Well, Mr. Bohn, this is the question that I've asked you now,

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
and then you're sending me in my little back, and explaining.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
My question now is that you are not over the second.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
In the presence of Frank Carr,

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
day to the 6th day of the Army in judgment

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
that you wanted to say Shine has signed in New York City

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
to your wonder-know-how, because this is possibly getting the sign.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
That was not the discussion that was held on that day.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Well, I'm making you think some money today,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
and Mr. Coon brought us the matters.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
You, David Shine, and one of the most significant years

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
signing in New York City.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Shine was the God's best.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
That was not what was said, and of course, it was the discussion.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
But it was the God's best, because I didn't want to say it.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
And I reached further.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
This is David's five, and he's able to name a sign in New York City.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
That's very sweet of him.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
When he said that was a lot of committee work to do use,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
that had to be a technical.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
And he was here that were various assignments around New York City

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
that the Army said the sign, David Shine.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Do you think you say that, Mr. Coon?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
No, third, that was not the problem with that conversation.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
I know that, but you might have to just look to have this at home

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
and tell it is exactly what kind of reflection there was

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
in regard to the assignment to the New York area.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Well, Mr. Coon, you are in the title of the Australian

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
and say that was not just the substance of the conversation.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Mr. Jenkins, anything you want out will one word

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
is not to give you a conversation.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
The substance of the conversation on that day is very close.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
Mr. Stevens stated that Shine was going to take space

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
at training like everybody else.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
That right after the space at training, Mr. Stevens

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
had planned out an assignment for Shine whereby Shine

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
was going to be in attendance as an observer

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
at various intelligence goals of the Army

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
for the purpose of reviewing textbooks and other matters

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
and reports directly to Mr. Stevens on that subject.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
This discussion followed a talk with Mr. Stevens on that occasion

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
which Mr. Stevens told us, but he had been greatly discerrified

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
by the General Project's testimony over the use of

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
pro-communist literature and communist indoctrination literature

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
by Army intelligence in the schools.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Mr. Stevens also told us that as they were told before

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
are self-explanatory.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
He had, he, Mr. Stevens, had had a long thought

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
with a major, whose name he's gotten from up, I believe,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
teaching as an Army intelligence school,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I believe, out of talent.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Now, that's from the outline of the major data

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
and the type of literature they were used in the process

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
situation and other reports which he had gotten.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
He's a secretary who was very much discerrified

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
about the whole situation and that he was looking forward

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
to using Shine so his great advantage in going over

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
the text materials and going to the schools and reporting

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
to Mr. Stevens.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
I believe, there is, I have no clear recollection

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
but it's perfectly possible or probable that I

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
as Mr. Stevens at that point is during the basic training

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
where I would have was summary and 50 made for staff members

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
who contact Mr. Shine in case of emergency

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
or in case there was something which we might meet for him.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
That is, the best of my recollection is the substance

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
flux occurred on that occasion and there are some five discussions

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
for Mr. Stevens about this.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Shine assignment which we have not covered.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
If you want to, I will, if you don't, I...

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
But I'll not do this second.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
You see, the text will you miss?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
There might be a case in between you

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
that's on a control service which you shine about committee work.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
That is perfectly possible third.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I do not deny it.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
So Mr. Colm...

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Ah...

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
That makes some even hinting times up to that time.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
So, Mr. Stevens, if you can talk to somebody in the Pentagon

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
about David Shine,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
he made a day for the defense.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Or is that a commission time?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
About a commission or about...

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I read about time wins with General Regent George.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
George.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
I have least one with the General Regent George.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I think more than that, sir.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
I think there was discussion for Mr. Stevens on September 16th.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
And about Shine?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yes, sir.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
And on September 21st.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Now that you want to explain the September 16th discussion with...

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Whatever you think.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
They will.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
But that's on September 2nd now.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
You need to have some aged and distinctions with these respected gentlemen

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
to add them to that Shine.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Ah, I don't believe I had ever thought with Mr. Atten.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
I...

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
To that's not.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
No, sir.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I believe I met Mr. Atten.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Very recently on September 28th.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I did not discuss Shine with him,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and he did not discuss Shine with me.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Really?

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I very much would like interrupting you to put the microphone down.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
But from the examination,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
but I do think that...

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
In view of the facts,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm much of a maid of the Shine situation,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
that they witnessed.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
They showed me out to Calabuncey,

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
the other two meetings with Shine with the staff.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I know that it gives nothing apt to.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Give him place to go to meet him.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
Mr. King, the senator will have ample opportunity

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
to examine and cut the damages with me.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
I'm trying to get along.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I know the committee wants to get along.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
Mr. Cohn, you have a second day armistad of the bulls-baits.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
That's a macintamidian.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
That's a macintamidian.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
And you were both indicated to me

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
as early as I saw with the first two.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
But you were ready to insist and continue

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
your sportsman with investigation.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And turn it back to the Army.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
You look all that testimony.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I do, sir.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
I'll ask you whether or not they didn't attack.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
That at that time that is on October 13th.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Something was sent to the secretary.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
About here that I have registered to turn it over to him

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
together with your information that was available

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
and let the Army proceed with it.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Is that a hurt?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
No, sir.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
What occurred was that the secretary or somebody...

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I remember the term,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
the investigation is going to go on forever

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
and send it to McAuthy to know it will not go on forever.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
There will be a time when we'll step out,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
turn it over and you'll have it all be itself.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
When that time comes, we'll depend on a great measure

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
on the job of house cleaning, what you people do.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
And I remember the senator running to quite a detailed discussion

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
about the government printing off its investigation.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
So that's got it out.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
It could have taken much longer than it did,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
so we're short by the complete 100th event.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Not look at that, but actual cooperation,

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
which we received from Mr. Blattinburg,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
the head of the government printing off.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
So you say that when the secretary of the Army

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
testified here under all that an indication

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
or a statement was given to him on October 13th

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
that he was going to send it back over to him

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
that he's incorrect about that?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
I would say that he's incorrect in the time though.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
There was certainly no doubt that it was made clear

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
in the investigation was not going to go on forever.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I do say, sir, that he has been taken

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
and sustaining the hope on that occasion

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
that the bowing out of this subcommittee

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
from communist infiltration at Montenegro in the Army

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
was an imminent matter.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
And I think, sir, that's the newspaper for which I put

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
an evidence yesterday, what's the sentence

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
that's redeemable to issue that press release saying

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
he was going to turn it back on October 19th

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
that it was no doubt.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And Mr. David's mind that the senator was not

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
to turn it back at that point.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
Mr. Cohn wasn't as a result of statements made

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
by you and our senator McCartney to the secretary

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
of the Saddam's on October 15th and 14th

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
that Mr. Adams prepared this proposed press release

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
on the 19th day of October 19th.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't know why he prepared it, sir.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
I do know that nothing was said to him

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
on the 13th of October, particularly, sir,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
when you take into account the two events

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
on the 14th of October, mainly the stripping of a file

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
and the senator's dislike, which was conveyed to Mr. Adams

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
on that, and General Watson testimony.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
That it was only when we came in, they started doing something,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
which made it pretty clear that if we went out,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
they would stop doing anything.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
The senator discussed both matters with Mr. Adams

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
and I am sure that on October 19th, Mr. Adams,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
while he was welcome to try,

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
to have had no sound reason for believing

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
that the senator was about to bow out of these investigations.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Now you made a trip to Montreux on the 20th day

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
of October's bondage.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Yes, sir.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
And that's been rather fully described here.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
You heard that testimony, haven't you, sir?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Yes, sir.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
Mr. Cohn, when you were denied as missions

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
to a sensitive laboratory,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
you became highly insane.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Now that's the truth about it, isn't it?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That is the truth, sir.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
And I'm not a see-you.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
You say this is a declaration of war, isn't it?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I don't recall the exact words I used there.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
I don't recall saying that.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I can give you the substance of what happened

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
and the substance of what I said.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
If you allow it, it's been going to Mr. Cohn, because...

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The second day of the Army was that.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Oh, yes, he was that.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
And you just say that he was wanting you

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
to just continue the investigation of Fort Monks

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
and the Army.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Oh, yes.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
That's right.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
And Mr. Adams was that.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Yes, sir.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
But if the little was that, the second day of the age.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yes, sir.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Which then in court was that?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Yes, sir.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Many of us were like, it's done 20, 25 people

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
including the United States Senator

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
and the United States and the Congress.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
That's whether the whole strain of cars.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And the results of that, he is representing his wife.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Yes, sir.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
And then the result of that, he is representing his wife.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Both presidents and presidents of the Potterworth,

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
A. We represent.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
And maybe high ranking officials,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
most of the Army,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
and the civilian mass,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
that's right, he is the school.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
It is right.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
And you will say, you might say,

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
in all those civil groups of the United States senators,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I think he comes to the United States.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Oh, nothing much was entitled me to that high designation fair.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And I don't think that is from my right side.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
So an actor is just.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
All right.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
I'm leading you to the 8.3564,

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
the testimony of his young men believe.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Coding Ryan Gold.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
This is it.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
This is law with the Army.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Did you say that was gold?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Sir, I have no recollection of the words I used.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Specifically to answer you.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I do not remember using those words.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Further further, Mr. James,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
you don't deny.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Well, I come pretty close to denying it,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
because I talked to Mr. Rainbow and Mr. Jones,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
who are with me throughout on that day.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
And they tell me that they were angry as I was.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
And a lot of things were said.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
They don't recall those particular words,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
they said that I will make no one to be fair,

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
that I was angry.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
And if you want.
