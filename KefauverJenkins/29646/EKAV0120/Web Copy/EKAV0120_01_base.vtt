00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Mr. David Schott of the committee staff was about to be dressed.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
And that he, Mr. Combe and Senator McCarthy, felt that he should have a direct commission

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
for which they considered him qualified by education and by reason of the fact that during

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
the last war he had, as a subordinate employee, tells the substance and day war for responding

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
to the rank of lieutenant.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
I asked Mr. Cohen why he came to me as I was no longer in the act of military service.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
He replied that the army authority had not been cooperating, that General Reaver had promised

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
to arrange for a commission for Mr. Schott and had not done so, that I knew all the senior officers

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
in the Pentagon and would know whom to talk.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
I answered that I would phone General Hall and find out what the possibilities were and gave

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
him a direct commission.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I asked Mr. Cohen an appointment to see me in my office the next day.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I phoned General Hall about 430 on July 31.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
He informed me that direct commissions were being issued only in a few of the technical services,

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
such as the medical and judge-adget general department.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
That Mr. Schott's qualifications did not justify his direct commissioning in any of these branches.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
General Hall said that the opportunity to qualify for all of the candidate training was open to Mr. Schott,

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
as it was to any other citizen drafted into the armed forces.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
And as the secretary of the army, who was aware of all the facts in the case, had directed that the

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
pre-sundered courted and the opportunity supported Mr. Schott, after he's entered into the military service,

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
should be the same as for any other American citizen, no more and no less.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
Mr. Cohen came to my office at 11.20 a.m., on August 1, 1953.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I hold in the substance of General Hall's reply to my inquire.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
He said that for Mr. Schott to proceed through facing training, an opportunity to would increase his

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
five military service and have since from these duties in the committee, which he did.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
I asked if Mr. Schott had had ROTC, and if he had attempted to obtain a commission in any other branch of the armed service.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Mr. Cohen replies that Mr. Schott had no ROTC training, and that there appeared to be no chance of a commission,

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
in one of the other branches, except that the expense of a protractive thermal service.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
Mr. Cohen then asked if the CIA could not arrange to have Mr. Schott in commission, as he had investigated experience.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
I replied that the CIA drew a few commission personnel by details from the armed services, but gave them additional training,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
and required a longer tour of duty.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
However, I often tell a phone Mr. Allen Dulles, director of central intelligence, to ask about the possibility.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
Mr. Cohen said that I need not do this. The CIA said was to duty a subject for future investigation,

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
and it would not be right to ask them to get Mr. Schott in commission, and then investigate the organization later.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Very soon, tell me what it means to be a smith.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
They will remember generally Smith's badmouther in places.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
All the facts that you remember was referenced to those two conversations with Mr. Cohen.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
It does. It does.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
I will ask you whether or not all those two occasions are on either of those occasions.

03:20.000 --> 03:31.000
You considered that Mr. Cohen was acting as an individual or was acting officially as counsel for the McCarthy Investigating Committee.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
I assumed that he was acting in both departments, as the counsel for the McCarthy Committee,

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
and especially as the friend of the young man for whom he was seeking the commission.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
How long were you actively connected to the Army?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Forty-one years.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
They'd weather not doing all of your years of experience with the Army.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
You have been contacted from time to time by United States Senators Congressman,

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
and the administrative officials and others, with reference to pursuing your calls into the given a commission

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
to an inductee at that the Army and forces.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
They've heard from a member of the Army forces.

04:13.000 --> 04:22.000
I have been contacted many, many times, and on a number of occasions by members of the Congress.

04:22.000 --> 04:35.000
Did you regard these requests by Mr. Cohen on behalf of Shann as ex-automator, or any humanitarian proper?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I did not.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
They'd weather not only their illicitations, you felt that Mr. Cohen was being to present them

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
that was trying to hide their hearing while.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
Not me, sir.

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
Did Mr. Cohen abay you that Shann was an experienced consultant to the staff of Senator McCarthy?

05:04.000 --> 05:23.000
With respect to the investigation of inter-imperialization of communist and those who were first security members in the Army and other departments of the government?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Not to my recollection, sir.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
He's been simply mentioned as I recall that Mr. Cohen, as I knew, had investigated experience.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
Mr. Shann had investigated experience along the lines I have mentioned generally, is that what you mean?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
That's what I understood at the beginning.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
I'll ask you whether or not that is one of the reasons assigned by Mr. Cohen at that time in asking that you intercede on behalf of Shann.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
Not specifically.

05:55.000 --> 06:08.000
Had you heard of that time, Mr. Smith, that an investigation has been planned of the alleged infiltration of communist at Fort Monmouth?

06:08.000 --> 06:17.000
I have read a good deal about the alleged infiltration of communist support Monmouth, but my recollection does not place the two together and I don't know the dates.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
You, of course, would not know when Senator McCarthy or his staff laid their plans to make that investigation, I think.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
I would not.

06:27.000 --> 06:38.000
You have no recollection now that at that time that investigation was either actually under way or was only preferentialist to be carried into effect.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I do not.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
I think in general, you know that Senator McCarthy and his staff did in fact investigate Fort Monmouth.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I do.

06:49.000 --> 06:58.000
It was given why he was able to investigate, and a matter of interest to you in the State Department as well as everyone else that has been discussed.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
That's correct.

07:01.000 --> 07:17.000
Do you recall that that investigation was obviously in some thirty-three civilian inquiries that Fort Monmouth, who in either discharge, are dismissed?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I do not recall the exact results of the Council.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I know that some were dismissed and some were suspended.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
The General Smith has an argument and occupying your present position.

07:32.000 --> 07:50.000
I would ask you if it isn't the fact that you regard the work of investigating the infiltration of poor security vests in the Army as extremely important.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
And having talked about our day reading in this country.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
I regard the investigation of poor security risks anywhere, especially in government, as very important.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
Regarding the priority rating, you're asking me to read it by comparison with other events now taking place and I must compensate for that.

08:10.000 --> 08:21.000
I think especially regarding the important Fort Monmouth in dealing with facts that Fort Monmouth is an Army signal installation.

08:21.000 --> 08:30.000
I paid very little attention to it, and I would not regard it as more important there than I would anywhere else in any other sensitive place.

08:30.000 --> 08:40.000
Do you know General Smith is a matter of fact that the defense is being set up by this country against the Tomicom habit in Baumwark Warfare?

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
Are standards in radar plants and other plants at Fort Monmouth?

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
I do not. You do not know that it's a fact.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
That doesn't mean that they're not. I simply do not know it.

08:53.000 --> 09:06.000
One other question. I ask these of you who say two other questions. I believe you say that at no time Senator McCarty ever comes active you with reference to two days a child.

09:06.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm speaking from very grave, very long term recollection. It is possible.

09:15.000 --> 09:26.000
I talk to Senator McCarty about another matter that he before and it is possible that on that occasion the senator may have asked me to give an appointment to Mr. Col.

09:26.000 --> 09:39.000
But I do not recall that specifically he mentioned the subject or that he mentioned Mr. Shine in connection there with and I am not even certain that on that occasion he asked me to receive Mr. Col.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
Are you not even stated as a fact? I do not.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
Then eliminating Senator McCarty your only contacts where we'll Mr. Col.

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
That's it. This final question. Do you regard any things that by Mr. Col.

09:57.000 --> 10:10.000
I do not.

10:10.000 --> 10:22.000
I have to ask the chairman. The last question asked by the council of the question of the chairman is I have to ask.

10:22.000 --> 10:35.000
There is nothing in the individual in South Florida member of Congress or any other friends requesting a direct commission for an individual in the armed services.

10:35.000 --> 10:43.000
If he believes that the individual is qualified willing to bear on it. There is not. I have done so myself.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
So to make such a request is not within itself asking for a preparation consideration is it?

10:50.000 --> 11:01.000
It is not. It becomes established that the individual does not assess the requisite qualifications.

11:01.000 --> 11:08.000
And then one insists that he be given granted its direct commission.

11:08.000 --> 11:17.000
Would you regard that then as asking for a preferential consideration as an army officer I work but no such request has been made to me?

11:17.000 --> 11:30.000
I understand. I have any other requests than may be since you have been under Secretary of State and since you left the army to assist in securing a commission or direct commission for anyone else?

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
Yes. By members of Congress? No. How many? Yes, in general.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
I would recall possibly two. Possibly two. That's all.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Thank you.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
I'm Chairman. Within a limit to recollection I think General Smith's statement speaks for itself.

11:49.000 --> 12:00.000
And I see no reason why I should prepare any questions that might elicit opinions that might be only remotely approximately two and what is before it.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
And consequently I let the statement stand for itself and I have no question.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
I don't have no question. I have no question. I have no question. I have no question.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
When you contacted the department of defense?

12:14.000 --> 12:24.000
Was Mr. Cohen and your time ordered you contact the army or the department of defense and then report back to Mr. Cohen as to the results of your intersection?

12:24.000 --> 12:36.000
As I recall it, I contacted the department of defense or rather General Paul, to buy a seat to staff of the army immediately after my telephone call with Mr. Cohen.

12:36.000 --> 12:49.000
When did you notify Mr. Cohen as to the information that you secured from the army? On my recollection? Not until he called on me the next day.

12:49.000 --> 13:00.000
I have no question. Mr. World, I have a few questions. You have questions you would keep account of.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Never send them in.

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
Mr. Chairman, I think it would be a great invitation for me to keep the general here alone.

13:12.000 --> 13:26.000
Mr. President, I think the picture is very clear. I think the new and proper pressure was applied to him and it would be difficult to apply pressure to the general.

13:26.000 --> 13:37.000
I think you get to do more important things than to discuss a private army who has been promoted to the system until you are still a private.

13:37.000 --> 13:44.000
I have no questions. I have no questions.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
You don't know who they are. I know we are in America. I have one other question.

13:50.000 --> 14:06.000
General Smith, you have stated that you do not regard these two requests by Mr. Cohen as being out of the ordinary or suggesting anything in proper.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
May I ask this?

14:10.000 --> 14:31.000
Whether or not in your opinion, this significance of those two requests made by Mr. Cohen and detail value may be properly evaluated as two isolated instances.

14:31.000 --> 14:45.000
Whether or not they are to be evaluated in the light of other and succeeding events or a chain of events.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
Mr. Chairman, I am not the person to evaluate those things by. I am only able to testify what I know.

14:52.000 --> 15:03.000
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Thank you very much.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Thank you very much.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
From Washington, the mutual network is bringing you on the spot coverage of the La Bacardi Army hearing.

15:10.000 --> 15:18.000
Our coverage will continue after this 10th second pause for station identification. This is the mutual broadcasting system.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
WOR now leaves the hearing to the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigation.

15:23.000 --> 15:31.000
Last witness in the controversies between Senator McCarthy, Roy Cohn and Army officials, the General Water Beetles Smith, under Secretary of the Army.

15:31.000 --> 15:41.000
We shall resume the broadcast of the hearings at 11 a.m. tomorrow. At the night at half past 10, we will present a recap of today's testimony.

15:41.000 --> 15:51.000
You are tuned to WOR 710, New York. And by a foretrama.

15:51.000 --> 16:15.000
America's leading advertiser is a proud to bring his trans guy, but the latest stars in the old time famous hit plays the radio.

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
The biggest dramatic show ever presented on radio. The WOR Radio Playhouse.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
I was kicked.

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
The General Water Beetles Smith under Secretary of State and made an appointment with the scene.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.000
So stated that he, co-woman Senator McCarthy, felt the shine to have a direct commission.

17:05.000 --> 17:13.000
He stated that the Army authorities have not been cooperated and the General Reaver has failed to obtain a commission for Shah.

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
The General Smith passed this information along to General Johnny Hall, then by Chief of Staff.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
The following day, General Smith was advised that Shah was not qualified for a direct commission.

17:25.000 --> 17:35.000
Further advised that the Secretary of the Army had directed it. The treatment recorded, and the opportunity is afforded to Shah in as the entity army, which be the same as for any other America.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
No more, no less.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
The General Smith passed this information along to Carl when he called on him later that day.

17:44.000 --> 17:55.000
On September 16th, I talked with Senator McCarthy at the World War Powers in New York, where he was visiting in the Shah's family apartment.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
Our meeting was to discuss Army matters, then under investigation by the Senator's committee.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
It was on occasion, as I recollect, that the Senator asked me for a commission for Shah.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
I remind Senator McCarthy that if he knew, Shah's application has been turned down.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I told him that the Army was commissioning very few people.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
In order that there may be no misunderstanding, as to whether or not Senator McCarthy did in fact,

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
to take up with me the matter of the commission for David Shah.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
I told him full of telegram from him to me dated March 12th.

18:32.000 --> 18:47.000
In view of news stories this morning, Ray Cohen and Shah would appreciate if you would make it clear to the press that the only time you and I ever discussed the subject of the commission for David Shah was in his presence.

18:48.000 --> 19:06.000
At which time I urged a new fully agreed that his case had to be treated the same as the case of any other draftee, and that we agreed that any other handling of the case in view of the investigation of the Army would be extremely bad for the committee and the Army and that David Shah and his presence fully agreed with us in this matter.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Ending quotation.

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
The important thing to note is that he admits having taken up with me the matter of the commission for Shah.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
Senator asked me at the September 16 meeting in the Shah in a part of him.

19:21.000 --> 19:35.000
If the Army could use what he calls Shah in special qualification, he suggested a direct assignment such as special assistance to me, or to the Army's intelligence division with particular reference to comment.

19:35.000 --> 19:50.000
I told him that such assignments were not possible or young men of draft age. On October 2nd, 1953, Cohen and Francis Carr of the Senator Staff consulted me in my office for approximately 35 minutes.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
This meeting was to discuss the forthcoming investigation at Fort Monmouth.

19:56.000 --> 20:11.000
I informed them that the Army would assist in every way with the investigation. In the presence of these men, I telephoned General Carr B. Lawton, demanding General at Fort Monmouth and instructed him to give every assistance to the committee.

20:11.000 --> 20:20.000
The subject supports the prohibitions relating to disclosure of loyalty security information, as step forward in presidential directives.

20:20.000 --> 20:28.000
During this discussion, Senator McCarthy has confirmed in his memorandum of October 2nd, which he made public March 12th.

20:28.000 --> 20:37.000
The subject of Shah's induction into the Army came up. Paul and his need of a fine shine to the New York City area, when inducted.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
He stated that the committee must have Shah in available, complete committee work with which Shah in was permitted.

20:43.000 --> 20:53.000
He said that the Army certainly must have settled places in the New York City area, where Shah in the perform army work, without the necessity of taking basic training.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
I told him that I said it would be impossible, but it's due to Shah in from basic training.

20:59.000 --> 21:08.000
Mr. John G. Adams, a two-fold South Dakota, became counselor of the Department of the Army on October 1, 1953.

21:08.000 --> 21:15.000
One of the things that appealed to me in appointing Mr. Adams was his excellent war record.

21:15.000 --> 21:23.000
He served overseas for 34 months during World War II, starting with the North African infantry landing.

21:23.000 --> 21:38.000
He had also had wide experience in legislative matters. First, as clerk of the Senate Armed Services Committee during the 80th Congress, and later as head of the legislative division of the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

21:38.000 --> 21:49.000
I charged him as department counselor with the primary duty of liaison between the Army and the committee, and directed him to cooperate with the committee.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
I thereafter received much of my information about the activities of the committee from him.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
Mr. Adams will tell you firsthand what he knows about the matter at the issue here.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
I shall mention some of the incidents he reported to me.

22:06.000 --> 22:18.000
Mr. Adams advised me in mid-October that Senator McCartney had become irritated with Shah because of his contingent efforts to have his picture taken, along with the senator and others at the committee.

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
The senator hopes that Shah would be drafted and that nothing would occur to stop the draft procedure.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
He asked particularly the call not to be made aware of his attitude for a child.

22:30.000 --> 22:39.000
On October 27, Call New York and told me that the child was due for instruction on November 3.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
He expressed two ideas of his own as the child's future best.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
One was a fellow at the outset of Shah's induction into the Army.

22:49.000 --> 23:00.000
How and tell you have been talking with General Renville, Deputy Director of Selective Service, who he said had agreed that a two-week fellow might be passed.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
The other idea was the possibility of a job at the Central Intelligence Agency.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
Provided CIA to pick him up before the draft got him.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
After talking with Mr. Aram Gauras, Director of CIA the following morning.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
I called home and told him there was no chance of chance of shying the job in CIA.

23:22.000 --> 23:43.000
I told Call New York that the time could be assigned to temporary duty at first timing in New York, prior to starting his regular basic training, if actually needed for committee work.

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
I told him I could not extend the period. He told me he wanted to talk with Senator McCarty about this.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
On October 31, Call and Phone, the E.O.D. was raised with two arrangements with satisfactory practice.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
I gave instructions to expect some necessary details.

24:00.000 --> 24:09.000
Shine was inducted as a pilot in the Army on November 3 and went on temporary duty that day, the first time in New York.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
Almost at the same time, Senator McCarty has Mr. Adam to have Shine's temporary duty in New York camp.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
Because he thought that the newspaper may pick up the story and this might prove embarrassing to Senator McCarty.

24:22.000 --> 24:31.000
Upon running this, Call and Required Suites that the temporary duty, the extended over the first weekend, the little angel, which was done.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
On November 3, I paid an official visit to Fort Fifth.

24:36.000 --> 24:49.000
On that day, I advised Major General C.E. Ryan, commanding general, that he would shortly receive as an inductee, a former staff member of this committee, who might turn out to be a problem for him.

24:49.000 --> 25:04.000
I told General Ryan that Shine should be made available upon the request of the committee staff over weekend, when required to complete Shine's work for the committee, and provided it did not interfere with his training.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
On November 6, Senator McCarty, Call and Call, lunch will Mr. Adam and me in my office.

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
The Senate is on them on them. On November 6, published on March 12, date on April 4.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
We told him, Stephen, we were jammed up trying to get out our reports to file.

25:25.000 --> 25:43.000
And with the mon with investigation and the day of Shine, with about the end of the hour, and had much information and material on the reports and investigations that we could not get along without, Mr. Stephen said that he would arrange for days to complete the work over weekend and after training hours.

25:44.000 --> 25:57.000
On November 7, Senator McCarty, Call, to ask me not to assign private Shine factory committee. I never had any intention of assigning private Shine factory committee.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
But only releasing him for committee business, at times which did not interfere, it is military training.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
In this conversation, the Senate has indicated that the committee had little actual need for Shine services.

26:10.000 --> 26:22.000
I call your attention to the inconsistency between this statement, and the statement made to me the day before it, has confirmed by the memorandum from which I have just read.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
I do not account for this inconsistency, I simply recite the facts.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
My order to General Ryan was that private Shine was to be released only for committee work, when it would not affect his training.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.000
Under the circumstances, I had the trust, Senator McCarty, and his staff, not to abuse the arrangements.

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
I may say here, however, that had I known, you had to give him the General Ryan.

26:47.000 --> 26:56.000
In my effort to assist the committee, we see abuse by the staff of the committee for the extensive wise, the order would never have been issued.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
General Ryan is here, and is prepared to relate the discipline.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
In my order, for a camp, the commanding officer, at Fort Dick.

27:05.000 --> 27:15.000
On December 10th, the Senate of McCarty's request, I lunched the Senate of McCarty, car, and the stratum, in Washington at the Cal Army hotel.

27:15.000 --> 27:23.000
Senate of McCarty asked whether it would be possible to refine private Shines in New York, at the end of eight weeks of training.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
He said he knew of cases where only eight weeks of training was required.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
He suggested the Shine might be assigned to check tax books, with less points.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
I told the Senator that private Shine would have to complete his full 16 weeks of basic training.

27:39.000 --> 27:51.000
Senator McCarty wrote me a letter, dated December 26th, 1953, which he has made public, purporting to display any effort on behalf of private Shines.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
I hand you a copy of the letter.

27:55.000 --> 28:01.000
You are reading it and the rest of the team, Mr. Jeeman, so allow our Allen to be taken into make before.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Mr. Jeeman, that you got here, might be a little closer.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Come here.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And we'll have to wait for you.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
The letter is dispelled.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Do you have an extra copy available to anybody in the district in New York?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Do we have them?

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Would you send them a hand to me so we can follow the lead?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Thank you, Senator.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I'll have to copy.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
The letter is dispelled.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Do you have an extra copy available to anybody in the district in New York?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Do we have them?

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Would you send them a hand to me so we can follow the lead?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Thank you, Senator.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I'll have to copy.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
This is not bombing them up.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Do you want me to read this, Senator?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I think that you'd like to have the...

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Yes, not to hear it.

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
The secretary of the Army, Mr. Jeeman, is going to read a letter.

29:05.000 --> 29:12.000
Would Senator McBrath, they wrote to him, as he says on December 22, 1953,

29:12.000 --> 29:20.000
as Mr. Jeeman just said in his statement, which purports to displace any effort on behalf of private shines.

29:20.000 --> 29:27.000
The interruption now is to permit copies of this letter to be distributed through members of the subcommittee.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
Senators of the subcommittee and members of the staff.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
We pause ten seconds now for station identification.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
I'm the YT.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
Bring, and we'll set up the Secretary of the Army, Jeeman, is preparing now to read this letter from Senator McBrath.

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
Dear Bob, I have heard rumors to the effects that some of the members of my staff have intervened with your department.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
In behalf of the former staff consultant, David Shaw.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
This, they, of course, have a right to do as individuals.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
However, as I have told you a number of times, I have an unbreakable rule.

30:16.000 --> 30:24.000
That neither I nor anyone in my behalf shall ever attempt interfere with or influence the Army and its assignment, a motion to accept it.

30:24.000 --> 30:33.000
I have discussed this matter with members of my staff. Some of whom feel very strongly that in view of the fact that Mitch Shaw is over 26 years of age,

30:33.000 --> 30:40.000
attempted to enlist in the Army when he was 18, but refused because of a swift disc in his back.

30:40.000 --> 30:49.000
Whereupon looked in the merchant marine, he would never have been granted except for the extreme black-wing writers, such as Chisholm, F.R.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Start screening about his case because he was a consultant for our committees.

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
I realize that the decision of the draft for a derriere in his case obviously was unknown to you and far below your level of operation.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
While I am inclined to agree that Mitch Shaw has never been drafted except because of the fact he worked for my committee,

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
I want to make it clear at this time that no one has any authority to replace any consideration for Mitch Shaw.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
Other than what other drafts he has got, I think it is extremely important that this he may very clearly endure

31:18.000 --> 31:27.000
in due of the thousand investigation which our committee is conducting a communist infiltration of the merciless under the Truman Actors and Regime.

31:27.000 --> 31:36.000
Definitely repeat what I have told you before. Of course, the victim's investigation will in absolutely no way be influenced by the Army's handling of the case of any individual,

31:36.000 --> 31:43.000
regardless of the whether he worked for my committee or not, which I must regard on his scenarios during the process.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Thank you.
