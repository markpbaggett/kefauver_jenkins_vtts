WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
He has a mother.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
The mother of them.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
The way is the subject of an inquiry.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
It is the theory of Senator McCarthy that this witness is testimony is colored.

00:20.000 --> 00:32.000
Or is perhaps untrue because of a controversy that has shared a fore existing between Senator McCarthy and this witness's brother.

00:32.000 --> 00:41.000
That is the implication of the charge that in my opinion makes it competent to pursue that land of ingress.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I'm Claire and I thank the council for his explanation.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
I really wanted to accept it.

00:49.000 --> 01:01.000
That as I understand my brother's case, he retired as he's entitled to do by law upon reaching the age of 50.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
That's all I wanted to say.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
I know nothing about any security case involved in this.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Very well known are there any other questions you may be dismissed.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
Carol Weber you are a dismissed and I say to you is an old friend that we appreciate and the cooperative management which you have handled you a part of this discussion.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Thank you very much Mr. Chairman.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What is this? What is it?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Pardon me.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Miss Lieutenant Weber.

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
I think more respect for the chairman of the acting chairman of this committee than almost any other Senator here.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
I think he is one of the most intelligent, one of the most honest, sincere senators we have.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Let me say over that when he talks about the frank testimony of this witness.

01:57.000 --> 02:12.000
When the witness has said to me, Mr. Frank Carr on the eighth of July, when Frank Carr was head of the FBI, so Bristol Group in New York,

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
and later admitted to the never-numerous regard until he came before the committee in September.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
When he makes accusations, I just think the chair should perhaps wait until the balance of the testimony is in.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.000
May the court retore any chance for you to get the details of Frank Madder and which general reason to change the testimony when you find out.

02:35.000 --> 02:45.000
I just wanted to say this that I requested this morning from Washington, the mutual network is bringing you on the spot coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Our coverage will continue after this 10-second pause or station identification. This is a mutual broadcasting system.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
7-10 on your dial. W-L-R. New York.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
I know that he is very honest.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I know that he is very honest.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
But there is no presence on the next week, Frank.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
Back in Washington, mutual coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings continues before the 7-1st permanent subcommittee on investigations.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
As I know, the announcement is made today to Mr. Carr, team of the committee.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
He was working for the FBI running the office, what do you call it, Frank?

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
In security matters in New York, it has supervision of some 100-odd people.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
The night of the 15th, on July 16th, the announcement was made and he came with the committee.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
I know that the only matter of 6 days is some here and I know that any mistake you make there is a complete beyond the whole.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
It does not affect that when we met on July 10th, Mr. Carr was present.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
He is here now and he will recall that we are all there.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
And the announcement was made that he would be the new executive director of the staff.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Senator Tars, I know.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
And, let me further.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
6-6 days, minute to 2.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
As far as I know, there was no announcement, man, until the 16th.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
The point is, when General Reaver said he knew him on the 8th, he was not here, he did not know him.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
And General Reaver himself, very honestly, and very frankly admits that he made a mistake.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
I don't accuse him of any misconduct.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
It's a mistake you get a very easily made.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
And I think that he is making mistakes about other things.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
I think when further cuts the money he had missed that, the point is,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
the General Reaver was very honest about this this morning.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
He first said he knew fine currently.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I finally said he didn't meet him, but it will stop somewhere on the 8th.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
There is nothing, nothing as far as I know, General, that it indists you because of that.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
It's just a mistake in memory and we got those, we all make them.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
Well, I want the record to show them, but in your chair, I can recall,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
positively by association of events that Mr. Carr and the minister will throw this close,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
but I'm sure it was before the committee on July 10th.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
And what are public announcements made later?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
No, I don't know.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Senator, the senator is in here.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
That is made.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yes, that's it.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Something that should be able to establish an entire vote.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Mr. Chairman, I think it's completely unimportant, but I just want to make the point.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
The important center for Washington and the Senate is completely unenthrused.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
And the record will show this chairman, the ICTJ.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
That senator McCartney will have an opportunity to testify before they change.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
He'll have to continue then, then they give testimony with respect to that fact.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
And the senator Jackson will likewise have the same opportunity.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
And I do not think those statements may say either party are proper at this time.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And I'm not getting the same.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
I would like to make this statement on understanding the committee.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I do not know anything about your minutes.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
All you I remember today that I left the committee.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
But I do know that I met Mr. Carr at a meeting of the committee before the Democrats left the committee.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Of that I am certain.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Those are questions of truth.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Substitute to the established practice proved during the course of this year.

06:28.000 --> 06:36.000
And I might suggest that no party who is making this statement with reference to that fact has been unrolled.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
And I'll revert to the science of the committee that he might lead an arrow to memory on that point and we have kept his testimony on that date.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Thank you General George Smith.

06:46.000 --> 06:58.000
Mr. Chairman I desire to call a witness at this time whose testimony will be lengthy.

06:58.000 --> 07:13.000
I am advised that another witness who I desire to put on this afternoon, bereason of the fact that entire committee's commitments may compare his absence from the city at 3.30.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
With the understanding that the witness I am now about to put on will be permitted to step aside at 3.30.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
I desire to call the next witness Mr. Robert T. Stephen.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
Stephen.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
I am coming now before the committee moving up to the witness chair is Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stephen.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
One of the principles in this affair of Senator McCarthy is dispute with the Army.

07:48.000 --> 07:58.000
He is probably more closely associated with this whole controversy than any other individual with the exception of Senator McCarthy of course.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Secretary Stephen.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Chairman March is gaffling for order.

08:04.000 --> 08:15.000
From fire with the request of counsel, you ask Mr. Stephen to suffocize and you can put on this other witness and interrupt the testimony of Mr. Stephen and then Mr. Stephen's background.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
He's very objective.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh, no.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
He's not.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
He's not here at hand before.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
You're telling us where the testimony you're about to give to the police so that nothing but the truth so help you guys.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
The police are all involved.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
You may be kidding.

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
The target may take care of the pictures now and then there'll be no more flight problems when you touch them.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
They are in the fire of the night.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
What the hell?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
How you doing?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
How you doing?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I live in the abyss of the police.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Mr. Stephen.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Mr. Stephen, please help.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
It's Secretary of State and the board of all the members of the committee.

09:11.000 --> 09:20.000
The hospital is being circulated, Mr. Chairman.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
And if you have them for their past day, they also need to be treated now.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
That's right.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Mr. Chairman, are these mics working? I can't tell.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Can you hear me?

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Working with you helps to pull them over closely.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
How long is Fender 1 in the ambulance?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Can you hear me now, Mr. Chairman?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
That's right.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
There's not a copy of the other.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
And there's not a copy of the other.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
There's not a copy of the other.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
Mr. Chairman, please get the system to the front.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
The documents will be system to the front.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
There are only two questions I desire to ask this witness,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
mad to his reading a statement.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Will you please tell this committee your full name?

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Robert, Tenbrook, Stephen.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
That's the EVNF.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
What official position do you hold with the United States Army?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Secretary of the Army.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Mr. Stephen, how are not you, April,

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
mad written statements which you desire to read to this committee,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
prior to being questioned?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I do have such a state to serve.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
You are asked to now read this.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Stay weathering hot.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
That is, I dedically, the same statement you submitted

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
to Chairman Monday and myself yesterday morning,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
some 24 hours ago.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Identical, sir.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
There have been no changes, whatever made in this state.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
None whatsoever.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
We're requested to now read that statement,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
if it is the desire of yourself and your counsel,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
to the committee.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And I have received it.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
And I'm a feminist chairman,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
and I'll be given a rough bit at the time you will indicate.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
That's right, sir.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
You will be interrupted, sir.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
You may not be able to appear tonight.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Gentlemen of the committee.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I am here today at the request of this committee.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
You have my assurance of the political operation.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
In order that we may all be quite clear,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
as to just why this hearing has come about,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
it is necessary for me to refer at the outset

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
to file its D.D. David Shaw,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
a former consultant for this committee.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
David Shaw was eligible for the draft.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Efforts were made by the chairman of this committee,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Senator Joseph Ormock Barthie,

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
and the subcommittee's chief counsel, Mr. Roy M. Cohen,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
to secure a commission for it.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
Mr. Shaw was not qualified, and he was not commissioned.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Selective service, then drafted it.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Subsequent efforts were made to seek preferential treatment for him.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
After he was in the office,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
something got wrong up in the...

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
...cowgrapid cafe.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
So he kindly stopped at the sweetened machine there, but it is...

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
...worked.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
He's actually just a bit of a lawyer with a little machine.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I'm sorry, I gave you a speech.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Over the past several months,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
it became known that the Army was having a difficulty

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
in regard to private Shaw.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Several senators in Congressmen requested information from the Army

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
regarding the Shaw in matters.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Finally, the secretary of the fence received the following letter

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
from Senator Charles D. Potter dated March 8th.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
I have received many inquiries concerning external pressure

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
for preferential treatment in behalf of private G. David Shaw.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
A former member of the staff of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
an investigation,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
and now a member of the armed forces.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Pregmentary information which has reached me has been most disturbing.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
I request the following information as a member of the above name subcommittee.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
One has five of Shaw and receives any preferential treatment.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Watch the lever since becoming a member of the armed forces.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Two, has any effort whatsoever been made by any source affiliated

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
with the above name subcommittee to exert pressure

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
for the purpose of gaining preferential treatment for private Shaw?

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Three, if such intercession has been made,

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
please advise me fully of the source type and date of such efforts.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
If there is no foundation for the information coming to my attention,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
it is no more than proper and fairer, the five of Shaw,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
as well as the subcommittee, be so informed.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
In the event there is substance for the charges, however,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
the committee should have an institution,

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
all of the facts upon which it may face immediate action.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
On March 10th, the Department of Defense repiles the Senate of Potter,

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
giving him the answers to his questions in the form of a chronology.

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
Covering the periods from July 8th, 1953, the mid-Sept. R.A. 1954.

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
I wish to make clear here that this statement was finished only to members of this committee

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
and to members of the Congress who had specifically asked for it.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It was not made public by the Army.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
However, it became public information, Senator McCarthy attacked it.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
I am here to verify the answers to Senator Potter's questions.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
The chronology of March 10th disposes what you may find to be substantial

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
and undo efforts on the part of Senator McCarthy and members of the staff

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
to have preferential treatment given to Jeav David Shaw

15:40.000 --> 15:47.000
by the Army. The Senator and his staff claimed that no such pressure was exerted.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
They dealt with the matter by making charges against the Department of Army personnel

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
and by attempting to draw attention to situations either totally irrelevant

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
or only remotely relevant to the shine matter.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
In this statement, I shall deal first with the issue raised by Senator Potter,

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
those pushes which were exerted on the Army on behalf of Charn.

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
The Second night will come in briefly on other matters raised by Senator McCarthy in this state.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
Before getting into the Charn story, I want to make two general comments.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
First, it is my responsibility to speak for the Army.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
The Army is about a million and a half men and women in post across this country

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
and around the world on active duty and in the national guard and organized reserves

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
but hundreds of thousands of loyal and faithfully double service.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
One point of order.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Mr. Stevens is not speaking for the Army.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
He's speaking for Mr. Stevens.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
Mr. Adam and Mr. Jensel, the committee did not make the Army a part of the country mercy

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
and I think it's highly improper to try and make the Army a part of it.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
But Mr. Stevens can only speak for himself.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
I am for that. Mr. Charn, I'm also chair of the government.

17:15.000 --> 17:24.000
Nothing Mr. Stevens has said indicates that the Army is a part of this controversy.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
It is entirely copper and indeed I ask Mr. Stevens what is the official connection

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
with the Army as well as the Bosnian is.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
He's answer being that he was the Secretary.

17:35.000 --> 17:44.000
He is a steady year, facts with reference to the Army by reason of the fact that he is Secretary to the Army.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
I wish to call a chairman's attention to this matter.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
That when this statement was filed with the Chairman,

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
and the Senate from a colon and myself went over it, borrowed an in detail,

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
and decided that it's in its entirety,

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
was irrelevant and proper statements to be left to this committee.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, what's the matter?

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
The sons they share and Mr. McClellan decided.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
But Mr. Stevens has a marriage responsibility to speak for the Army.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
He is not speaking for the Army here.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
All the way of investigating has been some communist in the Army.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
A very small percentage.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
I would say much less than one percent.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
And when the Secretary says that in effect I am speaking for the Army,

18:40.000 --> 18:48.000
he is putting the 99 and the 90th percent of goods, honorable while man in the Army, in the position

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
of trying to oppose the exposure of communist in the Army.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
I think that it should be made clear that they have the outset and we didn't waste time on it.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Our after our, the Mr. Stevens is speaking for Mr. Stevens,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
and those who are speaking through him,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
we Mr. Adam speaks.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
He speaks for Mr. Adam's, and those who are speaking through him, and likewise, must have helped him.

19:13.000 --> 19:22.000
And I may say that I have done very, very much at the time that you have connected the very American Army with this,

19:22.000 --> 19:29.000
best attempt to sabotage the efforts of this committee's investigation.

19:29.000 --> 19:36.000
I again say, Mr. Chairman, there is nothing in this statement from which an inference can be drawn

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
that the Army has but put a party in the interest to this controversy.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
And we are in a card with a senator that the parties in the interest are Mr. Stevens, Mr. Adam's, and Mr. Henson.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
If that's understood, then I have no objection.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
That is not understood, and I think that Secretary, who has the Army,

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
please let me be the Secretary, he speaks for the Army, and appropriate, and as a matter of fact, he might want to speak about it,

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
and this inquiry, he speaks for himself, and Mr. Adam's, and Mr. Henson.

20:09.000 --> 20:21.000
Mr. Chairman, my eyes say, sir, if this was art, that I was appointed Secretary of the Army by the Commander-in-Chief,

20:21.000 --> 20:28.000
that I was confirmed by the Senate of the United States.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
But I worked as a member of the team and the Department of Defense under Secretary Wilkow,

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
that it is my responsibility, as I have said here, speak for the Army.

20:39.000 --> 20:46.000
Mr. Stevens, may I remind you that this chairman has ruled that you may read your statement.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Arguments will be made only to have the conclusion of this year.

20:50.000 --> 20:57.000
I suggest that it ought to conserve time, this is just Stevens' precedence to the reading of his statement.

20:57.000 --> 21:04.000
As a rule in argument, Mr. Stevens, you may be seated.

21:04.000 --> 21:15.000
It is many millions of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men who have in the past worn its uniform.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
It is millions of others who will one day wear the same uniform.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
The Army is a great and non-extendable institution.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
It is a mild legend, a common force against common dangers.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
The valor, history, integrity, loyalty, and capability of the Army are beyond question.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
It is serving the country today as it has throughout our history, in a dependable and devoted manner.

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
I speak for the Army today out of a pride and confidence that grows greater every day I spend on jobs.

21:50.000 --> 21:59.000
There are personal reasons too for my pride in the Army and for my resentment of any swear against it or any one of the armed servicers.

21:59.000 --> 22:09.000
The two oldest of our four sons, enlisted in the Navy during World War II, our third son, enlisted in 1952 as a pilot,

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
and is now a couple with the seven sons in Europe.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
He has been overseas in 21 months.

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
Second, I want to affirm here my foe belief in the right of Congress to investigate,

22:24.000 --> 22:31.000
and that means scrutinizing the activities of the Army or any other department of the executive branch of the government.

22:31.000 --> 22:44.000
The conscientious exercise of this obligation in one of the checks contemplated by the Constitution against the possibility of unlimited executive authority by the executive branch of the government.

22:45.000 --> 22:54.000
As a member of the executive branch, it is my duty to do everything I properly can to help this and other committees of Congress.

22:54.000 --> 23:07.000
I have such a profound regard for elective office in this country that it comes very easily for me to cooperate with the senators, the representatives, and the committees of Congress.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
Let me now turn to the point of issue and first summarize the sharn story.

23:14.000 --> 23:26.000
I have been informed, once, from mid July of last year until March 1st of this year, David Sharn was discussed between one branch,

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
or other as a department of the Army and Senator McCarthy, or members of his staff, in more than 65 telephone calls.

23:34.000 --> 23:45.000
During the same period, this matter was discussed at a approximately 19 meetings between the Army personnel and Senator McCarthy for members of his staff.

23:45.000 --> 23:54.000
Three, requests made on shines behalf, raised from several or direct commissions before he was inducted into the Army,

23:54.000 --> 24:02.000
to many for special assignments, relate from routine duties, such as KP, expert formal, and special visitor privileges.

24:03.000 --> 24:15.000
Four, from November 10th, 1953 to January 16th, 1954, shined by the then-apotted and army, obtained 15 passes from the post.

24:15.000 --> 24:24.000
By way of comparison, the majority of other newly inducted personnel obtained three passes during the same period.

24:24.000 --> 24:31.000
The history of the sharn case begins where the army is concerned on July 8th, 1953.

24:31.000 --> 24:41.000
I had been informed that General Miles Reaver, the then chief of the Army's legislative liaison office, had been told the Senator McCarthy's office.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
Senator McCarthy asked him if a direct commission could be obtained for sharns, then on members of the Senator's staff.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
The Senator stated the speed was desirable since shine might soon be drafted.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
Roy and Tom, chief counsel on the Senator's staff, was present, and reiterated the need for speed.

25:03.000 --> 25:15.000
The next day, General Reaver called Tom and told him that in order for shine to be considered for a commission, he would have to come in and fill out a formal application, which he bid.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
On July 15th, shine himself, taught the lieutenant general Fred J. Brammerman in the Army Office of the Year, legislative liaison,

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
and asked whether he could come over to the Pentagon that afternoon and hold up his hand to be sworn for his dismiss.

25:30.000 --> 25:41.000
Pardon me, Mr. Steven, Mr. Steven, how this time we have the witnesses present in court can be in the committee room.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
In the committee room, the matter is not thank you for it.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
Five minutes, Mr. Secretary will talk to you magazine as many as Mr. Smith.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
The next witness in central authority will be issued at just comment in the committee room.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
So, General Roy already used to be a serious candidate with his gang.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Smith, chief, of coming to what the health care now is general born.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
I think it's about the care of the students, the host, and nothing about the students.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Don't help you guys, I do.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Thank you.

26:40.000 --> 26:49.000
The interview of the fact that General Smith is engaged in many pressing matters vital to the nation.

26:49.000 --> 26:58.000
I wish to announce that I will make my examination and any calls examination as far as I can, and as much to the point as possible.

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
Any piece of question that the members of the committee and those interested do likewise to the end.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
That is testimony made to each of these dissatisfinements.

27:08.000 --> 27:16.000
It be my understanding that there is a possibility that he will be called to the foreign country for much tomorrow.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
By the benefit of the record, will you please take your full remains.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
A lot of being smithed, General Roy's army retired, presently under Secretary of State.

27:28.000 --> 27:36.000
General Smith, where you retired as a July 1953 foreign army.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
How was it?

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
About the position that you hold as a July 1953 under Secretary of State.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
You are personally a clear senator MacCardy.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
I am.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
I would ask you, General Smith, first of all, whether an officer of MacCardy in person.

27:56.000 --> 28:06.000
By telephone call or otherwise, ever come back to you with reference to one G-David Chan.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Not directly, my regularity.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
Please, please, state, whether and counsel for General MacCardy, Mr. Roy Pooh.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
Are any member of General MacCardy's staff, they've come back to you with reference to Chan.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
It's shown that when was that?

28:25.000 --> 28:34.000
The General Smith, by for me, I have been requested to ask you to identify the gentleman sitting on your right and the gentleman sitting on your left.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
On my right, there's a system for Secretary Bruce and Morton.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
On my left, there's Mr. Scott McClough.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
Now you may proceed, or you may refer to any document.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
You desire to refer to the purpose of refreshing your recollections.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
And without asking you specific questions, I will ask you to stay chronologically.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
When the first contact was made that was reviewed by Mr. Pooh,

29:02.000 --> 29:10.000
or anyone on Senator MacCardy's staff, we've referenced the Chan, what was said, and so on, that I'm alive.

29:10.000 --> 29:19.000
Mr. Chairman, I can do this best by reading the carbon copy of a letter which I sent to the Secretary of Defense from days ago.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
If I may do so, I will read it, which completes my knowledge of the incident.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
May I do so?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
No, Jackson. You may.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
What, thanks?

29:31.000 --> 29:39.000
To reach on a letter you have written, with reference to this incident, I am.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
When was the letter written, may be asked? On April, Trent, 1954.

29:44.000 --> 29:56.000
Thanks, whether or not, in that letter, you undertake to the best of your ability to recount the events of July 31, 1953.

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
And immediately subsequent minutes, and immediately passed, I do.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
I knew what circumstances was this letter of April 10, 1954 written.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
It will be self-explanatory, I think Mr. Counselor, let me read it.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And with that, we can totalize the following.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Okay, James, I think you can.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I say I think that the letter will explain so.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I will have you make with me.

30:22.000 --> 30:30.000
Here, Mr. Secretary, at the request of the Secretary of the Army, I transmit to the Department of Defense the following,

30:30.000 --> 30:41.000
which is my recollection of the principal point in a telephone conversation and interview with Mr. Roy Cohn of the Staff of the Senate Committee on Government Operations,

30:41.000 --> 30:53.000
and a telephone conversation with General John Nees Hall, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, which took place on July 31 and on August 1, 1953.

31:00.000 --> 31:08.000
Thank you.
