WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
I'm going to have to return to the guest of the committee who have come to the hearings

00:05.320 --> 00:06.320
this afternoon.

00:06.320 --> 00:16.520
Tell you that you're very welcome to be here and to repeat the standing rule of the

00:16.520 --> 00:22.880
committee if you have not heard it before to the effect that there are to be no audible

00:22.880 --> 00:29.000
manifestations of approval or disapproval of any kind from the audience at any time.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.280
The uniform members of the Capitol Police Force see before you and the plane closed

00:35.280 --> 00:40.280
people scattered through the audience have standing instructions from the committee

00:40.280 --> 00:47.480
to remove from the committee room immediately, politely but firmly, any who might elect

00:47.480 --> 00:51.920
to violate the terms under which you enter the room, namely to comply with the committee

00:51.920 --> 00:58.880
regulation against audible manifestations of approval or of disapproval.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.120
I'm sure that we will continue to enjoy the cooperation from our friends in the audience

01:03.120 --> 01:09.880
that we have enjoyed in the 63-4 sessions that we have had so far and I again express

01:09.880 --> 01:15.240
my appreciation to the Capitol Police Force and their associates in the plane closed

01:15.240 --> 01:16.240
the door.

01:16.240 --> 01:22.240
I'm sure that we have had the committee room.

01:22.240 --> 01:26.840
Mr. Pruitt I understand that you had concluded your cross-administration with the morning session.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.840
Is that correct?

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
Yes, correct.

01:28.840 --> 01:35.000
So we'll start then with the customary 10-minute go-around.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.440
Under the terms of the regulations of the committee, each member of the committee have

01:39.440 --> 01:43.600
in 10 minutes in which they ask questions and counsel for each side have in 10 minutes

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
in which they ask questions.

01:44.600 --> 01:51.640
The chair has the first 10 minutes and Mr. Carr would ask you first of all whether you

01:51.640 --> 01:57.480
had ever missed Mr. Cheyenne before he came to work for our committee.

01:57.480 --> 02:04.800
I think that we said this morning and I'm sure it's correct that I was probably introduced

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
on one time.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.360
I have a very recollection of having Cheyenne with him at one time.

02:10.360 --> 02:14.800
It may have been a some function I don't recall exactly.

02:14.800 --> 02:22.120
In all events you had no special background apprenticeship for a young having no better

02:22.120 --> 02:28.440
or worse relationship with him and defend like resumed in 6 or 7 or 8 other members of

02:28.440 --> 02:29.440
our staff.

02:29.440 --> 02:35.600
Well, I say even less I only shook hands with him that's an introduction I recall.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.800
And I think I understood the testimony this morning that most of your relations with him

02:40.800 --> 02:45.720
since he was a consultant rather than an investigator came to his son of a McCarthy or Mr.

02:45.720 --> 02:46.720
Compton.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.720
That's correct.

02:47.720 --> 02:54.640
You had no personal interest or did you have in what his career in the army might lead

02:54.640 --> 02:55.640
it?

02:55.640 --> 02:56.640
No, sir, I didn't.

02:56.640 --> 03:03.520
A statement was made this morning which I am not sure I understood because it's subject

03:03.520 --> 03:05.360
to various kinds of interpretation.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.760
You were discussing one of the numerous lunchrooms of Mr. Adam, Cohn, Mr. Carp.

03:09.760 --> 03:16.720
I think it was the one dealing with the first information that was given you that Cheyenne

03:16.720 --> 03:19.040
might be heading towards overseas duties.

03:19.040 --> 03:25.160
You quoted Mr. Cohn as saying that you thought Cheyenne should not be used by the army.

03:25.160 --> 03:30.480
Now that is subject to quite a few interpretations that we ask you the first option in our mind

03:30.480 --> 03:36.720
is that that might very well imply that Mr. Cohn's office that Cheyenne should not be

03:36.720 --> 03:39.720
recruited into the army or it's got to be the army.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.920
No, sir, I'm sure you've been by use by the army.

03:42.920 --> 03:48.200
I'm sure I meant and I thought I made it clear later that he should not be discriminated

03:48.200 --> 03:51.480
against by the army because it's not from the committee.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.360
What you should have said to the very working head is mind very absolute.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.120
You would not be misused by the army.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.280
Misuse was probably the case.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.520
I went back and looked at the records and said you, sir, if I could use the excuse to.

04:04.520 --> 04:09.720
It could be interpreted and you, some of the charges might very well be interpreted.

04:09.720 --> 04:16.040
Mr. Cohn's office is not the use as a member of the army by a draft to be put.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.680
You're sure that's not the intention of those words?

04:18.680 --> 04:19.880
No, but not.

04:21.480 --> 04:25.800
I'll ask you some questions now that I asked Senator McCarthy and I asked Mr. Cohn.

04:26.760 --> 04:32.920
As one interested in the past and also interested in the impact of the past on the future,

04:34.120 --> 04:37.880
it would seem to me that Toro Vile and the investigation that Fort Manila

04:37.880 --> 04:41.960
you would have directly observed the staff Senator McCarthy has challenged Mr. Cohn as

04:41.960 --> 04:44.120
Chief Counsel had worked out.

04:44.120 --> 04:50.040
He rather sell the Atari relationship of cooperation whereby the instrumentality that you

04:50.040 --> 04:57.560
were investigating, showing as it did your desire to eliminate communist and strategic positions

04:58.360 --> 05:00.680
cooperated towards that goal.

05:02.200 --> 05:07.880
Do you feel that that is the optimum way in which we can conduct an investigation if we can

05:07.880 --> 05:14.440
work out some kind of cooperating performance such as you did have for several weeks and perhaps

05:14.440 --> 05:16.920
months in the investigation at Fort Manila?

05:16.920 --> 05:17.400
Yes, sir.

05:17.560 --> 05:23.640
Your opinion what was it that caused that cooperation to get rid of all the parts?

05:25.320 --> 05:32.120
Well, I think that it's gradually deteriorated.

05:33.560 --> 05:39.560
I don't think that it ever thought had fallen apart during the moment investigation.

05:40.760 --> 05:46.520
There was still some limited cooperation between it right up to the very end.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.080
I was talking with Mr. Adams.

05:50.200 --> 05:56.680
But because the building of cooperation to end them, whether it was a period during the Fort Manila

05:56.680 --> 06:03.160
and other investigation or after, what was it that seemed to change the state of the cooperating

06:03.160 --> 06:12.040
forces, I think probably the important period was in connection with the calling in of the

06:12.040 --> 06:23.880
Royal reports. That seemed to be the point that Mr. Steyron's, Mr. Adams didn't want us to go beyond.

06:24.680 --> 06:30.440
In your opinion is there anything else going out of the effort, the experience of the effort

06:30.440 --> 06:36.360
is finding what cooperating means, which would need you to believe that such a cooperating

06:36.360 --> 06:43.400
effort could not again be resumed, provided it's possible to resolve the problem,

06:43.400 --> 06:47.960
and it's a lot to do about calling in people on a loyal support, for example.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.240
Issues of that time.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.640
But yes, I think this problem can be resolved.

06:53.320 --> 06:59.240
Do you think it's worthwhile to try to make an effort to endeavor to establish that kind of

06:59.240 --> 07:04.440
cooperative approach to a security problem which is the equal concern and then,

07:04.440 --> 07:06.840
rather than the issue, to all of the women?

07:06.840 --> 07:13.160
Yes, sir. Mr. Carr, you said that our new Mr. Cajun, John Adams, is your birth to

07:13.160 --> 07:15.480
gave sign as a hostage, is that right?

07:15.880 --> 07:16.360
Yes.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.040
In your presence and to you.

07:18.040 --> 07:18.280
Yes.

07:19.160 --> 07:23.480
Did he do it in overgrown with you, if you were considered to be proficient or in overgrown,

07:23.480 --> 07:26.120
would you like to consider to be almond and fresh?

07:28.760 --> 07:33.160
I think that on most occasions, he was being proficient.

07:33.240 --> 07:39.240
I don't think they've used the word hostage itself, or was certainly not considered by me,

07:39.240 --> 07:40.680
it's a threat, I thought, to see.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.000
You know that John Adams is rather well?

07:44.040 --> 07:45.160
I know him rather well.

07:46.440 --> 07:51.560
He's what you might call a sort of a master of a flip phrase, if you not, that is just

07:52.520 --> 07:55.800
sometimes the thing he says when the duty prints.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.600
The best thing from its inflection might convey it all together, different meetings,

08:00.600 --> 08:03.960
and if you could hear the inflection and what's the

08:03.960 --> 08:06.440
abandonment of the faith that's correct.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.600
Yes, sir, that's true of any of us.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.800
Yes, but would you agree that John Adams perhaps is more in time than the flip phrase

08:13.800 --> 08:15.560
than maybe Frank Carr?

08:15.560 --> 08:16.280
Yes, sir.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.960
Yes, or then perhaps the refugees.

08:21.320 --> 08:25.640
Pick that up, if a young man and consequently knowing the individual,

08:26.280 --> 08:30.280
I would be glad to believe that even though he used the word hostage,

08:31.400 --> 08:37.240
he didn't do it in terms of the man's about to make a bet that we're going to chop off the

08:37.240 --> 08:38.440
head of the China.

08:38.440 --> 08:42.680
We're going to put him in a dungeon, but he's done perhaps more or less, I think,

08:43.640 --> 08:46.680
between friends and your friends who've gone at him, did I write?

08:46.680 --> 08:47.160
Yes, sir.

08:47.800 --> 08:53.640
With the feeling that he said might well be understood by you as a deceased's remark.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.760
I don't think the use of the word hostage in itself is that no excuse.

09:01.160 --> 09:10.840
You have heard a lot of testimony, Mr. Carr, who did his theory about the desire of the army to

09:11.800 --> 09:18.600
call off the hearings or to change the nature of the publicity growing out of the hearings,

09:19.560 --> 09:22.520
depending upon which witness happens to be understand.

09:22.520 --> 09:27.000
They put a different emphasis on what they would like to have happened concerning the hearings,

09:27.000 --> 09:31.560
but it was agreed by all sides of the controversy that the people in the army would have

09:32.200 --> 09:36.040
really some kind of change at least in connection with the hearings.

09:36.040 --> 09:42.280
Now, did you ever have Mr. Stevens complain to you directly about the types of hearings

09:42.280 --> 09:46.760
that you were conducting as chief investigator and chief staffman at Kredmont?

09:47.480 --> 09:50.920
Did he ever complain to you about the car preparing for a notice?

09:50.920 --> 09:57.000
No, he never registered with you, and as the headman of the committee next to the senator,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.960
and the specific complaint and said, Carr, I'd like to have you do it this way and spend it that way

10:01.960 --> 10:08.040
or that I would like to have you call them off, nothing directly to you, no, sir.

10:08.680 --> 10:14.760
Did he ever mention to you a specific complaint about the nature of the publicity,

10:14.760 --> 10:19.000
which emanated from the hearings after each executive session was concluded?

10:19.000 --> 10:24.600
No, sir. So that if such a desire was present on the part of the army,

10:24.600 --> 10:29.720
it was not conveyed to you. You tell us now under those as chief investigator.

10:29.720 --> 10:36.440
Well, if I understand you say such a desire, a desire to call off the hearings, yes,

10:37.720 --> 10:44.680
any talk to me personally by Mr. Stevens concerning the method or the operation of the

10:44.760 --> 10:50.440
hearing for newspaper results, no. In other words, your conversation with Mr. Stevens,

10:50.440 --> 10:54.600
you're telling us we're in the direction of suggesting that the hearings be dropped

10:55.320 --> 10:59.000
rather than in the direction of the hearings be changed.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.840
That's correct. That's correct. You tell us he did talk with you about the desire of his

11:04.840 --> 11:10.040
terminologies, but not the desire of his changing them or changing the publicity.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.920
Well, yes, sir. I was present at the November 6th one.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.360
At which time the publicity has not come up?

11:17.400 --> 11:19.560
I don't recall it in my head. I don't recall.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.240
Why don't you leave and you send your president to the Vindicic list?

11:23.240 --> 11:24.920
That's what we're calling him off to me.

11:24.920 --> 11:25.640
Yes.

11:25.640 --> 11:31.560
Other than that, if you ever call on you individually or extend words to you directly,

11:31.560 --> 11:35.000
that he would like to have the hearings terminate his or his change,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.040
no, sir, not individual.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.800
Just stand at one of these.

11:37.800 --> 11:38.520
Yes.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.360
As time goes by, you have to.

11:45.400 --> 11:53.080
Mr. Barr, these hearings, again, you were regarded as one of the principles

11:53.080 --> 11:55.240
of the controversy. Is that correct?

11:55.240 --> 11:55.640
Yes.

11:58.280 --> 12:02.920
As such, did you participate in some of my interviews?

12:03.720 --> 12:06.920
Then we get to some better news.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.720
The title is the first show that's my turn.

12:17.080 --> 12:25.160
As one of the principles in the scontroversia, did you participate in the draft thing of this

12:25.160 --> 12:30.280
document in Patel's statement submitted at your quest to temporary committee?

12:31.080 --> 12:41.480
Only for the quenches 1953 to which I frequently refer and which are identified as the countercharging of this group?

12:41.480 --> 12:42.680
Yes.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.880
You did participate in the drafting of it?

12:45.880 --> 12:46.840
Yes, sir.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.680
I was present to internal drafting.

12:48.680 --> 12:57.480
At the time of this file, did you then adopt it as your meetings or your response to the committee's request?

12:57.480 --> 12:59.880
And so far, it'll apply to me, yes sir.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.600
It'll apply to you as far as you were involved.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.080
Yes.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.240
You were directly in and directly in and in charge of your countercharging.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.280
You adopted this.

13:11.160 --> 13:21.880
Then, as your response to the army charges and as constituting your countercharges against the army,

13:21.880 --> 13:22.520
is that true?

13:23.480 --> 13:24.280
Yes sir.

13:24.280 --> 13:27.400
I make no argument about statement in charge.

13:27.400 --> 13:27.880
Yes.

13:27.880 --> 13:28.360
All right.

13:29.320 --> 13:37.160
Then, I shall not have time or I shall not take the time to go through and identify each fire group

13:37.160 --> 13:40.760
and which you are in for a good and which you make countercharges.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.640
But I want to ask you now if you stayed under oath,

13:44.920 --> 13:49.560
that the countercharges you have made in this document are true?

13:51.320 --> 13:51.880
Yes sir.

13:52.760 --> 13:57.640
At the time you made them, did you regard them as serious or prevalent?

13:58.280 --> 13:58.680
Serious.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.640
Do you now regard them as serious?

14:01.640 --> 14:02.280
Serious.

14:03.080 --> 14:07.000
You've began regarding these things as serious as controversies,

14:07.000 --> 14:10.760
serious, much earlier than the time this document was filed, didn't you?

14:10.760 --> 14:11.720
Yes sir.

14:11.720 --> 14:18.440
You began regarding them as serious as of October 2nd 1953, is that correct?

14:19.080 --> 14:19.880
Yes sir.

14:19.880 --> 14:23.400
Last but not the age you made your first memorandum was it not?

14:23.400 --> 14:24.280
Yes sir.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.320
And you marked it confidential and placed it in the file.

14:28.040 --> 14:28.520
Yes sir.

14:28.520 --> 14:33.160
Now explain to us just what was serious about this controversy at that time.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.640
Well why did you regard them as serious then?

14:35.640 --> 14:40.520
What had transpired before and what caused you to prepare this memorandum file?

14:42.600 --> 14:45.560
I'm not sure that I followed your last question there.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.840
Sir I regarded this whole affair as serious.

14:48.840 --> 14:53.640
I sure regard it now or I regarded the whole important moment case as serious.

14:53.640 --> 14:58.440
I certainly regarded any contact I had with the secretary of the army as serious.

14:58.440 --> 15:04.840
I recorded this contact with the secretary of the army because

15:04.840 --> 15:09.160
Senator McCarthy was out of town and I thought that this was something that he should know about.

15:09.800 --> 15:16.280
Well all right it was something that developed at that time that called you to feel that it required

15:16.280 --> 15:23.160
some specific attention and to the extent that you did prepare a memorandum at that time.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.200
Yes sir I thought this was something that Senator should know about.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.400
Now was that all right.

15:27.400 --> 15:31.240
What I want to point out was this the customer procedure after you had

15:31.240 --> 15:35.400
complied with the secretary of the army or someone else in a similar position in government.

15:35.960 --> 15:41.960
No sir this was violated the customer and this was something no sir not necessarily.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.560
I didn't understand you then.

15:43.560 --> 15:47.400
Now you said what you asked is this were a customer procedure.

15:48.360 --> 15:54.680
The customer procedure is either to write a memorandum or to speak to the senator to the chairman.

15:54.680 --> 15:59.160
Well I thought you had answered that it wasn't reason I asked you the next question I ask you again

15:59.880 --> 16:05.720
was this memorandum all about over the second in line with your customary procedures that you

16:05.720 --> 16:09.960
had had a conference with the secretary of the army, secretary of the navy or someone else in

16:09.960 --> 16:11.960
a similar position of government.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.160
Was that customary?

16:13.160 --> 16:14.520
What are the other?

16:14.520 --> 16:15.560
The word customary.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.560
I did it in this instance.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.520
I think it would be a good thing to do in all instances.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.520
I didn't ask you a lot of the good thing.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.360
I asked you what you've been doing before.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.160
But it's a common practice or was this your first practice?

16:29.160 --> 16:31.240
This was the first contact I ever had with the secretary.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.640
All right what was the first time that you'd had with other high-importance government officials?

16:37.080 --> 16:41.880
Have you got any other memorandum in the file or conferences or contact

16:41.880 --> 16:45.640
some or to this with other government officials prior to this date?

16:45.640 --> 16:46.840
I'm sure I'm not touching.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.000
You can you recall any?

16:51.800 --> 16:52.440
No not all.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.800
All right let's see what was so serious about this now.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.240
They caused you to make a memorandum.

16:58.280 --> 17:02.360
We'll read it, replay it, and if the colon and I met with second-test reasons,

17:02.360 --> 17:04.600
it's intended gone to discuss General Lawton.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.120
All pork marmos and his blackout order,

17:08.680 --> 17:10.040
three pork marmos,

17:10.040 --> 17:12.200
personal speaking with our staff.

17:12.920 --> 17:18.360
Have General Lawton blacked out conversations between members of his staff

17:19.160 --> 17:20.760
and others at pork marmos?

17:21.320 --> 17:25.080
In other words, believe it them from talking to the staff of this committee.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.200
Is that correct?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.720
Yes sir, there was such an order.

17:27.720 --> 17:28.920
There was such an order.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.120
Who had issued it?

17:30.120 --> 17:31.960
It was issued through General Lawton.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.880
Issues due General Lawton.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.320
Do you know why he had issued it?

17:38.040 --> 17:38.840
No I don't.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.000
All right then you referred to Jim Juliana,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.080
have been advised by Colonel Allen.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.240
That he couldn't talk with anyone because of an order by General Lawton

17:49.240 --> 17:51.880
to bidding documents to the MacArthur Committee.

17:51.880 --> 17:52.920
Is that correct?

17:52.920 --> 17:53.160
Yes.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.680
Mr. Stevens was very helpful you say.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.080
He called Lawton and had the order of immediate division

18:01.080 --> 18:05.480
stating that it was his policy to cooperate with the congressional committees.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.680
Did he state that?

18:07.720 --> 18:08.360
Yes sir.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.080
Did he call and have the order rescinded?

18:11.080 --> 18:11.720
Yes sir.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.400
What was it in that action to indicate this to the England series?

18:15.400 --> 18:18.280
If he was cooperating, if he was getting the order rescinded,

18:18.280 --> 18:20.600
what was it in that action that told you the things

18:20.600 --> 18:22.120
that you ought to make a memorandum of?

18:23.640 --> 18:26.200
This memorandum was made because

18:26.200 --> 18:28.040
Senator Praty was out of town.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.440
Audenauly I think that I would have just spoken to the senator

18:32.440 --> 18:34.280
and told him what the secretary had done.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.320
The senator was very interested in the pork marmos situation.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.640
I left the memorandum for him.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.920
All right, good next senator.

18:42.920 --> 18:49.640
During the course of the conversation, Dave Schein pending induction in the Army came up.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.880
How did that happen to come up?

18:54.440 --> 19:00.360
At the conference with the secretary, as I recall it, the secretary

19:01.320 --> 19:05.400
brought up the subject of Dave Schein by mentioning that he was not going to,

19:05.400 --> 19:07.560
or he didn't think he would receive a commission.

19:08.120 --> 19:11.160
Howdy previously applied for a commission.

19:11.160 --> 19:13.160
Yes, I understand he had.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.560
Why did he bring that up in the conversation if you folks were non-interested in him?

19:17.560 --> 19:19.560
I don't know why he brought it up.

19:19.560 --> 19:23.560
The first time I heard the secretary had brought it up because you were interested in it, didn't he?

19:23.560 --> 19:25.640
Wouldn't be any other reason to bring it up with him?

19:27.640 --> 19:30.440
I suppose you did bring it up without me.

19:30.440 --> 19:34.280
He brought it up because you were interested and because you had previous problems, I actually thought it was possible.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.080
I have never had any previous contacts about it.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.600
You had had none.

19:38.600 --> 19:44.280
Well, I had no bother there as I interpreted this memorandum, since you had missed the cold.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.080
That's correct.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.640
And he had previous problems that I could have with him about it?

19:47.640 --> 19:50.520
I don't really know.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.040
I think he had.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.320
I think he had, yes.

19:53.320 --> 19:57.480
Is that what prompted the secretary to bring up the conversation in about Dave Schein?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.480
I don't know what prompted him to bring it up.

19:59.480 --> 20:04.360
Is that just un-all-one unexplainable for as you know then?

20:04.360 --> 20:06.280
That he's very concerned about your conversation.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.800
At the time, yes.

20:07.800 --> 20:11.880
At the time you didn't understand what he's bringing up for.

20:11.880 --> 20:12.680
That's correct.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.360
All right.

20:16.360 --> 20:21.800
Mr. Stephen stated that he thought Schein should take his initial basic training

20:21.800 --> 20:27.000
and that after he had completed his basic that he, Stephen, would be able to use Schein

20:27.000 --> 20:30.680
and his own advantage in the army.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.760
Did the secretary make that statement?

20:32.760 --> 20:33.640
Just guess.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.880
How did you interpret it as a sign?

20:35.880 --> 20:38.680
What did he mean by it?

20:38.680 --> 20:40.280
What was James Ford on its report?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.200
Just what it says here, Senator.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.520
Greg Biden just what it says here, Senator.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.680
But he was going to use him to his advantage.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.680
What did he mean by the his advantage?

20:48.680 --> 20:49.080
Wow.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.760
He said, as you read on further, he says something here about...

20:57.640 --> 21:01.640
He would attend some security type schools with his within the army

21:01.640 --> 21:03.800
and report to Stephen his observation.

21:04.600 --> 21:09.240
After he had attended other schools, yes, or had certain other training.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.200
Yes.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.320
Well, did you get the impression what I'm trying to determine is yes.

21:13.320 --> 21:23.560
This Schein matter has called a terrible school, a cure or for quite a long time now.

21:23.560 --> 21:31.560
I'm trying to find out whether this was the army inspired this, whether they are other colonies.

21:32.360 --> 21:36.600
And do you think now that the secretary there just brought up the subject about China

21:36.600 --> 21:41.960
to discuss it with the viewer trying to explain how he was going to handle an

21:41.960 --> 21:44.760
in the future without anybody inquiring about it?

21:44.760 --> 21:45.560
Is that correct?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.760
I don't really know why he brought him up to...

21:48.760 --> 21:51.800
Well, nobody had inquired about him according to you.

21:51.800 --> 21:52.760
I didn't say that.

21:52.760 --> 21:53.320
I didn't say that.

21:53.320 --> 21:53.960
He had that?

21:53.960 --> 21:55.000
I had never.

21:55.000 --> 21:55.560
I had never.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.600
Well, you was there.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.200
You and Mr. Coleman was there.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.320
Mr. Coleman mentioned it.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.560
What did the secretary say to him about it?

22:01.560 --> 22:04.840
The secretary brought it up by this reference to the commission by recall.

22:04.840 --> 22:10.360
Without anyone making any comment about it or asking to make any inquiry about it?

22:10.360 --> 22:11.320
Yes, sir.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.320
He just brought it up out of a class guy.

22:13.960 --> 22:14.200
What?

22:14.200 --> 22:15.160
He's not talking about it.

22:15.160 --> 22:15.800
Yes, sir.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.480
Well, I haven't been in things for him to bring it up.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.920
You've been told about it for a long time.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.560
Yes.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.480
He just brought it up out of a class guy.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.680
I'm getting told about how he's going to handle this Schein in the army.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.160
Yes.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.360
Well...

22:26.360 --> 22:27.160
Oh.

22:27.160 --> 22:27.880
Oh.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.480
Oh.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.920
I'll get you in ten minutes.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.560
Let me try our own review.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.440
37.

22:45.720 --> 22:46.840
You have a family.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.400
Yes, sir.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.360
Three children.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.080
Three children.

22:49.080 --> 22:49.560
Yes, sir.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.040
What is your legal residence in Washington DC?

22:54.040 --> 22:54.600
All right.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.520
Well, I love the false church.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.080
Yes.

22:57.160 --> 23:00.120
You live where false church, in false church, in desks.

23:00.120 --> 23:04.520
Before you came to this area, where were your legal residence?

23:05.640 --> 23:07.880
I'm a native of Newport, Rhode Island.

23:07.880 --> 23:16.280
I had been living for the last six and a half, almost seven years in New York City.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.320
You've got your bachelor's degree from Brown University.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.280
Yes.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.480
Whether you specialize in wild air, political science.

23:24.440 --> 23:28.520
And then you went to the University of Pennsylvania Law School, the bachelor's degree.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.320
Yes.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.200
But did not the...

23:32.200 --> 23:37.960
the curfew of the law, I did make no effort, I take it to become a minute to the law.

23:37.960 --> 23:38.440
No, sir.

23:38.440 --> 23:44.600
I went to law school primarily for the purpose of qualifying myself onto the FBI.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.200
Did you join the FBI on application?

23:49.400 --> 23:51.240
Initiated by yourself?

23:51.240 --> 23:52.200
Yes, yes.

23:52.200 --> 23:56.120
And you went into the FBI service waiting?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.840
June 1st, 1942.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.360
And you continued on until how old?

24:03.960 --> 24:07.400
For 11 years, one month, and I think 15 days.

24:08.040 --> 24:11.240
So the person taken those when he joined the FBI?

24:12.040 --> 24:14.760
Yes, in substance, what is it?

24:14.760 --> 24:20.120
It's a note of legion to the country, to the Constitution.

24:20.200 --> 24:25.320
I was known for it, but it requires some special publications to get into the FBI.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.240
Yes, sir.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.480
Well, there's a few publications, sir.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.360
Yes, sir.

24:30.360 --> 24:33.720
What's the physical publications to join the FBI?

24:34.840 --> 24:42.040
Well, you'll have to take a physical examination and be qualified there.

24:42.440 --> 24:56.760
There are many things that you have to be able to do, but the prime thing is that you must be able to do a physical work.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.280
You must have some figures.

24:58.280 --> 25:04.280
Yes, you've been referred to as the strong man and the strong man, as you call him.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.160
There are no weeks here in the FBI.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.760
No, sir.

25:08.760 --> 25:13.560
So there's three to several of the inheritance from the days where you were in the FBI?

25:14.920 --> 25:17.400
If there's strength there, that's where it came from, so yes.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.440
What is the experience for the terrorists who can work in the FBI?

25:23.320 --> 25:28.200
I think that the FBI is the most powerful investigative organization in the world.

25:28.600 --> 25:33.080
And what are the requirements for an inquiry theory and a pursuit of it?

25:34.040 --> 25:40.840
I also think that the success of the FBI is an example of their accuracy.

25:41.640 --> 25:48.040
Do you get some charge from a very distinguished public servant, John, and Google, who

25:48.040 --> 25:52.120
announced a rat that they were using to do these in the FBI?

25:52.840 --> 25:53.400
Yes, sir.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.840
He speaks to all of the new agents as they enter.

25:57.800 --> 26:06.120
You know, there's his own high requirement for accuracy and�, and through ratify in the pursuit of that work.

26:06.840 --> 26:07.320
Yes, sir.

26:08.840 --> 26:16.520
Are there any missed people who are getting into the FBI and they stay there very long?

26:16.520 --> 26:18.120
I don't know of any of that space, no?

26:18.840 --> 26:23.080
But how many agents are there, the other person are there, Mr. Collins, the person who knows?

26:24.040 --> 26:28.040
I don't know of this, Mr. Momentson.

26:28.040 --> 26:33.080
You know you've been referred to not only as the strong character of this problem,

26:33.080 --> 26:38.280
but as the silent character in this problem, you've seen that in the press, haven't you?

26:38.280 --> 26:38.680
Yes.

26:39.960 --> 26:47.000
Silence is almost a requirement in pursuing these secretive work of the FBI.

26:47.000 --> 26:47.880
Yes, sir.

26:47.880 --> 26:48.840
Yes, sir.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.800
The least of the kind of a man in that field, you have to be not only strong,

26:53.800 --> 26:57.560
but I think you have to be somewhat on the silent side.

26:57.560 --> 27:04.040
So it helps, yes, I would be so, but they certainly articulate the old adage.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.960
The silence is golden.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.640
You're going to get any weird things.

27:08.840 --> 27:12.920
Mr. Collins, all the FBI agents who never thought on me for information,

27:12.920 --> 27:15.320
every one of them always had a notebook.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.080
Does every FBI man tell you no to look?

27:19.080 --> 27:20.280
Yes, sir.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.320
Every investigator carries some sort of a notebook, yes.

27:23.320 --> 27:29.560
He does use a clean or trustworthy, swindling memory that he's used to.

27:29.560 --> 27:36.520
That becomes the taking note when he becomes a habit, yes, sir.

27:36.520 --> 27:44.520
So I presume in your work for the committee, you have always been rather meticulous about making notes.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.160
I've made much, yes, sir.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.600
All along the line, I suppose, the refrains are missing.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.040
Yes, sir, whenever I cut.

27:53.640 --> 27:57.000
Now Mr. Carl, I raised all this for very depth of the use.

27:59.960 --> 28:06.920
We're moving on towards the end of this high public adventure,

28:06.920 --> 28:08.120
if you'll recall it, that's...

28:08.600 --> 28:09.400
Yes.

28:11.480 --> 28:16.440
And when we get to the end of the call, it appears to me that what was in front of the committee

28:17.480 --> 28:26.680
will be a conflict in the rest of the day, and a conflict in capacity to recollect where there is

28:26.680 --> 28:29.640
a barrier in the testimony between women.

28:31.640 --> 28:37.480
Have you ever liked yourself for some time, time, on notes that you've made to form more?

28:38.600 --> 28:44.600
Yes, sir. You feel them as a call rather reasonably suitable for your rest of the night.

28:44.600 --> 28:49.320
Many things that have been raised in the court have been investigated.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.120
Yes, sir?

28:50.120 --> 28:54.520
What is the view just for a few seconds, I use.

28:56.040 --> 29:00.440
I think you should have this in mind when you're examining any of the wetless, I think,

29:00.440 --> 29:02.520
the other members of the committee, seven-line also.

29:03.480 --> 29:10.040
The matter is this that I have the none written rules, that are strong on this.

29:11.080 --> 29:15.880
Many members of the committee interrogate anyone who doesn't want his name known,

29:15.880 --> 29:23.800
does want to manage about, otherwise the informants you can call them last.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.880
I have a request of that.

29:26.840 --> 29:33.880
No member in the place in the file knowing that too many people have access to those files,

29:33.880 --> 29:39.480
so that I wish you would keep that in mind when you discuss the difference in the procedure

29:39.480 --> 29:42.280
and the FBI and our committee and the FBI.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.560
I think everything is written down, everything is put in the file.

29:46.200 --> 29:52.280
In my committee I have been strong to the two, any government employee who wants to give

29:52.280 --> 29:55.080
an information, unless they have given instructions.

29:55.640 --> 29:59.080
So, there may not be a file, no member had a different fare,

29:59.080 --> 30:02.440
but I've been informed of what the information is, and the validity of the procedure.

30:04.040 --> 30:10.200
Where a recollection comes to the issue is to car you are willing to stand upon a unit recollection,

30:10.200 --> 30:15.960
based upon the feedback you received from those taken that you've gone for.

30:16.040 --> 30:23.160
Yes sir, and you're willing to stand upon the, the record of your birth today in making

30:23.160 --> 30:25.640
answers to the questions that are going to be answered.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.120
Yes sir.

30:26.840 --> 30:32.040
Now I think to the moment that the car I have only one other question and that is this.

30:34.280 --> 30:42.040
Is it possible for a person to express some interest in another in your judgment without being charged

30:42.040 --> 30:44.600
with undilonged influence and by that I need it?
