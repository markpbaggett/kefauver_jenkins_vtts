WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.640
It's just the Whitney.

00:01.640 --> 00:03.540
What he did.

00:03.540 --> 00:08.440
Later in the day, in fact, it was on the telephone.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.880
After I'd left Senator McCarthy at the World War

00:11.880 --> 00:16.600
of my story, he told me that he had been hearing rumors.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.360
And he said that he thought that there was some sort

00:19.360 --> 00:22.280
that some of the press were going down

00:22.280 --> 00:26.520
to Fort Stix to stir up trouble.

00:26.520 --> 00:30.800
He asked me if I would be sure to check

00:30.800 --> 00:34.240
and make sure that the staff was not

00:34.240 --> 00:39.000
abusing any privilege that Secretary Stevens had given.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.600
So if you accept the moment, that Senator McCarthy

00:42.600 --> 00:47.560
did discuss the question of signs, active

00:47.560 --> 00:51.040
discipline, and relationship with the staff,

00:51.040 --> 00:56.080
and the subcommittee to shine later in the day.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.640
Now, I'll ask you to turn to your memorandum date

00:58.640 --> 01:03.520
of December 21, 1953 to Senator McCarthy.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.640
Do you have that front?

01:04.640 --> 01:06.520
Yes.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.160
And did you dictate that memorandum?

01:09.160 --> 01:11.560
Yes.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.840
And I'll read from it.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.960
Following my conversation with you all

01:15.960 --> 01:18.920
at the end of New York, I think you should know

01:18.920 --> 01:23.080
that the staff of the subcommittee has not told foundation, time,

01:23.080 --> 01:27.200
or service, except when necessary to the committee works.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.480
Now, was it Senator McCarthy's telephone call

01:30.480 --> 01:32.920
that prompted you to make this memorandum?

01:32.920 --> 01:33.440
Yes, sir.

01:33.440 --> 01:33.960
What?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.920
Actually, was the telephone call from me to the senate?

01:36.920 --> 01:39.560
If the senator asks you to look into the matter

01:39.560 --> 01:41.000
and give him a report?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.880
Yes, sir.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.600
And you did look into it, and this memorandum

01:45.600 --> 01:48.160
is you report to the senate?

01:48.160 --> 01:48.880
Yes, in effect.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.640
I also talked to him.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.640
And Mr. Adams is not correct when he says

01:55.640 --> 01:59.240
that the senator recommended you on the morning of Thursday,

01:59.240 --> 02:02.640
December 17, with reference to the subcommittee staff

02:02.640 --> 02:06.040
interventions on the air for sure and its dates.

02:06.040 --> 02:06.640
That's right.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.040
It's not so.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.320
It's an air of that.

02:09.320 --> 02:14.120
Now, on the question of your memorandum, Mr. Carp,

02:14.120 --> 02:19.480
I will ask you if the purpose of your dictating

02:19.480 --> 02:24.600
the various memorandum which are contained in the document

02:24.600 --> 02:29.640
which I'm sure you're referring to now,

02:29.640 --> 02:35.600
was to convey information, either to Senator McCarthy

02:35.600 --> 02:38.720
or Mr. Coleman?

02:38.720 --> 02:39.560
Yes, sir.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.040
Yes, sir.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.200
Convey information at other reasons.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.800
And what are the reasons you did it in two days?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.480
To make a record.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.880
So the memorandum I had two purposes.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.160
Is that correct?

02:52.160 --> 02:53.320
My memorandum I guess.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.320
Yes.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.720
To convey information and for the purposes of keeping

02:58.720 --> 02:59.320
correct?

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
Yes.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.160
Did you attempt to dictate memorandum

03:04.160 --> 03:07.920
concerning all of your contacts with Mr. Adams?

03:07.920 --> 03:10.080
No, sir.

03:10.080 --> 03:15.080
Was there any particular reason that you dictated the memorandum

03:15.080 --> 03:19.400
which in fact appeared in this document which I have in my hand?

03:19.400 --> 03:19.920
Yes, sir.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.280
It's a reason for agent.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.160
All right, now.

03:23.160 --> 03:29.960
Let's turn to your memorandum dated January 9, 1954.

03:34.720 --> 03:38.960
From yourself to Roy Coleman.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.280
Did you dictate that memorandum?

03:41.280 --> 03:42.560
Yes, sir.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.760
Where were you when you dictated?

03:44.760 --> 03:46.640
In San Diego, my father's office.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.440
In Washington, Texas.

03:48.440 --> 03:52.320
Where was Mr. Cole in New York?

03:52.320 --> 03:55.360
Down that is the date.

03:55.360 --> 04:03.120
If it not, Saturday, January 9, when you talked to Mr. Adams, who was in Emmer's Massachusetts.

04:03.120 --> 04:03.600
Yes, sir.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.640
That's correct.

04:04.640 --> 04:10.400
And as I recall the testimony, that call concerned too.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.520
Fact all.

04:11.520 --> 04:16.520
One, the question of the insert for the annual report,

04:16.520 --> 04:19.960
a relation to the change of the Army security problem.

04:19.960 --> 04:20.480
Yes.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.000
And secondly, private champion.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.600
Yes.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.280
Is that correct?

04:25.280 --> 04:26.240
Yes.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.760
And I read from your memorandum.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.760
Your memorandum.

04:31.760 --> 04:36.960
I called John Adams about the question of the insert for the annual report.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.200
The phrase of change of the Army security problem.

04:40.200 --> 04:45.840
I also told him you had been trying to reach him about they not being free Sunday to

04:45.840 --> 04:47.760
help with the report.

04:47.760 --> 04:53.600
He was up in Emmer's Massachusetts, stated that he was slow bound, and that he couldn't

04:53.600 --> 04:56.280
do the thing about it from Massachusetts.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.960
I am sure that he doesn't want to do anything, but I told him he was thought.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.840
I think he was up to him.

05:02.840 --> 05:08.760
It is obvious that he doesn't want the part about Army laxity in the report.

05:08.760 --> 05:13.640
So don't expect days to get off the hill.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.840
If I correct, the review of memorandum is thought.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.040
Yes, I.

05:18.040 --> 05:26.680
Now, you knew I'd take it that Mr. Shine was assigned for KPJD the following day, Sunday January

05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
10th.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
Yes, sir.

05:28.680 --> 05:38.480
And the purpose of your call among other things was to get private shine relieved from that

05:38.480 --> 05:39.480
obligation.

05:39.480 --> 05:40.480
No, sir.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.480
It was not?

05:41.480 --> 05:42.480
No, sir.

05:42.480 --> 05:47.280
The purpose of my call was to discuss a matter concerning the annual report with Mr. Adams.

05:47.280 --> 05:52.680
I had discussed it with his assistant, Mr. Haskins on the day before.

05:52.680 --> 05:57.960
I wanted to get a, Mr. Haskins was not in a position of authority to give me an answer

05:57.960 --> 05:59.520
to what I was interested in.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.400
I called Mr. Adams.

06:01.400 --> 06:08.160
The Shine memorandum, the Shine matter is an incidental to my call.

06:08.160 --> 06:15.000
I merely told Mr. Adams as an incidental to my call that Mr. Cohn had been trying to

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
reach him.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.800
Well, you've brought up the set of the Shine on that case.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.360
I brought up the subject of Shine in the telephone call.

06:21.360 --> 06:27.640
Did you ask Mr. Adams to attempt to secure a relief's private shine from the duty on the

06:27.640 --> 06:28.640
following day?

06:28.640 --> 06:29.640
No, I didn't.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.920
The conversation went something like that.

06:31.920 --> 06:40.960
I said that Mr. Cohn had been trying to reach Mr. Adams and that Mr. Shine had been

06:40.960 --> 06:43.520
assigned some duty over the weekend.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.520
And Mr. Cohn wanted him to work with him on the report.

06:46.520 --> 06:51.520
I told him that Mr. Cohn would try to contact him.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.280
And you dictated this memorandum to Mr. Cohn.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.600
It was in New York on Saturday, January 9th.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.000
And why did you insert in that memorandum?

07:02.000 --> 07:08.120
It is obvious that he doesn't want the part about I'm elaxing him the report.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.120
So don't expect these to get off the house.

07:14.360 --> 07:19.960
I can't say why I inserted any particular part of this thing in here, any particular word.

07:19.960 --> 07:25.920
As a matter of fact, I really ask you this, Mr. Cohn, why you trying to convey the

07:25.920 --> 07:32.560
information to Mr. Cohn that a private shine would not be able to get off on the following

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
day?

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
No, sir.

07:34.560 --> 07:39.560
I'd already conveyed this information to Mr. Cohn, my telephone before I wrote this

07:39.560 --> 07:40.560
memorandum.

07:40.560 --> 07:45.960
When I told Mr. Cohn, my telephone, that what concerning the conversation I had had

07:45.960 --> 07:51.160
Mr. Adams, Mr. Cohn said, all right, he would call him.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.160
He called him.

07:52.160 --> 07:58.760
A long later in the day told me that he had called Mr. Adams at some in at Amherst, Massachusetts,

07:58.760 --> 08:01.560
and that the phone had wrong.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.480
He heard it ring several times.

08:03.480 --> 08:08.320
He knew from the sound that somebody had picked up the receiver.

08:08.320 --> 08:15.200
He said something like hello, John, John, and there was no answer.

08:15.200 --> 08:19.280
He felt that from the sound that somebody hung up the receiver.

08:19.280 --> 08:25.880
He told me that he was sure that Adams had been there and had received a call.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.680
I didn't make much difference for me at that point.

08:28.680 --> 08:32.880
Mr. Cohn said, how am I putting this in a memorandum?

08:32.880 --> 08:33.880
I want to know.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.880
I want to have this on record.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.880
Mr. Cohn, the question.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.880
That's not an answer.

08:40.880 --> 08:46.360
So it wasn't for the purpose of conveying information to him on that particular day?

08:46.360 --> 08:49.200
No, he had the information.

08:49.200 --> 08:59.480
Mr. Cohn, I refer you to page 2573 of the record, which referred to your train ride with

08:59.480 --> 09:03.400
Mr. Adams on November 25.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.960
And I'll read from Mr. Adams' testimony.

09:06.960 --> 09:11.240
The train takes about three hours, 45 minutes.

09:11.240 --> 09:18.480
As I recall now, as I felt it began, 41 a half of our entire conversation was directed

09:18.480 --> 09:23.480
to Shannon, and was filled with Mr. Cohn's observations to me.

09:23.480 --> 09:28.880
To the effect that for so long, a shan was not said especially a sign.

09:28.880 --> 09:34.680
Saddest factory in so far as Mr. Cohn was concerned that we were in trouble.

09:34.680 --> 09:39.880
Mr. Cohn pointed out to me that he thought that he wasn't proposing this as an independent

09:39.880 --> 09:42.080
proposal in my opinion.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.280
But I felt that he was bashing on to me at the least.

09:45.280 --> 09:50.280
He had that as long as the assignment of shan was not said as factory, we could expect

09:50.280 --> 09:51.280
trouble.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.280
Now, you recall that testimony.

09:54.280 --> 10:03.120
Did you state on that occasion of that train ride on November 25 in Subway?

10:03.120 --> 10:13.000
That was so long as the assignment of private shan in the army was unsatisfactory to Mr. Cohn

10:13.000 --> 10:14.960
that the army was in trouble.

10:14.960 --> 10:15.960
Yes, sir.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.960
You deny making me such a stare, yes?

10:18.960 --> 10:22.960
Using the words of Mr. Adams or the substance.

10:22.960 --> 10:23.960
Yes.

10:23.960 --> 10:31.760
You have testified, though, that the not-most car that the subject of shan was brought up on

10:31.760 --> 10:32.760
that train ride.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
Yes, sir.

10:33.760 --> 10:40.760
Did it consume as Mr. Adams, as testified to nearly one half of your time?

10:40.760 --> 10:41.760
No, sir.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.760
I've testified to that this morning.

10:44.760 --> 10:50.760
And you've already stated that there were numerous other subjects in the word conversation.

10:50.760 --> 10:56.760
Now, in what manner was the subject of shan injected into your conversation?

10:56.760 --> 10:58.760
On the train trip?

10:58.760 --> 10:59.760
Yes, sir.

10:59.760 --> 11:04.760
Yes, it followed the conversation we had concerning General Lawton.

11:04.760 --> 11:16.720
Do you deny Mr. Cohn that you ever stated to Mr. Adams that as long as the assignment

11:16.720 --> 11:24.760
or treatment of shan was unsatisfactory to Mr. Cohn that Cohn would make trouble for

11:24.760 --> 11:25.760
the army?

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
Yes, sir.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.760
I never made any statement to him.

11:28.760 --> 11:33.760
He dawned this occasion not on the occasion of your luncheon on March the 5th.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.760
Or any other time?

11:35.760 --> 11:36.760
Yes, sir.

11:36.760 --> 11:37.760
That's right.

11:37.760 --> 11:45.760
And it took that small interview that the subject of shan was injected into these conversations

11:45.760 --> 11:59.760
by Mr. Adams in the form of using shan as faith in an effort to hope the army's investigation

11:59.760 --> 12:01.760
by this committee.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.760
Yes, sir.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.760
Is that how the subject of shan was injected into these conversations?

12:06.760 --> 12:13.760
Into this train life conversation and the conversations I've specified to often times shan

12:13.760 --> 12:16.760
came with this come up in conversation.

12:16.760 --> 12:26.760
Now, you heard Mr. Adams just money did you not that on December 20th and on December 23th?

12:27.760 --> 12:30.760
You fall.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.760
Mr. Adams in South Dakota.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.760
You recall it?

12:35.760 --> 12:36.760
Yes, sir.

12:36.760 --> 12:45.760
Did you tell a phone, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Adams, at his home in South Dakota on those two days

12:45.760 --> 12:47.760
December 20th and December 23th?

12:47.760 --> 12:56.720
So I recall talking to Mr. Adams in South Dakota on one day he says two days under

12:56.720 --> 12:58.720
the guise of the military.

12:58.720 --> 13:03.720
And what was the purpose of those calls?

13:03.720 --> 13:08.720
Those calls had to do with General Adams.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.720
Did the calls relate to private shan in any degree?

13:12.720 --> 13:13.720
No, sir.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.720
Was that subject brought up?

13:16.720 --> 13:18.720
Not by me, sir.

13:19.720 --> 13:26.720
Is it your testimony that the subject of private shan was interformed by Mr. Adams?

13:26.720 --> 13:27.720
No, sir.

13:27.720 --> 13:32.720
I don't recall private shan's name being mentioned in either of those phone calls that there were two.

13:32.720 --> 13:37.720
But why do you state that Mr. Adams brought up that set?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.720
No, I didn't state Mr. Adams brought it up.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
I said I didn't bring up the set.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.720
And if it was brought up, it was not brought up by you.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.720
And if it was, that's correct.

13:45.720 --> 13:50.720
Let me read from Mr. Adams' testimony, page 2594.

13:50.720 --> 13:57.040
On the 20th of December I received a long distance call from Mr. Car, in which the set

13:57.040 --> 14:03.720
date on the 20th of December and on the 23rd of December while I was in South Dakota,

14:03.720 --> 14:06.720
I received a long distance call from Mr. Car.

14:06.720 --> 14:12.720
On one and I think on both of the occasions, the principal sentence of the call seemed to

14:12.720 --> 14:14.720
me to be shan.

14:14.720 --> 14:20.720
And I restated that I had told them that if they were just wait until Christmas and

14:20.720 --> 14:24.720
New Year, I would try and find out what was going to happen.

14:24.720 --> 14:30.720
Mr. Jenkins, you say that in one or two calls the subject seemed to be shan.

14:30.720 --> 14:36.720
Was there not shan discussed by Mr. Car?

14:36.720 --> 14:40.720
Long distance while you were visiting your mother in two calls South Dakota.

14:40.720 --> 14:47.720
Mr. Adams, it was and as I say, the principal sentence of one of the calls as I recall it

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
with shan.

14:48.720 --> 14:52.720
My recollection is that both calls are looted with shan.

14:52.720 --> 15:02.720
Now Mr. Car, do you now say that the principal purpose of neither of these calls was shan.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.720
I know.

15:03.720 --> 15:08.720
And you've been hired to stay for one by Mr. Adams to the contrary.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.720
I know.

15:10.720 --> 15:18.720
I'll give this to that.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.720
I'll take that here.

15:20.720 --> 15:28.720
Leave it here.

15:28.720 --> 15:37.720
Mr. Car.

15:37.720 --> 15:45.720
There's one other subject that I want to discuss with you and I believe we can do it for

15:45.720 --> 15:47.720
four gentlemen.

15:47.720 --> 15:52.720
And that is the subject number one.

15:52.720 --> 15:59.720
How do I support by Mr. Shine subsequent to November 3,

15:59.720 --> 16:03.720
while he was at Fort Decks?

16:03.720 --> 16:15.720
I will ask you if Mr. Shine interviewed any witnesses while he was facing the Fort Decks

16:15.720 --> 16:17.720
to your knowledge.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.720
Yes sir.

16:19.720 --> 16:27.720
Do you, do you records or memorandum kept in your office reflected?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.720
I don't think they do.

16:29.720 --> 16:41.720
There was no written data or memorandum kept to document any interviews which Mr. Shine made of witnesses

16:41.720 --> 16:44.720
probably with the Fort Decks.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.720
I don't know that.

16:46.720 --> 16:55.720
Who assigned him to the test of interviewing with this is probably with the Fort Decks?

16:55.720 --> 17:02.720
I don't know that he was assigned to the test of interviewing witnesses.

17:02.720 --> 17:08.720
He had been working on the Fort Moments case along with the rest of us.

17:08.720 --> 17:12.720
He had some informants.

17:12.720 --> 17:17.720
He had one witness that I can readily recall that he interviewed.

17:17.720 --> 17:24.720
I don't know that it was an assignment I think he might have been just a follow-through.

17:25.720 --> 17:33.720
Why was Mr. Shine permitted to do that type of work while he was on duty at Fort Decks?

17:33.720 --> 17:40.720
To understand that you have a staff of trained investigators, men with experience in the FBI?

17:40.720 --> 17:51.720
Why was this young man with no appreciable prior experience in interviewing witnesses given that task?

17:51.720 --> 17:53.720
Why was he permitted to do it?

17:53.720 --> 17:59.720
Well, first of all, I might say that he was not permitted to do it while he was on duty at Fort Decks.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.720
All of these things happened during his non-training hours.

18:03.720 --> 18:19.720
I might also say that as far as that period of time is concerned, he had had prior experience in interviewing witnesses and investigation following his work on the information programs

18:19.720 --> 18:22.720
and the virtual AmeriCorps investigation.

18:22.720 --> 18:33.720
Is it the practice of your office when an investigator interviews a witness to make no written memoranda of his interviews?

18:33.720 --> 18:38.720
No, sir. I don't want to say that it's the practice of the office.

18:38.720 --> 18:44.720
It's the practice of the office to run itself as efficiently as possible.

18:44.720 --> 18:55.720
Sometimes memorandum dictates sometimes they are. During the course of preparation for hearings, many times notes are maintained,

18:55.720 --> 19:01.720
scribbled notes are used in interrogating witnesses.

19:01.720 --> 19:06.720
Did you expect to use the information gathered by Private Shine?

19:06.720 --> 19:11.720
It is interviews with these various witnesses.

19:11.720 --> 19:15.720
We did use information at least one of them as I recall.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.720
And how did you get that information from Private Shine?

19:19.720 --> 19:23.720
I usually came through Mr. Colman.

19:23.720 --> 19:38.720
And Private Shine was able to retain any of his heads all the information gathered from these witnesses, which he interviewed at Fort Decks without making any written memorandum.

19:38.720 --> 19:44.720
Well, sir, is it a cheat test? No, sir. Is it a question?

19:44.720 --> 19:49.720
Could I have a question, please?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.720
Where are we?

19:51.720 --> 19:54.720
I have a question.

19:54.720 --> 20:03.720
The information gathered from these witnesses, which he interviewed at Fort Decks without making any written memorandum of his interviews.

20:03.720 --> 20:15.720
Well, part of it, the first part of the question, Private Shine didn't retain any of his head. He conveyed it to Mr. Colman, who made use of it.

20:15.720 --> 20:20.720
The second part, I don't recall that he interviewed these people at Fort Decks.

20:20.720 --> 20:31.720
Well, this practice of interviewing witnesses who can make any memorandum of his interviews, is that consistently followed by other investigators?

20:31.720 --> 20:49.720
It's not consistently followed by anyone. However, Mr. Colman very frequently makes a memorandum during the case of preparing for hearings, very frequently interviews are conducted.

20:49.720 --> 21:01.720
And the information is received, which appears in the printed interview of the at the hearing. There is no need in many cases for memorandum prior to that time.

21:01.720 --> 21:13.720
Mr. Colman, why weren't these interviews? The witnesses by Mr. Shine conducted while he was at Fort Decks, conducted before he entered the army.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.720
Who knew he was going in the army?

21:16.720 --> 21:19.720
Right, sir. Why weren't these?

21:19.720 --> 21:28.720
If I understand your question, you want to know why weren't the interviews that he conducted after he was at Fort Decks, conducted prior to that time?

21:28.720 --> 21:30.720
Yes, sir.

21:30.720 --> 21:42.720
Prior to Mr. Shine's going into the army, I discussed with Mr. Colman and Senator McCarthy the fact that he would probably be in the army.

21:43.720 --> 21:53.720
The main reason that I had for discussing it with them was the reports. The other information he had was valuable, but I was concerned with the reports.

21:53.720 --> 22:05.720
I felt that if the end of the year came around and the interim reports and the annual report were not out, it would be a reflection on the committee and a reflection on me.

22:06.720 --> 22:13.720
They advised me that Mr. that they had given this word to Mr. Bosslog.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.720
And that Mr. Bosslog was going to write the reports.

22:16.720 --> 22:25.720
It later developed that Mr. Bosslog was unable to write the reports through no fall of his own.

22:26.720 --> 22:41.720
Information from Mr. Shine had in the possession was used in the staff and the rockatories of witnesses in October.

22:41.720 --> 22:46.720
He cleaned up as much as he could at that point.

22:47.720 --> 22:59.720
Now, you still haven't answered my question with Dr. Stude Shine's interviewing witnesses while he was in the army and stationed at Fort Decks.

22:59.720 --> 23:12.720
These were, these as far as I could, I recall incidental matters, the prime reason, the prime work rather than he had was connected with the writing of the reports.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.720
The only thing that he did or did not interview witnesses.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.720
Yes, he did. He interviewed some witnesses.

23:19.720 --> 23:29.720
When you say witnesses, I can think of one who was a witness, a man and others were confidential and fallen.

23:29.720 --> 23:35.720
If you not have other investigators, that you're command to do that sort of work.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.720
Yes, sir.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.720
Was they fitting to do it?

23:41.720 --> 23:47.720
Yes, sir, but this was more or less of a follow through on works that Mr. Shine had done before.

23:47.720 --> 23:54.720
For instance, one of the persons he talked to insisted that he only talked with Mr. Shine.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.720
These are things that happen in investigations.

23:57.720 --> 24:05.720
It's your testimony that young Mr. Shine was indispensable to the work of the committee.

24:05.720 --> 24:12.720
And that it was compelling that he interviewed witnesses after he was conducted in the army?

24:12.720 --> 24:14.720
No, sir, it is not.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.720
Why was it done?

24:16.720 --> 24:22.720
As I have said, Mr. Shine did interview a few witnesses.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.720
I can recall one off hand.

24:24.720 --> 24:31.720
He interviewed informants with whom he had had contact a prior to his going into the army.

24:31.720 --> 24:37.720
That was in the panel to his main task, which was preparing the report.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.720
I had no further questions.

24:39.720 --> 24:42.720
I mean, it was time to recess and tell the two of us.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.720
Well done.

24:44.720 --> 24:45.720
That's all.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.720
You have Dr. Hart Chairman, Monday now.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.720
And we'll be back to the next session of the hearing.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.720
We'll be at 2 p.m.
