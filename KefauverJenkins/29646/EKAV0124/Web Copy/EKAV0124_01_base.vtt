00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
You have a virtual connection with the task-gipping of this telephone conversation similar to your picking down notes on other telephone conversations.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
I mean, did I use the same class there? Yes, yes, yes.

00:17.000 --> 00:28.000
But I do understand that that in most of your time, our year-to-year session, the telephone conversations, monsters, or other major research in here are never complete.

00:28.000 --> 00:37.000
I wouldn't say that they're never complete. I imagine I get a complete version in my short hair notes on many, many calls.

00:37.000 --> 00:49.000
But I take it that in this particular instance that at times you could not feel a slight of a conversation, or a random conversation in a room, and for that reason, certainly it's a deleted.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Yes, sir. That's a little bit.

00:51.000 --> 01:03.000
You have done over a few of your notes. Is there any change in the subject of the conversation as a result of this delete?

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
I don't know if they thought it's not in my opinion.

01:07.000 --> 01:23.000
Mr. Lucas, you transcribe all of your telephone conversations? No, sir. When do you transcribe the telephone conversations?

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
When the instructor, the Army asked me to do so, I thought it was the department councilor who would ask me to do so.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Then I figured that he would be acting on instructions from the instructor.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
I assume there are many calls going into the office of the secretary every day.

01:41.000 --> 01:53.000
Now, you can log your book in your executive way that you can readily secure the call that the secretary is interested in.

01:53.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't know about it readily. I have a system so that I can't locate the call. When will this particular call pass by?

02:10.000 --> 02:20.000
I don't remember exactly what they're talking about. I imagine there's somewhere around the marks set around there.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It was not sent by that. That's the time I do not believe.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
Mr. Lucas, you monitor all of the calling calls as well as incoming calls to the secretary's office.

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
I monitor the call, which the secretary talks about whether it doesn't matter which way they would initiate this test.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
Other words, you hear all telephone conversations that the secretary has to resolve this.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Whatever parties they'll be talking to, is that correct?

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Call the phone and the call will be in the department of the test.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
I'm going to keep this in the call and which rarely does not say, do not listen to it.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
If the secretary is all of them like mine, your ears must be heard many times.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Yes, yes.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I'm going to turn that back on you.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I have no problem.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Mr. Love, I'll just want to put the flag to the center.

03:18.000 --> 03:28.000
Thank you for taking your note for us and we know with everybody in this room have a perfectly good picture of that telephone conversation.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I believe so.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm going to try to be in this call.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Just a few questions.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
You monitor the call, Mr. Adam Lotton.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
If there may be over the department of the test, let's vote.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
The one I would not monitor, because there would be may over the vote box, the photograph, the system, I believe.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Now, can I ask you this question?

03:55.000 --> 04:07.000
One of the issues that I'm going to discuss, deal with more of any questions about any phone calls, the secretary, Mr. Adam Lotton,

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
is going to be very familiar with the son of the son of the son of the co-op hearing.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Would you have a computer make?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
In the case, what's the name of your call?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
A certain day.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
A comment will be called.

04:21.000 --> 04:34.000
Do you know that if you ask me, sir, a certain senator's phone or talk on the phone on a certain, the next day, where the secretary, yes or no, that I would not address that call.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
In other words, you could go back to your books now.

04:38.000 --> 04:51.000
And over the past six, eight months, you could give the different names of the different subjects who would have called the secretary and the secretary to regard it as particular matter.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
I couldn't do it right now, no, because the records are rather large.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
But you have some questions, please.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Yes, sir.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
I still don't know completely in line with how the work is going to take notes.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
You say you're trying to get the conversation of both parties, rather than social reading.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
What's it?

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
When you write up your report, do you write it up as nearly as you can in a verbatim report of the conversation that you write?

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
You write your version of up and down during that conversation.

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
What we said is that we are going to report on any, let's make the conversation between myself and the secretary of that student.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
The transcript in report two, on the call of November 7th, does that call or any other call?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
So there's a normal procedure.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
The normal procedure?

05:49.000 --> 06:06.000
I will, at the time it's possible, if it's of a stratific conclusion, the call, if I'm not pushed into doing something else more important, I will then write on a specific paper, this time, the time of day,

06:06.000 --> 06:32.000
that is done by using those short hand notes, the time of day, the dates at the top and I indicate who calls who, and just leave a subject, for example, if you phone special thanks students on November 7th and talk about the shine matter, I will tell you that on that middle split, such and such time, then the party calls that same students, Ray, shine matter, three.

06:32.000 --> 06:43.000
So the theory of your report on the phone conversation is your own personal idea of the important part of the telephone conversation.

06:43.000 --> 07:12.000
That's the thing that I use for locating the call with me, yes, it's the way we are in formal lectures, I would like to make this very clear, as far as the more new and I made some comments from the interview, what's the given telephone conversation about when we get very close and I'm very opinion, none of that bonus should be borne by you, you're just a reporter doing your job, you do the job, you're always doing right.

07:12.000 --> 07:41.000
You do not make the call at the demonstration, that's correct, could you tell us what I'm up and I told her, you monitor the call between Secretary Steven and General Washington, General Washington, General Watt, the radar information of the sport model, I'd be only able to tell you at this time, but have you been asked to transfer and write the conversation between Secretary Steven and General Washington?

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I'm not going to tell you again.

07:46.000 --> 08:04.000
You follow my question, in other words there's very important telephone call, Green Watt Steven and General Watt, and I have to ensure you know what I'm not the Secretary, when you have to transfer and the conversation between, I'm not going to see them for the awful app, the transfer and the conversation between Watt and Steven.

08:04.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't believe it was put that way through, when I was asked to do my first unit transcribing and connection with this matter of hand here, I was told to, this is my best recollection at this moment, I was told to transcribe the call, the conversation will be,

08:33.000 --> 08:53.000
I don't believe it was spelled out, I don't think anybody's best transcribed just the call from Senator McCarty or Mr. Carl and Mr. Colne at that point, how many times will this be?

08:53.000 --> 09:19.000
I'm referring to second, and then I'm referring to second occasion when I was asked to transcribe conversations that regard to the matter of hand here today, I was told to go through my book and transcribe all the conversations, having been saying what's the letter, no general law will not mention.

09:19.000 --> 09:31.000
How many conversations did you come to try and replicate? I don't recall third day how many of those were in the video, I'm asking with five, you know, right, money out, I'm not getting time, I'm fired.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
I mean, the time for first thing I said, that's correct.

09:35.000 --> 09:42.000
I mean, we're not always going to see it again now with the council.

09:42.000 --> 09:56.000
Chairman, do you have any questions that the council has asked in jail? I'm sure if you have, council for the committee, but I will, once first, inquire whether anybody else has any questions or questions, do you have any questions?

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
I have no further questions about this, I have to make you state that this time, you may.

10:02.000 --> 10:19.000
This witness has made such a year drop to use his words, some his transcription, some of the words of the conversation, whether by any burdens there otherwise does not appear.

10:19.000 --> 10:48.000
We know lawyers under the name of the most, that sometimes the dropping of a comma, a summer phone or a tear goes in pallet chains and meaning of a sentence, in due to the fact that this witness now says that his transcription is not accurate, that he made himself the judge of what was material and what was not.

10:48.000 --> 11:01.000
I do not see this as the committee on just sending them a party and especially this committee investigating this conversation that he's been admitted to the government.

11:01.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm no longer in just the public. I have to be excluded and that's like they even be called back to the witness today.

11:10.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't like to compete with the senators there, but do like the microphone and other competitions, you take these questions and follow us for a new break.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
Thanks. I turn off a greeting Mr. Jenkins, in spite of my good respect for you.

11:29.000 --> 11:40.000
Mr. Smith, the transcript you were not asked, your testimony I think you a D of E were asked, but it is 99 and 44 100 percent accurate.

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
And I do not agree that he made himself the judge of what was important and what was not important.

11:48.000 --> 11:56.000
I think we have in this courtroom and witness has completely prepared to testify to a telephone conversation.

11:56.000 --> 12:11.000
I think what the dialogue that looks at in my life, and if we do not put the telephone conversation into a day, I wish it understood that I should learn with all my power and the satisfaction that it deals with it in the end.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
Mr. Chairman, I believe this is a further question.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
We are ready for the questioning procedure.

12:23.000 --> 12:31.000
10 minutes and a 10 minute rule, but without discussing our believe the council's recommendation and send them a phone call and we'll like to address themselves to that point.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
Mr. Chairman, I suspect you are the judge of the commission.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
Mr. Chairman, I suspect you are the judge of the commission.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
I do say that it would be admissible.

12:46.000 --> 12:58.000
It is not in full and complete.

12:58.000 --> 13:16.000
It is what this stands me, but we know it is a thousand percent accurate, but the very fact is that he admitted to a left out word and his notes are directed to a shorthand notes now indicates that worth one list that might have some meaning.

13:17.000 --> 13:32.000
Mr. Chairman, I suspect the validity of his testimony and for that reason, I agree with Council that if not being complete, it is not admissible unless both parties agree to it.

13:33.000 --> 13:54.000
Mr. Chairman, this can be used however by the government who took the notes and by the other parties who referred to conversations to refer to their members, they should be able to ask for a note that bestifies the member as the what actually occurred.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
Mr. Chairman, I'm a reporter. I do more than I would say.

14:01.000 --> 14:21.000
Mr. Chairman, I think it would be helpful to know how many other monitors, conversations to be introduced in evidence and whether the additional monitors, conversations, whether they sell and obtain a category.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Mr. Chairman, I don't know.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Did you answer that?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I will ask the question there, Robert.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
I assume that the discussion will have a section of the members' room and I have an announcement that you will not bring in.

14:39.000 --> 14:48.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask this. Are there similar solutions that would appear in the notes of Mr. Luther?

14:48.000 --> 15:00.000
Senator, there are no solutions. This is a careful response who does not want to take a note that say I am sure I have got three words absolutely.

15:01.000 --> 15:19.000
Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Luther, Mr. Luther, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Roosevelt, I am sure that no demographer takes note by hand or by a senator by the positively specified that each and every word is absolutely shaken down.

16:19.000 --> 16:32.000
Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Smith, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Smith, Mr. Luther has specified that going along to the taking down all the telephone conversations, something happened and he didn't get so close.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Am I correct in that announcement? I don't mind if you ask for it.

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Luther, Mr. Roosevelt, let me repeat the question.

17:14.000 --> 17:43.000
And that is your testimony that in taking down the note, short hand note of the conversation between Senator McIath and Senator Suck's Ray Stevens on November 7th, that you took out the conversation down words for words for the best of your ability to the best of your life.

17:43.000 --> 17:58.000
Now, by that, do I understand that there is no premeditated or welfare relations of work. There were no premeditated or welfare relations of work.

17:58.000 --> 18:11.000
The end of time that your notes disclose that certain words did not appear because of some interest that made it impossible for you to hear.

18:11.000 --> 18:24.000
They were specified either of the parties. At this point, I don't know just why it was, but I made a little mark with the knee indicates that I left a few words out there.

18:24.000 --> 18:37.000
And there is an instant break in my perspective, short hand note, those were the things because sometimes human beings do not always complete practice.

18:37.000 --> 18:48.000
Have you ever listened to me? Have you ever read a transcribed note of a conversation here?

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
Yes, sir, there are few of them. But when I know that there is, they cannot be word-to-word.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Do you think all of the sentences have a substance in a public?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
No, sir. I know they do not.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
So, let us forget to the point here. You say some of the sentences were not complete.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
From Washington, the mutual network is bringing you on the spot coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
We interrupt the hearings momentarily to bring you up a button from Moscow.

19:14.000 --> 19:24.000
Soviet Russia has broken off diplomatic relations with Australia in protest against the kidnapping of a Soviet diplomat Vladimir Petrov.

19:24.000 --> 19:34.000
All members of the Australian Embassy staff in Moscow were ordered to leave there and the Soviet Embassy staff in Kambar was ordered to return home to Moscow.

19:34.000 --> 19:42.000
Our coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings will continue after this 10 second pause for station identification.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
This is the mutual broadcasting system.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
710 on your dial.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
WOR. New York.

19:54.000 --> 20:03.000
Back in Washington, a mutual coverage of the McCarthy Army hearings before the Senate's permanent self-committee on investigation.

20:03.000 --> 20:12.000
And counsel is occasionally asked questions of the witness in the head of the unlawed and some switch-up.

20:13.000 --> 20:21.000
You have a great understanding. One is questions. I am correct them or not in the discussions.

20:21.000 --> 20:29.000
That you stated a while ago that you dropped all of the mid-adunments from this conversation.

20:29.000 --> 20:37.000
Yes sir. Just how many do you not know? That's correct sir. At all.

20:37.000 --> 20:51.000
I have just a question or two. There is nothing in this symbol. This text that you put above the line that would indicate whether it was a two-word or six-word or eight-word, the champion in the fossil of the incompleteness of the new Donald recall.

20:51.000 --> 21:00.000
How many words might be done? That's correct sir. At the time of taking the note, I realized for what reason now I do not remember.

21:00.000 --> 21:09.000
I realized that I had left something out whether I was too far behind to recall it or whether it was noise because I didn't hear it.

21:09.000 --> 21:16.000
I don't know now. I made a mark to indicate that I knew I was leaving something out and I wanted that to show in my notes book.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Put that down. Let's keep protecting yourself.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
At some future time there was a test-trip in that to remind you that the test-trip is not complete.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Yes sir. It's inimical.

21:26.000 --> 21:38.000
Just one question. Can you tell us the number of places on your notes recording this conversation where you indicated that something was admitted?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
What? Just one.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Yes sir.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
That's what you wanted.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
That's what I wanted.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
That's what I wanted.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
You need more time to get it.

21:51.000 --> 21:59.000
Well I will invest. Where does that appear in the transcription? In your short hand note.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
In the body of the call. In the body of it.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
How many words were taken down?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
You can tell by the number of places.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Sure. You can refresh your recollection.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
I work for it and have to pay you as a note.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
And roughly how many words will pay?

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
I'll talk to them.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I tried to figure some of the shite hand and the tray.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
You can refresh your recollection.

22:41.000 --> 22:50.000
I was just about three to five hundred.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Two or three hundred.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Yes sir. This is two or three hundred.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
No sir. This is one.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Well not how many words are missing.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
A lot of that five hundred.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I don't have a penny.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
You're going to whatever I think is different.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Well that's not four of that.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
But you have not a minute and no.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
We have to answer justice.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Right away.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Up top.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
This is just in case.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
What about this.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
This is in the suit.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
We have to answer.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
We have to answer.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Yes.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
We have to do the fact that the chair is not the father.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
We have to talk to him.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
We have to talk about it.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
We have to turn the cell over the chair.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
And he will decide if it's not the principal.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
What are the intent of the bill?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
The bill is not ready torender.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
The debt is signed and transferred.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I work it hard.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I work stupid.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
The man who wins eός's.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
The bail completed.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
I deal with it all.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Very long term I deal with step by step.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Get ready straighter.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Get ready straighter.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Get ready straighter.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Get ready straight.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Get ready straight.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Go under.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Go under.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Stand in the style.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Anybody else want to contribute a film that's earned them a lot of money?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Let me do it.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
All right, but I think it's better to do it this way.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Underdrapper with those pictures that were taken off the bail proper.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
This is the trim.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I've got everything in the trim.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Left trim.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
You'll find a road here.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It's better to tell if I'm in America.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
This is the trim.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Maybe I have the record.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
Very clear that I don't accuse the enterprise, the young target for anything, the improper.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
I think he did about many years.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm going to like to do the good of scoop on that document.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
I merely felt that it should not be appeared in the last magazine.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
When I heard you were in the field, over here, there's just one, two.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
What do you play in?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I have your jacket on.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Do I understand about 500 words were taken down?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I have to make three to five hundred.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
I'm not sure if that's what I'm not paying for.

25:23.000 --> 25:31.000
And how many words, if you know, and your opinion were not taken down?

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
In my opinion, it was part of a sentence, probably five or ten or maybe fifteen.

25:40.000 --> 25:48.000
I just don't know, but in my opinion, it was, I know I'm not so bad as to leave out a whole sentence.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
I understand it.

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
Then the words that you were unable to take down were part of a sentence.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
They were not an entire paragraph.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
That's correct.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
It's just part of a sentence in my opinion.

26:04.000 --> 26:16.000
And do I understand your testimony to be that maybe five to a maximum of fifteen words might be missing out of a total of between three hundred and five hundred words?

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
That is my opinion on it.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Yes sir.

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
Then other than for this particular sentence, your best knowledge and belief, all of the other sentences were complete.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
I believe so, yes sir.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
That's all.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Any further, who sent the sentence?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
No, I'll mention it up to just one question.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
I don't.

26:39.000 --> 26:46.000
Whose conversation was the commission made, was it made in the, and the Secretary of State, who's in conversation, or in some of the Macartons conversation?

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
At the very beginning of every, a remark by Senator Macarty.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Go ahead.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
I'm a killer.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Apart me, Senator Simon, I'm sorry.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I like that.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
One second.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
What you try to do, as much as you can, is get all the word in any conversation.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Is that correct, Mr. Lucas?

27:10.000 --> 27:18.000
Yes sir. I try my darned it because I want to get those deep-pale down, so it's necessary. I can help the secretary by doing so.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
Now often, when you put somebody on the line in any office, the person's thoughts too fast, but I'm taken occasionally.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
And they have to say you're talking too fast.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Is that correct?

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
He tried all of a sudden a lot, but sometimes the person was thought too fast.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm sorry.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
Sometimes the person was thought too fast, he didn't pay his head for it.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
That's correct, yes sir.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Sometimes it's a rare occasion, but it just does happen.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Well, that time on the track is different for anything on the cell phone.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
What you say is that the best of your ability, you think on everything that's there on phone time.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
That's correct.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Yes sir.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Often I dial in, that's the greeting of the beginning of the conversation.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
It's pretty easy to tell when a man starts the business of his phone call.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
There may be a few social remarks about dinner or something of that sort, surely social.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
And then often in a phone call a man will say, I need to bother you, but.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
And then I know whatever the person is.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't bother you.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Any time, anything?

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
I've been doing great things, nothing to do here, nothing to see, nothing to do.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Very good.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
It's a lot of money for everything.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
Well, I have only this in the space, and I think we're at a cost where it's sold in this case.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I was not sure.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
But I finished dinner, sir, please.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
We have to get to finish with a quest thing before we go to the station.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I thought I was asked for comments.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Do you ask for comments?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You ask for, you ask for the question.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
You ask the way.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I have no further questions.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
You may speak to a minor board here in the evening, sir.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
You may speak to a point of order today.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
The point is that I have to go to the station.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I have to go to the station.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I wish to speak to a point of order today.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
The point is that I think we're at a cost road in this case.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
I am not a lawyer without experience.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
I have dealt with hundreds of telephone calls.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
And never in my life have I seen one offered in a car room in which I had more confidence

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
as it was some fee-divercy than I had in this one.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I don't know if you had ten minutes.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
Mr. Lucas, when I got stuck in the last time, I believe the question.

29:32.000 --> 29:40.000
First of all, how many conversations that you have transcribed in this matter of the promotion of shame?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I am not sure, sir.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
I would say, or 50 or 100 telephone conversations were transcribed.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
I might have just some remarked about it.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
How are you doing with Senator McCarthy or something of that sort with a, I'm really minor.

30:04.000 --> 30:11.000
That's the total number of conversations that have any mention of your self-senator

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
or your staff or your committee or anything in connection with it.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
In other words, when I stand, you transcribed all conversations.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
There's like a mixture of mentions, you know, the work of the committee,

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
myself or the staff and that number of 15 or 15 hundred.

30:30.000 --> 30:38.000
That's my guess, sir. I just don't know how many there were, but I transcribed maybe a factor of that high.

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
I'm not trying to pin you down to that number. I know it's impossible for you to give us the accurate number of the number.

30:44.000 --> 30:55.000
Let me answer this. How many conversations were there between the secretary or Mr. Adams and other members of this committee?

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
I thought we called for, which of any idea how many?

30:59.000 --> 31:07.000
No, sir. Were there locations on which was the Adams or Mr. Steven Cole,

31:07.000 --> 31:18.000
or members of the committee in regard to the wisdom or the possibility of falling off the investigation of communism in military establishment?

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Item.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I'm asking a mess from the political professor.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I don't understand the question, sir.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
The North quarter read the question to the US.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
you
