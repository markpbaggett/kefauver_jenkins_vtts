00:00.000 --> 00:05.560
Occasionally, the fall witch, Mr. Adams, Mr. Stevens, called other members of the committee

00:05.560 --> 00:09.760
in regard to the wisdom of the possibility of college and off the investigation of communism

00:09.760 --> 00:10.760
and military establishment.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.760
I don't recall any first.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.600
No, you were going with Mr. Stevens with absence for some time, was over in the audience.

00:20.600 --> 00:28.680
During that time, Mr. Adams was making phone calls to senators in regard to the investigation.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.980
I was knowing that about that theory with the office, it's not in the same room with

00:32.980 --> 00:38.280
the secretary and I don't handle his phone calls unless he happens to be up in the secretary's office.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.280
I don't recall the...

00:42.280 --> 00:44.280
You didn't have to come.

00:44.280 --> 00:51.280
During the period when he was absent, when the secretary was open to party, I don't recall any first.

00:52.280 --> 00:58.280
Now, who in the time's bad leads the conversation really together?

00:58.280 --> 01:12.280
I feel like I gave a leader to Colonel Polaroor, Colonel Wood in our office.

01:12.280 --> 01:16.280
And then we kind of approached with him with some contrast.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.280
I'm not sure I'd say one, two, or three.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.280
They worked many, sir.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.280
Do you have a penchant for those in relation with you?

01:30.280 --> 01:32.280
I don't know, sir.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
No.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.280
That's how it really makes you a chief.

01:35.280 --> 01:40.280
Other words, let's say that the secretary of Stephen Stalkman's was the religious...

01:40.280 --> 01:48.280
I'd like to know what I know, my colleague, Senator June, or Senator Hector, why six months ago.

01:49.280 --> 01:54.280
Do you have an index so you can go to your book and report back to the secretary.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.280
The date, time, the phone was when...

01:58.280 --> 02:04.280
I have two ways to locate a call.

02:04.280 --> 02:12.280
I've mentioned the little flip that I make with your chronological.

02:12.280 --> 02:19.280
I've stapled together my notes for things that I might have to refer to.

02:19.280 --> 02:23.280
One day, the staples pass.

02:23.280 --> 02:32.280
And then, at a later time, when I'm out of chance and I'm far behind right now,

02:32.280 --> 02:40.280
I'd go over these chronological notes that we've called here and simply the subject.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.280
And I've tied a post that on card.

02:44.280 --> 02:48.280
If an owner here, I think there might be a future reference to it.

02:48.280 --> 02:56.280
If it seems to be a minor call and an invitation to dinner or something, I wouldn't post it.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.280
Or you're on the card.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.280
I would have it in the exonerate summary.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.280
I'm between the winners of what type of that index you have.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.280
Do you have a card in the index?

03:06.280 --> 03:12.280
Yes, sir. 3, 5, 5 card index, which, as I say, is not even complete on all his phone time reservations.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.280
It is them. I'm the ones that I think he might...

03:15.280 --> 03:18.280
It's that's my point of reference.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.280
But when I was bringing the card, you could win the 30-year-old.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.280
Yes, you know.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.280
You haven't got the transcript.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.280
I don't have to realize.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.280
All the number of cases you can tell us any of the cards are missing.

03:30.280 --> 03:35.280
Not sure. They're constantly being added to it.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.280
Because the text will talk to the new people.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.280
I don't know if you got my question.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.280
But there was a text of the pecateria.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.280
2nd number of cases.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
The day of 20.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.280
You make a card and make the exact number of cases.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.280
Do you remember them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?

03:50.280 --> 03:51.280
No.

03:51.280 --> 03:55.280
So you've got no room room.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.280
The time has begun.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.280
Any other questions?

04:03.280 --> 04:06.280
I'll answer them.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.280
I'll answer them.

04:09.280 --> 04:16.280
Do you have any record of a phone call?

04:16.280 --> 04:17.280
I have a second.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.280
I answered them.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.280
You know that I have a record of a call.

04:20.280 --> 04:24.280
General Washington, do you have a second record?

04:24.280 --> 04:26.280
I don't know.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.280
I believe it's up there.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.280
May have thought the general lot.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.280
But I don't remember if this point my record is not here.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.280
You can't try that.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.280
I'm not sure.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.280
I don't have.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.280
The other phone call, telephone conversation,

04:42.280 --> 04:45.280
Mr. Cohen, and secretary Steve Luce,

04:45.280 --> 04:48.280
on the 27th of October.

04:48.280 --> 04:53.280
And I realize that you have to recall specific dates.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.280
That's the other phone call.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.280
I think I've got to recall it.

04:59.280 --> 05:05.280
I could recall it as calls and place them in an interior.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.280
There's a many little details.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.280
I don't believe I could recall that any kind of conversation

05:11.280 --> 05:14.280
had around a particular week will stay.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.280
I wouldn't know as far as time has concerned.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.280
Could you check your records?

05:20.280 --> 05:23.280
I'd like to ask you a question.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.280
I have a question.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.280
I'm sorry.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
I'm sorry.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.280
I agreed with those suggestions.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.280
Give us the number of calls.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.280
Mr. Cohen and secretary Steve Luce,

05:38.280 --> 05:40.280
we want to talk to the police.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.280
I have the conversation.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.280
Transparency.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.280
Yes, sir.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.280
I can show that.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.280
Mr. Cohen passed on the phone.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.280
I'm sure I must have passed.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.280
He passed during that photograph.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
Yes.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.280
I'll turn you down to the telephone.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.280
How many conversations are there?

06:01.280 --> 06:03.280
No, sir.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.280
I'll be giving the secretary a few minutes.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.280
I'm not sure.

06:16.280 --> 06:20.280
I believe I gave him to tell what are federal below.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.280
Who would have been a few of those?

06:24.280 --> 06:29.280
I believe on the first occasion.

06:29.280 --> 06:42.280
I knew that the secretary was with a remission from secretary of information.

06:42.280 --> 06:45.280
I believe in the case of Mr. Cohen.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.280
What would you recall?

06:46.280 --> 06:49.280
I have a phone call on me and my secretary Steve Luce.

06:49.280 --> 06:54.280
Two of Mr. Cohen left over 28 years ago.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.280
I believe on the other side of that.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.280
There was a conversation with Mr. Cohen

07:00.280 --> 07:03.280
but I don't recall the date.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.280
Mr. Steve Luce, we have the call.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.280
What was the pay?

07:11.280 --> 07:15.280
I believe on October 21st or October 28th.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.280
Mr. Cohen's on October 26th, why not send it to 28th?

07:18.280 --> 07:21.280
That's you, that's those.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.280
I believe that, yeah.

07:24.280 --> 07:29.280
On the matter of the day, we'll talk about the call and honestly conversation.

07:29.280 --> 07:35.280
We are really, for the thing that I know is until we decide whether to admit this one or not.

07:35.280 --> 07:41.280
If we're not willing to have a talk about that, there is this conversation

07:41.280 --> 07:46.280
that may be overwhelming, surprising, or showing other possible telephone conversations.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.280
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,

07:49.280 --> 07:54.280
do we have a phone call in the given, nothing right there, so that's good.

07:54.280 --> 08:00.280
Well, perhaps the conversations would not be partially admissible

08:00.280 --> 08:02.280
and would have to be excluded.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.280
Let both parties agree to it.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.280
I think that's correct in my hour.

08:08.280 --> 08:13.280
In part of the trans-pigment argument will be applied to the UK.

08:13.280 --> 08:21.280
If in what the both will lead to, decide whether or not we should admit a partial recording

08:21.280 --> 08:26.280
until I have some picture of the other conversation with Mr. Leigh.

08:26.280 --> 08:32.280
Mr. Chairman, I think it's of the utmost importance to have all of the conversations

08:32.280 --> 08:36.280
that are substantially active for him.

08:36.280 --> 08:40.280
Admittedly, I'm sure that we have all of these conversations.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.280
I think it'll be extremely easy.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.280
Now, I don't want to impose upon the claim of the committee, but this matter will brought up.

08:47.280 --> 08:53.280
I am just to see them to offer one particular conversation.

08:53.280 --> 09:05.280
There are some prior conversations which will seem to be certainly as important.

09:05.280 --> 09:12.280
It's not more so, and I would like to spend a few minutes on that if I may.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.280
The season's meeting is possible.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.280
Thank you, Bill.

09:20.280 --> 09:29.280
Do you know how many conversations there were between Secretary Stevens and other members of this subcommittee?

09:29.280 --> 09:35.280
In regards to Mr. Cohn or Mr. Leigh, Mr. Chairman.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.280
May I have a mind to commit?

09:37.280 --> 09:40.280
Is it being very of this time?

09:40.280 --> 09:43.280
It is for the...

09:43.280 --> 09:54.280
A recording, a transcription of this conversation between allegedly occurring between Senator McCrath and Mr. Stevens on November 7th.

09:54.280 --> 10:07.280
Now, this is a theory making an exploration of many other alleged recordings of monitoring of other alleged conversations.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.280
And it is objective to...

10:11.280 --> 10:14.280
Mr. Cohn, may I start at the...

10:14.280 --> 10:16.280
...and I think you can have a final slide.

10:16.280 --> 10:25.280
Mr. Cohn, may I start at if you want to restrict the interrogation of this witness of this claim to one particular conversation, one girl,

10:25.280 --> 10:31.280
...to all those men who are afraid to have a witness, it can be a very valued arithmetic.

10:32.280 --> 10:42.280
The telephone conversation between Mr. Stevens and the member of this subcommittee and other individuals of this subcommittee, I will answer this question.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.280
You will be able to hold a correct conversation.

10:45.280 --> 10:50.280
It is the sure field that we are going to take this piece to you.

10:50.280 --> 10:58.280
And this time, when you have a one conversation following back later about all of the other conversations, I have got no objection to that.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.280
Very soon, we will wait for you to move to the next.

11:02.280 --> 11:11.280
A very long and expensive day that he is not sending requests to send you from reclining to reply to a question at this time as to whether or not he would...

11:12.280 --> 11:17.280
...and it is the same as the other conversations that we have been discussing.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.280
I am also...

11:19.280 --> 11:22.280
...and I am staying in the assembly of the committee here from Council.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.280
I make a kind of a really downed response, which is all of the same time.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.280
This is what I have heard from Mr. Cohn, that is...

11:28.280 --> 11:30.280
...it is all from that little slide.

11:30.280 --> 11:34.280
A particular matter of the conversation is to be brought into evidence.

11:34.280 --> 11:42.280
The same moving and the same circumstances will apply to all of the minor discussions of current investigation.

11:42.280 --> 11:51.280
More than usual, I think the right person is found now as many people in regard to a private meeting which should be in one person.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.280
But I didn't suggest these hearings.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.280
Now, this is what this is.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.280
Does have information.

11:58.280 --> 12:03.280
If you want to know that, information regarding conversation with Mr. Cohn.

12:04.280 --> 12:09.280
And members of this committee, although members of this committee, I am now Mr. Cohn.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.280
If you believe, not questioning him.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.280
I am just...

12:12.280 --> 12:15.280
...particularly conversation with myself and the obfits.

12:15.280 --> 12:21.280
I am trying to find out what information he has, which might change some way to understand investigation.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.280
But if you have nothing to miss, go to him in a way.

12:23.280 --> 12:27.280
And I think it will be a great mistake to deny that he's trying to address this Council.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.280
So, right to find out.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.280
Just for this human hand world knows.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.280
And we do have to get through.

12:35.280 --> 12:39.280
I would like to suggest to the Chair and the Council that they submit.

12:39.280 --> 12:46.280
All of the original notes from the dates about the investigation of coming with them.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.280
The middle of the investigation began.

12:48.280 --> 12:52.280
And after the Chair, that is the move of the middle of the meeting.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.280
I think that's probably the purpose of it.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.280
Glory to the lift-pishing ramp.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.280
And the greenstone of the middle.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.280
All these missions began.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.280
Now, what those notes will show I think they don't know.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.280
That's why I've got to look at them.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.280
So, I think it's a little bit more.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.280
And it looks like same.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.280
But the green one brings a good hit to time.

13:13.280 --> 13:14.280
Cheers.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.280
Let's try out all the patterns of the board.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.280
The right hand is on the left of our ears.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.280
I think it's an excellent idea.

13:19.280 --> 13:24.280
All notes that relate to conversations.

13:24.280 --> 13:28.280
On this side of this controversy ought to be speaking.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.280
And made available to the committee.

13:30.280 --> 13:38.280
That would include the member and previously related to the press by the committee and staff.

13:38.280 --> 13:47.280
I think that all notes relating to telephone conversation by all of the principals and parties of this controversy ought to be speaking.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.280
And I think that's the period of the same time.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.280
I make a flexible idea.

13:50.280 --> 13:55.280
This challenge could I come in on the roll or not be the roll to write the army more?

13:55.280 --> 13:59.280
Let's make a good phrase that telephone conversation available.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.280
So, let's just turn them in.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.280
Let's just turn them in.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.280
I don't think the richer roll can fix the army any more than I can.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.280
So, I think it's a picture here, because I need to plan.

14:09.280 --> 14:13.280
So, I have to learn the ethnic background, because I think the army just as much as you do.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.280
I'm trying to fix more.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.280
Now, I'm not trying to speak for the army today.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.280
Let's speak for your plan.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.280
Let's move to the army.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.280
Oh, I have to tell you the family.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.280
Get this area out there.

14:25.280 --> 14:29.280
I have to tell you the entire area is left.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.280
We're not pursued as invagations of other this time.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.280
I will abide by the learning of the care of the security of the army.

14:37.280 --> 14:42.280
I just think that it's one important lesson of the legion out.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.280
That is it.

14:43.280 --> 14:49.280
Do you think the government expects the army mechanical development in the Pentagon?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.280
I don't know about the Pentagon, sir.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.280
I don't have any mechanical devices.

14:53.280 --> 15:01.280
Well, do you know, or did any reason please, that the government has taken the army mechanical devices anywhere in the Pentagon?

15:01.280 --> 15:05.280
I just tell no to have your heard me say where?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.280
I haven't heard anything on the subject.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.280
I understand the narrative has been issued.

15:10.280 --> 15:16.280
It's recently that no mechanical recording shall be made issued by the Secretary of the Pentagon.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.280
The plan I don't know whether they're having mechanical recordings.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.280
That's correct.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.280
I wouldn't say so.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.280
I just tell no.

15:22.280 --> 15:30.280
I've never seen any mechanical recordings made except I believe in one which I don't know what they had in the field of this case or not.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.280
But it wasn't the Secretary of Time for stations.

15:33.280 --> 15:44.280
And I suppose whoever had it made as a permission of the chairman of the other end of the line, but others on that I do not know anything about the vehicle recording support conversations.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.280
The man has the gimmick spike.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.280
That's the time I could use the...

15:49.280 --> 15:50.280
Yes, the account.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.280
I'd like to use the customer's information on me.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.280
I believe he has the right of well to create some kind of tool of tools.

15:57.280 --> 16:01.280
Mr. Wilson, about the immissibility of the United States.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.280
Mr. Chairman.

16:03.280 --> 16:16.280
Mr. Chairman, is my understanding of this plan that Mr. Wilson should have already received and Mr. Audem is against all of the monitors recording transcriptions.

16:17.280 --> 16:35.280
Mr. Arming, which Mr. Thuvens or Mr. Adams has maybe admitted in evidence, provided that the committee headed by Senator Matradi makes the same agreement with respect to any recordings or monitors conversations that he has.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.280
Is that correct?

16:38.280 --> 16:40.280
Do I even correct in only one respect, sir?

16:40.280 --> 16:44.280
I understand that I am retained by the United States Army.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.280
We're not only the two out of the two states, the other degrees.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.280
Not argue that point, in order to shorten time.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.280
May I ask the senator from which council?

16:52.280 --> 16:56.280
Do you or do you or not give you to that position, Senator MacIty?

16:56.280 --> 17:00.280
Mr. Dinkham, I am very sure that...

17:00.280 --> 17:02.280
I am not questioning this witness.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.280
Mr. President, what information is this?

17:05.280 --> 17:09.280
He has thought about a bullet box, an anonymous bullet box, and a picture of Victor von.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.280
And then what is?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.280
He has thought that it was interesting.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.280
I don't know what to remember, but it is an example.

17:14.280 --> 17:19.280
Then Mr. Chairman, Mr. President, I am not going to point it in any way.

17:19.280 --> 17:27.280
Mr. Chairman, in due of the fact that he is admitted that this plan is scripted...

17:27.280 --> 17:35.280
...of this telephone conversation of November 7th is not full and complete and accurate and correct.

17:35.280 --> 17:40.280
It is still my opinion that the transcription itself should not be admitted in evidence.

17:40.280 --> 17:47.280
However, it is not my opinion in due of additional information elicited from this witness...

17:47.280 --> 17:50.280
...since I have been in my original opinion.

17:50.280 --> 17:58.280
That this witness, who allegedly and mentally and on that telephone conversation may testify now...

17:58.280 --> 18:10.280
...has to that conversation allegedly occurring between the committee chairman and Mr. Chairman and that he may use the note...

18:10.280 --> 18:18.280
...which he took at that time for the purpose and the purpose of refreshing his recollection...

18:18.280 --> 18:26.280
...and with the further statement of this committee that the objections raised with respect to it...

18:26.280 --> 18:32.280
...not being technically accurate in every respect both to the ways of the testimony...

18:32.280 --> 18:35.280
...or others and to its admissibility.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.280
Mr. Chairman.

18:36.280 --> 18:41.280
And then, Mr. Chairman, may I complete my actual examination of this?

18:41.280 --> 18:44.280
Before I let you make any discussion, Mr. Oderna.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.280
I will turn it into a comment.

18:47.280 --> 18:51.280
Use up to 10 minutes and maybe questions by other members of the committee of Mr. Oderna.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.280
Mr. Chairman, let me go.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.280
One step further, please.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.280
In order to be technically correct.

18:57.280 --> 19:02.280
It still should not be admitted because it is a monitored report...

19:02.280 --> 19:06.280
...that is, the testimony of this witness should not be given.

19:06.280 --> 19:10.280
A body is refreshing his recollections from the notes since it's a monitored report...

19:10.280 --> 19:15.280
...without the consent given in this open hearing by some of the McCarthy.

19:15.280 --> 19:21.280
We feel the statute pertaining to such monitored conversation.

19:21.280 --> 19:26.280
Very long now, before we do only point to order...

19:26.280 --> 19:29.280
...we have the witness before it, that there are other questions.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.280
Councilor Mr. Oderna, I have none.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.280
I have none.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.280
Well, Mr. Chairman, I have none.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.280
That's more than a water.

19:39.280 --> 19:43.280
I wonder whether we are going to take his testimony or not going to take it.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.280
We are on my request.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
All right.

19:46.280 --> 19:50.280
You're going to keep him in the witness table as the news.

19:50.280 --> 19:55.280
Just standing in this legal situation, there's technical issues.

19:55.280 --> 19:59.280
If the building is encountered, it's a very testimony.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.280
Absolutely. There's one of people that will understand.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.280
I'd rather let that seem any question.

20:03.280 --> 20:08.280
Senator McCullough, we cannot have this witness...

20:08.280 --> 20:11.280
...about the monitored telephone conversation...

20:11.280 --> 20:17.280
...without the consent of Senator McCullough in view of the statute applicable to...

20:17.280 --> 20:20.280
I may say, Senator, I'm simply with over and question...

20:20.280 --> 20:24.280
...since we're the expedite these hearings and the Aniston...

20:24.280 --> 20:28.280
...getting on to what we can take this afternoon.

20:28.280 --> 20:32.280
If we're going here, I would like to ask you many questions...

20:32.280 --> 20:36.280
...about many other conversations that get the correct number...

20:36.280 --> 20:40.280
...that he has monitored, whether he has it, whether they're available...

20:40.280 --> 20:43.280
...or they can be made available to the committee.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.280
Chancellor, please do as far as you admit, one time ago...

20:47.280 --> 20:52.280
...what they're ruling on the request for the commission...

20:52.280 --> 20:55.280
...to the committee of all the classified notes...

20:55.280 --> 20:58.280
...and the short-hand vote...

20:58.280 --> 21:01.280
...and all the parties to the controversy.

21:01.280 --> 21:06.280
I'm just as uncomfortable as I am as to get missability of such evidence...

21:06.280 --> 21:09.280
...from the standpoint of its legality...

21:09.280 --> 21:12.280
...would defend upon the willingness of the committee...

21:12.280 --> 21:14.280
...not assuming that they're monitored.

21:14.280 --> 21:18.280
If they're not monitored, then of course...

21:18.280 --> 21:22.280
...any transcription may just...

21:22.280 --> 21:28.280
...of that conversation that has a party who receives it directly.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.280
In order to make a record of it, within my opinion...

21:31.280 --> 21:36.280
...the admissible testimony is not a monitor, it's messy.

21:36.280 --> 21:41.280
Let's count. I'm not raising the question of missability.

21:41.280 --> 21:45.280
I am merely pursuing the request originally made...

21:45.280 --> 21:50.280
...that the Army funny, all of the short-hand notes...

21:50.280 --> 21:53.280
...and the time-side notes and conversations...

21:53.280 --> 21:56.280
...and the other principles too, they talk diversity and new life law.

21:56.280 --> 21:59.280
Do you mean permanent managers, permanent, they show monetary...

21:59.280 --> 22:02.280
...I mean to the committee that was the request originally made...

22:02.280 --> 22:05.280
...by Senator McCarthy?

22:05.280 --> 22:10.280
Of course, low matters will be requested by your...

22:10.280 --> 22:15.280
...adjection. I assume that we have the right to have those...

22:15.280 --> 22:19.280
...no transcriptions.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.280
But that does not go to the question of whether they're going to be...

22:22.280 --> 22:24.280
...admitted in testimony.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.280
It merely goes to our right to have the information...

22:26.280 --> 22:29.280
...as each witness is presented.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.280
It is proper for this committee to inquire about witness...

22:32.280 --> 22:36.280
...not most he has made, what's memorandum he has made...

22:36.280 --> 22:40.280
...and to have those introduced by that witness...

22:40.280 --> 22:43.280
...assuming that they are competent and relevant.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.280
Well, the extractors are at this point. The Army is free...

22:45.280 --> 22:48.280
...and I understand it to submit this information to the committee.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.280
But if I have an idea, it is correct.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.280
You find that he has earned one more moment Mr. Chairman.

22:54.280 --> 22:58.280
Well, this telephone conversation of November 7...

22:58.280 --> 23:03.280
...can go to the committee this afternoon on either one or two days.

23:03.280 --> 23:08.280
If Senator McCarthy were consensuous this mission, it goes in.

23:08.280 --> 23:12.280
If this committee by majority votes, those you wish to hear...

23:12.280 --> 23:15.280
...is otherwise this witness that he must testify to.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.280
So you may have it on either basis.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.280
Senator McCarthy, one more story.

23:20.280 --> 23:25.280
If you will consent, this committee has to come out here today.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.280
If you do not consent in the committee votes...

23:28.280 --> 23:30.280
...that my witness is testified to.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.280
This committee on the country will hear us today.

23:33.280 --> 23:36.280
Mr. Wilson, I think that Mr. Moon's answer to the Chairman of the committee.

23:36.280 --> 23:39.280
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.280
Mr. Newton, we have to get this.

23:42.280 --> 23:48.280
I think the most important matter here, the most full of matters...

23:48.280 --> 23:51.280
...year, during which time we're investigating...

23:51.280 --> 23:53.280
...conviction, translation, military.

23:53.280 --> 23:57.280
Most telephone conversations would be a great benefit to the committee.

23:57.280 --> 24:02.280
I agree with the council, Mr. Jenkins, that...

24:02.280 --> 24:06.280
...the taking of the notice is illegal.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.280
And therefore, it normally would not be admissible.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.280
I would like to call the council the attention to the fact that...

24:12.280 --> 24:17.280
...I'm investigating that committee is not bound by the usual rules of the government.

24:21.280 --> 24:26.280
Senator McCarthy, the council invite Mr. Chair, he did not say taking the notice was illegal...

24:26.280 --> 24:29.280
...but it might be illegal to admit that.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.280
Let me say that.

24:30.280 --> 24:34.280
As the chairman of the rules, the government before committee...

24:34.280 --> 24:37.280
...are considerably different from before court.

24:38.280 --> 24:43.280
I think that, regardless of how proper or improper it might have been...

24:43.280 --> 24:46.280
...to monitor the telephone conversations.

24:46.280 --> 24:51.280
I do think the committee should get all of the telephone conversations.

24:51.280 --> 24:56.280
Over the past year, having to do with its subject, even remotely...

24:56.280 --> 25:00.280
...I think the telephone conversations should be examined by the council.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.280
And the one Mr. Jenkins considers...

25:03.280 --> 25:06.280
...a potent testimony.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.280
Otherwise, it should be put in the record.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.280
I get nothing further to say at this time.

25:10.280 --> 25:14.280
Mr. Chairman, may I make some other remarks?

25:14.280 --> 25:19.280
In order to clarify the matter now under consideration by the committee...

25:19.280 --> 25:26.280
...it is not the violation of the law to monitor a telephone conversation...

25:26.280 --> 25:29.280
...send in interstate commerce.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.280
It is only a violation of the law...

25:32.280 --> 25:37.280
...for the party at the other end of the line...

25:37.280 --> 25:44.280
...to whom it is sent to by force that without the consent of the sender...

25:44.280 --> 25:47.280
...I say to this committee...

25:47.280 --> 25:52.280
...that's the only way such a telephone monitor telephone conversation...

25:52.280 --> 25:57.280
...may be proven legally without this committee running a foul of the law...

25:57.280 --> 26:01.280
...and taking the chances of getting in jail...

26:01.280 --> 26:05.280
...with three persons in the party to a fee...

26:05.280 --> 26:08.280
...that it might be was anything evident.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.280
No, I'm not a judge.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.280
As stated, that he will permit it to go in...

26:13.280 --> 26:16.280
...either by Senator McCrath and Mr. Smith...

26:16.280 --> 26:19.280
...which would make it perfectly legal...

26:19.280 --> 26:24.280
...or upon a vote of this committee to receive it...

26:24.280 --> 26:30.280
...which, in my mind, simply means that Mr. Warch is willing to take good change...

26:30.280 --> 26:35.280
...of it being admitted if this committee will assume responsibility by...

26:35.280 --> 26:40.280
...but as a committee committee, I say this was obtained by Mr. McCrath's consent...

26:40.280 --> 26:45.280
...you violate the law, and if you admit in evidence...

26:45.280 --> 26:48.280
...but monitor a telephone conversation.

26:48.280 --> 26:54.280
I have no question about some from a private position.

26:54.280 --> 26:59.280
I want all telephone conversations...

26:59.280 --> 27:03.280
...having to do with this great promotion of shame...

27:03.280 --> 27:08.280
...and the controversy of an Adam's and a Cone of myself, anyone who would admit military...

27:08.280 --> 27:11.280
...I want them all made public right there.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.280
I want a no-circum-sense.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.280
Hello, Mr. Warch.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.280
You select one monitor telephone conversation...

27:19.280 --> 27:21.280
...out of a hundred quchice as we have...

27:21.280 --> 27:23.280
...and offer to put that in the record.

27:23.280 --> 27:27.280
That would be about a tylingon file for anything I have ever heard of before any committee.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.280
I want them all out.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.280
I want this whole picture laid clear on the table.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.280
I want everything involved to even, to anyone in the military, to do any counter.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.280
I want anyone in the administration, to anyone else.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.280
Your guidance and notification made a part of the record...

27:41.280 --> 27:45.280
...and I will not consent to put in isolated pieces one letter out of a hundred.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.280
Let's make that perfectly clear this time.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.280
You can terminate by the end of the day.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.280
The entire fire now in perfect agreement.

27:52.280 --> 27:57.280
They will all be made available, but they can only actually go in evidence...

27:57.280 --> 27:58.280
...one of the times.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.280
So I suggest we now take the one we've got here.

28:01.280 --> 28:09.280
Well, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I move that the committee accepts the agreement...

28:09.280 --> 28:11.280
...and the chairman stops the discussion.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.280
Mr. Chairman, there's proper work here.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.280
And now, rule that they shall hold in the record.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.280
I expect that.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.280
And all of the same time, I assume.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.280
All of it is passed by all.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.280
Move your seconds.

28:21.280 --> 28:27.280
All that they have pertaining to this concept, first of all, in any way, directly or indirectly.

28:27.280 --> 28:30.280
I assume that includes all parties.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.280
All parties.

28:31.280 --> 28:34.280
May I ask the... may I ask the senator made a motion?

28:34.280 --> 28:35.280
Yes.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.280
As a motion, assume that they will all be put in at the same time.

28:38.280 --> 28:43.280
I don't know how you can do that if you can figure out a statistical way to do it, I agree.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.280
Well, well, let's look.

28:45.280 --> 28:49.280
Now, let me show this. I don't know what... I don't know what's in this.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.280
I don't see this.

28:50.280 --> 28:52.280
You all know what I have to do.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
Let's get them in the record.

28:53.280 --> 28:57.280
The point of order, Mr. Chairman, you may not say I don't know what's in this...

28:57.280 --> 28:59.280
...incomplete conversation.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.280
The regard of following complete is my B.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.280
I am willing to have upgiving the record here.

29:04.280 --> 29:07.280
All of the conversation is going to the same time.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.280
Mr. Chairman, I think it's a very clear...

29:09.280 --> 29:11.280
Right to share on that point.

29:11.280 --> 29:17.280
Motion is very clear that all of the monocity conversations dealing with the point raised by the senator from Wisconsin

29:17.280 --> 29:21.280
are included in the motion made by the senator from Arkansas as a chair in the census.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.280
That's right.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.280
Oh, I have a second.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.280
No exclusions.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.280
But the ball in and let the ball...

29:26.280 --> 29:29.280
Any ways of asking what birthday thank you is relevant.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.280
What party is here relevant?

29:31.280 --> 29:36.280
The point of order, Mr. Chairman, is the senator from Arkansas, a man named his motion to say that they've been in front of Roger Glowder.

29:36.280 --> 29:40.280
Mr. Chairman, I have a question.

29:40.280 --> 29:48.280
Mr. Chairman, would you amend the motion to say that these conversations be put in the in front of Roger Glowder?

29:48.280 --> 29:50.280
Yes, I have no objection to that.

29:50.280 --> 29:54.280
As the parties will agree that I just want to get them all in the record.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.280
The amendment will be able to reflect on that.

29:56.280 --> 30:02.280
And do I understand that you will include the short-hand notebooks...

30:02.280 --> 30:08.280
So I'm wichstly short-hand remarks are transcribed and this will include...

30:08.280 --> 30:11.280
This request applies to all of the principals for this controversy.

30:11.280 --> 30:12.280
That's correct, then.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.280
Both sides.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.280
That's Cameron.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.280
May I point out one thing that's different than it was.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.280
Is that an amendment to be moved to the men's thickness of motion?

30:20.280 --> 30:23.280
That amendment is not available in me.

30:23.280 --> 30:27.280
Mr. Chairman, do you want to speak to your employees as opposed to a blind order?

30:27.280 --> 30:36.280
I think that these three essential for the record that we have similar as that from Mr. Cohen and Mr. Cobb, paralleling the extent of the senator.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.280
We should have their consent as well.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.280
Is it your position, Mr. Chairman, if I may?

30:40.280 --> 30:44.280
And your position that the University of Consent has everyone who has called,

30:44.280 --> 30:47.280
or would just even call that...

30:47.280 --> 30:50.280
Senator, Mr. Senator, why are Senator Z?

30:50.280 --> 30:53.280
If he called, there are ten people somewhere else in the hill.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.280
Is it your position that you will withhold those telephone conversations,

30:57.280 --> 31:01.280
unless we can induce those people to consent to them for the indirection?

31:01.280 --> 31:04.280
I will not force all of the stopping, sir.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.280
I don't need the appointed lawyer, Mr. Ray, to the motion.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.280
His Ray is the admissibility of the other.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.280
The motion is fair to the committee.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.280
It's secure all of the seven.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.280
And the matter of the admissibility, you might have to get the consent.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.280
So I understand that this will also...

31:20.280 --> 31:26.280
Some testimony was made by Mr. Lucas in connection with the indexing

31:26.280 --> 31:30.280
and the certain descriptive index titles he made.

31:30.280 --> 31:36.280
I think that ought to be included in all memoranda to all the principles that it's controversial,

31:36.280 --> 31:39.280
relating to telephone conversations.

31:39.280 --> 31:44.280
I think that some of it may be in memoranda form, memorandum,

31:44.280 --> 31:48.280
and part of it may be a verbatim transcript.

31:48.280 --> 31:52.280
And it's right to justice the word all of the mighty inclusive term,

31:52.280 --> 31:54.280
and that was the word employed by the standard marchinist.

31:54.280 --> 31:58.280
If you have a mind, then I'll first talk to you about the straff of faith

31:58.280 --> 32:01.280
relating to any telephone conversation.
