WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
So I did a prior, or at a later date.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
He mentioned security problems in the airport.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
So my correct?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Yes, sir, the Navy, sir.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
And the Navy?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Yes, sir.

00:17.000 --> 00:29.000
So as a result of this meeting, on the bumper flip.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
You, on the roof, testify, what security.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
And Mr. Adams is not so.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
He just needs to look to you and to the sun.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Whether you've watched through the airport, the Navy, and the problem depends.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I would say that's a substantial statement.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
If you heard the testimony of both Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams,

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
but they do not, I did say that they have a suggestion.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
I heard that you have to be careful to pop them in the fence.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
And I heard what they said, sir.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Somebody not don't do.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Somebody is certainly mistaken, sir.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
It's not us.

01:21.000 --> 01:33.000
When we, the memorandum of November, November the 17th,

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
while that a memorandum with you prepared, I believe I did.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Now that referred to a meeting of his health, a Martin Club in New York,

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
attended by Mr. Staden, Mr. Adams, Mr. Carl, Senator New York, sir.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Yes, sir.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
That was me.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
You were parked, you memorandum.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
But it's like there again.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
I asked you exactly the airport from the Navy.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
I spoke to the President of the York memorandum.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
At this meeting, Steven began saying,

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
he worked to resolve the conjecture of the airport from Navy

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
and the personnel employed directly by the Phantom Service.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
The service of continuing to Army here, he did sir.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
Now is this taken up made in the SNR manner as the statement of Mr. Staden's office?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes, sir.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
There was a discussion about that, I think, about the general situation during lunch.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Then, as we were leaving the room, we ate in one room,

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
and then we went across the hall to another room to, that was the yet,

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
and on the Harry Dexter White hearing, for on television and Mr. Brown,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
how, and Director Hoover, it's testify.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Mr. Steven's out of television set brought up, and we went into the next room.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I recall that we were leaving the room.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
Mr. Steven, I think, in the hearing, some people slept in the McCarthy at the door,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
and that the committee couldn't just drop this on the investigation for a while,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
and going to the Navy and the Air Force, and that the fence to pop in the mouthware,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
and let the Army along for a while.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Here, you're kept following to this one under old.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
I am, you heard, Professor Mooney, of Mr. Staden's and Mr. Adams,

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
and they denied that they made it request, so once again,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
for a clear fence committee,

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Professor, somebody at Certainly Mistaken, and once again sir, I am not.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
And you have the number of them from yourself,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
and send them across the other side of the night.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes sir, I'm familiar with that.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
And that's the number of them you've faced here.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
John Adams said today that, all enough the idea,

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
about investigating the Air Force, he got specific information for us about the Air Force base,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
but there was a large number of them in the section.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
He said they would trade out that information,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
if we were telling what the next Army project was,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
that we would investigate.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
Now you, we testify that that memorandum is a bank.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Yes sir.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
And that, Mr. Adams offered to trade you information on the Air Force,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
if you would lay off the Army,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
and let the insides of that so-called map incident send the front.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
That's right.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
And you heard Mr. Adams testify,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I could send that map incident,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
yes sir, he gives a different version of it.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
That's all I have, Mr. Jones.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a,

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
just a brief statement before asking some questions.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Total time in the hearings,

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
the reference has been made to the fact that the Democrats left the committee,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
and were asked for, we have sent ourselves.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I just want to say that whenever,

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
let's throw it up again, I shall give the fact

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
to the American public why we left.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I think we'll say a lot of time if we don't do it again,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
but I'm going to make a free statement now,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
so that the American public will fully understand why we left.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
The Democrats left the committee last July for a very good and valid reason.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
The Senator McClellan stated, we oppose one-man rule.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
We oppose the principle of delegating the chairman,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
full and final authority to hire and fire staff personnel.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That's a reason,

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
for our leaving can best be demonstrated

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
by the change in the rules

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
that was made when we returned in January.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
And may I say also to the American public,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
and so that the public will fully understand

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
that the matters we're now investigating all occurred,

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
as a matter of fact, they started a day or two after we left the committee

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
and continued during our absence.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And so, apparently,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
there must have been a good and sound reason for our leaving.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I think if we have been on the committee,

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
we might not now be spending a lot of time investigating that,

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
which is taking the time of this committee.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
I think we might well say that when the rules were changed,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
we were not advised,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
at least I was not advised,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
or what was going to face this.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
To be patient for a moment,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I think we might complain of entrapment,

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
because we had no knowledge

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
that we were going to be subjected

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
to a long, long hearing when we went back on the committee.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
The time the rules were changed to give to the committee

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
the full authority,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
members of the committee,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
on the hiring and firing staff personnel.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Mr. Cohn,

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
you have stated that the committee is being tied up on the investigation

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
of these communists and the defense plan.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
That's one of the important matters.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
And that's one of the key important matters I think it is.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Well, now let me ask you this.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
These people are working in defense plans,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
and you mean private industry

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
that are doing work for the government?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yes sir.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
We have as a head of the defense establishment,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Mr. Charles Wilson.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yes sir.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
That's correct?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yes sir.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Now if we have 135 communists working in defense plans,

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
wouldn't it be found to send all the mains to Mr. Charles Wilson immediately?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And put him on the spot

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
and ask for these people to be dealt with according to my opinion,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
turn of persons.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It's only an opinion no sir.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Well why do you say no?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Well sir, if you just take the correct case,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
as an example,

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
or we've gotten this double clock in long delay over a long period of time,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
we've got no results, no action of people who cover them up,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
the people who promoted the decision.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
You think Mr. Charles Wilson,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
the former head of general voters,

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
would want to cover up communist working in private industry?

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Sure, I'm sure Mr. Charles Wilson will not want to cover up any communists there,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
because that's not a practical matter.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Son of a jack from URS,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
give me how I thought we could get results on this.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I think the way we can get results on this,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
or is the way we've been getting results on this and the pit.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
And that is by holding first executive sessions,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
and then public hearings,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
when the employees and these defense plans,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
having been named as communists,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
in both the Fifth Amendment,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
most of the responsible think companies in this country,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
have adopted a rule that,

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
after both Fifth Amendment claims are made,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
by people currently working in defense plans,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
these companies will fire.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
So, Fifth Amendment communists.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
That rule has been adopted by General Electric,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
as a result of the work of this committee,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
by the International Telephone and Telegraph Company,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
and by other companies.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
The way to get the results there,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
by hearing, get these people in public sessions,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
have them claim that the Fifth Amendment,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
have the witnesses named them as communists,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
have them fire from the defense plan.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't think Mr. Wilson is a matter of fact,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
that's the power to fire them from the Fifth Amendment.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
You see, he doesn't have the power to fire,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
if I don't believe that he does.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Well, Mr. Cohen, wouldn't this be putting him on the spot

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
if you sent him a list of names of people

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
who are alleged to be communists,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
and then he did nothing about it?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, sir, because I imagine the reply

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
that we would get would be,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
these people do not work for the United States government

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
as such.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
They work for defense plans, which do subcontracts work,

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
you work for the United States government.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
Therefore, we don't have the jurisdiction to hire or fire the people.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
All right, let me just finish this,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
and I'll be glad to you for a complete question.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Well, Mr. Cohen,

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
what you mean to say is that you do not have enough faith

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
and this administration,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
that they will not do anything about removing these people

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
who are alleged to be communists?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
No, sir, I have not said that.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Well, Mr. Wilkblow, I mean, you say that Mr. Wilson

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
wouldn't do anything about it,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
or he would pass the box or do something like that.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Is that it?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
No, sir, I told you two things probably the most important

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
and the two is that the defense department itself does not have the power

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
to hire or fire these communists in defense plans.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
That can be done only by the private employers.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
They can not keep you in your letters and ask.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Why don't you, in your letter, you're anticipating all that,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
suggest Mr. Wilson,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
that you realize that there's no law dealing with it directly,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
but that he takes appropriate action because they're the...

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Well, when it's under you, would you, for a minute?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Well, it's not all the by time we're getting to be in the office.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Could you...

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
May I say to the senator,

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
if you want to have any information we have on the final transmit

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
that to Charlie Wilson,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I'll be glad to call a meeting of the committee

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
and take that up with the committee.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
We do have a science-able number of individuals who are currently

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
our communists working as a today in defense plans.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
It is not up to my chief counsel to make that decision

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
that it's the senator's morseling and wants us to transmit

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
that to the secretary of defense.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I frankly can see no objections to doing it,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
and I think we should take that up with a meeting of the committee,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
however, that's the sort of thing that can be held up

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
for this hearing you're holding today.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Well, Thunder, I'm just trying to get it to heartless,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I might say, and respond to your suggestions

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
and respond to your suggestions.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
We on the committee haven't yet received the 135 names that we asked for,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
so it's pretty hard for us to join in a trash middle

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
or something we don't know about transmitting.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Well, now, Mr. Thomas, one other...

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Uh, Mr. Schubert, I just...

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
May I say this?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Have we received them?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
May I say this?

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Uh, I will give you all the information at any time

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
that the members of this committee want to meet with me.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
I have refrained, wait a minute, I have refrained from calling a meeting

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
because I have felt you've been all trivipium is dead.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, may I say,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
a son or a month, may I have the attention?

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
May I say this, uh, if the members of this committee

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
care to meet with me at any time over the noon hour,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
in any evening, I'd be more than happy to give them a

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
uh, macro and picture of all of the

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
macro to work building up.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I would...

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I do not have time to order any special reports

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
made for the members of the committee because of the staff as they know.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Well, Mr. Collins, I take a thing you feel that, uh,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
by letter we wouldn't accomplish as much.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
May I suggest then that these names be turned over the generic committee,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
which could expose the 135 people.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
What if time is of the essence, what's the answer?

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Uh, I would say this, I have never undertaken before to

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
tell the gender committee what to do or what to investigate.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
At the time, this investigation came up,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I spoke with the chief counsel for the gender committee,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
and it was decided that they were their involvement

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
with other investigations with such that this investigation should

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
appropriately be taken up by this committee.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
We began it, sir.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
We're well into what we've had terrific results in it.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
We have actually gotten a lot of fifth amendment communists out of vital defense.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Well, I'm asking around about 135.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yes, sir.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
We're in the middle of it.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
We started the job, and if you're going to get another committee to start in at the very beginning

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
and go back again, there's probably going to be a lot of duplication and waste of time.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
And the last I heard the gender committee was busy on other things and could not undertake

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
this investigation.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Well, Mr. Collins, the staff is available.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
They're not the allegations made that we have these people who are not now being employed

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
or correction of the committee work.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Why not just turn the staff over and insist on them and expose them immediately?

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
If you say that exposure is the only way that we can remove these people because Mr. Wilson

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
won't do anything about it, who's ahead of the defense establishment and former head of general voters.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Should we send our agents out to serve it?

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
I think I said I don't think that Mr. Wilson has the power to do anything about it.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
These people work for the private industry.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
It is only their employers who can fire them, not Mr. Charles Wilson and the employers have adopted an arrangement

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
that they will not act against these people unless and until we hold these hearings

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
have witnesses testify naming these people as communists, give them a chance to be heard in their own defense

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
if they involve the amendment, they will then have certain rights.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
They will be suspended if they do not withdraw that system and then claim

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
that there are certain rights of time they will be discharged.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
I noticed in the newspaper two days ago that General Electric is just five, seven more people

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
from a defense plant as a result of hearing tell by this committee.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
Mr. Kong, I do believe that you stated that if it was sent to Mr. Wilson that it would be handled just like the first case,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
that's been the record.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
I assume therefore that you have no confidence in the Secretary of Defense doing anything about this.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Sorry if I gave that impression sir, I did not say that.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
I'm not a case that might not have any confidence in the Secretary of Defense.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I stand on what I said about the correct case sir.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
We have not gotten that information.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
We have never gotten it.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
We've asked for it for a period of time.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
On the practical problem here sir, the answer is to let this committee do its business and hold these hearings

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
and we can get those communists out of the defense plant very rapidly.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Well I thought you would say that it would be handled in the same way.

16:22.000 --> 16:29.000
Maybe I'm along the record tomorrow or later today I think we'll speak for itself.

16:29.000 --> 16:37.000
But your view is that the only way you're going to get any of these people out is to have a public hearing.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
There's no point in advising the head of the agency of their election in advance so that they can take speedy action.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
They can't say.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Well I'm not talking just about this case. How about matters where they're in the government?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Don't you think they ought to advise them at once?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Sir, I wouldn't want to talk in generality usually.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
What do you think these specifics are?

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
Last March when the two-in-a-quarter page FBI file, lifting 35 names came in.

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
Why wasn't the Secretary of the Army advised in writing forth with that he had 35 of the list subversives?

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
Under his jurisdiction working on highly important and secret radar work.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
First of all, after we received the information, that was the beginning for us.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
We had to check it out, we had to assemble facts and evidence to know whether the information was well-founded, whether we could suspend-chated.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Well, it was from the FBI.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
Sir, it was from the FBI but in the case of many of the individuals concerned, there was no derogatory information.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
In other cases there was derogatory information which we had to check out ourselves.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
We did that, we kept holding the case.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
The second reason, sir, is that the reason the information-

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Just before you get to the second reason, let me ask you this.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
Isn't that report? Isn't it states that Aaron Coleman was an FBI agent?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Is right in that FBI?

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
I understand, sir. I am not supposed to discuss the contents of that report here.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Well, I mean, I'm not asking anything.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
I haven't seen the document. Just a minute, Mr. Cohen. I haven't seen the document.

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm only giving that which was volunteered by people other than myself after hearing.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
And that was read into the record that he was an FBI agent.

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
And it was from the FBI. Why didn't you immediately advise Mr. Steven to have only been in office, I believe how long?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
A month and a half or two months.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
They had an FBI agent working in a highly secret radar laboratory.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
He was in a state-of-the-sphere.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
You may answer the question.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
The extended time is expected.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
I may expect an inadvertent statement that's under Jackson-made.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
I'm sure that inadvertent.

18:40.000 --> 18:47.000
He said this was from the FBI files. The testimony was that this was from Army Intelligence.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
That's the sworn testimony of myself under oath.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
And therefore, the Army had all the information which we had.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Well, let me say this. And if the Senator disagrees, we have got nothing from the FBI.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I didn't say that you got it from the FBI.

19:02.000 --> 19:13.000
The IDIDIS modified, reduced version of a report was one sent by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
to G2 of the Army with a copy to the Air Force.

19:18.000 --> 19:28.000
And if you can see the information that the FBI had obtained, it was an FBI report sent to the Department of the Army.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Am I wrong?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
You may answer the question.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Can I be answered?

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
You may answer. No, I would say you're right, sir. The Senator McCawtty's point was we did not obtain it from the FBI site.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Nor did I trade the truth of opinion from the FBI.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
We obtained it from the Army site.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
And if I may answer your question, as to why we did not communicate with the Army about that, I would do that, sir.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
The reason we did not communicate with them at that point.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
On air and coal, in particular.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yes, sir. On air and coal.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
The Spires members actually may answer the question. There's going to be no other question.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Yes, sir.

19:56.000 --> 20:12.000
The reason we did not communicate with the Army on air and coalmen in particular is that the gentleman who brought us the information told us that the people at the Army were well aware of the coalmen situation and of the other situations outlined in that memorandum.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
And that the spice effect they were well aware of it.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
They had not done anything about it and were not doing anything about it.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
And they did not do anything about it until its committee began its work.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
And that's right, sir.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
Mr. Caron, we started the roll call delayed and so we made complete this round of questions receiving our pass.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Very good.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
That is right, sir.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
That is right, sir.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Please tell us the yield we got twenty seconds to make unparalleled observations.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Any objections?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And being out in air, funny kind of.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
Mr. Caron, the unit of any instrumentality in our other government.

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
They have the solidities who issue a system of other than a committee of Congress or a court.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Most are by a court senate action.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
I assume you include a sprangery which means with the inaliment of a court.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
Most are, I know that with respect to Mr. Wilson.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
He is an administrative officer in government.

21:05.000 --> 21:12.000
He would have no authority to issue a subpoena and put not without the story certainly with respect to people.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Working in defense plans who are not in part of the government structure.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
That's right, sir.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
This job could be done by the committee and the committee alone.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It could not be done by Mr. Wilson.

21:21.000 --> 21:29.000
Mr. Caron, I must say I am quite surprised about the defense plan people.

21:29.000 --> 21:36.000
Now, you say that the Department of Defense has no authority to tell the people who are working in these plans to leave.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I do so.

21:37.000 --> 21:44.000
Well, during the before just before I came into the government, I was in private industry.

21:45.000 --> 21:51.000
And our plan was full of people from Air Force intelligence, Army intelligence, Navy intelligence.

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
And we not only worked close with the FBI, but actually their agents in my part, the world, my very good friends.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
We discussed everybody that we knew that there might be any problem with.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
If there was anybody they thought could get out, they'd gone out right away.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
As a security risk now, is all that blown up?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
No, we don't have any more of that now.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Most are perhaps the heads of some of the other businesses are not as diligent and not as you are.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
But the fact is that I don't have to look at the future.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I can look at the past few months.

22:22.000 --> 22:33.000
This committee has exposed a large number of current communist party members still working in 1953 and 1954 in defense plans.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
The only control that defense department has as far as I know is control over security clearance.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And that control is not clear.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
There are some instances we came across where that control is sort of divided between the defense department and between the private company.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
One case I recall the private company has control up through confidential.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
The defense department or the Navy.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Well, the company.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Now let's get out of this point.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
The government is the buyer.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
And the department of defense and great injustice, thickness of Wilson.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Mr. Stevens, who did run a big company.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
If they told the seller, here, you're getting a lot of business from us.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
We don't.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
We've had a rise from a Senate McCarthy's committee.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Everybody would jump.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
I think it's fair to say with that, to get rid of these people.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Now you get rid of them.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
You still say it's a defense department.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Couldn't tell the people or even if they did, if they wouldn't get rid of them, the answer, sir.

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
Senator Simonton and I think that there's tremendous merit to some proposal being worked out,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
whereby there would be greater control by the defense department.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
But the way things stand now in 1954, sir, the answer to you probably would be.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
What's the Mr. Wilson probably would be?

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
The people you want us to fire members of the United Electrical Workers Union,

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
which in many of us locals is a communist dominated union.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
There is collective bargaining where they're recognized by the NLRP.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
We have to deal with them.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
We cannot fire those people.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
We are sorry.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Do you mean that you think that you couldn't get rid of people in the plant

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
as you told the people that ran the plant that they were?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Security risk in the United States?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Have you given these 133 names to the FBI?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
For me, sir.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Have you given these 133 names to the FBI?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
No, sir, I don't think I've given them the FBI.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Well, the FBI is all of the United States,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
and they worked very closely with the defense player.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Why not give the names to the FBI so that they try and get rid of them?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
I will take a note, sir.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
I'm sure that the FBI knows about these 133 and a lot more than we know about.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
But if they know about them, wouldn't they tell the Department of Defense about them?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
They would, sir.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
If they do, then it wouldn't be a question of the Department of Defense not being able to fire them.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Well, yes, sir.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
The Department of Defense says not, and it might sound ridiculous, but it's true.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
The Department of Defense does not have the power to fire these people.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
It's private and for your record.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
For the record, when I was with the Air Force,

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
if anybody was to proper knowledge,

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
had come with respect to any security risk in any plant that was doing government business with the Air Force,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
they would have either immediately gotten rid of those people

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
or the business would have been canceled.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
And that, I believe we want to check this because it's incredible to me

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
that the American people through the Department of Defense are giving business to companies

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
where they are helpless about getting rid of security risk, or I might say three other ten points.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
Having that yield, I would be mildest and in that they have three screening boards

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
or the countries divide into three sections for screening purposes.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I think they call them industrial security.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
One section is under the control of the Army, one on the Navy and one on the Air Force,

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
for screening a personnel who worked in defense plants.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
I don't know all about the authority, that screening board says.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Well, I can answer the senator's way, I don't know only what the board,

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
but I know that we worked with the intelligence of the three services

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
and also with the FBI and the three services intelligence were not sufficient.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
But if anybody from the FBI ever told anybody in the plan to law work with,

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
that we had a security risk, he was out, regardless of boards or anything else.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
And I believe that that would be true of the Secretary of Defense.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
I do not think that he could stand on that situation, and I have enough respect for him to believe that he won't.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
And I'd recommend even if it is inconvenient, and you don't give the name to another committee,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
so that this committee isn't blamed for holding up the work.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
I'd certainly give the name to the Department of Defense.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
I'd give him to the federal bureau of investigation, and I'd say these people,

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
every minute, every day, they're in these plants, they're a danger, the security of the United States.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
And we think that you ought to get rid of them and give the reasons why.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
I am sure if you do that, that any manufacturer of government business,

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
if he gets that information from the buyer, he's going to get rid of those things.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I'm certainly sorry, I'm really sorry for your first question.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
I'd be glad to hear.

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
We seem to be concerned about having a contract in the first and the next country,

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
our subversives.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
I'm sure, remember this committee knows that under our 48-programmed law short for a firm,

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
that about $2 billion for a contract have been placed in European countries like Italy,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
where 25% of the workmen belong to the community.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
Well, I'd say to my good friend from Idaho, that could not be more true,

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
and if he'd be kind enough to read a report, that the distinguished senior senator from New Hampshire

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
and I have recently put out, he'd say just how worried we are about the condition

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
which he brings up.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Mr. Brennan report.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Mr. Chairman, I thank you.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
I thank you, Senator.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
Senator Simonton, if I can say that the reason is that his friend had reported,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
primarily due to the send of his great staff.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
Senator Simonton, if I might try to clarify this for you,

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
I don't know whether the defense department is entirely plainless or not.

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
I think that it hasn't suggested the fact that there are certain things which the defense department can do.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
Under certain congressional acts, I know that there was at least one incident where the situation got so bad

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
that one department or another just issued an instruction to a company saying,

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
if you recognize such an union which is coming and decommunited, we will withdraw all our contracts.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
That was at the know of the atomic laboratory of states in New York, where there was nothing.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
Mr. Colton, I haven't got the ten minutes, but I would urge you, even if you do not think it would expedite

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
getting the defense risk out of these plans by giving it to another committee of the Congress.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
I would urge that immediately the names be given to the FBI in order to take in a place

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
as far as the Department of Defense.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
I'd like to proceed.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
I'm sure the M.A.I. has.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
I'm sure the M.A.I. has.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
I'd like to support, without reservation, the position taken by my colleague

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
with respect Mr. Chairman to why we left the committee.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
At this point, I mentioned that the first paragraph of the Prouch Memorandum,

28:58.000 --> 29:05.000
which I read quickly, has in its 1,000 terminus, they're in the army.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
That is the way I remember reading the Prouch Memorandum.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Is that correct?

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
I believe that that was a testament based on his experience, which went back as such a long way.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Now, that's true.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
Certainly a matter of that character should be brought up with the members of this committee,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
and not just files, shouldn't it?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I've spent it assignment.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
Once again, that goes into the operation of the committee and the small court trying to do a big job.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
A lot of other things like that came in at the same time,

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
and later date, staring on other sensitive government agencies with equally alarming situation,

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
so that when we get something like that, we try to track it down.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
Now, the two and a quarter-page memorandum talked about 35 subversive cases,

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
but the Prouch letter in March talked about 1,000 terminus in the army,

29:50.000 --> 29:57.000
which would be 1,25th of all the terminus according to the FBI information in the United States.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Now, is that information never been given to the FBI?

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
I've sent it assignment and I am sure that the FBI has all of that information,

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
all of the names on the defense plan people, and a lot more.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
Was the information given to the Department of Defense?

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
You got the letter to the Committee getting touch with the Department of Defense,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
and say they had a document to show there were a thousand Communist members in the army,

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
or the Navy and the Air Force?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
No, sir, it did not.

30:23.000 --> 30:33.000
Mr. Chairman, I, some days ago, mentioned that Mr. Struv pencil was the chief lawyer of the Department of Defense.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
While I have this opportunity, I'd like to correct that statement.

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
I understand that he was the chief lawyer, but that now he is the assistant secretary of defense.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
In charge of foreign aid, I believe that's correct.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
Mr. Cohn, you think a lot of the FBI, I'm right about that,

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
on I said no, organizational law enforcement agency in the world,

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
of which I think has much information for more.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Now, I agree with you about that, as you know,

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
and I'm back now on this question of information and informants.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Yes, sir.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
I noticed that Senator Hickenlooper has this question of Mr. Hoover some years back in testimony.

31:14.000 --> 31:23.000
He said, are you aware of any occasion when FBI investigative files have been made available by anybody to congressional committees

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
or to individual members of Congress?

31:26.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm Mr. Hoover answered, I'm not aware of any loyalty reports being made available to any committee by any agency or any individual in the government,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
because there is a direct, presidential directive so happening it.

31:41.000 --> 31:51.000
I know insofar as a federal bureau of investigation is concerned, no confidential reports of the bureau have ever been made available to anybody.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Would you care to comment or notice remarks by Mr. Hoover?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
No, sorry, I don't think they require any comment by me.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
You believe that he is right in this position?

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Sorry, you'll never get me to say Mr. Hoover is wrong in any position.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
Then do you believe that you could have ever gotten this letter from the FBI?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
But we have gotten this from the FBI, we could not have said.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But you did get it from the Army.

32:10.000 --> 32:16.000
We got information from the Army, sir, that after the FBI had forwarded information to the Army,

32:16.000 --> 32:22.000
the Army had ignored, but the FBI had sent in that there was an example of lack of information.

32:22.000 --> 32:28.000
Why, why, just one more question, why is it wrong to get it from by the committee directly from the FBI?

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
It is right to get it from the FBI to the Army file, because there was not a question of...
