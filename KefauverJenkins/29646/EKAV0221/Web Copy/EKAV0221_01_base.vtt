WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I just wanted to go to the office.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Yes, sir.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Mr. Jenkins.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
I have no question to Mr. Jenkins.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Mr. Collins this morning, Senator Jackson was encouraging you about access and availability

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
of the committee file.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yes, sir.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
And he stated that he had gathered from the jury in some way or other, from some testimony.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
That there was some implied criticism of the members of this committee because they did not know what was in the files and did not look in the files.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
I would like to ask you because to me, it seems to me that this is just because it seems very unreasonable request to expect committee members to go looking in the files.

00:47.000 --> 01:03.000
Earlier in your experience on the committee, there have been customers or any of the members of the committee to be down in the file rule in the evening or early in the morning or after hours or any other time looking around at their own relations, pulling out file, or as an envelope to look at it.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I never heard of this.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Thanks.

01:05.000 --> 01:15.000
I just wanted to say on that point because I think some of our readers of the record, when these hearings come out in French or those who listen to it, then the radio will get the newspaper report.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
I feel that members of this committee have been very likely to do it because they have not been going to those along the spot.

01:22.000 --> 01:35.000
Let me say that in 16 years in Congress, which I have shared on some eight or ten committees never in my life, have I gone into a committee room and started pulling out the drawers and sagging up the envelope, some looking in the file.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
When I was on the House Committee of the United American Activities, we had five rooms, our file, the United American Activities.

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm sure if the members of our committee have their own relation and gone in, pulling those files out and looking at it, we would have had a high charge to papers in the room and out of filing system.

01:50.000 --> 02:04.000
We did it the appropriate way and the usual way when I committee member once information to follow the formula followed by the senator from South Dakota, who calls in the file master of the room or some clerk in charge and says, I'd like some information on this subject.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
Can you bring me a file? Is enough to proceed to which it seems to you will be a more arguably one of the one who protected the integrity and the argument as a file?

02:12.000 --> 02:23.000
Yes, sir, and I know that there have been a considerable number of occasions when the senator in one half sent for various staff members and asked for information and files and various matters. I'm sure they have always been supplied to each other.

02:23.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm very, I'm very, I'm very frequent of cases. I've done that in this committee. I've done that I think in all the communities which I have remembered. But I didn't want the impression to get out in the country just the members of this committee.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
And we're somehow rather so freeing on the job because they didn't put out in with their own hands and fingers and kept carrying the file in the part looking for information.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Of course, right. Are you out of your mind? Give out information throughout a year time.

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
Even with chairman, the reason I raised the question you recall that when the so-called FBI report was to be introduced in evidence, we were advised it was available all of us.

02:54.000 --> 03:04.000
And I have no knowledge of it. It's been a sentence in March of 53. And I please and I may be an herb at the record seat for itself. I think Senator McCarthy said it was available all the members of the committee.

03:04.000 --> 03:14.000
The point is that we can sit down and get it. I mean, obviously if you've got such a massive file, I try to make a point that you couldn't start searching every file. That was a point that I was making.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
It's been a practice of doing what they came to me as any committee member interested, any practice we have, some court or some secretary, bringing the file and bringing the information.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
But certainly if each of us starts looking around in that file, we're going to have a strong practice that we're allowed to be really good to.

03:28.000 --> 03:38.000
I quite agree with you. And I think that's very important that we be advised when there is something as serious as was involved in that report that I referred to.

03:38.000 --> 03:50.000
And that was for that reason that I raised the question. Because if every member is to be presumed to know what's in the file, I think we could all be in a very difficult situation that something developed later.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
We have been derelict and not taking action. So that reason that I called us to the attention.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
Yes, I think it's not a fake enough to public record on that point because just not a few, there's not for one minute.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
One people to presume that he knows everything in the file. So the three standing committees and the five subcommittees, which he is a member.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
He certainly does not know what it all was filed. He has no desire expectation to be notified every time an institution is made in the file.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
But he expects when he wants to know something to go to the proper official in the file room and have emphasis at my place.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
So unless we're notified, we can have four cameras. I certainly do not expect to be notified every time something goes in the file room at the eight committees, which I have enough.

04:29.000 --> 04:38.000
I agree, but this is a very serious matter. There's 35 alleged subversives that that's for mom. And it was not, if it were a trivial matter, I wouldn't have raised the question.

04:39.000 --> 04:49.000
You might have answered from the person. I guess the impression of some of his actions helps to maybe someone with derelict and not giving him this information.

04:49.000 --> 04:58.000
I say to the chairman that my three democrat friends were guilty of absenteeism for quite a few months, or they would have had this information.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
When I ask the committee for the right to...

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Well, I'll have to...

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I remember it. Turn the alley.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
The more is he finds the yield, any time from here with three.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
There's a hell of a problem.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
There's a lot of time and the current is the yield.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
He has some questions. He has no attendance.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
No sir, I'm going to start a call if we are going to keep my own time.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
Mr. Cohn, I'd like to ask you some questions now about your law practice, which was a question very appropriately raised also by Senator Jackson.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
You have been practicing, you say, in practice with...

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I think three other people in New York City and a law firm.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Yes, I haven't always been a partner.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
I think it is pertinent position, priori, to ask you whether or not you're in the court of that practice.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You have ever represented it?

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, you now represent any of the scientists.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The answer is no.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
May I particularize?

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Have you ever represented personally or as any member of the law firm represented personally?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
G. David Chine.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
No sir.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Or the Chine Hotel Company?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
No sir.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Or the Chine Theatre Institute?

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
Sir, neither I nor anyone in my firm has directly or indirectly are in any way shaped form manner or mean represented.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
Mr. Chine, anyone in his family, anyone in his business or anyone connected with his business in any way.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
Is it correct or incorrect that the books of the law firm have been subpoenaed so that council has access to the record so that we don't have to rely upon your testimony?

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
To can the life on the facts and the books of the law is correct or everything up there is completely available to the committee, some of it has been subpoenaed.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
And my answer is a categorical note every question you ask.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
So that you supplement the binding is read books by testimony under oath.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
But at no time, since you have been a member of this committee, have you or any member of your law firm?

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
Brothers and sisters, G. David Chine or any of the scientists that is correct.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Hello, Senator McCartney.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
Mr. Chine, I wish we could answer statements to the lady about the Democrats leaving this committee last year.

06:57.000 --> 07:15.000
I want to say for you, Jennifer, those who are the other remarks, that the Democrats left this committee to go forward with public and members voted in obnoxious rule that denied to the Democrats, the right to have been advised in the selection or discharging in staff members.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
We stayed on for the committee and the last rule was we were sent in by the same Republican members who voted it.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
How about the reason we left the committee and that's absenteeism, I'll be absent again whenever we try to make this a one man's committee.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I want that under good nomad and she's the question.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
But don't go forward.

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
I want to say I get that.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Never old, I'll always do.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
We send him a call and he'll be returning in another 10 minutes.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
You can get a line.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Get out of the line.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Get out of the line.

07:52.000 --> 08:03.000
So the senators leave the caucus room for the fourth time this afternoon to vote on the floor of the Senate.

08:03.000 --> 08:13.000
And the major now before the consideration of the upper body of the Congress of the United States is an amendment introduced by Senator Wayne Morris of Oregon, which increases by $35 million dollars.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
The loan authority of the rural electrification administration.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
They grow into the floor of the Senate to vote on the Morris amendment.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You heard the chairman declare a brief recess.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
The ABC Television Network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army controversy.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
There are eight members of the United States Senate involved in this hearing here in the caucus room.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
And when a roll call goes comes of course I call up the out of the caucus room down the elevator across the subway.

08:40.000 --> 08:51.000
The little subway cars that run between the Senate office.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
And the Capitol building itself and then go up and vote and come on back the same way.

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
And that has happened now for the fourth time this afternoon.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
And every we have just received a very interesting statistic.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
As of 5 p.m. this evening.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
It's a 5 p.m. this evening, Eastern Day Lifetime.

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
The American Broadcasting Company will have telecast 119 hours of live television from the hearing.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Yesterday's session was the longest session on record so far in the 25 days of hearing.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
It was six hours and three quarters.

09:31.000 --> 09:44.000
So 5 p.m. tonight we broadcast 119 live hours of television coverage of the hearings into the controversy between Senator Joseph McCarthy and Mr. Stephen and Mr. Evans.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
This is Bryson Ranch reporting again and perhaps we can give you a little bit of a summary here of what's been going on.

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
We have had four roll calls this afternoon and not too much of this has been transacted in this afternoon session.

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
Mr. Welch, coffee, jam and Mr. Cohn on some of the matters about who was a game-order to private shine.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
If there is gunner back now we will resume this summary in just a moment.

10:12.000 --> 10:24.000
Another back speaking from the Senate's office room and now it's my great pleasure to introduce Mr. Robert Kennedy, who has been referred to a good deal during the course of these hearings as the Council for the Minority of the Subcommittee.

10:24.000 --> 10:32.000
I think perhaps if you've been watching these proceedings on television you've seen Mr. Kennedy in the background behind Senator Jackson and Senator Simon in Trichland-Lean.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
Mr. Robert, I think Mr. Kennedy has a putting his glasses up on up beyond his forehead.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
I have it but I have also. Are you conscious of that? Could you push your glasses up?

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
The only place I know is where they are. You can fill them down fast. You don't have to open and close them all the time.

10:47.000 --> 10:56.000
That's the merit of that also. Mr. Kennedy, what is the Council to the Subcommittee? What are the duties involved?

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Well, I am the Minority Council.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Senator Martin again.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
If nothing else today's hearings should demonstrate to the country that there is other business going on and kept the little size of your ear.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
I send him a call and I will let you begin with your ten minutes period and when the senator comes we will be brought back to him.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
We work with no time.

11:28.000 --> 11:37.000
Mr. John, I have been rather intrigued by the medical physical speculation about Mr. Wells' or to weather or not.

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
We would be here today if there have been no Mr. Shine. Mr. Shine has received a commission.

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
As I recall, the bad effort just as he was beginning July, is that correct?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yes sir.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
In what month did you either contemplate issuing the subpoenas for the Army Royalty and Screamin' Board?

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
If not, all in what month were the first subpoenas issued if they were issued?

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
The first public statement was in by Senator McCarthy, was at the beginning of September.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
I imagine that the contemplation was someone before that, sir.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
No, I would not have sent out the assumption that there weren't on Mr. Shine.

12:26.000 --> 12:33.000
All of Mr. Shine had taken a trip to South America or in those Shiner and some of the places.

12:34.000 --> 12:45.000
Is it your judgment that in the pursuit of your thinking, that effort still was made to subpoena the records and the members of the Army Royalty and Screamin' Board?

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Not about that. You say there is no doubt about that.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yes sir.

12:49.000 --> 12:58.000
Now, if that effort were made and they were not subpoenas, do you anticipate that in the language of Mr. Wells, where it might have been a collision?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
In a way to bring people to this room?

13:02.000 --> 13:11.000
Yes sir. I'm sure that there would have been. I might say Senator Dirtian, that the concern with the Royalty Board and that problem was basically Senator McCarthy.

13:11.000 --> 13:21.000
That was a personal concern of his. I was not in disagreement with it in any way. I was a little let hopeful to what the results would be,

13:21.000 --> 13:33.000
and that was something which he was very much set on in this and in other investigations. And I'm sure that in spite of me or anybody else in the world, he would have pressed that and assuming Mr. Steven's and Mr. Adams and others weren't that far existed.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
There would have been this collision Mr. Shine or Mr. Shiner. Yes sir.

13:38.000 --> 13:48.000
Now let's do it we worked for a moment to witness the investigation is over and I trust that it will only be over.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
It is very strong to the ability of the regular investigating committee to resolve this. Yes sir.

13:55.000 --> 14:04.000
You or the Chief Council would have some estimate of what work will be undertaken as soon as the record investigating committee gets underway.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
Yes sir. Why New York judgment so would be among the first of the things to which you will be questioned?

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
I would say the first things are with faith communism and the sense plan. I would say one of the first things with faith as well people with questions.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
I would say one of the first things probably was easy for us to.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
In his knowledge as the oil ematires ending at the present time it can be considered that I take it in.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm finished committee business. Not that about it. All that faith is should be required or no initials or reactions.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
They request the army to Mr. Adams to protect those people.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Has been standing for some period of time.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
It still stands never been withdrawn and that is a matter of pending that in service for me.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
And the authority to issues the penis lodges in the hands of the chairman of the list.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I take it by action of the full committee.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
That should be impaired. That's right.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
So that if those of the people actually issue problem members will allow people to.

15:01.000 --> 15:09.000
What do you anticipate or are they different to the opinions between army and the committee as to whether or not?

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Wow. The members must respond to the supreme.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
True. Whether they can justify.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Our matters involving inferior loyalty for us in the action that was taken.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
So if they are different to the defense of the system they will be another coalition.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
You would anticipate the threat kind of a collision when I bring some people back into this committee.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I say if it follows the pattern of this I suppose it was yesterday.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
That's all for the moment.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm sending the card to you. Send the card and read.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Eight and see what it is.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
And you're sending the flag to the chair.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Let the phone read.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm curious.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
My other than the ministerial.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Paragraph number five of the document which you have before you go.

15:57.000 --> 16:04.000
I'll resume paragraph six of that document.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Yes.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
First sentence refers to a report in the quotation.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Yes. And I assume you and I know about that.

16:10.000 --> 16:17.000
The first two which is the chronological statement of events that the army issued.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Right. The computing sentence of that paragraph is as follows.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
When placed in proper perspective.

16:25.000 --> 16:33.000
It will be found to have given greater aid and comfort to commoners and security.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
But any single other obstacle of a design.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Is that your statement today?

16:40.000 --> 16:48.000
Not only that, sir, but I think the political affair, the official monthly publication of the communist party and its wet monthly issue.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
That's the hearing then what's been going on.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Is a very big victory for the.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
I'm here in the evaluation of the top report for this issue.

16:57.000 --> 17:06.000
Dear regarding alleged pressure and effort to secure a preferential treatment for private churn.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
As given.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Greater comfort.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Cominert.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Unsecured risks.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Running a single other obstacle ever designed at your testimony.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Yes, I was just planning to stop the work of this committee and to discredit the chairman and the.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
I think I get a very important document with it.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
The right to charge is very grave and serious.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yes.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
So you have treated us that way.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Yes.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
I do not agree with those who say that this is a waste of time for this committee to investigate the charges.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
Sir, with all respect, I don't think it is a waste of time for the very able to investigate that.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Which is given the greatest comfort to the commoners of anything ever designed.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
It's a waste of time.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm a common authority sector.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I think that.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I am mobilizing this committee and.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I'm using your work.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
I am mobilizing the committee and keeping it away from its investigation of communist and defense plan and in other places.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
The communists are gaining as we stay here.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
All right.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
What it has done for that purpose is you have charged.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
That has lost under that purpose.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
There isn't that one of the greatest things can funny us if we have men at the head or the army of the United States.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
It's regarding the such tactics.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
Does that be any more important investigation of looking into those charges in your opinion and your fighting commoners?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Sir, that's certainly important.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
I only say send a number of phone.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I very much regret that in looking into it.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
The very best.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
We all regret this.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I agree with you.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I regret it.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
I don't have the head.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I know if I didn't feel it had absolute duty to be here.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
I don't enjoy it.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
But the point I'm making is.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
This hearing from your viewport in mine is not a waste of time and it takes profit.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
And it's paramount.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
Do any other investigation this committee could be making that this time?

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
I don't think there's any basis of all these charges, isn't that true?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Sir, I don't agree with me.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
No, sir. It's great.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Well, one would be greater.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
But all investigate the second area of the army, whose problem isn't common.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
It's great.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm a great friend of the McLeod.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
I feel it is.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
You're very great.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
It's all these matters.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
The other members of the committee could be spat from this and used in connection with the other.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh, sure.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
It doesn't happen.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
What it did happen.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yes, sir.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
And these charges are before us.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
Can you think of any more serious charges or anything that you know all is going on?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
That could be more serious because this government has been having it.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
They had other men who had Scotland commoners in time and the stock of committee of the Congresswoman investigating them.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Do you know anything more serious than that?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, sir, it's very hard.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
That is what it is.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
It is.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yes, sir.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
It's very hard to evaluate the relative serious, sir.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And this is even certainly wise.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
And Mr. Adam certainly was trying to stop the investigation of the loyalty for us and of communist and the army.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That was a very serious thing.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
All right.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
If they were doing it.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Yes, I'll give you all the part of the talk to clean up.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Well, sir, I think I am much more concerned about.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
You're not concerned about the talk level?

19:55.000 --> 20:12.000
Well, I'm concerned about it, sir, but I just think that if the commission of addressing itself to communists and defend plants, communists and government, and not spending all the time on the month on this, I don't think tonight.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
So, that may ask you this.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.000
If you got such a man at the head of the United States Army, let's cobbling communists try and stop investigations of him.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
If he succeeds, don't you know more to get in than any committee could ever get out and shouldn't we clean up at the top first?

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
Well, sir, I'm afraid that this committee would not have the jurisdiction to do anything about Mr. Stevens or...

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
Well, if you mean it has no jurisdiction to investigate Mr. Stevens, if he's cobbling communists?

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
I have a certain jurisdiction to investigate it, sir, but I don't know what power the committee would have over.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Well, what power does any committee have after an investigation except the past or law?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Decade in force in his aim?

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
What power does it have? You know that it has no power other than to expose?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Well, as a power to expose, close links to the other.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Don't you think he should be exposed?

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
Legislative. Well, sir, I probably don't have any wisdom on this subject.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I think I would thank you, should use it.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, sir, one of the chief columnist investigators, I think you have a very fixed...

21:10.000 --> 21:24.000
Along the shakeable opinion, I'll serve my opinion with great respect to you, is that if we have the benefits of the distinguished gentleman of this committee in uncovering communists and defense plans and other things which we have already in not sitting here,

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
stay in and stay out on this, I feel with you. Since you pressed the upper tenions, I, I, I, I, I brackish the national interest with the national interest with much better be served.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
And let us deceive them for all and continue to serve at the top of the island.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Right, have you heard that?

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
I have no opinion on this, the statement is continuing to serve on item, it's nothing I or anyone else on it.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Yes.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
Anyone with much more power than you have any opinion on the communists?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Yes, I do.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
All right, then, why would you have an opinion on him?

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
Continues to serve if he's trying to prove that an investigation of communists in the military?

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Sir, he is appointed by the President of the United.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Oh, so are the army officers appointed for the President of the United States?

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
They cabinet members of the Secretary of the Army, and I don't think...

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Oh, well, do you want to hold him in the news?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
No, I don't want to hold him in the news.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
That obviously is.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Well, I want to get it to tonight.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I don't think the committee can do anything one way or the other.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I must speak.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Well, it can expose him, Gainey.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
If he charges, it's true, it's not exposed.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes, sir.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Well, that was right.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
He'll do it.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Well, sir, do you think, sir?

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
I certainly think it is unfortunate that the committee has tied up for these many weeks

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
and months on this matter here when it's quickly investigating communists and communists.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
Well, do you mean that down there is that a commonist from some defense plant may be more

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
dangerous to the security of this country, when a man at the head of the army whose problem

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
would be...

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Oh, you're almost sweating, sir.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
I think I have.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Ah, hey.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
But, sir, we do have the situation of these communists in the defense plant in the army

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
and other fighters.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
We work on about our business getting them out.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
They have tried to stop us.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
And the man who tried to stop you, if they did, it should be God's now, sir, it shouldn't

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
be.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Well, sir, I'm afraid we're never going to know all of the people who have tried to stop us.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, sir.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
We know one and two are important to your system, Lloyd.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Yes, sir.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Don't we?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yes, we do.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
That two, which is it in the fire, I decide to stop.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Yes, sir.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Well, don't think you ought to stop.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Stop and get them out, both.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I don't think we can be able to get them out.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
You don't think we're real?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
No, sir.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Oh.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
And this man has expired in the fire.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Ah, sir.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Mr. Gorn?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Mr. N.A.

23:27.000 --> 23:39.000
The Memorandums, which, ah, send them across being yourself, Mr. Carl, ah, Bobberton

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
and the other, you testify that the Memorandum of the party November the 6th was prepared by you

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
or dictated by you.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
I think it was, sir.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Yes.

23:48.000 --> 24:02.000
Well, I think one of the major charges and the, in this document, is in the second paragraph,

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
which I'll read.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Yes, sir.

24:05.000 --> 24:12.000
Which refers to a meeting that was held at the Secretary's office, or at the end of the

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
McCarthy, Frank Carl yourself, ah, Mr. Seif.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
This Memorandum, you say, fit.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
What's your statement, sir, that we hold up our public hearings on the arms?

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
It's suggested that we go out to the Navy, the Air Force, and the Panther Department, and fit.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
We said, first of all, we had no evidence worn in the investigation of these other departments.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
Adam said not to worry about that, because there was plenty of search there.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
And they would punish us, the least.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
Mr. Seif and Bobberton thought that was the answer to his thought.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Now, just call on a few questions and commissions.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
First, first, Mr. Seif and Bobberton said to Warren, ah, have that meeting?

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
To Warren II, to discuss this in your Memorandum?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Yes, sir, very call it.

24:59.000 --> 25:13.000
And substance speaking, to be exact, where Mr. Seif and Mr. President thought that, ah, if we could stop investigating the Army and to some attention to the Navy and the Air Force for a while, that that wasn't an easy army situation.

25:13.000 --> 25:21.000
Now, Mr. Seif and say that the armed that the Air Force and the Department of Defense and Navy had security problems that you should look into?

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
Well, I'm sure that that was implicit in just taking certain.

25:24.000 --> 25:32.000
Ah, I'm sure he did not want us to, ah, just go out and investigate something which was unfair.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
I assume that he felt that he might have the same problem when he assisted in the Army.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Did he make you any specific security problems?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Yes, the other departments might have.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I don't recall Mr. Seif and the other.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
No, the word he stated that, ah, well, lower your fire.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Yes, that's not what the matter is.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
We're second.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
The last part of the U.S. Justice, Adam is not only, ah, about that was a good idea, but he stated he would 42 the Navy.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Yes, sir.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Now, what Navy?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Did he, ah, did he 40-20 the Navy?

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Uh, he never furnished any action.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I was thinking of this particular meeting.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
I was thinking of a meeting?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Yes. No, he didn't give us any weeks. That's the clear meeting.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Did he just, he just stated that, but I can give him tonight.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
That's right.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Did you involve him to what?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Yes.
