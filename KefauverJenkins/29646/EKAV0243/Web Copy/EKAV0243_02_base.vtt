00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm now talking about the voice of America's information service investigation.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Yes, sir.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.500
I think you mentioned the name of a person there that you were led to the commoners

00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
that back row in any way.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.500
I know.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.500
Well, in any way, all I want to establish is that that person was not in any way connected

00:18.500 --> 00:19.500
to the Department of the Army.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.500
Oh, I can see that right off the end.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.500
That's very clear.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.500
Sure.

00:24.500 --> 00:31.500
And that, sir, the government's printing office in that case, we've heard a lot about that.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.500
That is likewise in no way connected to the Department of the Army.

00:35.500 --> 00:40.000
Well, so they did some work, secret work for the Army, but I would agree with you for the first of this year.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.500
It was in no way connected with our investigation.

00:42.500 --> 00:48.500
The responsibility for the security matters of the government printing office did not rest on Mr. Steven Zartoff, didn't it?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
Certainly not, by my way, no sir.

00:50.500 --> 00:56.500
Now we were talking about whether or not in the course of your investigation, you uncovered any espionage.

00:56.500 --> 01:04.500
It's been referred to as the current espionage at Fort Monmouth, and I, Gavin, you didn't quite agree with me when I suggested you did not uncover any such evidence.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.500
Is that correct?

01:05.500 --> 01:09.500
I said so, a topic which is very difficult to define.

01:09.500 --> 01:15.500
I told you that there was there a Mike's, very instant espionage, and handling espionage cases.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.500
There was a very dangerous situation.

01:18.500 --> 01:24.500
We were very clear that there had been espionage, that it had continued until at least a fairly recent time.

01:24.500 --> 01:31.500
And that a potential espionage situation still did exist. It was a bad situation. I'm not going to put it here.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.500
Well, it's not put here.

01:32.500 --> 01:40.500
But let's also be fair to both sides. There's always potential espionage in the military, as well as another sense of importance of the government.

01:40.500 --> 01:45.500
There's not much further than just a potential it might be anyway. There was a specific situation here.

01:45.500 --> 01:50.500
Well, as the secrecy goes up, the potentiality goes up.

01:50.500 --> 01:59.500
Even on top of that, there were specific people there who had records and had done things which would put any security officer on notice.

01:59.500 --> 02:00.500
Are you referring to Aaron Coleman?

02:00.500 --> 02:01.500
I think he's a pretty good example.

02:01.500 --> 02:06.500
Well, I thought we agreed just today that his clearance has been lifted and he's been working in a building not even on the post.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.500
Sorry, that doesn't mean too much to me.

02:07.500 --> 02:12.500
Well, I would have thought it would not mean too much to you, but perhaps it may mean something to some other people.

02:12.500 --> 02:12.500


02:12.500 --> 02:23.500
Well, let me ask you that question. Isn't it true that if you had uncovered evidence of espionage, it would have been the duty of the FBI and the Department of Justice to submit that evidence to a grand jury and seeking indictment on it?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500
Doesn't work quite that way.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.500
You won't answer that one yet to know.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.500
Which I could, I can't.

02:29.500 --> 02:38.500
In any event, insofar as you know, the FBI and the Department of Justice did not submit any of the cases that you uncovered to a grand jury seeking indictment.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.500
For espionage?

02:40.500 --> 02:41.500
For espionage.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.500
I don't know where they have one.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.500
Well, you know they did not.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.500
No, I don't know.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.500
You don't know that.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.500
Nothing.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
And by the same token, you don't know that they did.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.500
That's right.

02:52.500 --> 02:58.500
And you would trust the testimony of the FBI to evaluate whether evidence comes to espionage or not.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.500
Would you not?

02:59.500 --> 03:05.500
When we start, we're given the full fact that it's a vilify and given to the FBI by the people who have responsibility.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.500
I would trust that judgment on any.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.500
You think that you have facts? Yes, the FBI did not have.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.500
It might be possible for that.

03:12.500 --> 03:20.500
And of course, our investigation, we would develop certain things by use of our propane of power, which the FBI does not have, which would be helpful to them.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.500
Yes, sir.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
Did you turn those facts over to the FBI?

03:23.500 --> 03:24.500
Yes, sir.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.500
Then they did have the facts if you had.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.500
Is that right?

03:27.500 --> 03:30.500
Well, to the extent that we went up, we turned the facts over to the museum.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.500
Well, when I say we turned the facts over, I believe so.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.500
We furnished copies of our transcripts to the FBI.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.500
Well, that's turning the facts over, sir.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.500
In an all-fairness few with the CONG, you did the same thing to the Army.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.500
We certainly tried to say.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.500
Well, you find it's trans goods to the Army, but what went on?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.500
Yes, sir, I believe we did.

03:46.500 --> 03:52.500
And so you now can't tell us whether or not the FBI and the Department of Justice start indictments against anyone, then it would go ahead.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.500
It's one month.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.500
Uh...

03:54.500 --> 03:55.500
What?

03:55.500 --> 03:57.500
Five to one month or S.D. and I.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.500
Yes.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.500
No, I can't.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.500
All right.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.500
All right. There's not a lot of talks about General Love.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.500
We, I think, use my kind of creativity to find professional soldiers.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.500
I certainly believe it's right.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.500
You have the authority of no one other than Robert C. Stevens for that.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.500
There goes the unbeing of find professional soldier.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.500
I think he's been a great anti-chummy expert.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.500
It's very important to me.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.500
All right.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.500
I will go along with you on that.

04:18.500 --> 04:29.500
Now, I believe that your testimony, sir, that on October the 14th, in an evening section,

04:29.500 --> 04:34.500
General Lotton testified before your committee on a evening of October 14th.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.500
I should.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.500
To the waitress, I'll get some space and I'll probably...

04:37.500 --> 04:39.500
Well, I'm very well familiar with this.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.500
If you want to ask me about what he said on the question of S.D. and I support my committee, I'm ready to talk to you about that.

04:44.500 --> 04:51.500
Well, I think I have a plan. If you'd like it, I'll get it.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.500
Sure.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
I think you'd feel a more accurate plan.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.500
If you want to ask me the question about what I'll be giving you, if you want, anyway.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.500
Bonnie, you're searching for the tank. Get them while we have the opportunity.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.500
You have the other face, General.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.500
I have a tanker.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.500
Yes, I have it.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.500
But they didn't.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
I have a here at 814.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
Are you ready, Mr. Cohn?

05:30.500 --> 05:33.500
Yes, I'm ready to put something out, but I don't want to call the air at the moment.

05:33.500 --> 05:38.500
Well, I suggest you do that, so you can call things by a distance, if they're responsive to questions.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.500
Sure.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
And why you have to wait until a week or a week or so.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.500
I'm working on it.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.500
Now, I'm taking 814 as a transcript of that session.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.500
The chairman was determined to ask this question.

05:48.500 --> 05:54.500
Could you tell us why it is only in the last two or three weeks that you are getting these effective results?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
I think you remember that question.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
Sorry, welcome.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
I'm curious.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.500
And the answer by General Lawton was, yes, but I had better not.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.500
I know that so well, but I am working for Mr. Steven.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.500
I think you remember that answer.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
Sorry, welcome.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.500
Now, I want to ask you, Mr. Cohn, whether when you heard that question and that answer,

06:12.500 --> 06:15.500
you thought that General Lawton was being critical of Robert Steven.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.500
I'd answer it this way, Mr. McClare.

06:22.500 --> 06:27.500
Well, first, you know, in the past, we've had the rule that you have to answer, yes, and no, then put it in front of it and say anything you want.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
Sure.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
Now, would you try to follow that rule?

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
Sure.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.500
I will, but the answer is yes.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.500
I think he was in giving a social answer.

06:36.500 --> 06:44.500
He had to be critical of the people for whom we worked, who had made a difficult to him to suspend both time units and make right our laboratory.

06:44.500 --> 06:49.500
I think he was reluctantly critical and critical and responsible for his question, but he had answers.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
You think he was reluctantly critical?

06:51.500 --> 06:52.500
I do.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
Now, let me read you the preceding question.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.500
The chairman, what does that have to do with him?

06:57.500 --> 07:02.500
And you have a complete cooperation of the Secretary of the Army in this, I understand.

07:02.500 --> 07:06.500
And General Lawton answered absolutely and same as I move.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.500
Yes.

07:07.500 --> 07:12.500
Now, in the preceding question, do you think that General Lawton was being critical of the Secretary of the Army?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.500
I think so.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
You answered that and a question for the usual rule.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
You have to know about and then say anything you want.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
Sure.

07:18.500 --> 07:25.500
No, I think what he was saying there isn't a whole thing, that once Senator McClare at the end of the picture and puts a pressure on Mr. Steven's about the situation.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
Mr. Steven's then began to cooperate and think remotely.

07:28.500 --> 07:34.500
But before Senator McClare became alone, nobody could get anything done.

07:34.500 --> 07:41.500
So, what the net effect of it is, as you will find it then, and mine's you with it, and I was not, that's just general of the same critical.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.500
What was the second kind of thing on it?

07:43.500 --> 07:53.500
Uh, not so the net effect of what to me was, the General Lawton said, I've known about this security risk, communist infiltration situation for a long period of time.

07:53.500 --> 08:00.500
I've been able to do something about it only in a few, two or three weeks since Senator McClare and his committee came on the scene.

08:00.500 --> 08:04.500
Since they came on the scene, I have been getting cooperation from Mr. Steven.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.500
And his task is before that, I wasn't getting help from anybody.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.500
I get my hands on him.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
Uh, Mr. David?

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
Yes, sir.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
General, have some of them come.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
Yes.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
Uh, Senator Grayson?

08:15.500 --> 08:16.500
Yes.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
Senator Jackson?

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
Yes.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Senator Simon?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.500
Mr. Cameron, I have a few notes there.

08:23.500 --> 08:28.500
First, three charges presented.

08:28.500 --> 08:34.500
A new diversion and a new attack against me by Senator McClare.

08:34.500 --> 08:43.500
The present is a pupil of Missouri in the main, one television by Senator McClare, in the 1952 campaign.

08:44.500 --> 08:50.500
And I'm reassured by the fact they will think as little of them now as they get then.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.500
Now let me get my notes together with Robert and Haystale.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.500
Mr. Stateno was ahead of the United Electrical Works.

09:00.500 --> 09:04.500
He was the international vice president in Missouri.

09:04.500 --> 09:12.500
By law, he had represented for some time the people in the plan that I went to originally.

09:13.500 --> 09:19.500
Everybody knew that he was ahead of the Communist Party and that's part of the United States because he often said so.

09:19.500 --> 09:26.500
I see on his own, or came into my plan, I believe, in 1940, but the second Mr. Stateno and all of us conversed.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.500
I worked very closely with the FBI.

09:30.500 --> 09:41.500
The charge of any money, however, in any way, passed the framework of Senator and me, his totally and completely false, just another diversion and just another attack.

09:42.500 --> 09:55.500
The meetings referred to by Mr. Vice-Centren Macroffing, which I attended with Mr. Stateno and the Times attended, were also attended by leading citizens to Republicans and Democrats of St. Lawrence.

09:55.500 --> 10:01.500
They were infigated and chaired by one of the most beloved men that I have ever known.

10:01.500 --> 10:09.500
Bishop of the Marauders will talk of Missouri, formerly Bishop of Arizona.

10:10.500 --> 10:23.500
And I would ask anybody who has any question of that beloved bourgerman who has some of the Barry Goldwater of Arizona, what he thinks of.

10:23.500 --> 10:34.500
I might have the Bishop's thought was not on the list of a vegetable birdie drawn up in the recent controversial article by Mr. J.D. Macroffing.

10:34.500 --> 10:48.500
Now finally, Mr. Cameron, there was never a step taken for suspectedly negotiations that wasn't approved in its entire if it was of any importance.

10:48.500 --> 11:01.500
Negotiations in my plan, by one of the greatest Americans that I have ever known, and one of the men who suffered as much from the time he has any man I know.

11:01.500 --> 11:10.500
Mr. James Carey, the head of the United Electrical Workers, a lot of the new unions that took its place.

11:10.500 --> 11:18.500
They nearly destroyed it. He went out. He knows this story in complete detail.

11:18.500 --> 11:30.500
And I was suggest most honestly for the chair that it oughted to clarify some of the terrible passions that are scooping through to people in these areas.

11:30.500 --> 11:42.500
But he'd be called before the committee to tell the truth, with respect to this latest divergence and its latest attack on me.

11:42.500 --> 11:48.500
Someone had three days ago, a little car, that I would like to lead to the American people.

11:48.500 --> 11:59.500
It would have made out of some under the guise of doing the foremost anti-communist, or doing the work of the time and movement in this country.

11:59.500 --> 12:15.500
Now, Mr. Chairman, I have no question to ask, or Mr. Cohn, but I would ask the chair, especially because of the dreadful attacks that have been made upon me, by the Senator from Wisconsin.

12:15.500 --> 12:28.500
I would ask the chair to ask the Senator if he will sign the letter so that we can both testify on the oath for the points that both of us think almost important.

12:28.500 --> 12:35.500
The chair will have to say in our due different, so he's calling from the chair. He realizes that I'm sure the Senator from the chair was realized.

12:35.500 --> 12:44.500
The chair is dealing with Bill Sutton, and some of the unnamed companies, which apparently, the President of the Missouri,

12:44.500 --> 12:59.500
all over the chair, and the government on name, you remember the other days, when the question of Mr. Green's class, Mr. Rosenberg was brought in, the company, Congressman, with name, and double-feeble, and who the air didn't know that he was an anti-feeble statement,

12:59.500 --> 13:06.500
and double-feeble and who the use, so that it would be too bad, those communists that worked in my plan.

13:06.500 --> 13:14.500
The fact that I never had anything to do was that company. In any way, of any time, whatever. I never owned the chair with stock in it.

13:14.500 --> 13:24.500
I never worked for it on our day or a minute. That's the Emerson Radio Company. With company we are now talking about, and I take pleasure in telling the American people about it,

13:24.500 --> 13:29.500
because I work with it in the forth, but great thought is the Emerson Electric Manufacturing around.

13:29.500 --> 13:42.500
I don't want to get into an argument with the time that Mr. Smith's choice is. I don't want to make him any relationship, but I tell him what I will do, and I'll give him a night, since then five hours ago.

13:42.500 --> 13:48.500
He's so fine, and he's facing the right people, right? So he's facing about a few two-beds, just communists that worked in this plan, that's what he says, right?

13:48.500 --> 13:53.500
He doesn't say that he's a right-and-the-caliant. He's burning me instead. If you hear Roy, just mention your plan.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.500
Yes, I thought you'd want to know about it.

13:56.500 --> 14:04.500
Now, I say, I don't want to tell him, and he always stands to tell what he says. He got it to whether it's on the record or off record.

14:04.500 --> 14:10.500
Sure, I will. And I will not even go for five hours to repeat what you made me promise not to say.

14:10.500 --> 14:17.500
Well, I will repeat it, but I want you to ask him not to mention that we make it in May, because Mr. Tom came up to me also,

14:17.500 --> 14:23.500
and I said, I'm sorry, but I had to mention your plan. I said, Roy, I am too.

14:23.500 --> 14:29.500
Well, I'll go back to the village. I'll return to the village, if you realize it, until he's calling for you.

14:29.500 --> 14:34.500
But any other place that goes out of the village, if you want to come to the village, is coming in until the cutler.

14:34.500 --> 14:39.500
And if you're ready, you'll go out and go for a great batch of shaman.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.500
Yes, that's right. Emerson is an electric non-apacate, and he doesn't have the door.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
Very well. So it's coming in from the cutlery.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.500
Four of us are going to do that. Sometimes we'll just need to go over.

14:48.500 --> 14:54.500
However, at least that's the thing. It's certainly not one of the problems, but the adjudicated side of it,

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
the many need to allow it to.

14:56.500 --> 15:04.500
Now, as I mentioned in your letter, from the message, I've been to be sent over by this committee, so the chair is not going to recommend this.

15:04.500 --> 15:11.500
So I feel it's going to be fun that we bring in Mr. James Chai, or any of the other people who might accept the plan all together.

15:11.500 --> 15:15.500
Here's all of the countries that are in existence that we use as a son of the government.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.500
It's a gentleman in this, and you'll come and take it out of my time.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.500
You have just continued your time.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.500
And I'll say to you all of those, I thank you for our time.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
I did.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
Well, I'll say we're not taking out a good time.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
Thank you very much.

15:24.500 --> 15:32.500
First, all I was trying to do was to see to the agreement which was suggested in combination by Senator M. Barney and me.

15:32.500 --> 15:39.500
And I would like to know if he would like to sign that letter, and if he will sign that letter.

15:39.500 --> 15:45.500
And secondly, I think it's most extraordinary considering the fact that we try to actically every communist in America and the adherence.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.500
But in this matter, it made a game to me, of this car.

15:48.500 --> 15:57.500
Not to call it a great American, who could answer the call, which causes himself far better than I could, because he is so much closer to the problem.

15:57.500 --> 16:01.500
I therefore respectfully question that the chair is mistaken immediately in this manner.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.500
Not to call it a scary, and I gain it.

16:03.500 --> 16:12.500
And if the game keeps beating, Secretary Secretary of the CIO, be called to answer this letter to Chathapunney, may by the time it comes with time.

16:12.500 --> 16:17.500
So I'll have to give the same answer and the same basis, if he would have called all of the witnesses.

16:17.500 --> 16:21.500
Well, as for all of the charges, the federal Attorney has made against you.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.500
And all of the witnesses, the answer all of the charges.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.500
And if you have any good time to look at it, we will be here well beyond that.

16:58.500 --> 17:06.500
At external to the post-war years, and possible as late as 1951, Mr. Frenzer will immediately following,

17:06.500 --> 17:13.500
quoting Stephen, there was an espionage in the Second Court, working on the right stages of the war in a letter here, as he says.

17:13.500 --> 17:19.500
But there was cut off in 1949, 1906, or 1951, as difficult to determine.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
Still quoting Stephen.

17:21.500 --> 17:29.500
When I say that a press conference last Friday, the Army has no proof of true investigation, I want to make it unmistakably clear

17:29.500 --> 17:39.500
that I was speaking of the Army investigation online, and not of the inquiry by the teleprimament of the military investigation of the Temple of Cassius Chairman.

17:39.500 --> 17:48.500
When the assays press and the infiltration has been drawn from the press conference, that can be said that they have done the last thing that has not been done for over the years.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.500
So what is all the secretary?

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
Cool.

17:51.500 --> 17:56.500
That is entirely incorrect, as the lack of the press conference will surely reply.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.500
And dropping down to the sub-head of the torpedoes, think just missing.

17:59.500 --> 18:07.500
A former security officer in the General Electric Plants at the Connected in New York, testified yesterday that 20-30-6 the documents,

18:07.500 --> 18:12.500
and a new type of torpedo had been found missing in August of 1952.

18:12.500 --> 18:22.500
Some of the magistrates that he valuates in these documents, resolved with the conclusions they were sufficiently revealing to compromise the entire torpedo project.

18:22.500 --> 18:31.500
So I've had the impact on all the actual, but the media that would get paid off roughly about Secretary Stephen, so that they got it.

18:31.500 --> 18:41.500
And he said that he didn't know for the afternoon that he said that there is a set-off in 49-50-51, is difficult to determine.

18:41.500 --> 18:46.500
The awful lot of the government's fair make much of the point that they need.

18:46.500 --> 18:52.500
There are no indictments for that, but again, there's a movement of matter.

18:52.500 --> 19:00.500
It was correct that there has been no conviction for that, but some of them in 42 or 43.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.500
I think that's right.

19:01.500 --> 19:06.500
For the words, the German papers in the early 40s, I think that's right.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.500
And I think that even the Roman words were not convicted of that.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.500
No, they were not.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.500
They were convicted of some therapy to commit that to that practice.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
They were not convicted of that to the United States.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
They were convicted of some therapy, so it's been that it's been out there.

19:18.500 --> 19:22.500
A lot of the technical proof involved on the United States practice.

19:22.500 --> 19:27.500
Now, is it for the fact that the claim that they're coming,

19:27.500 --> 19:31.500
when you're the French, you're normally 35 individuals who are suspended,

19:31.500 --> 19:35.500
and it's coming to back down some of the world's requirements,

19:35.500 --> 19:42.500
that the reason, of course, for the French who are the fear that they might take committing death to not.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.500
Yes, but that's certainly one, as I say, in some cases.

19:45.500 --> 19:50.500
It went further than that, so it's a case of actual disappearance of documents and removal of documents.

19:50.500 --> 19:55.500
And again, there are other things that I don't want to go on to any of these days.

19:55.500 --> 19:59.500
If no one will be responsible enough to get a conviction for us,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.500
then let's give a number of witnesses.

20:01.500 --> 20:05.500
I actually see the man taking the serial, handed over to a court and said,

20:05.500 --> 20:07.500
that's not even enough.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.500
There are other elements of technical proof on the United States,

20:10.500 --> 20:13.500
which make the problem very, very difficult one.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.500
But if you're not coming, handling the secret radar on the serial,

20:17.500 --> 20:23.500
that radar radar is in effect in open conduct available to the coming of time.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.500
Yes, so I think that any distinction with the bloody heads about it

20:27.500 --> 20:29.500
is a dangerous situation.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.500
That's all they can do is a dangerous situation.

20:31.500 --> 20:35.500
Now, I'm going to say that the French fire seems to be trying to win them around the facts

20:35.500 --> 20:39.500
that I took them under the Communists of Stone and Telecommunications Laboratory.

20:39.500 --> 20:43.500
I gather and it feels unless the fires are at Fort Monmouth, they're not important.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.500
I may be doing it injustice by that.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.500
Each of us has a 50-mile-of-a-less important one.

20:48.500 --> 20:53.500
A communist fire would be just as dangerous in telecommunications

20:53.500 --> 20:57.500
and when it's taken forward, handling works in Fort Monmouth,

20:57.500 --> 21:01.500
as though that's fire, or on the physical plan, that's Fort Monmouth.

21:01.500 --> 21:05.500
The distinction is to whether they work at Fort Monmouth for 50 miles away

21:05.500 --> 21:09.500
or what takes the Fort Monmouth or what takes the Pythagorean thing across

21:09.500 --> 21:11.500
and they're very unimportant to think.

21:11.500 --> 21:17.500
And there's an individual who is handling top secret work, the top secret work.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.500
It's one of the things that we know in this room for our hands.

21:20.500 --> 21:28.500
We're working in telecommunications until the day that we ask the security officer to produce it.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.500
That's right, Sarah.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.500
It's a middle of December of the past year.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.500
That's what you want to go.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.500
The former 13 had leaked to be accurate.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.500
That's right.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.500
And she appeared on the summer 16 and was doing the teleholder announcement.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.500
She was engaged in the conspiracy from the dust in her room.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.500
Yes, she did.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.500
She involved with the system and then I'm not assuming she was going to keep 30.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.500
She can met up the United States and about a lot of other things.

21:46.500 --> 21:53.500
And we're explaining to her, as you recall, that she could not refuse to testify in regard to the afternoon

21:53.500 --> 21:58.500
unless she felt that her answer might unopened some of my questions.

21:58.500 --> 22:06.500
And once she refused to tell her to have been giving secret material to people known to her,

22:06.500 --> 22:09.500
to be agents of common destruction.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.500
She refused to go out of the stuff in some of my questions.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.500
That's not like a lie.

22:13.500 --> 22:25.500
Now, I know Mr. Frank Sparrow, besides the minimized, the fact that Mr. Coleman picked us a grant that had been lifted.

22:25.500 --> 22:32.500
After he was working on the post, associating with individuals through a 65-day plane,

22:32.500 --> 22:38.500
and all of them, from the public, apparently had a lot of much access to six of the material.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.500
The fact that he was not, as when he was politically working on himself.

22:42.500 --> 22:52.500
So that's particularly showing Mr. Coleman's case, because it's very, very short to show that he was not about asking other people to take classified information from the laboratory and give it to him.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.500
So thank you, Mr. Sparrow.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.500
Well, let's look at one of the questions.

22:58.500 --> 23:04.500
As soon as the worst thing I guess today raised a very important question, and by the attention from this,

23:04.500 --> 23:10.500
there is a very important question, as a question of the Fifth Amendment's Communist structure.

23:10.500 --> 23:20.500
Is it correct that the investigation has shown that this Fifth Amendment's Communist will guarantee the Communist leadership skills, not to tell rank and file Communists?

23:21.500 --> 23:28.500
He had been a secretary of the Governor of Yokohama in Japan, and the funny got to see how they're working.

23:28.500 --> 23:34.500
His orders were trained to remove apparent power from the living family, by trial.

23:34.500 --> 23:40.500
The fact that the only reason he could think of was that his wife and daughter had been going to a trial class,

23:40.500 --> 23:44.500
and he didn't even think of the name of a trial class, but the both of them did the same.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.500
And beyond that, he had nothing to make us a hard to pay.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.500
Nothing.

23:49.500 --> 23:56.500
And our investigation showed that just a vast number of young men was real hard to pay.

23:56.500 --> 24:07.500
To apply for a space-side duty, or to use file of Communists, with four issues, got a flush board back at Camp Chomer.

24:07.500 --> 24:14.500
Now, they found their ways to press the women at a Congressman's pit of security, getting the first of considerations.

24:14.500 --> 24:20.500
I don't think anyone tried to tell the committee that they knew how effective the Communists were.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.500
I mean, the Congressmen were.

24:23.500 --> 24:28.500
We don't know if the government is able to see the investigation, but there's no nothing to say about this.

24:28.500 --> 24:33.500
But there's only information here about the Congressmen, why they need the application.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.500
We don't know a lot of different routine requests.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.500
The campaign is office, so that he knew that the others are signed in on.

24:39.500 --> 24:43.500
But then they asked the government of Communists managers,

24:43.500 --> 24:48.500
whether they come under the government's presence, who actually helped him get his order signed,

24:48.500 --> 24:53.500
and refused to answer the government's answer my question, because I thought I'd collect him yesterday.

24:53.500 --> 24:57.500
So that, as of now, either you and I and anyone of the facts,

24:58.500 --> 25:04.500
have any way of knowing what importance the Congressmen's request was,

25:04.500 --> 25:09.500
whether it was made by his office, whether he made himself from the routine requests,

25:09.500 --> 25:12.500
whether they took an active part in the change of duty.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.500
We don't have a final answer on that.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.500
I asked all the questions, and since then, they've viewed the trust in the front of the front,

25:16.500 --> 25:19.500
to work that way, as the other day, and I think it was a very good question to all the other day.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.500
So, the other questions was from Sarah.

25:21.500 --> 25:24.500
They asked me to move you questions in the envelope.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.500
You cannot get any useful out of this, Mr. Dinkin.

25:26.500 --> 25:32.500
We've all gathered, and I'm in position of a man who's already been tired of the tale.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.500
They need to hold you.

25:34.500 --> 25:39.500
It's way we can move in my case, it's been possible to try to move.

25:39.500 --> 25:44.500
The man who's been here, I was very surprised, because there's a lot of commitment on the wall.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.500
So, I'm getting asked on that.

25:47.500 --> 25:51.500
I'm going to look for any of the things that I have been trying to minimize,

25:51.500 --> 25:53.500
and the danger of a kind of a government being.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.500
But I'm sure you wouldn't want to.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.500
I, as a parent to me, at least I hope I've been getting the idea.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.500
I just want to get these things spread out so we can determine responsibility for them,

26:02.500 --> 26:04.500
not once and all, again.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.500
That's right, isn't it?

26:06.500 --> 26:09.500
Now, as I said, there was no evidence of espionage.

26:09.500 --> 26:13.500
There's at least no indictments for espionage, and you quite often point out to me

26:13.500 --> 26:18.500
that espionage and conspiracy to commit our espionage are different things.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.500
I agree.

26:19.500 --> 26:26.500
If you uncover any evidence that was backed up or even support and indictments for our conspiracy

26:26.500 --> 26:31.500
to commit espionage, there was sufficient evidence for us to submit it to the FBI.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.500
And if the FBI do you now always take any action?

26:33.500 --> 26:35.500
I assume that they are taking action.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.500
You assume that they are, but as of this moment, you...
