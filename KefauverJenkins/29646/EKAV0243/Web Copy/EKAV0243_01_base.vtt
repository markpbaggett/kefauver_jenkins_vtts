WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I would like to begin this morning, once more by welcoming the guests who have come to

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
the committee room.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
We have you here.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
I want to call your attention if you are here for the first time who are extending to

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
the committee room, which has to go throughout these areas.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
They will forbid any possible manifestations of approval or dis approval of any time,

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
and any time from my guest in the other room.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
And the committee has instructed the chair and the chair has instructed the uniform members of the Capitol Police

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
and the same folks that were gathered in the other room.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
That they are able to remove immediately from the committee room, lightly but firmly.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
Any one of you who have reason best known to yourself, you have to violate the terms under which you

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
entered the room, namely to conduct yourself as ladies and gentlemen and to refrain from

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
interfering with the procedure by making possible manifestations of approval or dis approval.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Now that we are defending service, we are happy to have you here.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
And I'm sure that all of you will comply with the committee rule, just as all your federal audiences

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
have already complied with it with very, very splendid 100% cooperation.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
And the chair we followed, which includes him, was a day that was Mr. Wolf and Mr. Sinclair's time to have

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
ten minutes.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
And so we will begin with them on the go-around before doing so.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I have stood in out.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
But some of the judges have detained the ladies, meeting of the appropriations committee,

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
where they are lightly up the bill, as announced yesterday, now the party will be followed

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
around, but we will be back to this noon.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
I am sure that as colleague, Mr. Dwayne Sack and Senator McClellan will be here shortly.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
Now Mr. Wells, if you want to proceed with ten minutes, Mr. Sinclair, you have a very nice first this month.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
Mr. Collin, yesterday, we were on the subject of whether Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adam

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
cooperate with the human third of a party and the conduct of the important moments of investigation.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
And I believe it's better to say that this question then, so I'll rate you, pretty well,

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
thumbs up your testimony.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
If that's not so, I'm sure you'll tell me.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
I ask you, well, Mr. Collin, Mrs. On page 5825.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Well, Mr. Collin, let me see if we can do this rather simply.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Can you tell me whether or not Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adam cooperate with you with important moments?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Can you answer one?

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Mr. Sinclair, do some extent yes, and do some extent no, sir.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Is that the fairer picture of your testimony on the evidence?

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
I don't know, but it's a family same very very, once again, I'm sure that answer to a very long problem.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Well, you would stand by in the answer in the next one, Jim.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
With a lot of qualifications, which you don't want to hear now.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Well, the purposes of moving along, I think it's a pretty accurate family.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
As I thought, I think I said on the record before that both here and the other hearings

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
that we have high cooperation.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
I think I said on the record, so there's an incident which we have not had cooperation.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Well, that's what bothers me, Mr. Collin.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
You've seen the role of a modern co-run.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
But as it gets today, under all these statements, to some extent yes, to some extent no.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Is that right?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yes.

03:40.000 --> 03:49.000
Now, yesterday, when we adjourned, I was about ready to read to you a portion of the official report for this committee for December 8th.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
And I think you looked up with your coffee up and it's all right.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yes, I did.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
And on page 56, I want to read part of it to you.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
And as you, if you'll probably, I think maybe we can get along with it.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Sure, if you'd once go ahead.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I think it's probably May 56th.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Sure, you'd allow that further.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Hello, Kevin.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
And this is the chairman speaking.

04:10.000 --> 04:18.000
I think for the record, at this time, we should make it clear that we have been getting what I considered good cooperation from the Army.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
And all of the individuals who will be questioning here at the Zara-leds' town of Tactivities have been interviewed.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
So I'm then in the single call for number of the years.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
And the Army has indicated that they are judges and judges together at the bottom of this, and as we are,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
is not that collected, as you've come.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
And Mr. Cone, you ask, and yes, Mr. Chairman, absolutely.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yes.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
When you went there to do not today, that the Army has been absolutely cooperative with you in this matter,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
doesn't it?

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
I think the point there was that the people were, you said it spoke for itself.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Sure.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
The people who were being called, if they spoke for itself, Mr. Cone, it speaks for itself.

05:00.000 --> 05:13.000
Mr. Cone, this is simply as possible in having a gentleman's agreement here that some of the witnesses have to, even if you don't like these answers, give me a lot of information.

05:13.000 --> 05:23.000
I can't believe that that's the proper procedure unless the witness consumes too much time on answer, but he does not feel that the witness is morning and made in the long answers, and he thinks it is proper.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
And questions to ask, the witness should be at the given opportunity to complete a single sentence in the book.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
Well, if the witness wants to go beyond the end of the idea, he's not going to speak for itself.

05:37.000 --> 05:51.000
I, of course, will thousand of Chairman Rue, on all of the statements, thank you very much, the point was that people who were being exposed had come in there before the President Administration, which is largely correct.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
And I would further stand by the statement. We have received cooperation in getting these people in and interrogating them from the Cleveland Criminal Auditor.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
And then, if the statement were finally, I would put a direct jurisdiction to the very next stage.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
When the public's too likely to find, will you indicate if Mr. Adam is an instant where we thought he was not cooperating with the committee?

06:12.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, let's talk about a long and I'm December 15th. Now, the signal that we're going to be proceeding to this subcommittee, which is on page 191 that we're going to share together.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
I would like to read to you another statement from the Chairman, which apparently was made in your presence.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
And then, by the Chairman, I have, of course, made Senator McCarthy, who says it's power.

06:37.000 --> 06:50.000
I may say, just so this will not be interpreted as an attack upon Secretary Steven, or those who are now inside, they have been cooperating fully with us.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
And I think our justice concern, if we are, about the very, very unusual picture that is unfold.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
More important, they are doing something about it.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
And then Senator McCarthy said, call on my equipment.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
No, you were there when the chairman of the chairman of the 15th. Yes, no doubt, sir.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
You were there, weren't you? The record says I'm sure I was.

07:13.000 --> 07:22.000
And you heard Senator McCarthy say that Mr. Stevens and those in charge had been cooperating fully and I emphasize the word fully Mr. Cohn.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Yes, so I heard him say that.

07:24.000 --> 07:32.000
Now, how do you say it? How do you handle this opposition that under all of you say that they cooperated to some extent?

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
And to some extent they didn't. And yet the chairman said, and McCarthy on December 15th said they cooperated fully.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Now, there are some certain statements to you. Yes, I am.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
You consider those to be consistent.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yes.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Do you want me to go?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
No, I haven't asked you any further questions.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Rather than whether or not you consider those to be consistent.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
So I will. Any time you want me to answer that, I will.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
Now, speaking of the situation that forced Manuel, there was a lot of talk about,

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
was there not Mr. Cohn during the course of the hearings?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yes, sir.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Is it third of state so that we can cover a rather large subject rather briefly?

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
That the F.D. knows it was being referred to as F.D. knows that had occurred in the past.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
No, sir.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
That is not very state?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
No.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
Is it your position, Mr. Cohn, that in the course of your hearings you have suffered evidence that you would consider as a lawyer evidence?

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
I have been asked that was frankly being committed at Fort Marlowe.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Mr. Cohn, I can answer that if it.

08:44.000 --> 08:56.000
By that one here in some detail, for the witnesses we have and the evidence we have for those we uncovered a situation of people who have been found to be security risks and some units of affiliations.

08:56.000 --> 09:11.000
Just a hearing of documents and other things, but certainly would give a reasonable person more as to whether or not there was carimets to unage, whether or not the situation was right for F.D. unage,

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
from the concerned that was a dangerous situation.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Is the car going to be a significant danger in situations?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Before I investigate, I would say very much so.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Mr. Cohn, of course, if you investigate.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I would say very often.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
You join the Honourable Court of Justice, the one talking about action that happened back in prior years.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
No, I think the thing started back when the Julius Rosenberg rings, went to work down at Fort Marlowe.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, when did Julius Rosenberg go to work at Fort Marlowe?

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
Uh, by the authority, he joined the, and I could be wrong, that he joined the single call around 1940-41.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm sorry, but he went to slow down at Fort Marlowe.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
After that, he was faced with signal, the signal, he was faced to slow it out yet.

09:53.000 --> 10:03.000
Once the Marlowe's from time to time remained in the single call working at Marlowe's subsidiaries and sub-installations through the year 1945.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
From correct.

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
Well, the matter of fact is, he was at Fort Marlowe's at a school for a period of ten months in 1941, isn't that right?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yes, I think that's right.

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
So, after he was connected with the single call and fill it out until 1945.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
That's where he might have been faced, I know he was over at Marlowe's, I know he was a story of other single call installations.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Well, at least until 1945.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Yes.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
When was the apprehended search in the 1950s, I believe?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
1940-49 or 1950s.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
That was certainly long before Mr. Stevens was in the army.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Oh, yes.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
I think it was the 1950s.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
I can read for you, sir, and you hear testimony that you think you found evidence of espionage and being considered.

10:48.000 --> 10:56.000
I already told you from the New York Times of Wednesday, November 18th written by Mr. William Arsson that it's written certain statements to Senator McCarty.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Now, I'll read part of it.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
You'll have to trust me, Mr. Regent.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
I'll show you what.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
Robert King's team, Secretary of the Army, agreed yet today with Senator Joseph Lama-Carty, Republican and Wisconsin.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Now, that's the large interference in the single call of adversary, the Fourth Lama's New Jersey.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
That extended through the four-year, then possibly has late as 1951.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yes, sir.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Now, 1951 was long before the Stevens administration of the Army.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Isn't that right?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So, I'd like to look at that article as well.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Certainly, you may have it.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
What's your hand, sir?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Yes, 1951 is before Mr. Stevens administration.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
I thought there was something about not knowing when it stopped for how long after the war continued to something like that for the fifth stop.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
Well, you're trying to say that there was sufficient domestic violence?

11:44.000 --> 11:53.000
I think it's a little more than sufficient, so I believe we had some witnesses before the Stutt Committee who refused to tell the Stutt Committee under oath.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Whether there was, I see an eye, I was taught by a moment.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Certainly.

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
Claiming the system amendment on the ground, their answers as to whether there was, I see an eye, a panic fort, my men.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Or whether they were engaged in a conspiracy to commit, I see an eye, a moment.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
On the ground, they were going to take truth to answer those questions, their answers might tend to show that they don't deal with crime.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
And frankly, that's enough to put me on notice right there, and there were a number of other circumstances.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
The Washington family, that Mr. Cohn, isn't it true that that was a 35-odd case to the Stutt Committee?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
That was suspended at Fort Manda.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Not one of them pledged to dismiss the amendment.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I don't know the name for the 35.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I didn't ask you the name, it wasn't about a two-spaper.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I don't know whether it is or not, it's too far.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
You are referring to persons who claim to dismiss the amendment.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
And isn't it true that not one of them for a year is a Fort Manda?

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
I think I'd rather say that it may well be in this first place.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
She's thinking you have to admit.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Any sentence in my right hand?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Any sentence in my left hand?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Yes, I have.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
I would like to take 10 minutes, I have for a personal provision.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Here, I'm going to tell you the next slide.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I'd like to take 10 minutes.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
The real letter, by me, is very short.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
Mr. Chairman, I have decided to testify on those before this committee.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
And therefore I am addressing the following letter,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
the Senator McCarthy and other leaders.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Theary Senator McCarthy, on yesterday, you agreed to take the stand,

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
to testify on those with reference to the matters considered by the Stutt Committee

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
on privileges and elections of the United States Senate.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
You will recall the Committee was chaired by Senator Henning,

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
and although the press were made to you to appear before it,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
you persistently refuse.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
You agreed to do this if I would take the stand with respect to my connections and dealings,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
with Secretary Stevens and Mr. Claude Griffith,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
which have been specified through in the present proceedings.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
I have considered your statement, and I present here with the plan by Richard Chandee-Caridout.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
I believe that I will have performed a public service of overwhelming importance.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
If any action of mine can induce you to enter under oath,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
the allegation formally preferred against you by the Stutt Committee,

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
and the wish you have here to fall persistently refused to respond,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
except to the noun the Stutt Committee.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Accordingly, I have proposed that we agree on the following points.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
One, you will agree to an investigation by a committee of descendants

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
to be afforded by the vice president upon recommendation of the majority and minority leaders of the Senate.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
Despite your previous refusal, you will agree to testify under oath before this committee,

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
and to furnish your all relevant documents and materials without regard to any immunity or privilege.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
This investigation will cover the following subject,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
for all of which are included in your report of the Stutt Committee.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
One, whether under the circumstances it was offered for Senator McCarty to receive $10,000 from the left-hand corporation.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Two, whether funds to fly to Senator McCarty to fight time and rhythm

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
or for other specific purposes were diverting to his own use.

15:18.000 --> 15:27.000
Three, whether Senator McCarty used close associates and members of his family to speak with each income, commodity and stock speculations,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
another financial transaction for all Syrian movies.

15:30.000 --> 15:37.000
Four, whether Senator McCarty's activities on behalf of certain special interests of his housing,

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
sugar and China were motivated by self-interest.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
Five, whether loan or other transactions Senator McCarty had with apples and safe banks or others

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
involved violation of the tax and banking law.

15:49.000 --> 15:59.000
Six, whether Senator McCarty violated federal and state force practice act in connection with his 1944-1946 federal campaign

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
or in connection with his dealings with Rain Chairman.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
Three, this investigation will prevent the June as the number of the committee are appointed and all available.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
If you will agree to the full going, I will agree to take the stand in the present proceedings

16:14.000 --> 16:22.000
and to testify out to my conversations and dealings with Secretary Steven and Mr. Clark Fluffer relating to the events

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
and the proceedings, the interpretation of these hearings.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
I thought that you will confirm your agreement with this program.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
If you are in a forwarded place, time is indicated below.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
Senator here is a letter and if you will sign it, then we can get this matter settled.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Senator McCarty, please.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Yes.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Senator Arthur.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Senator McCarty.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
I present the man here to get the bill.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
Mr. Clark, the letter is 490-1946 for the committee.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
And the chair is kept in the room and it's kept in the room and it's time to sign it.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
Which I think all will agree that there's nothing but the one we do with the country that's been here for the issue.

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
But you complied with the effect of the chair and it's time to sign it with the action area that's won for a final presentation on court.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
I said, I don't see how I can get you a final presentation of provisions to be getting the possession.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Nobody said anything about it.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I wish you wait and show it.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You're trying to come.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
You will have your time now in about two minutes because it goes immediately too late.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
So it's very good.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
There's a very strict smear, a little bit of smirking.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
No fanciest now, the one who first will go with it.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
He has raised everything now with the very stricters.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I think the chair is two minutes too late.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
So I'm tired of the chair.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I can't have you in my hands.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I'm going to have a wonderful, well-offer.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I'm going to have a few long hours of the work.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I'll question the right-handed submission.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I'm going to have a quick conversation.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Mr. Trump is going to have a quick conversation.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
I think the only thing that people can see how low the man can think.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I have a quick conversation.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
I'm going to have a quick conversation.

18:08.000 --> 18:16.000
He's an athlete who's come before the committee and gives the information that she has in regards to investigation.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
He's encouraged by saying that he wants all the old students who are here.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Now I say this Mr. Chairman.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
If that is necessary, you know what I said?

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
If you just find the humanist family, that will be done.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
If he writes presents, if he writes presents, what is enough?

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I want the order committee.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
So investigate the information.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
If they ask me to touch the plan, I will appear.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
And that is a time for me.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
I will not find any Mr. Trump in the matter as far as.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
But it was never seen.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
While looking for nothing to do with this theory,

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
keep in order to get to find him to be a decent, honest individual

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
and get on the plan and get over the subject of criteria for the major telephone troops like in cross-examination.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
I will do all of those things in the world.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You have that interest.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
The creation of a special committee.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
I will now consent to go before that special committee.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
Now be glad to answer any of these smears that appeared in the daily work there anyplace else.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
What does that make me think?

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
Has intelligence been up in the world as far he brings up as nothing to do with this theory?

19:34.000 --> 19:42.000
He knows that now it has appeared just so clear to the American people that he is the individual.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
He got the chief advisor of the Democat Party, Underground to be seen.

19:49.000 --> 19:56.000
An honest secretary of the amings, who most masters to be rough,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
does his politics, he might run into it.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Mr. Simon DeMiro is the Mr. Peter.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
All trade on a beast, relocation, to come before the committee.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Then give us the truth.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
He knows that he is not to do that.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
That is the primary agent of Christ's booklets.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
Now, Simon can simply just go for a trade of going on with the plan and taking the oath.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
But then I say Mr. Chairman, we take an additional vote.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
He is not, we will remain investigate.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And I don't investigate about him.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
Investigate about his failure as anyone should reach by meeting the administration.

20:34.000 --> 20:41.000
If there is anything against me, they should be able to present that to our grain jury they did not.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
He now raises the frameless smears as right way.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
But it will be just a clear Mr. Chairman.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
He is misdeferred to form a special committee.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
To reinvestigate those smears, to get to do something and understand,

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
as I understand the fate of the family, as I have taken it, as my Republican colleagues have taken it,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
I will now make the firm commitment to go before that committee.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
I will claim no signings and documents.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And it will work out here.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I will ask the court for a first and foremost.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
May the chair say it.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Mr. Chairman, the chair still has the floor.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
The chair is going to recognize you, but the chair would like to say,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
if we are going to continue this mid-morning measures every month.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
First, you or the senator McCarty, say something about the other.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
And then saying, now I have a point of which we will do it.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
It is very difficult for the chair to know how to stop that kind of waste of time,

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
as it is necessary to the members of the committee are concerned in the country of the chair.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Because I can do the best I can to keep it in balance that is wrong.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
Normally, when somebody is attacked, a point of personal privilege is granted

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
as a person to defend himself.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
It is not the usual procedure for them to give the attack another point of personal privilege.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
But I am trying to do this thing as accurately as I can,

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
from the very point of the chair, who believes that the use of waste of time

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
takes place, but will have no control over the temperance of the justices of the words of yourself.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
So, rather as a chair, it is all I can do now.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
If you say that I will grant you a point of personal privilege,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
I suppose you are going to use it to attack Senator McCarty,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
then he will have to have a point of personal privilege.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
So, whatever time you can see my words here and then get neither of you,

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
any more personal privilege, I shall need to continue your personal duty this morning.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Mr. Chair, may I have a moment?

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
I have listened carefully to what you have said.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
Now, I will be glad to wait in accordance to your wishes until my time comes.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Thank you very much.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I appreciate that.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
You didn't say that Senator McCarty would have come.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Senator McCarty, you have come in as to which to be trying to get to it.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
No problem.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
So, I'll pardon the eye of Senator McCarty.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I have hungers in my left, my first chance.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I have some opportunity to wait for my time.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
But there are some exactly ways to come in here.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
It's coming in a minute.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I'm very sorry about all of this.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I say I appreciate the chair.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
I believe the chair is playing one of the most important abs than this morning.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
I was touched by the four other committee on the board of directors and views.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
I would like to thank Mr. Chairman that I have to be asked to ask for

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
for the proper commitment to convene the board of directors

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
and the senate which morning that I asked to do a special time on President Trump before.

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
I don't know how early I can return with that to noon, but that will be the occasion of my absence.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
If I am absent looking after this legislation, I will not have to leave this place at the start.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm happy to see you today and I have mentioned earlier about that.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
I'd like to tell a reason people to understand one thing because we want the country to know

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
that there is much interest in these arrangements as many members have concerned as of.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
We are reaching that stage in the station of Congress now.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
Whether I commend this important bill, as they go to the office, in the middle of the floor,

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
every morning and every afternoon, making it virtually impossible for there to be the full attendance

24:17.000 --> 24:24.000
of the hearings which has been impossible to maintain as a rather unusual record of tonight.

24:24.000 --> 24:31.000
At one reason, all of a sudden, through a country enthusiast we try to establish a termination date for the hearings

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
and a list of witnesses so that we can know and measure our time as against this tremendously important duty

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
all of a step to attend you on the full time.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
And the chair will excuse any of its knowledge of court at any time when they have massive

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
revital concerns to their particular specialization or their particular state.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Because these are not the floor attendings.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Not going to be like that, do you have time minutes to which to interrogate the list?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Hi.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
If you want to use it otherwise you have to write a recommendation to the list.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, from the personal few, to the myself and Mr. Framington.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
I want to make it clear that there is no personal few.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
I have never been trying to get the information from Mr. Framington.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
That year was really close to the great deal now.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
I think I would have been able to understand here's the situation in terms of time and needs.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
I would even even encourage it to list this or that if you're welcome,

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
it's time I wouldn't like to have you explain it to you up again right now with my voice.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
Well, I think Mr. Chairman, I'm due to the fact that I have seen Mr. Framington

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
wrote a letter that she had not sent to me, which I've never received,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
since I have shown with the clarity of my card,

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
except for it all that I'm looking at, not some of the many.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
Mr. Framington did the GnRF8 read it well.

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
I believe that I have a settle now to make some similar things.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Well, I have my own account, you have only five different fingers.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Well, I have my own account.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I'll put this in the form of a customer.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Look at that.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Mr. Chairman.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
Mr. Cone, this is the developer.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
Well, remember what you were here for reference and trust upon being a judge?

26:18.000 --> 26:26.000
As I had back down, I had been dealt with by a man with his partner

26:26.000 --> 26:34.000
for five years last week, for conspiring to install his government support in Brown.

26:35.000 --> 26:41.000
He had appeared for a number of years ago, and I'll be calling the year back for a year,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
so he's 43.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
So this man, the gentleman, has been convicted for that time,

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
made a public brag about the fact that he was remembered to come to his spare face.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Call of the great.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
He had appeared for that one of the men who asked to be a judge here.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
The author of that man with the stripes was the attempt to get higher wages for the working man,

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
to bring you to see him, whereby instead of getting the working man higher wages,

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
he gave me to accept an affectionate amount of money each month,

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
of these man's paychecks, which reduced the wages,

27:23.000 --> 27:31.000
and that's a matter of condition the stripes have called off,

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
and that this man who brags about being a communist,

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
was part of a steady fraud with one of these judges here,

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
and trust upon being a judge,

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
and there's some of the steady fraud conflicts we announced,

27:47.000 --> 27:54.000
and one of the things that is just was the deceleration of the common man,

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
the deceleration of the commoners,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
starting and forming the commoners' association,

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
whether they saw the announcement,

28:02.000 --> 28:12.000
wouldn't it say that that might possibly give some slight fits to the American people

28:12.000 --> 28:19.000
as the by-law judge this morning comes on the fan and receives all the old smears,

28:19.000 --> 28:28.000
why he tried so hard and got the huge advantage of the Democrats' credit

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
to force an end to our investigation of communists,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
which he has defeated in doing.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
That's best for my bloated to long,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
with the total effort to answer it.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Thank you very much.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
I want you all to report it to the police.

28:48.000 --> 28:56.000
No one has no other question to tell you how you have been.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Well, I'm totally ahead of this film.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
I think my last question to you was,

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
if it wasn't the truth that the 35 persons who were suspended from fourth Marnaissance,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
that September and October,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
not one of them, but the 35th Amendment.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
As you know that far as I know that, right?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
That's right.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
There were some persons who pledged a fifth amendment in the course of those investigations,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
that's also true and all fair and few, isn't that right?

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
He asked that it went a little deeper than that, Mr. St. Claes.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Some of those persons worked at places near Fort Monmouth,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
which were doing work for Fort Monmouth,

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
such as the Federal Telecommunications Laboratory,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
down at Nuffley.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
On December 16th, we had a lady with a tap secret clearance, I believe,

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
who involved the fifth amendment and conservedly to commit espionage.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
That was room for vengeance, right?

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
Now, federal telecommunications laboratory sounds like,

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
it's one of those elusive names that if you look into it,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
you might think it's a department of the government,

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
but it is not as well, yes and no.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
It's owned by the International Telephone and Telephone Company.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
I believe it's just about 100%,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
it's just about 100%,

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
the fence will work for the United States government,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
so I suppose it has that in-between status.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
But it's not under the direct control of the army.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
No, that's right.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
And she pledged a fifth amendment, that right?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah, by the way, I better say,

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
here the International Telephone and Telephone Company has cooperated fully.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Well, we're under investigation about that.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
We're under investigation, then.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
They are sensitive.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Well, now this lady has a top secret clearance, you say.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
She had a top secret clearance, then she was doing work on other secret work,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
and she has pretty much the run of a flight, I believe, on secret.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Well, I just wanted to ask you this question.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Next clearance was not a clearance given by the army.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Well, I think this top secret was an Air Force clearance.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
I think she also did a secret work on Army Signet Forward.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
I could be wrong.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
I don't know.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Well, I'm just trying to get this thing in some understandable form.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
The young lady did not work at Fort Monmouth.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
That's what we all agree on.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
She worked at the...

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
She had a clearance that was not given by the army.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
That week in the green on.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
No, I can't agree on that.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
I think that I do equal.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
Well, all right, if we can't agree on it, let's have some other things.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
And she worked at the federal telecommunications laboratory,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
which is in nutley, majority of some 50 miles away.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Right. Right. Right.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Now...

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
We've had...

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
...
