00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
What's with that? What's with Malafo?

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
Well, I hope you like it.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
I hope you like it.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm buying my load.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Thank you.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
The man is just here.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm here for this.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
It's difficult to identify.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Go down the other way.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
You're going out to the fire.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
I'm going out to the fire.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
No.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I'm going out to the fire.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm going out to the fire.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm going out to the fire.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
I'm going out to the fire.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
And uh...

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm going out to the fire.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Have a nice, deep breath.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
I have a little bit of a deep breath.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
I have a' got me'd.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
A' been for me.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I have a chuck up a dot.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Are there questions about that?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
A' be gone by picking us outta here Varadjsasrbwe.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Our answers are clear.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
This is a trading post.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
25% of stake inflation has been shut down in a 54 hog.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
weeks Thousand miners have a little bit of decranced out.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.000
72 banks are going through a感謝.

00:50.000 --> 00:50.000


00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
And $3 of 5 delta euro is going to be cheered down right here.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
And this is sao effect phase.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
But I can't even say where you want to keep me up.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
My thousand-percent relationship has worked out.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I have said it was taking a ton.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
I was there in my night and I slept at 4.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
And the guy at 4.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I was there for a few days at 4.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
And I haven't been there in 4.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I was there.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I was joining 4.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I was there.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I was there.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I was there.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I have a few years in New York.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm November 5th.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Because I go to the beach.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm going to sleep.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I alerted the rich-匪ores, but...

01:25.000 --> 01:42.000
I dial with my time,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
and I'm not a doctor.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm not a doctor.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm not a doctor.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I don't know how many times I've marked it just like in the sky,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
but so you might have sprained your eye,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
but I know my best place for a long time in the future.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I will keep waiting.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Right, the bus driver is expecting my group,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
my phone is early, but not even a bus.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Right now, right over here, the bus driver,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
where are you now, the bus?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
The bus driver's early on,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
not sneaking up the bus,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
but I'm sure,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
it's not a familiar hour.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
What I've said some of the parties before,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
we could try to get around,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
not the news, not the world,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
and not the number 14.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
You will have to make peace with the service of the people

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
and you just start a business.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
No, I'm not the first person to start a business.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I will be right about it.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I'll give you my time now.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
This is beautiful.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
It's a beautiful spot.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's a beautiful city.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
It's a beautiful spot.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Shine.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Wait for a moment.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
The modern world is being the furniture.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm from King New England here,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
this best location of one of New York's best.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I'll be putting in some people, not.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
This beautiful, beautiful,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
shining shine.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Everyone just left you with a beautiful,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I'll stick my foot in the line.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I'll stick you in.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
This best detail of the art.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
How you release this weapon in which you start

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
with no curve at the end of your mama.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
How did you let you found out

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
on the battle that the tender was just beneath?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Tell you all your stuff in your heart position.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
And how you place that face of your mouth

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
with the effect of some of the rounds

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
around you including your face.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
This best place of art is in your eyes, please.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
How do you have to stand?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Change your face with a little piece of music.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
How do you have to stand?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
How do you have to stand?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I did a sick close round of the world.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Continue your mind, how do you see?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
This is a complete run across the nation.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
For the number of who might start?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
How do you think that I'm glad?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
How do you think that you're such a good athlete?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
How do you think that you're such a good athlete?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
How do you think that you're good at?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
That's what I don't think there was any change.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
How do you throw it out?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
How do you think that you're good at?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
How do you do, I said.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
How are you?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
You out there.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
What other people wants?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Tell me what.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
That's what I had to say.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
That's exactly what I was looking for.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
How are you pointing at me.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Dye your eyes to fazem as Spicy tea,pecially spicy.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You've heard another thought that might be forbidden

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
to�Billun.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
It's a fact that scatting generally is an investigationяти part of this,

04:30.000 --> 04:30.000


04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
but it's not that.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Let's be gentle with that eye, by the thought of funny.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
We even do make a littleあります by this.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I felt the bad last night.

04:44.000 --> 04:52.000
I felt what was back to the last meeting of November 6th in my office.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
Where the sun is for the world, my life, in gray for the start of my life.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
I was going to go away,

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
with that eye, I was going to just bump into the costume.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
And I was going to be standing there with that around.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I was going to be with you in the first place.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I was going to be there.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I was going to be wearing our clothes,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
and I was just giving them this key.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I need work.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'll be by the feet.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I need to put cover to the side.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I need to put it in my face.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I need my eyes open to the bathroom.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Open the bathroom.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Open the floor.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
There's nobody in the body of Edward.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
What about Edward?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Where's Edward?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Where's Edward?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Where's Edward?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Where's Edward?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Where's Edward?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Where's Edward?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Where's Edward?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Where's Edward?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh, Edward's close немного.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
There's someone in the perfect position across the restroom.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Check out these blackouts.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Look, Edward's gone.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Two guys.

07:04.000 --> 07:17.820
Why's Edward's

07:17.820 --> 07:19.820
mediums?

07:19.820 --> 07:22.820
I can prep Edentine's Lawyer that's gone.

07:22.820 --> 07:23.860
Never free of charge and only D swift action.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.860
I'm not free of charge.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.860
I'm not free of charge and I'm not free of charge.

07:27.860 --> 07:29.860
Look, Edward.

07:29.860 --> 07:31.860
I'm not free of charge and I'm not free of charge.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.860
Look, Edward.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.860
I'm not free of charge and I'm not free of charge.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.860
Look, Edward.

07:37.860 --> 07:39.860
If we show how we have it,

07:39.860 --> 07:41.860
about the usage of the enemy's capabilities,

07:41.860 --> 07:45.860
that's a power of the most powerful of the fellow students

07:45.860 --> 07:47.860
for most of the enemy's.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.860
They are.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.860
I would condition that you're under arrest for the time

08:51.860 --> 08:53.860
of the day.

08:53.860 --> 08:55.860
Well, I suppose that's how we do it.

08:55.860 --> 08:59.860
On the other hand, we do a job.

08:59.860 --> 09:01.860
We're proud.

09:01.860 --> 09:03.860
I would say that.

09:03.860 --> 09:05.860
I'm here with you today.

09:05.860 --> 09:07.860
I'm here with you tonight.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.860
I want you to come.

09:09.860 --> 09:11.860
Why do you think this is just a business?

09:11.860 --> 09:13.860
You're just not a bad person.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.860
You're just not a bad person.

09:15.860 --> 09:17.860
You're just a bad person.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.860
I'm not free of charge and I'm not free of charge.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.860
I would evoke you if I left for a bit and though,

09:21.860 --> 09:23.860
I would paws back into the piss of women they are.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.860
I'd love for better qualifications.

09:25.860 --> 09:26.860
My son is pretty much measuring the relation

09:26.860 --> 09:28.860
as it is available.

09:28.860 --> 09:29.860
I—

09:29.860 --> 09:30.860
I would say you're—

09:30.860 --> 09:32.860
You'd love for freeingers,

09:32.860 --> 09:33.340
persons with heart when we are in 돈ig on

09:33.340 --> 09:35.860
our market in Badgello?

09:35.860 --> 09:37.860
I would say you were.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.860
I have to say, one can pay a dime as your officer.

09:40.860 --> 09:41.860
But...

09:44.860 --> 09:48.900
You were mascara flew invented into Seulemera in Obama.

09:48.900 --> 09:52.900
I have to have a blink of an eye to the fin.

09:52.900 --> 09:56.420
You have to take the window back to get another mirror back to the owner

09:56.420 --> 10:11.080
and get files of the person passing by me to set the

10:11.080 --> 10:13.660
bench on.

10:13.660 --> 10:20.820
If you look at a warning life during a screening, you have to be speaking

13:50.820 --> 13:54.820
I can make you part of order as a request of a question the ask by possible

13:54.820 --> 13:58.820
The chair has to be a request of your own

13:58.820 --> 14:00.820
The chair has to be a request of your own

14:00.820 --> 14:04.820
But for me now, I'm counting on the rest of the action

14:04.820 --> 14:07.820
I've got things going on, I'm going to start by a lot of stuff

14:07.820 --> 14:10.820
The chair has to be a request of your own

14:10.820 --> 14:12.820
But for me as a reason, I'm going to start today

14:12.820 --> 14:18.820
Now it's the evening you are told about the events of October 20th

14:18.820 --> 14:22.820
When you say there was an exhibition on the Piavero Rai call, is that correct?

14:22.820 --> 14:26.820
Yes, that was a birthday, a lot of bad nameless, but my nameless

14:26.820 --> 14:32.820
When he was not ashamed to go, I was holding a photo seat

14:32.820 --> 14:40.820
And you were told the substance of statements made by Mr. Corn on the occasion, were you not?

14:40.820 --> 14:42.820
Yes, sir

15:12.820 --> 15:18.820
But not at all, I was not a human and also a question came about what it is about

15:18.820 --> 15:20.820
Whether or not we're going to power or not

15:20.820 --> 15:24.820
I said that I like to take care of it

15:24.820 --> 15:28.820
But I said it's right, if I wasn't sure that it was a birthday or a letter

15:28.820 --> 15:32.820
It's a memory of a reason that's seen in the battle of the Kihanna

15:32.820 --> 15:36.820
Well, I was sitting back there, so I was in time available

15:36.820 --> 15:40.820
To go to have a choice in the club, we're going to see in place about this instance for a while

15:40.820 --> 15:45.820
But I made that off the spot, I was sitting and I was looking at the number of things in the battle

15:45.820 --> 15:47.820
But I didn't mean to mess with the matter, I didn't mean to mess with the matter

15:47.820 --> 15:50.820
I didn't mean to mess with the matter, I didn't mean to mess with the matter, I didn't mean to mess with the corner

15:50.820 --> 15:52.820
And you went on

15:54.820 --> 15:58.820
Well, the government made sure that the Prime Minister was going to say

15:58.820 --> 16:01.820
From the day he sees the event, I will say when he's out

16:01.820 --> 16:04.820
When you're laid on the fence, the furlough

16:05.820 --> 16:10.820
You can go over and make a speech like this, even if you're not in the safe, it's only going to get another party

16:11.820 --> 16:16.820
I have a message for you, so I can come through to come up here and tell you

16:16.820 --> 16:21.820
I don't know, so I'm trying to re-state that fall over

16:21.820 --> 16:23.820
So whatever, fall a year is the last word

16:23.820 --> 16:27.820
I knew that I am not telling the same numbers as long on the one hand

16:27.820 --> 16:30.820
And I said to the Prime Minister, I have done my desire

16:30.820 --> 16:33.820
I tried to think through the students' face, but I didn't post

16:34.820 --> 16:40.820
I was just saying the question is, why did you renewing the education that the Army took to?

16:40.820 --> 16:45.820
That all that is dangerous, I think you have done what you thought was right and right

16:45.820 --> 16:51.820
In the terms of all of the stuff, I'm going to return to the speaker's side by all of your life

16:51.820 --> 16:56.820
I think that's because what you can be confused is the fact that we are now

16:56.820 --> 17:01.820
If it's possible there's not an agreement, if it's possible there's no one that's not in your life

17:01.820 --> 17:03.820
Third of all, life

17:03.820 --> 17:09.820
If it's just there's no one that's not in your life, then it's possible there's no one that's in your first house

17:09.820 --> 17:16.820
If it's not okay to leave it, I have a question as it would either mind a side answer, work with, committee to talk

17:16.820 --> 17:18.820
I have no problem

17:18.820 --> 17:22.820
If the Prime Minister was really going to be an executive, come on

17:23.820 --> 17:27.820
I don't know if that's any way a sense of the style of investigation

17:27.820 --> 17:32.820
I've been from the Black Power line with you right now, I see it coming from the other side

17:32.820 --> 17:35.820
That's where it's happening, I have to take straight from my other side

17:35.820 --> 17:41.820
I don't know what I'm trying to say, but the same thing, I don't know if I'm not doing anything to let the right person use our life in it

17:41.820 --> 17:43.820
I think it's a good idea

17:43.820 --> 17:44.820
I think it's a good idea

17:44.820 --> 17:46.820
I know it was an effort on my fire

17:46.820 --> 17:50.820
The fluid over, I think you like it, but just a comment there

17:50.820 --> 17:54.820
I'm trying to load it out of hand and try to lift it to hell with it

17:54.820 --> 17:59.820
I just do whole things with this way, and by the way, I like to start a whole hurry of the line

17:59.820 --> 18:05.820
But with this thought I was feeling with the family, feeling with the people that are alive, and that's what I have to do

18:05.820 --> 18:08.820
The word is a comment over there, I will see you soon

18:08.820 --> 18:09.820
I will put it back

18:09.820 --> 18:13.820
Did you know, I looked at a thing, I feel the black eye, I know I really thought it was that

18:13.820 --> 18:18.820
Have you ran under this object, the right of these broken took place, I don't know if it's that

18:18.820 --> 18:21.820
Sorry, we're coming in the army

18:21.820 --> 18:23.820
May you call her

18:23.820 --> 18:27.820
I'd do a high-ranking officer, but I'm certified

18:27.820 --> 18:34.820
The way it is, it takes us in, so Mr. Kong, why do we have to give her to him?

18:34.820 --> 18:36.820
Have you ran under your head for that?

18:36.820 --> 18:37.820
I'm not there

18:37.820 --> 18:39.820
Have you forgotten anything?

18:40.820 --> 18:41.820
I'm sorry

18:41.820 --> 18:44.820
I was about to give a chance to please

18:44.820 --> 18:47.820
Then you can't want it, it's a last question

18:47.820 --> 18:49.820
If I were here, it's not possible

18:49.820 --> 18:51.820
We had to ask you if we were talking about Coral

18:51.820 --> 18:55.820
He's a king, he's a general officer, and he's a man

18:55.820 --> 18:59.820
But if I were to tell him, I'd like to find out where it's going to get me

18:59.820 --> 19:01.820
That was just a secret

19:01.820 --> 19:03.820
That's what you're saying

19:33.820 --> 19:35.820
I'm not the investigation

19:35.820 --> 19:40.820
And I'll fool him without fooling him in his own store

19:40.820 --> 19:43.820
What's the question?

19:43.820 --> 19:45.820
Give me a second piece of your soul

19:45.820 --> 19:48.820
That was the last question that I should be afraid

19:48.820 --> 19:51.820
But I'm not the gentleman, I'm the gentleman, I'm the first person

19:51.820 --> 19:53.820
I'm certainly planning this, I'm sure

19:53.820 --> 19:55.820
They're possible attention of me

19:55.820 --> 19:57.820
I wonder if I may look better than I thought

19:57.820 --> 20:00.820
That's what I'm about to say to her

20:00.820 --> 20:02.820
And I thought it's a good idea

20:02.820 --> 20:05.820
I was here, I was here, that's what I think

20:05.820 --> 20:09.820
That we were all properly trained to say our silver

20:09.820 --> 20:12.820
And we were following us

20:12.820 --> 20:15.820
And we had a hug in for a few months, every three weeks

20:15.820 --> 20:17.820
But it's been a very good week

20:17.820 --> 20:20.820
And the hug only took a few weeks

20:20.820 --> 20:22.820
And I was happy to hear how happy it was to be real

20:22.820 --> 20:24.820
So I think it was difficult

20:24.820 --> 20:26.820
It was better than I thought I was running

20:26.820 --> 20:29.820
And I was looking for the support to say how we were doing

20:29.820 --> 20:33.820
That's the most important thing I have ever seen

20:33.820 --> 20:35.820
For the fact that you have learned

20:35.820 --> 20:39.820
about the inspiration of the furniture I've been creating

20:39.820 --> 20:43.820
For as I've explained before, there are times

20:43.820 --> 20:45.820
I don't like the camera of the army over the head

20:45.820 --> 20:47.820
That's the thing that was bothering

20:47.820 --> 20:50.820
It wasn't the investigation itself

20:50.820 --> 20:52.820
And I want to find that I handle it

20:52.820 --> 20:55.820
And try to get a situation back into

21:25.820 --> 21:27.820
And I'm trying to find a place to hide

21:27.820 --> 21:29.820
And it's the thing that's for sure

21:29.820 --> 21:31.820
And maybe around the time

21:31.820 --> 21:33.820
I'm getting out of the public working for you

21:33.820 --> 21:35.820
That could wellrelated

21:35.820 --> 21:37.820
And try to make some noise

21:37.820 --> 21:39.820
And I thought it's better than the service

21:39.820 --> 21:41.820
That isn't what you want

21:41.820 --> 21:43.820
The other government's investigation

21:43.820 --> 21:45.820
Did his child

21:45.820 --> 21:47.820
That you had a child in your own

21:47.820 --> 21:49.820
How would you look out for your baby?

21:49.820 --> 21:51.820
That is a kid in the world

21:51.820 --> 21:54.820
Who is the deputy's deputy's deputy's deputy's deputy's

21:54.820 --> 22:00.820
I'm the deputy's deputy's deputy's deputy's deputy's deputy's deputy's deputy's deputy's

22:00.820 --> 22:02.820
I have not that one with that

22:02.820 --> 22:04.820
But there's a head with that

22:04.820 --> 22:06.820
I don't have that except before

22:06.820 --> 22:08.820
But I might be trying to make it even better

22:08.820 --> 22:10.820
If the last is a thirty

22:10.820 --> 22:12.820
And I want to press the last

22:12.820 --> 22:14.820
So now it's the hour of hope

22:14.820 --> 22:16.820
This is a day

22:16.820 --> 22:20.820
I don't have anything but paper to buy

22:20.820 --> 22:22.820
To beat your testimony of life's gravity

22:24.820 --> 22:26.820
That's like Dr. Steven

22:26.820 --> 22:28.820
It isn't so awful Mr. Jenkins

22:28.820 --> 22:30.820
But I think this is important

22:30.820 --> 22:34.820
That he respect to the matter that I mentioned before and made

22:34.820 --> 22:38.820
That having no hope for him is the army for justice to me

22:38.820 --> 22:42.820
Being in impression that there is just the amount of gunna be jail for

22:42.820 --> 22:44.820
Remember which I don't think was not so

22:44.820 --> 22:46.820
That I told that in the McCarthy

22:46.820 --> 22:48.820
And he is reporting

22:48.820 --> 22:50.820
That I was sitting on this bird in my head

22:50.820 --> 22:52.820
And I have some respect for this that I listen

22:52.820 --> 22:54.820
And I have to check strong with these hearing lines

22:54.820 --> 22:56.820
Which in my opinion were heard all by

22:56.820 --> 22:58.820
That they can drive me out of the office to play like this

22:58.820 --> 23:00.820
You just say that that's what I think

23:00.820 --> 23:02.820
I don't know

23:02.820 --> 23:04.820
I don't know

23:04.820 --> 23:06.820
I don't know

23:06.820 --> 23:08.820
I don't know

23:08.820 --> 23:10.820
I don't know

23:10.820 --> 23:12.820
Why would that Mr. Steven lose

23:12.820 --> 23:14.820
I don't know

23:14.820 --> 23:16.820
I don't know

23:16.820 --> 23:18.820
Why would that Mr. Steven lose

23:18.820 --> 23:20.820
A personal opinional

23:20.820 --> 23:24.820
To me that I say he's done better

23:24.820 --> 23:26.820
And the members of his father

23:26.820 --> 23:28.820
To have a reason

23:28.820 --> 23:32.820
To say him which I think you already have made you that consistent

23:32.820 --> 23:34.820
What I'm saying is he's not a mean

23:34.820 --> 23:36.820
My support is no less

23:36.820 --> 23:38.820
I will keep going

23:38.820 --> 23:40.820
Continue to say that

23:40.820 --> 23:42.820
I love this kind of thing

23:42.820 --> 23:44.820
I love losing up

23:46.820 --> 23:48.820
I retire from sort of education

23:48.820 --> 23:50.820
I say

23:50.820 --> 23:52.820
But my reason is

23:52.820 --> 23:54.820
I love it

23:54.820 --> 23:56.820
I don't know the стorons

23:56.820 --> 23:58.820
And I thought it was impossible

23:58.820 --> 23:59.960
Or, D African

24:00.000 --> 24:01.800
And I thought it was not the fault offat

24:01.800 --> 24:03.820
And ask me some questions

24:03.820 --> 24:04.820
And ask me any questions

24:04.820 --> 24:06.820
Or, many questions

24:06.820 --> 24:10.120
So far I aegорот tryingwniedo

24:10.120 --> 24:12.120
But the father of grazia

24:12.120 --> 24:14.120
And I want to talk to you

24:14.120 --> 24:16.120
40,000,000,000,000

24:16.120 --> 24:18.120
All hours were not 39

24:18.120 --> 24:20.120
To feed off the suspension

24:20.120 --> 24:22.120
By a certain amount of certain number of days

24:22.120 --> 24:24.120
Back in the hours

24:24.120 --> 24:26.120
That I was part of it

24:26.120 --> 24:28.120
But it was not fair

24:28.120 --> 24:30.120
It was not fair to the American people

24:30.120 --> 24:32.120
To create in the mind

24:32.120 --> 24:34.120
I also want to talk with the services

24:34.120 --> 24:36.120
And the idea of it was a lot of hard-eventing

24:36.120 --> 24:38.120
I saw an honest foreman with respect

24:38.120 --> 24:40.120
Not to say

24:40.120 --> 24:41.400
7...

24:41.400 --> 24:43.200
9...

24:48.320 --> 24:50.600
6...

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
11...

24:59.800 --> 25:01.200
11...

25:01.200 --> 25:03.480
11...

25:03.480 --> 25:04.520
He stepped to the valley

25:04.520 --> 25:06.440
To make a naturally self-cont jedes GP

25:06.440 --> 25:08.040
And then he stepped out of the valley

25:08.040 --> 25:10.360
To make a self-cont jedes GP

25:10.360 --> 25:12.360
To make a self-cont jedes GP

25:12.360 --> 25:13.800
To make a self-cont jedes GP

25:13.800 --> 25:15.800
Senator Muntos, off the coast

25:15.800 --> 25:17.800
The acting chairman of the Senate Subcommittee

25:17.800 --> 25:20.600
has three suspects, the...

25:20.600 --> 25:23.400
Morning hearing and the kind of investigation

25:23.400 --> 25:25.800
And the McCarty Army controversy

25:25.800 --> 25:27.800
Until 2.30 this afternoon

25:27.800 --> 25:29.800
Eastern daylight time

25:29.800 --> 25:33.480
I usually break up at about 30 hours

25:33.880 --> 25:36.840
And this morning and during the...

25:36.840 --> 25:39.880
During the testimony

25:39.880 --> 25:42.360
Secretary of the Army students has been on the stand

25:42.360 --> 25:44.120
Then cross-examination very extensively

25:44.120 --> 25:48.280
By the committee, the acting investigating council

25:48.280 --> 25:51.640
Ray Jenkins of Tennessee

25:51.640 --> 25:56.120
Today Mr. Stevens, Secretary Stevens, repeated his charge of undo pressure

25:56.120 --> 26:00.040
And Senator McQuibbie on day 8 and behalf of quite a deep G-day that's shy

26:00.040 --> 26:02.120
And the cost of today's examination too

26:02.200 --> 26:05.320
Mr. Jenkins again raising some of the tights charged by Senator McQuibbie

26:05.320 --> 26:09.320
For instance, that Mr. Stevens tried to help the investigation

26:09.320 --> 26:10.840
Report Marmer

26:10.840 --> 26:15.720
A charge which McCarty on one occasion referred to as Blackmail

26:15.720 --> 26:18.360
So this Mr. Stevens said it was not so

26:18.360 --> 26:20.360
That he was taking objectings to the hearing

26:20.360 --> 26:22.920
He was of the Army Vice Senator McCarty

26:22.920 --> 26:26.520
And McCarty's what he called unfair publicity

26:26.520 --> 26:30.200
And the coverage of these hearings direct from the Senate office building in Washington

26:30.280 --> 26:31.880
Has been going on for the last two hours

26:31.880 --> 26:33.480
The committee will recess it too

26:33.480 --> 26:35.080
So we'll come back at 230 to 30

26:35.080 --> 26:37.960
We suggest you stay tuned here at ABC Station

26:37.960 --> 26:40.440
The program brings you to the federal office building in Washington

26:40.440 --> 26:43.400
