00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
The committee counsel is special investigating counsel, Ray Jenkins of Tennessee.

00:07.360 --> 00:13.840
And now let's turn to Mr. Jenkins who is speaking now.

00:13.840 --> 00:21.920
Mr. Stevens, as I recall, a nice question I asked you, prior to adjournment for the lunch hour,

00:21.920 --> 00:28.320
was whether or not, in your opinion, this investigation of Port Monmouth was unfair to

00:28.320 --> 00:32.880
the Army, considering the results of the thing.

00:32.880 --> 00:37.920
A transcript of the record discloses that your answer was as follows.

00:37.920 --> 00:44.320
The results of our as a publicity was concerned with extremely unpack.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.360
You were called getting the manager answered to that question.

00:47.360 --> 00:51.520
Yes sir. I'll ask you this, Mr. Stevens.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.280
Do you know how to make that it was a saluted thing in part of the American public to know

00:58.560 --> 01:05.040
that there was an active agency such as the McCarthy Committee investigating

01:05.040 --> 01:09.680
alleged infiltration of communists in the Army and other departments of the government?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.320
Yes sir. I think it was a good thing for the...

01:14.320 --> 01:17.360
A good thing, you're not looking at that, you're not looking at the Army.

01:17.440 --> 01:22.080
A good thing for the public, no sir, and as I said before, I,

01:22.080 --> 01:25.840
plead for you, in favor of working with these committees in investigations.

01:25.840 --> 01:31.120
The only thing that I objected to was the manner in which the hearings were held and the

01:31.120 --> 01:33.280
publicity was generated.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.280
Mr. Stevens, honor about the fifth day of March of this year.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.920
You released a document called a series of events,

01:42.880 --> 01:47.840
and which were published in the newspapers as I recall on March 11th.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.440
When you say, relates, sir, we sent them to the members of this committee and to the members

01:53.440 --> 01:56.480
of the Congress who had asked for it. We did not make a public.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.160
It was made by the power of the 11th day of March,

02:00.160 --> 02:00.960
just a...

02:00.960 --> 02:07.920
And the countercharges are certain memorandum of the McCarthy Committee were released the following day.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.800
Yes sir.

02:08.880 --> 02:16.240
When did you and I released this series of events, which you sent to the certain members of this committee,

02:20.400 --> 02:22.240
contained the how many different events?

02:28.160 --> 02:32.800
Anyway, it was embodied in a possible mid-34 page, not advised, that correct, yes sir.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.320
And was published in the newspapers. It was published.

02:36.320 --> 02:42.880
When did you begin the preparation of that, Mr. Stevens of that document consisting of 34 pages?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.400
Well, I didn't... I didn't prepare.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.120
May I ask who did prepare?

02:49.120 --> 02:54.800
It was prepared in the office of the General Counsel of the Department of Defense.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.200
And why did he need his name as Mr. Hemsle?

02:57.200 --> 02:59.200
Mr. Strew the Hemsle and I had heard him in it.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.520
And say, was prepared in his office.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.560
I said under his supervision, many observations who did prepare

03:05.520 --> 03:07.680
the gentleman that I thought to was Mr. Brown.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.320
And the preparation of that was supervised by Mr. Strew Hemsle.

03:13.120 --> 03:16.640
That I believe is correct and I think it's covered by the letter that

03:17.600 --> 03:20.720
transmitted the analogy to that sign of the part.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.440
Have you read Mr. Hemsle's reply?

03:24.880 --> 03:26.960
Actually, I have not read it in detail. No sir.

03:26.960 --> 03:27.760
Have you read the...

03:27.760 --> 03:28.960
I've been in the newspapers.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.320
I know what it is in the name.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.120
Yes.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.800
Do you know that he displeams any personal knowledge whatsoever

03:35.680 --> 03:38.320
of the events that occurred from mid-July?

03:39.200 --> 03:42.880
I've been in your life and come back to the Senate and record the on-genuary for seems.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.360
I don't think I had any connection with it at all.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.560
Not only had any connection with it, but he had no knowledge, you have it to me.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.600
I don't think I had any knowledge.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.480
I didn't know it was you.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.440
That's right.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.880
Can you explain why he supervised the preparation of it?

03:55.760 --> 03:57.040
Why he supervised the preparation?

03:57.040 --> 03:57.600
Yes.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.600
Not having any personal knowledge?

03:59.680 --> 04:02.400
Well, if the letter began to have knowledge of it,

04:02.400 --> 04:04.160
I think you set up for January 14th.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.760
I think Mr. Hemsle began to have knowledge of it

04:08.640 --> 04:13.680
from around about the 26th or 25th of February.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.480
And you say there was Mr. Brown who actually prepared it?

04:17.120 --> 04:20.720
Well, Mr. Brown, I understand as run as in the Donald Council's office,

04:20.720 --> 04:21.840
the Department of Defense.

04:21.840 --> 04:26.800
Now, where did Mr. Brown get his information upon which he prepared that 34 page document?

04:26.800 --> 04:30.720
He called upon the Department of Army to submit its files

04:31.520 --> 04:33.040
containing the material relating to it.

04:34.800 --> 04:40.080
Did the files contain all reports of all these conversations, Mr. Siemens?

04:40.880 --> 04:46.560
I was a report made by you and Mr. Adams, our Mr. Adams, from Henry.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.320
Well, I only know about the part that I was connected with myself.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.480
That is Mr. Brown came to the office and we discussed the parts

04:56.560 --> 04:58.720
and but I have to acknowledge.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.440
I told it.

05:00.480 --> 05:08.880
From time to time, from the early September beginning with your trip from Montana back to Washington.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.960
Did you daily are of only occurrence of these events,

05:13.680 --> 05:15.200
making memory in the modern art?

05:15.200 --> 05:20.240
Did you later just try to mark, and in early March, from memory,

05:21.040 --> 05:23.120
from time to time, I read all these events.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.680
Most of my material is from memory.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.120
Some of it's from memory, and other things.

05:29.920 --> 05:35.600
Now you have testified about a meeting in the Cheyenne apartment on September 16.

05:35.600 --> 05:43.760
That's why I ask you if it isn't a fact that that meeting is not mentioned in either this

05:43.760 --> 05:48.640
compilation, this 34 page compilation of events, or in the specifications.

05:50.240 --> 05:57.200
Yes, file that your attorney is looking for that information.

05:57.200 --> 06:03.760
We give us the full name of the initials of Mr. Brown who prepared this 34 page document under the

06:03.760 --> 06:05.120
supervision of Mr. Hensel.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.440
And is official position with the Department of Defense?

06:11.760 --> 06:13.120
I'll get it for you.

06:13.120 --> 06:13.760
Very good.

06:14.480 --> 06:18.000
I ask you if it isn't a fact, now, as I understand it, you testify.

06:18.800 --> 06:26.000
Here, my Thursday, our Friday, Friday, I'm sure, that on the occasion of this meeting in the

06:26.000 --> 06:32.960
Cheyenne apartment in New York City on September 16, Senator McCarthy asked you for a permission

06:32.960 --> 06:33.920
for the Cheyenne.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.320
Isn't it a fact Mr. Stevens?

06:37.200 --> 06:41.200
That in neither this 34 page document inside of those events,

06:41.920 --> 06:47.120
all the specifications that his charges get, while such a meeting mentioned,

06:47.120 --> 06:48.240
is that correct or not?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.120
I think it is, but that's been checked, Mr. Jenkins.

06:51.120 --> 06:59.920
Can you explain to Mr. Midee why such an important event is that in which this first request

06:59.920 --> 07:02.080
to make it was made for the Senate to be used?

07:02.560 --> 07:06.160
Why was it made from both the events and the specifications?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.360
I don't allow it.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.240
You don't know why?

07:08.240 --> 07:16.880
Now, sir, you think that your recollection now that you testify here under oath is better than

07:16.880 --> 07:20.640
it was when these events and the specifications were prepared?

07:21.840 --> 07:27.120
Well, I suppose as I thought about this thing, and that my memory naturally has been sharpened

07:27.120 --> 07:32.160
up, Mr. Jenkins, on some point, as to why that second item was not in it, it was not in,

07:32.160 --> 07:32.800
I just don't know.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.800
You certainly gave it to this consideration before that Mr.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.800
Stevens will prepare, did you not, Mr. Stevens?

07:40.320 --> 07:41.760
Well, I don't know that I did.

07:41.760 --> 07:46.640
I don't know that the analogy that was originally published was not necessarily

07:47.200 --> 07:49.280
was intended to cover every single thing.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.360
This is fine, I'll have to tell you about that.

07:53.360 --> 07:58.080
But as we understand it, that is the first over-act on the part of the senator in seeking

07:58.080 --> 07:59.920
preference or treatment for David Shines.

08:00.880 --> 08:06.000
Now is your explanation of the leaving of that out in the events and the specifications

08:06.960 --> 08:08.960
of a lack of memory on the subject?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.360
Are the two forgot to include it?

08:11.360 --> 08:12.400
Is that your explanation?

08:13.200 --> 08:15.360
I just don't know why it was left out.

08:16.320 --> 08:20.640
You testified further about a meeting on September 21st, here in Washington.

08:23.120 --> 08:27.040
I'll ask you a further amount on medication, general cartridge, respect.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.840
I think it was, you guys.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.320
As you asked.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.520
Isn't it a fact that likewise in both your 34-page document and tag of it as I have

08:37.520 --> 08:40.880
signed your specifications, that meeting was entirely omitted?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.720
That was an executive meeting of this committee.

08:46.160 --> 08:46.880
What is that?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.720
You reasoned for having only a date.

08:49.520 --> 08:53.840
In your events as well as in the specifications, the fact that it was an executive meeting?

08:54.640 --> 09:00.560
It was an executive meeting, yes, and I didn't consider since the issues here were not discussed.

09:01.760 --> 09:05.600
That there was any particular reason to include that executive meeting of this committee.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.280
You were having a meeting in both your events and specifications.

09:10.320 --> 09:14.320
I referenced this to certainly say that meetings have you not been asked for.

09:16.320 --> 09:22.080
Then do we understand that the reason it was omitted was not the causes, it was an executive meeting,

09:22.080 --> 09:24.080
but the causes were nothing of interest discussed.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.360
Is that now your explanation?

09:26.560 --> 09:30.960
I would say that I wouldn't say that there was nothing in there in the course of the hearing.

09:30.960 --> 09:34.080
I wasn't aware of this to discuss, but it was an executive session.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.360
I wouldn't have thought it would have been a session.

09:35.360 --> 09:40.400
Well, there were discussions banging upon the issues of this controversy where they're not meant to see them.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.760
And the which you testified about in your direct examination?

09:44.720 --> 09:48.320
I think that the dental parkour should appear in the witness.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.320
Yes, I don't know whether it had to do with issues which we're talking about there.

09:52.320 --> 09:52.880
Not.

09:52.880 --> 09:56.240
We identified General Patrice and where he visited him,

09:56.240 --> 09:58.080
do you see the things in the area?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.640
The dental parkour was the efficiency staff,

10:00.640 --> 10:02.400
the two, which is in charge of intelligence.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.040
He charged him in time, that's right.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.800
And it was a piloting and DD2 investigation, the information,

10:09.680 --> 10:12.080
how many of this are extremely ordinary ones?

10:12.080 --> 10:12.560
That's right.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.440
Did you later remove them from that home?

10:16.720 --> 10:21.760
No sir, we had a new chief of staff come in and August the last year.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.200
And in the course of a new chief of staff taking over,

10:25.200 --> 10:30.720
it's perfectly normal procedure for him to make changes in the chief staff position.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.080
And he made a number of them and an inputting dental parkour.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.720
Do you know when General Patrice was released from his post of intelligence?

10:39.680 --> 10:43.040
I can't remember the exact date I'd say it was approximately.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.960
Well, I should think it was probably November.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.320
Well, the number of the investigation was in charge of it, but I think so.

10:50.320 --> 10:50.960
I think so.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.880
And is it the fact that you told Senator McCarthy and members of his staff

10:54.880 --> 10:58.320
that after each new nothing, whatever about intelligence,

10:58.320 --> 11:01.200
are the duties pertaining to that particular post?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.560
That is positively not a fact.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.760
positively not the fact.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.600
And he was removed not by you, but the Secretary of Defense

11:07.600 --> 11:09.120
are chief of staff.

11:09.120 --> 11:14.640
Chief of staff and dental Ridgeway made a change of any staff

11:14.640 --> 11:18.400
and he bought in General Trudeau from Korea as a chief to in charge of intelligence.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.640
Mr. Secretary, you tell us just a bad omeric examination

11:22.640 --> 11:24.640
about the meeting of September 28th.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.120
Do you recall that?

11:29.120 --> 11:40.160
No, I don't recall after you told me all that at the moment.

11:40.160 --> 11:40.960
No, I don't.

11:40.960 --> 11:41.440
I do.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.240
I request my number.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.440
You see that is his name.

11:44.400 --> 11:48.640
The meeting of September 28th is mentioned neither in the events.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.680
The 34 pages.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.080
A combination of events are the specifications.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.200
That is correct, isn't it?

11:56.960 --> 11:58.160
I think that's correct.

11:58.240 --> 12:02.480
The record was so, of course, what your testimony was about the meeting of September 28th.

12:03.440 --> 12:08.480
Now on September 29th, I'll ask you whether or not

12:10.880 --> 12:15.200
that was the occasion of the wedding day of Senator McCarthy.

12:15.200 --> 12:15.680
That was?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.560
You offended that meeting.

12:18.560 --> 12:18.960
I did.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.320
Of all the invitation of the senator.

12:22.320 --> 12:22.800
Correct?

12:23.520 --> 12:28.960
I'll ask you if you didn't see the blood-weating or sand with one day's shine.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.680
Very close proximity, but on first part,

12:31.680 --> 12:33.760
everything to him, I don't talk to him on that occasion.

12:33.760 --> 12:34.160
I'm sorry.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.640
Did you make an engagement to see him at a later date on that occasion?

12:39.120 --> 12:40.080
I don't think so, that.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.400
You don't think you did, do you deny that you did?

12:42.400 --> 12:43.760
I do not recall that I did.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.400
If you did, would you have any idea

12:50.880 --> 12:55.440
on the purpose of a future meeting between you, the secretary of the army and this boy,

12:56.160 --> 12:57.600
who was not land in the army?

12:59.760 --> 13:03.280
Well, yes, I think that's a valid possible.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.680
David Chyne, he wanted to talk to me, he wanted to talk about his

13:08.880 --> 13:14.320
future military, but didn't you initiate the conversation and tell him

13:15.200 --> 13:17.920
that the following day are shortly as I asked her.

13:18.160 --> 13:22.000
You wanted to see him and talk to him that it was no time or place to talk to him

13:22.560 --> 13:24.800
on the waiting day of the senator.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.840
I don't ever call that.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.680
You do not recall it, you do not deny it.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.440
I don't ever call it, but I do not deny it.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.800
When you examine that there, and I'm sure your lawyer will face you,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.640
your offense about two or two seconds.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.320
And while I've seen done, let me ask you the question.

13:43.280 --> 13:49.360
Isn't it a fact that in the document referred to as a vance,

13:51.200 --> 13:57.760
you state that right home spoke to you about David Chyne on October 2nd.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.880
Well, as in your specifications, you say that both call and car

14:03.760 --> 14:06.000
self-facial favors for David Chyne.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.800
They whether or not that is the fact,

14:09.760 --> 14:12.320
and if you have any explanation of that discrepancy,

14:12.320 --> 14:14.720
you may give it to the committee at this time.

14:14.720 --> 14:20.160
Well, I think that I said in my testimony on this point that Mr. Colman

14:20.160 --> 14:21.680
did most of the talking on this subject.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.800
I do not recall where the conditions are before you,

14:24.800 --> 14:26.880
and you may be positive about it this next day.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.880
Mr. Chairman,

14:28.880 --> 14:34.880
but I say the word of our specifications, I'm not familiar,

14:34.880 --> 14:48.560
myself, that your statements would be quick to say that our specifications were prepared,

14:49.200 --> 14:52.080
with great speed and under great pressure.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.600
I am trying to say they weren't finished in the small hours of the morning,

14:56.320 --> 15:00.400
and I think Mr. Jenkins would do me the credit of saying we were more closely on schedule

15:00.400 --> 15:02.720
on our specifications than was the other side.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.320
See that as it may.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.800
They were also the specifications,

15:06.800 --> 15:10.000
and they were also based on information from Mr. Adams.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.120
But I would like, although it's not comfortable for me to say so,

15:13.120 --> 15:16.720
that if there are defects in the specifications of old missions,

15:16.720 --> 15:21.760
the chances are very good that my young friends who lie to regularly admire and myself

15:21.920 --> 15:23.760
are very much to blame.

15:23.760 --> 15:29.200
Mr. Stevens did not stand at my stand-up desk late in the night while we whiffed those out.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.600
It was Mr. Saint Leon I of a digit.

15:31.600 --> 15:37.040
Mr. Chairman, this is of course a difficult task to interrupt such a gracious gentleman,

15:37.040 --> 15:41.360
Mr. Wells, but those are proper matters for him to show off all the closest dimensions.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.160
I beg your pardon.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.600
And your opportunity will come.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.960
My Mr. Stevens,

15:46.800 --> 15:50.800
did you not go to Mr. Adams on October 15th?

15:51.760 --> 15:53.760
With reference to David Cheyenne,

15:53.760 --> 15:57.120
and particularly with reference to getting a commission for him,

15:59.920 --> 16:03.600
I went to Mr. Dallas for that, was not on October 15th.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.240
What was he?

16:09.120 --> 16:11.680
It was on the 28th, thank you pardon.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.200
I covered 28.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.400
You went personally, who was down in that as a detective?

16:16.400 --> 16:19.280
He was director of the Central Intelligence Agency, still in.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.960
And that is a department of the Army, where men, especially qualified in investigations,

16:26.960 --> 16:30.240
are sent for training and for commissioning.

16:30.240 --> 16:34.240
Now it's completely in the fund agency, as nothing to do with the Army,

16:34.240 --> 16:40.880
except to the expense of its work as coordinated with Army and other military services.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.720
You say that was on October 28th?

16:42.720 --> 16:43.200
That's right.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.040
Nearly two months.

16:46.080 --> 16:51.680
I said you say these impregnities started by the committee.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.240
My favorite for Cheyenne is I ride up.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.880
At whose instance did you go to see Alan Dallas?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.840
Your own or not of the senator?

17:01.840 --> 17:03.200
I was to call him or anyone else?

17:03.920 --> 17:05.600
That's my I came up on the telephone.

17:06.640 --> 17:12.640
And Mr. Colne called me and said that he had two.

17:13.520 --> 17:17.600
Matters in mind was respect to Mr. Shaw.

17:18.800 --> 17:24.640
One was a possible furlough that might be grand as immediately on Mr. Shaw

17:24.640 --> 17:25.680
and being inducted.

17:25.680 --> 17:30.160
And the other was the possibility that CIA might have some use for Mr. Shaw.

17:30.960 --> 17:34.960
And I said, well, I'll go and ask Mr. Dallas if he can use Mr. Shaw.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.760
And I did that.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.640
And he said that he could not use him and I so reported to Mr. Colne.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.480
If he could use Mr. Shaw in any work of acting.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.080
In any capacity?

17:44.080 --> 17:49.680
Well, did you consider that an act on your part's design

17:49.680 --> 17:51.600
that's two favorite David Shaw?

17:51.600 --> 17:57.120
I consider it as an act of co-operation

17:57.120 --> 18:00.400
in the as a result of the telephone conversation

18:00.400 --> 18:02.880
when Mr. Colne called me with respect to David Shaw.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.320
I ask you whether or not

18:04.320 --> 18:07.280
mentioned is made of that act on your part.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.720
Regardless of how this committee concludes it,

18:10.720 --> 18:14.480
in either the 34-page compilation of events

18:14.480 --> 18:15.600
are the specifications.

18:16.480 --> 18:20.880
However, if I may, they're trying to look that up and say,

18:20.880 --> 18:22.080
I can't answer at the moment.

18:26.080 --> 18:32.800
Did you ever tell a shane yourself that you wanted him in intelligence

18:32.800 --> 18:34.320
that I wanted him in intelligence?

18:35.040 --> 18:36.880
No, I don't remember that.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.640
I talked with members.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.880
Early part of this thing that was a good deal of discussion.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.600
Like the time I rode down with him in the car

18:43.600 --> 18:47.120
from up time New York when I was discussing my private.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.600
Yes, intelligence matters were discussed.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.480
We shane.

18:50.480 --> 18:50.960
Yes.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.160
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, Iован.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.360
That was deering the period of the McCarthy investigation,

18:57.360 --> 18:58.480
what that's all right.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.600
Mr. Dallas, expect to.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.280
That was not a part of your pattern.

19:05.120 --> 19:09.280
The whole list by shane is a sort of a hostage

19:09.280 --> 19:15.520
and using as a bait for the purpose of a baiting

19:15.520 --> 19:18.080
this investigation was certainly not.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.800
And if he was a hostage, so have hundreds of thousands,

19:20.800 --> 19:22.640
if not millions of young Americans,

19:22.640 --> 19:24.720
then hostages will be doing their duty

19:24.720 --> 19:26.000
and then service for their country.

19:26.000 --> 19:36.000
I believe you are in the hospital.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
I have to ask you a question.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Is it being held in the bank?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
If it's been clear, are you ready?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Yeah, not fine.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I believe you had a meeting about

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
what you testified on November 6th, Mr. Sector.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
In your office, did you not?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Yes, sir.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Will you tell us again who was that?

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
That is McCarthy, Colin Carr, Adams and myself

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
for a one half of the meeting.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
And then for the last half of the meeting,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
General Ridgeway, General Trudeau, and General Mugin.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
I will ask you whether or not Mr. Sector Perry,

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
you all medication likewise invited

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
one gee-baby chimes to attend as your gift.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
November 6th, at which time

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
did he have a safe trip and had a chair there

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
for a gee-baby chimes expressed great disappointment

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
that he did not attend with the senator in his back.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
Well, David Chan, at this time, was in the arms.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
He was, he had gone in on the 3rd of November.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
He was assigned, as you know, in the first instance

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
to temporary duty, in 1st Army in New York.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
And, with the idea of being available for committee work,

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
now, David Chan was in Washington on that particular day.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I would have been glad to have him come along

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
as the member of the staff of this committee.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
I do not have a call having specifically invited him

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
to the lunch.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
You say he was in the army?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Yes.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Don't you know that he did not report to Fort Deeks

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
until November 10th?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Four days after the date about which time

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
questioning you?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yes, I know that.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Very well.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Now, Mr. Sector, I observe that in answer to certain questions

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
I ask you, you are extremely positive.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
There you don't appear to be a parent.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I ask you again.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Isn't it a fact that you specifically

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
are the question senator McCarthy and Roy Coles

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
to bring David Chan to the Pentagon

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
to your office on November 6th for a luncheon with you?

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
If he had, if he was in town, I would have been delighted to have him.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I get up.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
That, that, that, that, I should meet Mr. Chairman

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
as my, how nice of my question.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Now, I ask you again.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Did you earn my phone at 6th day of November

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
and by David Chan to the Pentagon

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
do you office for lunch?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
I definitely do.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Senator McCarthy and Roy Coles.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I definitely do not recall having done so.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Where do you have a pressure recollection?

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Do you remember Mr. Secretary?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That you have this?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
A table?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
That was food?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Already?

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
For all your games, after five or one week of chalice.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I, I don't recall.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I see. They all may well have been.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And do you remember the set first for the actions

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
in by the G, G, G, David Chan?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Now sir, I do not recall that.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
And do you remember telling Senator McCarthy and Roy Coles

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
that you were especially disappointed

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
that David Chan is not a fan?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
I do not.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Do you deny?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Do I deny?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Do you deny?

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
I have no recollection of having invited David Chan.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I would have been delighted for him to come.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
You would have been delighted for him to come.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
If they wanted to bring him as a member of the fair.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
In spite of all the sturdy efforts that have pressure you,

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
you still would have been delighted for him to come on November 6th.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, the reason that space, Fort Monmouth's investigation

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
was a subject, I suppose subject for discussion.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
And did you not tell Senator McCarthy and Roy Coles

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
on by the case of the six?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
That you wanted your picture taken with David Chan?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I doubt very much that I did.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
What do you doubt any other events of November 6th about the Chavez?

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
I just need to be pretty positive about the picture.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
And rather, he'll be about what you invited him there, not?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
I do not recall having invited David Chan.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
He'll be the Secretary of the House.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Mr. Coles, another step to bad.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
That's the fact you're not in position to not deny it.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Is that working saying?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Well, I'd like to hear the testimony.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
What possibly could have been your purpose?

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
In inviting David Chan there on the 6th day of November

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
to lunch with you, the Secretary of the Army,

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
give it for not for the purpose of offering his best service week.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
Sweet Morgans, the best service to Loa's week.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
This three-headed officer, the G-SIG, was about to devour you.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Well, I certainly have no such idea, Mr. Jenkins.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Well, why would you avoid him that?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Well, give not for that reason.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Only because he's a member of Santa McCarty's staff

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
and Santa McCarty wanted him to come.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It would have been perfectly all right, wouldn't he?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
He was there, and he's resting in the army.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
That's right.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Great pressure has been exerted upon you, you say?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
That's right.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
For some wrenching treatment.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Right.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And get his file out of that.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
And in spite of all the vertigation that was going on,

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
you now deny that the only partnership that plus me have had in mind

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
and in getting him there was to press a file to send it out

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
and get him off of your naked fort mom.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I completely deny that.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Of that, now you're 100 percent sure.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Is that right?

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Yes.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Mr. Secretary.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Thank goodness I'm about to.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
One other serious charge has been made against you.

25:13.000 --> 25:22.000
And that is from time to time, you offered up a figure made

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
even than a giant of this committee to let you alone to win.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
They are the forms of the Navy.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
If being a lady that you tried to divert this committee

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
from the army to the other fours of the Navy.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
What do you say about that charge?

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
I say it's an unequivocal law.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Now, last year's one case of this investigation

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
about which your men may have been facing.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
That certainly has not.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Well, I want to read you.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
And next, sir, from your testimony.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I believe you would need it.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
That you did try to prevail upon the committee to suspend the operations

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
as far as the investigation report might as this concerns.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I wanted to change the type of care.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
As far as the investigation is concerned, it could go out along.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
Question, and this is from the record of April 23rd.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Thank you.
