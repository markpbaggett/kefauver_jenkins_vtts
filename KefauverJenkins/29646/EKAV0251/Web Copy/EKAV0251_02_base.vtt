WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.200
And I am with the rescue of the takes because what he has done, I don't think he's at all.

00:11.200 --> 00:21.640
What he has done, he issued charges which would rob the two-year man, one sitting in my

00:21.640 --> 00:27.640
left, one in my right, who have done so much to fight this coming of conspiracy.

00:27.640 --> 00:32.160
But he has done his issue of charges which is to be released by the American people.

00:32.160 --> 00:35.240
It would rob them of their reputation.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.000
It would rob them of their jobs.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.440
I don't think there's some concern about their jobs, but I am concerned about their

00:42.440 --> 00:43.440
reputation.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.600
So you give your recall to testimony of this secretary of the Army about who we're talking

00:48.600 --> 00:50.600
on that with Mr. Henry Mouset.

00:51.120 --> 00:56.600
Yes, but in which he said that if he were sitting up there, where he's there,

00:56.600 --> 01:00.600
he'd not have faced any of the prisoners who's sitting as a judge,

01:00.600 --> 01:06.400
that he on the basis of the testimony about which he personally knew would

01:06.400 --> 01:10.400
lend me a verdict of not giving him Mr. Frank Carl.

01:10.400 --> 01:16.400
You call the suspect so testimony, but I don't think that was exactly the same.

01:16.400 --> 01:22.400
The more he got the burden of his testimony, the more likely he would be to claim on the basis of what he knew

01:22.400 --> 01:26.400
and on the basis of the testimony that has been in the business after that time.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.400
I think that was a good one.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.400
You think that is essentially correct?

01:30.400 --> 01:31.400
That's right.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.400
Now, the testimony is healthy.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.400
He launched it to my life.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.400
The question produced the life run.

01:39.400 --> 01:45.400
You talked about his life, Mr. Secretary of the Army had.

01:45.400 --> 01:55.400
I'm not concerned about his advisors, who they are, whether it was found or unsound the price that he had.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.400
The priority is coming to Washington.

01:59.400 --> 02:06.400
At the invitation of the President and accepting this high command, he was known.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.400
And one of the great industrial districts that he went to.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.400
I think that's right.

02:12.400 --> 02:18.400
And as far as you know, Senator, he's striking and he's reputation.

02:18.400 --> 02:30.400
As a business man, as a family man, as a religious man, in all of his relationships and lives, they're above the post-twenties.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.400
I frankly know nothing about his background.

02:33.400 --> 02:44.400
And as you say, I'm really thankful to him, he ran to the man he took in the steam of his poverty.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.400
I think there's no problem.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400
And as you say, that's the thing.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.400
And as you say, that he made a few attempts.

02:51.400 --> 02:57.400
And as we've seen, he had some more sense back in the United States.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.400
So, let's know, I don't know.

02:59.400 --> 03:14.400
And Senator, you say that in your opinion, he has from found the time he has been ill-advised, and you attribute his mistakes.

03:14.400 --> 03:23.400
To his life, to misguide his life on the part of his frame, so called.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.400
That's essentially what he said.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.400
Mr. Democratic, and I'm actually a president.

03:29.400 --> 03:39.400
I think one of the four of whom, definitely, they called that, about taking the stockings of these companies.

03:39.400 --> 03:46.400
When he wanted to be one of the subpoenas of the Long-Oven Board Council,

03:46.400 --> 03:50.400
nevertheless, he didn't build up a false story.

03:50.400 --> 03:58.400
He said, in effect, that you were told, there's really nothing serious that's really exaggerated.

03:58.400 --> 04:04.400
Now, if he were a dishonest man, he could have very well built up a story.

04:04.400 --> 04:11.400
Just further evidence of the enhanced honesty of the security I need to send him a text.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.400
I think you're right.

04:12.400 --> 04:19.400
As well as the testimony, the party that he had used, he would nevertheless, whether he could not do the against right car,

04:19.400 --> 04:23.400
on the basis of the returns as of that moment.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.400
That's why I didn't use comments.

04:25.400 --> 04:30.400
I think that's the front-way, first.

04:30.400 --> 04:37.400
So, if we would say of this clearly, the Army, Senator MacIvey, as a good moment,

04:37.400 --> 04:46.400
and then we all have been saying in all good conscience, not for the purpose of making him feel good,

04:46.400 --> 04:52.400
not for the purpose of soothing the wounds of his family.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.400
Our building in a fine position brings the leaders family,

04:57.400 --> 05:06.400
but in the midst of the heart and conscience, that's to the very core, to his very core.

05:06.400 --> 05:16.400
We believe that Robert D. Stevens is essentially unfunneringly an army whose food is now in a security door.

05:16.400 --> 05:26.400
The minister of the Security, the minister of the government, will assign some conditions of the report,

05:26.400 --> 05:30.400
citing this conduct, for there was no conduct.

05:30.400 --> 05:37.400
I found nothing remotely to sound about Bob Stevens.

05:37.400 --> 05:45.400
May I say, Mr. President, I sincerely hope that when we see rings are over,

05:45.400 --> 05:53.400
that I'm going to get him stuck down with Secretary Stevens,

05:53.400 --> 06:01.400
and work out the type of cooperation which we have for some time,

06:01.400 --> 06:08.400
I have no idea what to offer for Secretary Stevens.

06:08.400 --> 06:17.400
May I say, pardon me for repeating, I think he was badly most shocked if I can use that phrase.

06:17.400 --> 06:33.400
I don't believe he knew that he was having a shopped call by the political adviser of the opposite party,

06:33.400 --> 06:40.400
and I'm not criticizing the political adviser for some of that party for doing that.

06:40.400 --> 06:47.400
If he could get away with it, if he could destroy the Republican party in that fashion,

06:47.400 --> 06:53.400
if he felt the party should be destroyed, he may have felt that was his job,

06:53.400 --> 06:57.400
but may I say this, this is an illusion.

06:57.400 --> 07:10.400
I do think, I do think Mr. Jenkins that one of these things that we must get to the bottom of,

07:10.400 --> 07:18.400
to find out who was calling this shop because Mr. Vimeo 30 fucking bought his name,

07:18.400 --> 07:31.400
he had me appear to be clever to have the chief political adviser one party calling the shop for the other party.

07:31.400 --> 07:37.400
In that word, it continues to mean the elimination of the two party systems,

07:37.400 --> 07:43.400
if we don't have a two party system, then Mr. Republican survive.

07:43.400 --> 07:48.400
I'm chosen as the number of hard-ears on our understanding,

07:48.400 --> 07:53.400
until we decided we released this to Zom Marte since our leader of the share.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.400
I'm not going to let you about that, I'm not going to let you go.

07:57.400 --> 08:04.400
From the day upon which he met the Secretary of the Army to withdraw,

08:04.400 --> 08:12.400
he is the F11950B to the tenth day of March 19154.

08:12.400 --> 08:22.400
You never saw one act on his mark, I did you hear one word from his list,

08:22.400 --> 08:28.400
that would cause you to think that he was anything, but from the middle end essentially,

08:28.400 --> 08:36.400
an army full of the fear, man of integrity and high character,

08:36.400 --> 08:40.400
that is why this is something that would be a question of these workers and some of them.

08:40.400 --> 08:45.400
This is the description of the political system.

08:45.400 --> 08:55.400
We're turning to the conscious, then we do what you have to say about the Secretary of the Army.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.400
Let me ask you this question.

08:58.400 --> 09:03.400
And these are not quick questions, as I say, from a very...

09:03.400 --> 09:11.400
We are the five-zone of this drama and the curtain was turned down,

09:11.400 --> 09:16.400
and the characters were walked from the stage.

09:16.400 --> 09:22.400
And the second day I know what the members of the family were just saying,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.400
they were making the worst of things.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.400
Wouldn't you say something to McCartney?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.400
The nine-line.

09:30.400 --> 09:38.400
The others, even who they just stuck a day in the army?

09:38.400 --> 09:43.400
I don't, I'm not asking you to say to these perfect.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.400
I've made no mistakes.

09:46.400 --> 09:51.400
But nine-line, from sitting again, you know that hard-fought,

09:51.400 --> 09:56.400
and the title of no-high, negative, or low, and negative, is a sudden.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.400
But considering the things you said about him,

10:00.400 --> 10:05.400
is how the few George Communist is a part of the ocean to the army.

10:05.400 --> 10:11.400
His love to the army, his zealousness,

10:11.400 --> 10:15.400
far the army, and his welfare, and his pain,

10:15.400 --> 10:20.400
wouldn't you say now that by and large, the Secretary of the Army,

10:20.400 --> 10:23.400
could take lessons, I accept.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.400
Let's move to the listening, let's jump in.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.400
I think the district's brilliant.

10:29.400 --> 10:34.400
We're making much better Secretary of the Army number one, number two.

10:34.400 --> 10:38.400
I need your attention, much too.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.400
And then, surely, John Arborvanis-Pyca.

10:47.400 --> 10:53.400
I think you'll be much better Secretary of the Army than Secretary of the Army.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.400
You know that when it's pretty high, we're seeing enemies,

10:56.400 --> 10:59.400
and we're just saying.

10:59.400 --> 11:04.400
To talk to the enemy, we're seeing the ladies, we're seeing enemies.

11:04.400 --> 11:09.400
I think you'll talk about a same mistake, I think you'll see a very rough school.

11:09.400 --> 11:14.400
I think you know a lot more about Washington's politics now.

11:14.400 --> 11:18.400
When it came down, I think the size of the day,

11:18.400 --> 11:25.400
to do inputters like the areas of the army down 20 months ago.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.400
In some of the McCarthy's, you were the President of the United States.

11:29.400 --> 11:34.400
Knowing what you know, knowing what you know about the speech even today,

11:34.400 --> 11:38.400
you were not removing respect to the army, you were seeing.

11:39.400 --> 11:44.400
Mr. Derrickson, who's the President of the Army?

11:45.400 --> 11:50.400
I am a guy, I mean, don't go to make a need.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.400
I am a exerciseist, I can use those to these big and huge.

11:55.400 --> 12:00.400
The guy we have told, he's made it look great, he's learned his lesson.

12:00.400 --> 12:04.400
He's been to go in space for a lawyer, a man to choose for,

12:04.400 --> 12:07.400
man, not a bother, not a big thing to do.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.400
Mr. Derrickson, what's your name?

12:10.400 --> 12:14.400
Mr. Derrickson's my name is Frank William.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.400
And then, it's a lot of practice to have upon Bob Steven of the future

12:19.400 --> 12:22.400
if I were to advise them to keep him on.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.400
Do you mind if I don't even bother him?

12:25.400 --> 12:28.400
I think much you want, Mr. Derrickson.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.400
Much you want, Mr. Derrickson.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.400
You think you're the country of human beings.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.400
I think the community and the public have,

12:37.400 --> 12:40.400
and the people of the country, the people of the country,

12:40.400 --> 12:43.400
you like Bob, it's a lot of Steven's opinion for this.

12:43.400 --> 12:49.400
I think you do have tons of confusion in getting your cost of generation

12:49.400 --> 12:52.400
of human, over a decade or several days,

12:52.400 --> 13:00.400
that they will sum up the friendship, even bothering on affection.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.400
That's why I'm between you and the six-day of the night.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.400
Yes, I can say for you, Mr. Derrickson, as of this moment,

13:08.400 --> 13:12.400
I have no ill feelings, from the over-the-cord Bob Steven,

13:12.400 --> 13:17.400
but for the decisions, I would like to flag her up on answering,

13:17.400 --> 13:20.400
whether or not the president should keep him on.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
And I'm sorry for the anxiety.

13:22.400 --> 13:26.400
Yes, I would say, in one sentence,

13:26.400 --> 13:31.400
I think that this is the part of Washington's politics

13:31.400 --> 13:34.400
for concern, his very naive.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.400
I think we have learned lessons.

13:37.400 --> 13:44.400
I'm sure that he will be more hesitant to face the advice

13:44.400 --> 13:50.400
of my Democrat friends, who come to find a director

13:50.400 --> 13:53.400
of Republican Party, who's in the future.

13:57.400 --> 14:02.400
But as an engineer, I, you and I,

14:02.400 --> 14:05.400
I belong to Governor Smith.

14:05.400 --> 14:11.400
And in all of you, put them on me, given the things

14:11.400 --> 14:15.400
to lay down on yesterday afternoon, session,

14:15.400 --> 14:17.400
and the morning session.

14:17.400 --> 14:21.400
As I recall, Senator McCarty,

14:22.400 --> 14:27.400
there was not a word, not a single charm,

14:27.400 --> 14:31.400
I'll just honestly, I'll just come up,

14:31.400 --> 14:35.400
on the part of the Secretary's office,

14:35.400 --> 14:39.400
but these charges with the elected as all the members

14:39.400 --> 14:42.400
so inexplicably against me for all of them,

14:42.400 --> 14:45.400
on behalf of the adviser.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.400
He's got not enough explanation from the last look

14:48.400 --> 14:50.400
when we look at those way.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.400
Aside from the Democratic Party now,

14:53.400 --> 14:56.400
apart from the book written from,

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
sorry, took an afternoon,

14:58.400 --> 15:01.400
instead of waiting like it's sunny with transcripts,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.400
and took it around as a chunker,

15:03.400 --> 15:07.400
trying to get them to follow up the investigation.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.400
And aside from the charges,

15:11.400 --> 15:15.400
which were finally issued,

15:15.400 --> 15:17.400
and I don't know what's the party play about at all,

15:17.400 --> 15:22.400
but I don't know of any new time

15:22.400 --> 15:27.400
that I'm the part of not even removed

15:27.400 --> 15:30.400
when you look at the part of the Secretary.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.400
And the poor Secretary knows

15:33.400 --> 15:37.400
that these charges were put on,

15:37.400 --> 15:42.400
as I recall, in the administration.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.400
He was sitting inside and he was just sitting.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.400
And this is our election and supervision.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.400
Perhaps those members are the things to fight for,

15:52.400 --> 15:55.400
and what's your job, maybe, any maintenance?

15:55.400 --> 15:58.400
I must be sure that last look, Mr. Jenkins,

15:58.400 --> 16:03.400
it appears now that there are newsmen

16:03.400 --> 16:09.400
who have always been against the exposure of thunder,

16:09.400 --> 16:13.400
who have always been against the Republican administration,

16:13.400 --> 16:16.400
where the chief advantageers of Mr. Adam

16:16.400 --> 16:22.400
long before the matter was brought to Mr. Steven's attention

16:22.400 --> 16:27.400
and what parts they play in the drafting of the charges.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.400
I frankly don't know.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.400
I am in fine-affixed.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.400
I am in fine-affixed that the state of the Mads

16:36.400 --> 16:39.400
are very, very little to do with the drafting of the charges.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.400
Now, some of the reasons of this death

16:42.400 --> 16:46.400
are the value of a good name I think.

16:46.400 --> 16:50.400
The mission is certain to part as I am concerned.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.400
The charges here against Chief Thunder

16:53.400 --> 16:57.400
remember to be far farther to use as impoverars.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.400
To keep it soft by impoverry,

17:01.400 --> 17:04.400
to get proper ensue,

17:04.400 --> 17:06.400
to give their dispensation

17:06.400 --> 17:09.400
for one particular Friday

17:09.400 --> 17:14.400
out of millions of other soldiers in the army.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.400
And some of them are casading.

17:17.400 --> 17:22.400
I'm sure you realize that gravity in this case

17:22.400 --> 17:25.400
is the most charges only are greater than the RTs.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.400
I do not know.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.400
It's extremely true. It's the charge of work.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.400
You go with the army of the United States, Governor.

17:31.400 --> 17:35.400
And the integrity of this subcommittee, do they not?

17:35.400 --> 17:38.400
Yes, true. There would be extremely serious.

17:38.400 --> 17:43.400
And the series charges whether it's true or whether it's unjeweled.

17:43.400 --> 17:47.400
Impoverars the charges are concerned. But that isn't it, Governor?

17:47.400 --> 17:51.400
The charges are extremely serious.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.400
Now, some of them are casading. You have this.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.400
You think it's shine as a member of this class?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.400
That is correct.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.400
I think it's only because it's warning that he was recommended

18:00.400 --> 18:03.400
that comes to I call you. He comes.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.400
He comes to call and others may have also recommended him.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.400
These are the calls.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.400
I'm not going to anyone else recommend you, young man.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.400
Others have missed the call.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.400
Well, I check that. I read enough to give their names.

18:24.400 --> 18:30.400
I checked with a special number of newsmen in New York.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.400
And I asked them what they knew about me.

18:33.400 --> 18:40.400
I had the FBI give me an amtrak investigation.

18:40.400 --> 18:48.400
I would say that he was hired largely upon the recommendation of Mr. Callum.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.400
It's home team with you in January 1950s.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.400
I think it was January 1950s.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.400
Which young man's time follows by 18 days by 18 years.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.400
Look here, there's a new week.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.400
Here there's a few weeks.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.400
You did not know, giant, tired of the tiny team of you committing this new subject?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.400
That is not.

19:08.400 --> 19:12.400
You did not ask the same thing that he had ever had in his field.

19:12.400 --> 19:19.400
I was a member of an investigating staff in the running down communist.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.400
Not that I remember when the investigation happened.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.400
I saw that he had been working in the company of the former son last night.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.400
What had he done?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.400
What had he done on communism?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.400
Some of it was besides the parties.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
We had a definition of communism.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.400
That's what he said to me.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.400
He said to the homeless.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.400
I gave it to the army.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.400
A fairly important man put so far as well.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.400
He had some talk with him.

19:46.400 --> 19:53.400
I found that he had been living in the past a lot of time.

19:53.400 --> 19:59.400
On the question of psychological warfare,

19:59.400 --> 20:03.400
I thought otherwise known as information program,

20:03.400 --> 20:07.400
he apparently had been discussing a subject of the regime,

20:07.400 --> 20:14.400
but people were interested in having his applications all about the man.

20:14.400 --> 20:22.400
So here he had never had the one-day experience in targeting or interviewing the system,

20:22.400 --> 20:25.400
but he was already working on the work of the regime.

20:25.400 --> 20:31.400
I don't know if he ever had been in the target or not.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.400
I need to come down here,

20:33.400 --> 20:36.400
above the recommendation of Mr. Collins,

20:36.400 --> 20:38.400
as an unsafe to himself.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.400
As long as there's no problem.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.400
Does he not think that I'm usually punished

20:43.400 --> 20:46.400
that a young man of use,

20:46.400 --> 20:49.400
the post-qualification group,

20:49.400 --> 20:51.400
we just work in New York,

20:51.400 --> 20:53.400
where we work with teams,

20:53.400 --> 20:57.400
and come down here to Washington and join us faster.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.400
As an unpaid man.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.400
Well, I was a village in front for the fact that young man

21:03.400 --> 21:06.400
was a little more fun than he was trying to be the sunshine

21:06.400 --> 21:09.400
the Florida where they have all the hell.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.400
So I'd be willing to spend one hour and a half every day

21:13.400 --> 21:17.400
working for nothing, paying you the woman's money to

21:17.400 --> 21:21.400
try and help us develop facts

21:21.400 --> 21:23.400
having to do with the enemies of the country.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.400
I was very much impressed.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.400
I may have said that looking at you,

21:27.400 --> 21:29.400
I'm both at your control,

21:29.400 --> 21:31.400
who will work through the British dollar and youth,

21:31.400 --> 21:35.400
and the women's need to pay a day of the dollar.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.400
So I'm a good, I might say,

21:37.400 --> 21:39.400
just a welcome, for example,

21:39.400 --> 21:41.400
I understand this,

21:41.400 --> 21:43.400
is good things for nothing,

21:43.400 --> 21:45.400
and if I'm not even a brother,

21:45.400 --> 21:47.400
I'd rather come in Mr. T.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.400
than just add them so that,

21:49.400 --> 21:51.400
don't think I'd hear you talk about that.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.400
Did you know that he was supposed to be

21:53.400 --> 21:55.400
to the grass when he joined you fast

21:55.400 --> 21:57.400
and to MacIpean?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.400
To remember certainly.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.400
He has to claim that fact definitely

22:01.400 --> 22:05.400
our team is near the part of July.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.400
I've been to the New York July

22:07.400 --> 22:11.400
and the Royal Bay of Louis in the States.

22:11.400 --> 22:17.400
They have had them in Korea for a while,

22:17.400 --> 22:21.400
for the rank of, I think they called it,

22:21.400 --> 22:23.400
too late in the sound.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.400
He had to find the getting the army to mainly,

22:25.400 --> 22:29.400
because of a ruptured foot,

22:29.400 --> 22:33.400
this is trying to qualify for air.

22:33.400 --> 22:37.400
I hope that they were going to reexamine them.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.400
I think that would be July,

22:39.400 --> 22:41.400
a very wonderful July.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.400
So, Senator Jean knew

22:43.400 --> 22:47.400
in the early part of July and February,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.400
before I'm not later than July 8th,

22:49.400 --> 22:52.400
the safe shine had met all

22:52.400 --> 22:54.400
unless you say the climate,

22:54.400 --> 22:57.400
and qualifications were all in with me,

22:57.400 --> 23:01.400
because I was up here in the United States Army, didn't you?

23:01.400 --> 23:05.400
No, I didn't know what happened to them until after I heard that he passed

23:05.400 --> 23:07.400
his political.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.400
And then, Scott, when you went to General Reaver,

23:09.400 --> 23:13.400
Senator, I had him come to your office,

23:13.400 --> 23:15.400
and just to General Reaver,

23:15.400 --> 23:19.400
the question of its direct commission position,

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
man shine.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.400
What's the record, Mr. Democratic?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.400
Mr. Johnson, by the way,

23:25.400 --> 23:29.400
that I asked for information from Labour

23:29.400 --> 23:33.400
before Dave's Mac is,

23:33.400 --> 23:37.400
um, the draft has, but I'm not sure.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.400
If you recall, the strengthening the question of the commission

23:40.400 --> 23:43.400
to shine in general, we don't get anxious.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.400
So, let's look for a look,

23:45.400 --> 23:49.400
where I, I talked to Labour and asked him if he was,

23:49.400 --> 23:53.400
tell Dave, how's it going for a commission?

23:53.400 --> 23:57.400
I'm in a great place to remember that,

23:57.400 --> 24:00.400
during all of my history with Senna,

24:00.400 --> 24:04.400
I never asked for a commission for motion of anyone,

24:04.400 --> 24:06.400
and that's how it was by Dave's and Senna,

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
and I'm anyone now,

24:08.400 --> 24:13.400
to show Dave what form we should show out,

24:13.400 --> 24:16.400
not the usual procedure, that happened, bro.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.400
And Dave, are you saying that during your career as a senator,

24:21.400 --> 24:24.400
you have never outside a commission

24:24.400 --> 24:26.400
for any individual,

24:26.400 --> 24:29.400
as far as violence and then,

24:29.400 --> 24:31.400
as far as I know about it,

24:31.400 --> 24:35.400
but I don't recall ever having asked for a commission.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.400
You know General Labour?

24:37.400 --> 24:39.400
You know it?

24:39.400 --> 24:41.400
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:41.400 --> 24:44.400
I thank the first time in camp my office.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.400
So, many days in the fact that,

24:46.400 --> 24:51.400
mainly in this one case and this one case alone,

24:51.400 --> 24:53.400
you are generally wrong,

24:53.400 --> 24:56.400
the eighth day of July,

24:56.400 --> 24:58.400
far a Dalek commission,

24:58.400 --> 25:00.400
permission, man, shine.

25:00.400 --> 25:04.400
You've been out there since the MacArthur age of 30.

25:04.400 --> 25:08.400
I would be generally with testimony of 844.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.400
At that time Senna,

25:10.400 --> 25:14.400
MacArthur informed me that he was very much interested

25:14.400 --> 25:16.400
in obtaining a Dalek,

25:16.400 --> 25:19.400
reserved for a commission for some thousand,

25:19.400 --> 25:22.400
Mr. DJ, the DJ, the DJ, the shine.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.400
Senna, did you do that or not?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.400
No.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.400
Did you do that or not?

25:27.400 --> 25:29.400
Right.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.400
Do you know why I'd never read over the so-called

25:31.400 --> 25:33.400
100-Democritic?

25:33.400 --> 25:36.400
All right, I was about to pull my own house from mine.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.400
On reading further,

25:37.400 --> 25:40.400
the 70-day party that was our record city felt

25:40.400 --> 25:43.400
that Mr. Shine, because of his background,

25:43.400 --> 25:45.400
I've investigated exchange

25:45.400 --> 25:48.400
with the Committee of the Stony Qualified for a commission.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.400
Did you tell him that fair, Democratic?

25:50.400 --> 25:54.400
No, I gave him the background of the sign-on-half

25:54.400 --> 25:58.400
and whether or not he would qualify for a commission.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.400
I told him otherwise,

25:59.400 --> 26:02.400
it would be a waste of his day of time to apply.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.400
And River of that time told me that he would be

26:05.400 --> 26:08.400
unquestionably qualified for a commission.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.400
Then you were talking to him about a commission for the Shenmue,

26:12.400 --> 26:13.400
right, Mark?

26:13.400 --> 26:14.400
For personal emptying,

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
number one, how of wine, number two,

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
how they would qualify.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.400
Why, can't you, MacArthur,

26:19.400 --> 26:23.400
why would you have asked each general in the Army,

26:23.400 --> 26:27.400
how a man would qualify for a commission?

26:27.400 --> 26:30.400
Because Mr. Jenkins,

26:30.400 --> 26:32.400
President of the Army,

26:32.400 --> 26:37.400
has an office here in the front-off buildings.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.400
They have a liaison man over here.

26:40.400 --> 26:45.400
He is here for the purpose of answering the questions of some reason.

26:45.400 --> 26:49.400
I have often had a general span, for example,

26:49.400 --> 26:52.400
up to my office to get information

26:52.400 --> 26:56.400
that the firm of him, which was requested by some of my young men

26:56.400 --> 27:00.400
back in Wisconsin or any other part of the country,

27:00.400 --> 27:02.400
but man, I make it clear Mr. Jenkins,

27:02.400 --> 27:06.400
and I'm sure that the general span will testify to this.

27:06.400 --> 27:13.400
I have always made it clear that I felt it was some sweetly unpopular

27:13.400 --> 27:18.400
to exert any political influence to get a commission made from more to them.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.400
It changed the duty order for anyone.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.400
But we do, we do have a duty,

27:24.400 --> 27:28.400
I feel, to the young man who writes me,

27:28.400 --> 27:31.400
to the wives, to the mothers,

27:31.400 --> 27:35.400
to one information that we call the liaison man,

27:35.400 --> 27:37.400
I mean, just for that purpose, he's working for a man,

27:37.400 --> 27:43.400
to get the information that they would request that a goal I just for days now.

27:44.400 --> 27:48.400
Wasn't it simply a question of filling out a foreign senator in the

27:48.400 --> 27:51.400
and in the fine for a commission in the United States?

27:51.400 --> 27:53.400
I think they don't know.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.400
You don't know.

27:54.400 --> 28:00.400
And so you're in charge of General Reboot with how would he go about applying for a commission?

28:00.400 --> 28:01.400
Is that right, Senator?

28:01.400 --> 28:04.400
Well, it is more than I have seen with you,

28:04.400 --> 28:08.400
it's explained to David Roy how he would go about

28:08.400 --> 28:12.400
making applications very with pilots,

28:12.400 --> 28:15.400
what particular plans to the service,

28:15.400 --> 28:17.400
he might qualify him,

28:17.400 --> 28:20.400
and if he would qualify in any branch,

28:20.400 --> 28:25.400
would he be the client for a commission in that branch next month,

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
next month, and if he's taken,

28:27.400 --> 28:30.400
I think that's the duty of any kind of interview.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.400
Get a letter from me on the end,

28:32.400 --> 28:35.400
who is next for a pensioner,

28:36.400 --> 28:40.400
and some information over the late military,

28:40.400 --> 28:42.400
I am saying,

28:42.400 --> 28:44.400
can you use him any place,

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
and leave, not I?

28:46.400 --> 28:48.400
Well, Senator,

28:48.400 --> 28:52.400
had Shine written you set the letter requesting to you in his seat,

28:52.400 --> 28:57.400
but how do you think that you make this other interstation of the House of Shine

28:57.400 --> 28:59.400
with General in the House?

28:59.400 --> 29:02.400
I'm sure you told me he won't apply for a commission,

29:02.400 --> 29:04.400
ask me how it is.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.400
You're a bother when I told him that the way it was on man,

29:06.400 --> 29:09.400
I'd call him up and get the information for him.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.400
I would like to send him a question,

29:11.400 --> 29:16.400
whether or not on the occasion of your first conversation with General Weber,

29:16.400 --> 29:19.400
you told him this time was the essence of this bar,

29:19.400 --> 29:22.400
it was about to be active.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.400
I'll be sure.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.400
This seems quite interesting.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.400
Well, I don't control that,

29:28.400 --> 29:30.400
but I only have one time request for the first time request.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.400
You only have one conversation.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.400
Right.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.400
Now, still is it?

29:35.400 --> 29:41.400
Did he not accept that time tell General Weber that it was important

29:41.400 --> 29:47.400
that you just feed the game of that time?

29:47.400 --> 29:50.400
Mr. Jenkins, I don't know if you've put your reavers out the fight about it,

29:50.400 --> 29:56.400
I may well have some of the reavers in title or commission.

29:56.400 --> 29:59.400
He shouldn't proceed to a fine media place.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.400
I don't know what he's going to do.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.400
General Weber statement about it.

30:03.400 --> 30:07.400
It was emphasized to me that there was a very definite necessity

30:07.400 --> 30:11.400
to be seen in looking into the possibility of obtaining this commission.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.400
Because the status of Mr. Shine under the selected service

30:15.400 --> 30:18.400
acts as a family doctor chain.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.400
Us to that collector.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.400
I think you just did the important thing.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.400
I think they know him.

30:29.400 --> 30:37.400
I think about two minutes of reavers and I'm going to go with Mr. Shine.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.400
I think Mr. Coles and that you're harder for state to apply,

30:40.400 --> 30:43.400
after moving this inside of the commission.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.400
With these qualifications you said yes,

30:45.400 --> 30:48.400
that's an end of the interview.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.400
When does we understand that you neither have met tonight.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.400
What General Weber says about that?

30:55.400 --> 30:58.400
That you may have or you could have said

30:58.400 --> 31:02.400
that one's received in the dining of this commission

31:02.400 --> 31:04.400
to visit your man on your face.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.400
You go by, Senator.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.400
Oh, I can say Mr. Jones is what I don't remember.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.400
But if Mr. Weber said I did say it,

31:11.400 --> 31:15.400
I think Mr. Weber was most likely telling the truth.

31:15.400 --> 31:19.400
And Senator Ariel, ask him further.

31:19.400 --> 31:23.400
First he does not tell General Weber I'm ready for you.

31:24.400 --> 31:28.400
It keeps Mr. Coles from saying.
