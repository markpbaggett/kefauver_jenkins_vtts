00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
I personally thought that maybe it was part of his trail from this, but it was a bluff.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
I didn't know.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
I couldn't consider him doing what he finally did.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Namely, Phil, he is close to our juice.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
About time that I say, Frank Kyle has never brought into it.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
No indication of Frank Kyle, and anything else offered.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I believe you say you were not bothered to it.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
I was not.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
There's a lot of one that I guess you, she counseled me, so.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
No, Frank, he made it. He made it very clear that he knew that I had repeatedly told him in the secretary

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
that they should lean over backwards to make sure that the element of the press, which was

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
that the role of criticizing any exposure of dominance, shouldn't criticize them or couldn't

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
criticize them.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
By all that, I said, you don't have any sociality?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I have, sir.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
Just like I did it by letter on, also, it was a matter of one year.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
It's over 20 seconds.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
That's right.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Then, as you have other contact with the secretary, I miss that.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm going to step the foot to that meeting, and January 22nd is your apartment.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
I called with the items on the second subway after the steps amendment coming up that got

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
me an honorable disside, and talking about for this.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
And could I give you, again, I apologize for giving answers a bit long when I'm afraid I've

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
got to some of these cases.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
The reason for that was as far.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
Number one, Mr. Cohn had notified Mr. Adams in 1953 about the President of the United

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
States.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
That they had a Fifth Amendment Communist Major, that he was a dentist, being a dentist.

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
He would have access to any communist he wanted to use out of the state's point.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Mr. Cohn told me he did point it out to Mr. Adams.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Gendelts had been used in the past.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
That's ridiculous.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Because they privateer general can go to a dental office and no fuss and laugh.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
It's a guess that he'd be gotten out of there.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
That has been in 1953, then again in 1954, I think the date is January 4th.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Mr. Cohn again called Mr. Adams.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
And as they do something, nothing was done finally on the 26th of January with the Senate

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
for that.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I think we wrote it into a period.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
He appeared on the 30th.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
He was left.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
And we didn't pull these questions over half to understand we knew that he had been engaged

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
in these activities.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
He was left for the supply to his discharge center.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
He was fired with discharge.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
In that, for example, whether he attended a communist leadership school, one of the

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
names of that school, I didn't remember.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
It's only the name of the school, doesn't it?

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
The younger victory school, a communist leadership school, we first knew he had the candidate.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Right where the party was honored as a five-way-know.

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
He was new to answer on the ground as he entered my temper and came to me.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
He was left.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
Whether he was holding a coming of meetings in his home, down at Camp Silver, again the

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
usual refuse to refuse to answer.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
He was then weighing the major uniform.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
That is correct.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm not sure if he was uniform on my table, but he was a major then.

03:49.000 --> 03:57.000
As for whether or not he was engaged in a FB rise, he took the first match in the U.S.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
I think he took the first one, and conserved it, it admit it, but maybe not an

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
FB rise.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
Six of his amendments to other humanist bankers, two soldiers into the coming of party.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
Six of his amendments that were coming with had gotten a chance in his order.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
He had been ordered to go to Yokohama.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
His order suddenly changed and we asked him a communist.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
In the North, I had intervened in flying.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
The refuse to answer that, we asked him a friend of mine to come and meet him.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
He was sent with us.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
The change of order was very unusual.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
All the centers sitting at the table know that we get letters every day from real hardship

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
cases.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
The cases were families, our six.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
Someone about to die, and we very seldom was to change the order.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
In this case, he got a change of order.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
The only reason he could give, Mr. Duncan, was that his wife and daughter had been visiting

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
a psychiatrist.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
We asked him to give us a mammoth of psychiatrist he couldn't remember.

05:07.000 --> 05:16.000
Well, the matter occurred and we also found that he had refused to answer almost the same

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
queries, not the must-be tale, from the Army in August of 1953.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
Go across the place of the questionnaire, reduce the number of things like that.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
We're not covered.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
There was that size, that is it.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
That is his first male file, but we have a smear in it.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Give him 10 a god.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
I better have gotten some of the planning on yet.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Now, maybe you call Mr. Adams on February 2nd, about your day.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Yes, for one or less, I deserve Mr. Duncan.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
I wrote to the secretary of the Army and call him the attention to the testimony on the

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
coming of.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
You know the way to that letter.

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
The way to that was, I think it was a major 30th, it was a major public on the first

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
February of that recall.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
And that was before the last 16th, right?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Do you have a copy of that letter?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I can get a copy of that.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I can get a copy of that.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Yes, we have a copy right here.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I ask you, Secretary, to read that to us.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
The copy of that letter into the record.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Give him your day, please.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
No, that's not good.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
No, that's not good, that's not good.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
No, that's not good.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Okay, I'll put that left.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
So that remind me, Mr. Duncan, that we long as all inside the doctor's side of the

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
breath case.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And we don't go into it.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
We need to need that we are not the broad and the record now, endure the ruling that

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
the day that's been played so long ago.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
Just to work long ago, I'm sure you will recall we agreed to hold a testimony to the issues

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
of this kind of a phase.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
And further long ago, we went far beyond and left the issues of this kind of a phase and

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
we haven't.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
And I do not say this critically and I do not say a few words with Mr. Wells.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
I do not assume responsible of the fire that many of you issues have been brought into

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
this fund of this, perhaps, from the spam property so.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
It is certainly from the spam point of the spam point of the failure effect on the public.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
I do not propose to go into details, Mr. Wells, to the cost of news that perhaps.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
And I think the introduction of this letter and through this perhaps.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
The introduction of this letter might be a bit just to the committee of studying the

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
Sunlight on the attitudes of the secretary or those under the command that we would like to

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
discuss one case, I think, for that, just to chairman that it might shift sunlight or

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
the committee might move the wheel.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
And I wonder how to turn it to the reading to the referee out there that letter.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
And then further out, they see you in the units of Wells that I propose to face to that.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Well, I think one more word if you know it.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
You will remember Mr. Jenkins when the 25 names were submitted to you.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
There was a recital in the letter of the way the evidence then served and I have not

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
known if anything in your room is worth to the opposed.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Mr. Chairman, I don't know if the writers who have been watching them at Mr. Wells'

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
just to question or request, from the moment you will solve that question.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
The fact is that you did write a letter, I'm not going to ask you to read it as a record of the

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
biggest, biggest phrase of January.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
This was what I did there for a time.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I did this one, but then I took the right to the right.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
The bargum comes down.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
You know what I'm talking about?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
You know what I'm talking about?

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
My next contact was with Adam's words.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
My athletic contact was the result of this letter and the public connection.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
The letter is very, very first, for a boy first.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
The unilaterated arrest is discharged in the late time.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The morning of February is mine.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
The morning of February is mine.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
Now, if you have a conversation with Adam, the morning of February second, in the afternoon

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
for the letter to which you get the first, I had a conversation with him on the evening of February.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
Saturday, I will ask you to relate to the committee's acceptance of the context of that conversation.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
I call this letter, whether or not that involves the press case.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
It's so out.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
It's so out.

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
The words I assume that I would tell you that was just in my opinion, it's just new life on these thank you sir.

09:51.000 --> 10:01.000
And anything that was said by Mr. Adam with respect to the law of the board are similar to the years.

10:01.000 --> 10:11.000
So just relating to this in grace and as it has, I may say that it has this relation of injuries.

10:11.000 --> 10:23.000
At that time, I told Mr. Adam that we would get the means of all those responsible for the harboring of the brothers and nothing's there.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
He knew anyone else on earth could stop us.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And that we had a rather heated argument on that.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
I think that has something to do with this investigation, if I may, again, the underpriced, and I call him.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
I thought that what they had done was completely improper.

10:43.000 --> 10:57.000
So if they all knew that I had asked for a court march for this major, the court march for everyone who had anything to do with his promotion, his change of order is knowing that he was a communist.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
And that what they did the next morning was not a large.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
They tried to put him beyond the jurisdiction of the Army.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
I told him I thought this was unfair to Bob Stevens because Stevens was out of the country at the time.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
That the least they could have done was wait until the Secretary got back and until he makes the decision.

11:17.000 --> 11:26.000
I told Mr. Adam that I had every reason to believe that he, Adam, had a hand in the hand.

11:26.000 --> 11:36.000
And that I was going to try and find out the names of all of those for the hand in it.

11:36.000 --> 11:52.000
And that conversation I believe, Mr. Jenkins, as well as I demand for the members of the Royalty Board, has considerable to do with the false fraudulent charges of infiled here.

11:53.000 --> 12:08.000
Because Mr. Jenkins, let me say this in the sentence, there seemed to be no discrimination nor fear when we would pick up an individual kindness, expose him and help get rid of him.

12:09.000 --> 12:34.000
But there seemed to be an unexplainable, an unexplainable amount of discrimination whenever we talked about getting the names of those responsible for the cobbling and the special privileges for a communist or the names of the Royalty Board, we sent communist back to the Secretariat of Alavishar.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Now, that was the term I think why we're in the hearing today.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
Well, the New York Union Center was a solid book that came on back in Bruce Smith's office over the last couple of years.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
That's right. This was one of the two straws, the other straws are getting the Royalty Board.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
Did you ever have any contractors, Mr. Adams, or the Sik-A-H, to separate seconds?

12:57.000 --> 13:05.000
I had a contact with Stephen on the 24th day of February.

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
I think that's been gone over in detail because I had to go over to get a few of characters.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
That's the chicken dinner. That was the chicken dinner I guess.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
I think that has been attribution to the air.

13:20.000 --> 13:29.000
I think any other statement you know is I had a mate which you feel the committee should know about

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
and which we're kept light upon the issues as well in this conversation.

13:33.000 --> 13:46.000
Mr. Duncan, there may be details for a minute, but I am sure that by the time the sun is and Mr. Welch gets through cross examining me,

13:46.000 --> 13:54.000
there'll be nothing left out, so I will leave it up for the cross examination.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
I'm sure it's been a confidential set of bides in the 10 years of the direct examination.

13:59.000 --> 14:08.000
You have come back in the capacity of Dr. Jekyll with his cross examination after lunch, so we will be taking a two-five.

14:08.000 --> 14:15.000
Many of you have come to order.

14:15.000 --> 14:28.000
I'd like to start the proceeding if we could.

14:28.000 --> 14:43.000
Chair, I'd like to begin, and there's been a custom now for some time by welcoming the guest who has come to the committee room.

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
We have to have you here watching one of the committees of your government in action.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
As those of you who have been here before, I know we have a committee.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
It's important.

14:57.000 --> 15:06.000
Audible manifestations of the approval of just a true book at any time and any manner on behalf of the audience.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
The uniformed members of the Chapter Police Force that you see before you,

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
and the plain sounds people scattered throughout the audience,

15:16.000 --> 15:24.000
have received instructions from the committee to remove from the room without further orders from the chair.

15:24.000 --> 15:34.000
Anyone who violates the terms under which you entered the room, namely to refrain from audible manifestations of the approval of the approval.

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
I would ask the Chapter Police and the plain closeness carry out that order.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
If unhappily it becomes justice to her during the question of the proceed.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
Everybody in the room is convinced the convicts would be no more provided in this committee room.

15:53.000 --> 16:03.000
As we concluded the morning session, Council Jenkins had just finished his direct examination of the witness who was here.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
The witness who was standing in the car to the accountant was about to begin his sharp examination,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
buying him high to lay.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
The number I was told to have lunch this noon, I think I should explain once again.

16:16.000 --> 16:24.000
In earnest, the suggestions that he probably has the most unusual assignment ever given in the American Attorney's.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
His job is twofold and he wears two hats.

16:27.000 --> 16:37.000
One is to act as a defense attorney of the world, engaging in direct examination, helping the witnesses,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
present their case in the best possible life.

16:40.000 --> 16:49.000
Then he takes off that hat and becomes a shopping gun, something in the nature of a prosecutor in the attorney in which he does his best to demolish the case,

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
which he has helped to establish.

16:52.000 --> 17:02.000
And so he switches now from the happy Appalachians of a direct examination to the harsh adjectives of a shopping champion.

17:02.000 --> 17:12.000
The number of years ago there was a great opportunity to play non-blow away which went to the effect of absolute reason to Gallagher's positive and Mr. Schum.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I think that might have spread a little bit.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Mr. Schum again.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Mr. Schum.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
I hope that five of us will try and win up our rights to the point of which we will try.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Mr. Schum.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I left about the position you're in now, I would say, Chancellor Jenkins.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
I would then do a movie from one cast to another and he will proceed.

17:36.000 --> 17:44.000
He needs to hide at the exact time that he's now and he's determined to start a department in the shopping generation without Parliament.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
I'll tell you the goal out in the field ten minutes of the turn.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
You'll all like to meet up and talk.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Okay.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Chairman.

17:54.000 --> 18:09.000
Chairman McCluskey, the first thing I would like to say publicly is that every citizen of this country has to be in highly respect to the great office of the United States center.

18:09.000 --> 18:17.000
I'm sure you understand what I want to make it clear to all who care and to all who listen.

18:17.000 --> 18:25.000
I'm sure that some of you and your fellow understand as my difficult rule as a cross-examiner of a witness.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
It is not in touch in one.

18:29.000 --> 18:36.000
It has not been in touch in fact the cross-examiner and the second day of the army are his councils.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Are your councils?

18:39.000 --> 18:48.000
But I'm sure that it is also in you as a witness that in the discharge of my GD is offered for you to be chosen.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
There's otherwise another strike.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
So there are three out there that I want to discuss with you briefly.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
The first was the judgment that I say.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, I have received a great number of letters and letters from people.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
The effect of saying is Jenkins going to get rough with you.

19:16.000 --> 19:27.000
I want to make it clear to those people that have a duty to cross-examiner as vigorously as possible.

19:27.000 --> 19:38.000
That your cross-examination, the Bob Stevens, the Saturn, Mr. Cohn, myself, can know the express of your personal team.

19:38.000 --> 19:53.000
And I would like to tell you that as long as I have any of your judge, the chair of a Smithies, I don't think I have ever seen any more vigorous and more intelligent cross-examiner.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
And I want my friends for watching the panels that I expect you.

19:59.000 --> 20:08.000
I expect you to cross-examiner as vigorously as you can cross-examiner anyone.

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
And that's the flexible feeling between Mr. Jenkins and Jim McHack.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
Appreciate that some of your more sincere actions are possible.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
The first thing I want to do is to finish this in the 13th.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
I choose to join the charge as two of us with some of the letters which might be stronger.

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
One is to carry on this, and the other is to guide you over this name.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
I would like to guide you to examination all morning, some of them are fuzzy.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
I would keep saying the little thing is vain.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
As I just called, I want you to confirm yourself in the hall.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
With the leading suspect, fundamentally, a false discourage is the special thing you regard me.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.000
And I would like to ask some of the McCarthy senior edgmer Jim, Mr. Jenkins.

21:08.000 --> 21:16.000
On the answer that I think the Secretary of the Army is very honest and individual.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
He came down here with no experience in politics.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
I think he got no doubt that he was a very rough topic being played down here.

21:27.000 --> 21:34.000
I think what he did was mention the issue for the charges was completely wrong.

21:34.000 --> 21:45.000
I think he was caught in the position of individuals who have lost their best,

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
for the Shakespeare with the words in the UNICEF bloodplay.

21:49.000 --> 21:58.000
I am in blood, stepped in so far that there was no more as the figures of the law.

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
I think the Mr. Jenkins got shot at with a certain extent and smelt on on red.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
He found the admit choice between proceed.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
I believe he did play the McCarthy with the suffocating army of the students and armies, man.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
He got right.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
He was...

22:26.000 --> 22:34.000
Yes, but don't let the accused after the charges made against the car.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I think the fact was not honorable.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I think the truth is only of myself.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
I think the French will be the very honest man.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
The French are the unfunded people.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
The honest man, essentially unfunded, living with the American,

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
is truthful man, who is offensively unfunded once more years.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
Some of you may see...

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
No affordability, the security armies will soon be used now.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
How many years has been severely criticized by many people,

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
both my crook's ammunition of him was not just the right.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
And now, as the day it's twilight, with this drama, you might say,

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
when the curtain is lifted with falling, let's talk a little about the security of the army.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
The state is the senator who was fundamentally and essentially honest

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
with fundamentally and essentially truthful.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
There's a think out of the demonstrate of the judgment.

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
In the one of her clothes, which he made, one through my son and my father,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
which he said, I'm going to testify and tell the truth, one through son's reporter,

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
and he would be the one who made to somehow find the man to him,

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
which he said, for really is nothing to do with it.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
I think he was trying to be completely truthful.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
Not only does that senator McCarthy, but fundamentally and essentially,

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
he would serve the security of the army as a man of integrity, wouldn't he?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
When you're putting the funds for your...

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
In all of you direct testimony given here today,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
you'll never let one time mention these things,

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
those thoughts made against you.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Are you stuck by the security of the army, Dickie?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
And who's that of threat?

24:39.000 --> 24:45.000
Never let one time in the media to suspect the security of the army of the state,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
directly or the indecision.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
The shine was a hot piece.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
So, I remember the fuck I very known.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
Senator McCarthy, an imbu-what we have,

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
said about the security of the army.

25:06.000 --> 25:15.000
And I recall you just quoted there a package from perhaps the greatest philosopher that ever used it.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Say the one of two thousand years ago,

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
who's talking now about security and the value of a dismay?

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
In other words, is that philosopher came to my mind?

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
Who sees my first face?

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
But he'll take his mind with me and take that.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
This does not in return, but makes me poor indeed.

25:45.000 --> 25:54.000
And far we're right, as perhaps the most striking common day ever uttered on the value of a dismay that's puffed up.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
About the good name and the character of this security of the army.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
Well, you know, it holds a high position, a cabinet officer.

26:04.000 --> 26:11.000
And most of it will perhaps not strictly be for just constantly the only one man between human and human rights and rights now.

26:11.000 --> 26:20.000
I think that I'm sure he describes him as a man who has never maybe been expect against you or the members of this dark,

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
be the man for the son of a who's in the great security.

26:25.000 --> 26:32.000
Then, in the state of the youth, he hated coming to you and I hate the next direction this time.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
And you stated that in public utterance, and you stated now for all the years.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I am very happy to say that.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Robert Stevens makes coming to me to speak to you and I.

26:44.000 --> 26:52.000
I think the Bob Stevens, this point, coming to us with much as the enemy and I know.

26:52.000 --> 27:01.000
Senator McCutney, getting there to flak him, coming to us with much as any man who knows.

27:02.000 --> 27:09.000
The media has to claim that the McCarthy Committee was leaving the English.

27:09.000 --> 27:17.000
I mean, combining some persons in the army, became running the King's eyes.

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
Through the state of Montana, back to Washington, and Sturgeon, and the Indian soldiers.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
Through the Spanish and the Communist cooperation in the United Kingdom.

27:28.000 --> 27:41.000
From that time up to the day, this day's purchase, instant, got Robert Stevens out of here.

27:41.000 --> 27:50.000
The Secretary of the Army has never felt that done one word in the case of the youth.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
That he was a communist hardware.

27:55.000 --> 28:03.000
Or that he was reluctant, his vigilance to unbornly she did that in cooperation with you.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
With the army of communist, I said mercy.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
Now, there's a little fight we've got to fight for a short time.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
Mr. Stevens indicated, and I think honestly, sir, that he, just like Hamlet,

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
I think that it's true.

28:24.000 --> 28:34.000
I feel that Bob Stevens does not realize the truth.

28:34.000 --> 28:43.000
Remember, Peter Wolfen, Hamlet from Spurface, if he did, if he did,

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
he would have been willing to work without the famous and government printing off his debts

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
when the members of that old Truman Law report, his third communist before his,

28:55.000 --> 29:01.000
and make them explain why they sent communist back to Fort Montana.

29:01.000 --> 29:09.000
The British students lived in my opinion, they lived in Loyal Honest of Americans.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
I could find no fault with his activities until these times,

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
finally succumbed to the pressure and what pressure they were I don't know.

29:23.000 --> 29:31.000
Some of his friends and had one of his phone calls, but in the case that the political advisers,

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
the Democratic Party, was advising Bob Stevens,

29:36.000 --> 29:45.000
that some person who was, we hear about a meeting over in the Justice Department,

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
a pen of fire number of individuals, and put some motion in the machine rate

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
for the completely false charges.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
And I may say frauds and charges against Mr. Coleman, Mr. Carr.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
I think that if Mr. Stevens were a strong remain,

30:07.000 --> 30:14.000
if he didn't know it before Ham, when he discovered that the witness on the phone

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
that Mr. Carr had nothing whatsoever, so dealing with me shining honor,

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
I think when we spectacularly could have done himself from a few of them,

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
the country agreed that he came forward and said,

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
we were mistaken, somebody misguided me,

30:35.000 --> 30:43.000
and we find it now that Mr. Coleman has done nothing whatsoever in proper.

30:43.000 --> 30:50.000
I think that a man of strong characters would come forward and say that we were mistaken,

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
we want to drop those charges, let's get on with the investigation,

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
although it was destroyed in its place.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
So, I may say that Mr. Stern,

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
while I think there is nothing,

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
I think we just lost.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Nothing bad about the news.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
He got no facts.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Somehow, whether it's by the,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
or whether it's by the,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
or whether it's by the, or who,

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
and once we got to the end of the investigation,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
I'm going forward.
