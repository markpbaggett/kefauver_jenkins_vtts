00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
You mean that during the first of October up until this month later today?

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
When June 4th, and the first of October of June 4th,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
you were in the secretary's office at all times.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
We'll swear that over no calls in the secretary and anyone on the White House left.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Not that I remember, not that I still.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Perhaps there should be a little closer with him.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
You said how much you took.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I know. Well, the secretary said you did not take them, Mr. Lucas.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Well, I said how many times a day did calls to me and you did not take on the average?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I don't know, sir. Let's put this way.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Were you told when to take calls or when not to take them?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
There were two instances I was told not to. I don't remember what they were.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
I don't remember any during those periods, any occasions during those days where I was told that to.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Well, at the risk of becoming more so long this subject, I think it's important subjects.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Let's play the phone ring.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
As soon as the ring all day on the secretary's office, we'll start the phone rings.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
What do you do? Do you pick up an extension?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Nine of all rings and I pick it up. What's it?

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And where do you sit in the direction of the secretary's end?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Close out five, close to four in your office.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
You sit in another room?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, sir. And you can hear whenever the secretary is phone rings.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Well, the smartphone is raised.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I pick it up and it's written that somebody's telling me what's stuck in the back door.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Or find out if he's the down-to-cruseman.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
If you're a young, young, close, you pick up a phone.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
The telephoto-regions on the wire.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Those of the secretary's them tell you to monitor the call.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Or do you proceed to monitor it?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
The lengthie tells you not to monitor it.

02:04.000 --> 02:04.000


02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
And your family is fired.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
And I have no question.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
And I have no question.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
And he's actually one person.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Mr. Lucas.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
Am I correct in understanding that the cabinet officers have on their desk?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I believe a yellow phone.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Which is a direct line to the white power.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
This, I don't know what you call it, yellow phone.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
They have a white phone and a ranch is off with the white power.

02:37.000 --> 02:37.000


02:38.000 --> 02:38.000


02:39.000 --> 02:39.000


02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
All right, I'm going to ask you the second question.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Is it possible to monitor?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Is it possible for you to listen in on that line?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
No sir.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
But then the third question.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Is it possible for you to monitor a call between the secretary and the white house?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Not over that line.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Not over that line.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
No sir.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Well, and I assume what line is the secretary used?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Just trying to say some time here.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Just got to the white house.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
He would use that line.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So then I mean it's not possible.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I say if he uses that line all the time.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Then it would not be possible for you to monitor any call to the white house.

03:27.000 --> 03:27.000


03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Does he use any other line?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I have these in truth in there.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
So we use the regular switchboard when you've been there.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
And it's called the white house.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
You remember.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Not that I remember.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
No occasion like the regular.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Why are we asking the question?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
I don't understand that all secretary have direct lines.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
And seven of those direct lines.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
The white house.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
That's why we're still here.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
And all that direction.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
And you send this to the right?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Send this to the right.

04:04.000 --> 04:04.000


04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Send him the car.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
So the direction line is an important point.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I believe that you told me that.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
As far as you knew there were no calls between Mr. Stevens and family of White House.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Now, since I told her first.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Here that's not true.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
And they add letters.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.000


04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
There is a statement for the private line.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
He picks up that private line.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Sitting outside the door as you do.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
You would not know such a call.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Unless you leave the job to him also.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm not reflecting on you.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
This is your job to do that.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I have no way of knowing who he calls on the White House.

04:46.000 --> 04:46.000


04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, look at Mr. Putty important investigation.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
And by your answer you created a impression that there were no calls for the White House.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Now your testimony is that you would have no way of knowing.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Further enough there were calls in the White House.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
You did not answer that phone.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
It's a private line.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
You did no way of knowing.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
But there was a camera 1000 call.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Is that right?

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
There's a light in there that will indicate that he's on that phone.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
So that I don't go ring any more for another phone while he's on that one.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I have no idea who he talks to or what's going on over it.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
And you see when the man is on the right to see the chair believes that an answer to your question when he says anything calls in the White House.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
He thinks he heard something was in the state that it was not.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
But he monitored.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
He's coming to the loud speaking system.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I'm not sure that I heard it, but I think that's what he said.

05:44.000 --> 05:44.000


05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I don't really know what I said, sir, but that is the case.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
But I have no way of monitoring.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I don't know.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
I don't know.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
It's a little bit of a great file.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
He mentioned that loud speaking system.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
On the ground, and you have another phone from...

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I think I might find it.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I think I might find it.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
When you pick up the phone,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
and what is called the White House phone,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
the White House operator answers it.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
It might correct both of those phones.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
And I have a question.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Mr. Lucas, I'm trying to find out if further enough, we have all of the phone calls.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I'm trying to get it in regard to the charges,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
which resulted in immobilizing the committers.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm not interested in many charges, any phone calls,

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
to present the nice time.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I am interested in phone calls to other members of White House staff.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I understood you to say that you knew of no phone calls

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
between Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams who's on the White House staff.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Now, is this correct?

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
That you use a phone call from the White House staff, Mr. Stevens.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Or from Mr. Stevens, the White House staff,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
will not go through you with other phone calls, do.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
But there's a direct line,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
and therefore you have no way of knowing how many phone calls are made

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
unless you watch the white lights that went off.

07:11.000 --> 07:11.000


07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Now, can you tell us roughly how many times per day

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
for a week that white light went on?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Most of it, I don't know.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I just picked up the gift, I don't know.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Could you give us some money?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Well, close on, there'll be one for a while.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I have no way of knowing how many times during the day.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, that sort of sounds like my wife when she says

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
it's only a little way as a way.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I don't know, that means one blocker, 20.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I couldn't decide that on the...

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
What's that?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Well, roughly, can I just...

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
One last question, can I ask you roughly what it was like that?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Can I look it forward?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Just a little, one minute.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Just a little, one minute.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Just a little, make it on the next day to call the other two young people here

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
who do monitoring.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
They would be in the same position during and they wouldn't know what call were made

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
from the white house to Mr. Steven's device, perhaps it wasn't.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
That's right.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Could you tell us how you spell each other off?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
How many hours have they eaten you were?

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, Mrs. Pike, as she said, is a secretary to Inspector Steven.

08:37.000 --> 08:46.000
She would take calls, for example, if I went out of the room for a while or went out to reception room

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
or if I was already engaged, say, talking to somebody on the door,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
and then I'll inspect her there and bring her to the room.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Yes, sir. She was... she was welcome.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Since the other Mrs. Pike fired up or not available, she would jump into the fridge.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, in other words, you don't have three shifts of one takes, dollars, and types of the next takes,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
and types of material.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
No, we don't have shifts at all.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I mean, these three are incidental.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
Mr. Rawls, some of Mr. Rawls' disease is worth full time.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I am the same job you were having.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Walter, he has another full-time job, and he really...

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
He really seems to me on Saturdays, or if I'm on leave or something,

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
or that's dark, and I can't be there for the day, while Mr. Rawls usually be the one final.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
But you were a... you know, type of principal or the head, the manager in surprise, Steven Buckles.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
I have a point that's important to the fact that the Army is what I do most of the head-market, most of the call.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
No matter if you're in a very good debt, we'll conclude the questioning of Mr. Ruflitsen's departure

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
the month, Steven, phone call, that's concerned, and we'll call on Chancellor Jenkins now

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
so that he can introduce him in the evidence.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
And the Simonton's call, which we understand some of the Simonton's desires to have done at his time.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Good job, Mr. Ruflitsen.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
And the next bar for the safety of the continuity of the record

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
is made to a little longer than ten minutes, I don't know how long it'll cost.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
But I actually know that it comes just now that Saturdays, the time, the extended service,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
makes it completely continuous back into the record.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
And that's a good idea without a second, since the Simonton will be working on it until...

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I hear a particular call of a pretty red.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
I thank the Senator, and may I say I'd like to look for the end of the call to make a very short statement.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Thank you, Mr. Pete.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Are we through on this previous call on the agenda?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yes, we're now on the agenda.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And Colin, that's the inquiry you need to address.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
May I ask Mr. Jenkins, whether I have any phone call, but I just want to just put it there.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
And I think that you'll be chairing the inquiry and not the Zincs and Tennis.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Jenkins, so the chair, if you will, go follow the yesterday's address.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And if you look at that, it will complete me by a matter of minutes.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I'll do any monitor phone call for me.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
That's good.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
That includes Dr. Zoot, and the details are...

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I guess I was very unimportant, but I'm not going to ask you.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
The Secretary of State, and his chairman, Mr. Rekky,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
you further answer the Senator's objections to a question, let me say.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
I think it's better to exact them that there are no monitor phone calls, whatever.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I think that's between the infectees, even though I'm at the head of the...

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
This for the record, I have one entirely correct.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
There are none.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
In my opinion, the president can call Mr. Chairman, the senator from Missouri,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
has, I think, paid me a compliment.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
The enacting that I've been through calls, I can be so over there.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
I can't even tell the chairman without violating any of the rules of evidence,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
and I can validate them by having the party who makes me chairman.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
I could all do a slight discount for why the client's rights,

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
as Senator Jackson, and it might be better to call a continuity as far as the gentleman over here.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I'll put the menu on.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Please put the menu on.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
The government's resolution is before it's to have a security trial.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I would ask the council to make a statement about this.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
A couple of paraplegies, and then all of the calls, the same sir,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and it seemed to be which looked as if it was a month call,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
or rather the same one.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
I would list the rules on the witness stand at this time, the truth of the meeting.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, I have members of the committee.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
I desire this time to make a statement with reference to one or two of these monitored telephone calls

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
that pass between Sponger Simonton and the Secretary of the Army.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.000


13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
There are two adjectives,

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
being perhaps two, certainly in one, maybe in more than one of these calls.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Which in my opinion do not seem the slightest,

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
and two are distracted from the meaning of that particular call.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
I say that in all honesty and all sincerity.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
I do not think they would invade the senator from Missouri, they would not invade me.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
If I were the author of the call, but I'm going to ask those two adjectives, Senator McCarthy, and I,

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
do you say that they are no less changing the means of these calls that they didn't think they could have?

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Yes, they are glad to have them as witnesses, they glad to hear that.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Mr. Cullen is not the only person who used a strong language.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I'm not the only person who could have been a gentleman,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
but I'm not the only one who could have been a gentleman,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
and we've got a slave, they do not change the meaning of the context of the calls.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
And Mr. Welch, may I call upon you?

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
By unanimous concept, the adjective questions will be deleted from these.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
Can't skip to the letter, Mr. Rones, if he's demanded any meet and just give me.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
I was just very happy to have any member of the committee, including Senator McCarthy,

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
who looked up to two words, all I'd like to say there, no spend could be construed in any possible way as a scene,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
however they might be construed as empathic.

14:41.000 --> 14:51.000
I invite my colleague, Jim, to ask questions to strike in the unannounced attitudes of the record

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
and the carries also clarified over the wide confidence paid him that no adjective is his,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
that it is his, that it is his, that it is his, that it is his, that it is his.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Mr. Welch, you are back on the witness band.

15:04.000 --> 15:12.000
And you're here to fool quantify us as an expert in your line of monitoring telephone calls.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Mr. Chairman, I just, just want to be sure we got the address to it.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Before we reach the two words in question, I will be in the key.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Okay.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
This is taken by the two serves that you are an expert in adjective.

15:27.000 --> 15:35.000
As this as stated before, stating,

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
Mr. Welch, on the team's cover depth in firing a million new rounds in East Tennessee.

15:43.000 --> 15:52.000
Mr. Welch, he states whether or not he's monitored his telephone conversation between Senator Simon and the Secretary of the Army,

15:53.000 --> 16:03.000
on February 20th, 54, on 10-05, it doesn't state AM or PM, I presume, you can tell us.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
Did you not do that, Mr. Chairman? It was a year because that afternoon I went to New York for the New York.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
That was in the morning, then, of that date, just in order.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Now Mr. Rodin, you took that down, I think it in short hand.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yes, sir.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I think it's a tight issue.

16:22.000 --> 16:34.000
Whether or not it is verbatim, or 100 percent actors, those are not the Italian and European representatives of the conversation between Senator and the Secretary of the Army.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I will see to now read it in the record.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
10-05, I say it's all Senator Stewart's time.

16:43.000 --> 16:53.000
I say I want to call you, you and tell you, Mr. Stewart, in accordance with the previous request, if any, that, I say if he was face Secretary already.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I think that would be better.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Secretary, Secretary, I want to call you and tell you the developments.

17:01.000 --> 17:09.000
But when I got in the office this morning, I found out for the first time where Senator McCarthy was, believing it is fair to put all the cards on the table at all times.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
I wanted to call him and tell him that I had called on all the members of the committee.

17:14.000 --> 17:24.000
I could find yesterday and that I had said that I did not intend to produce liquor, and I told him that I did not intend to have use of our professional officer for continued.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
What you can imagine what happened, he really started to beat my brains up.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Senator Simonkin, don't worry about that.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Secretary of the Army, I am a codler of red, you see.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
Secretary of the Army, did you have anybody on the phone? Secretary of the Army, who else I did?

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Secretary of the Army, that's good, keep the recording.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
Secretary of the Army, he blew his lid and finally he said, when you accept the subpoena for time's block Tuesday morning,

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
and I said, I will take that under advisement. He said, are you refusing? I said, I am not refusing to appear at all.

18:14.000 --> 18:21.000
I will take it under advisement. He said, you are subpoena for 10 o'clock Tuesday morning. He didn't say what committee or where.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
Senator Simonkin, just keep it all down on paper. Secretary of the Army, I wanted to post you on what had transpired.

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
I looked at it and gathered from that and probably just shifting to Washington and had me for a witness because I told him I was not going to produce liquor.

18:36.000 --> 18:49.000
Senator Simonkin, he just called me his man and said he was not as liquor on Tuesday. If I found this way about it, if it was cursory on my part that he would go ahead with the hearing,

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
but if it was more than cursory, that he would postpone the hearing until I got back.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Senator Simonkin, wouldn't we do either? No, we can't.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
Senator Simonkin, what did you have? What did that person call you when you did the entire job?

19:11.000 --> 19:22.000
Senator Simonkin, he just called me his man and said that he would not have liquor on Tuesday. If I found this way about it, if it was cursory on my part, he would go ahead with the hearing,

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
but if it was more than cursory, that he would postpone the hearing until I got back.

19:27.000 --> 19:37.000
Secretary of the Army, is both following them? Senator Simonkin? Yes, Secretary of the Army. I guess he is following another meeting now for the flippers that beating my brains out.

19:37.000 --> 19:46.000
Senator Simonkin, I wouldn't show until I am here. I wouldn't go until I am here. Secretary of the Army, that is one reason why I am calling you.

19:46.000 --> 19:56.000
Senator Simonkin, I will get into that with flippers, Secretary of the Army. I put any call for John McCullough and I talked to him just before your call came on.

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
Senator Simonkin, I just wouldn't go. Let me talk to Flipkitt about it and I will call you.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
Is that all of that conversation Mr. Roach? Yes, you can now move to the room.

20:08.000 --> 20:16.000
Who said, well, then I am 20th of February, 54th, you monitor the telephone call between Senator Simonkin and the Secretary of the Army. Yes, sir.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
Is that according to your records, from the last meeting, the second one you reported, the 10-06 meeting? Yes, sir.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
Do you have a transcript of that new hearting before you? Yes, sir.

20:29.000 --> 20:36.000
Move it. Accurate. I was from Sanctuary, accurate. Yes, sir.

20:36.000 --> 20:46.000
I will ask you to now read that as a record. In 20th of February, 54th, 10-25th, Senator Simonkin, along with his aide.

20:46.000 --> 20:55.000
Secretary of the Army. Senator Simonkin, yes. I talked to our legal friend. He thinks it was in the state for you to call Mac.

20:55.000 --> 21:05.000
I am writing this letter to Mac. Dear Mr. Chairman, they call me the other of your staff call this morning to say you are available to post-polling this book or hearing until March 10th.

21:05.000 --> 21:15.000
Well, thereafter. Thank you very much. Secretary Stevens, all hope for me this morning. You are going to Sipina again this next Tuesday February 25th.

21:15.000 --> 21:27.000
Because of my great interest in this entire matter, I would greatly appreciate you all post-polling in each hearing with respect to Secretary Stevens before the Army. I am sincere to yours.

21:27.000 --> 21:41.000
I would suggest two things to you. One, less counterpunched this burden, not least. Two, I think your people over there are pretty impressed and I don't blame them. But maybe some of them can't see the force for the trees.

21:41.000 --> 21:52.000
This boy gets awfully rough. I would use those telephone numbers I gave you yesterday. That's eight and deep. It could not be deeper in this fight for your opponent. You see?

21:52.000 --> 22:04.000
Secretary of the Army, well, I tell you, probably it was for politics and for justice just because I just felt that having gone on and called on members of this committee, it was the right thing to do.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
And it would not give him a chance to say that we go around behind his back.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
Senator Simon, I'll just do it Mr. O.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
The only addiction to me is short paragraph. From the meeting, I found this word.

22:20.000 --> 22:32.000
I know, but it's amazing. Follow me and see if I read this paragraph correctly. With one exception to which I'll call your attention. From designing them.

22:32.000 --> 22:40.000
I think that's probably pretty smart. But you aren't the same. But you are the secretary of the Army and you can do anything you can.

22:40.000 --> 22:49.000
But I would not believe it was him a mission. It's awful. My friend. That is just for what it's worth. I have deleted only one word. I have an option.

22:49.000 --> 22:57.000
You agree with me that it is no way to change this meeting. You got to be prepared. I just have sure he was.

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
If I just wanted to meet with Mayor, Mayor, I didn't need one word.

23:05.000 --> 23:13.000
Apparently uttered by the secretary of the Army. Yes sir. I shall now meet Mr. Chairman and the next secretary.

23:13.000 --> 23:37.000
I know it is worth a lot. The meeting one word. Mr. O.

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
Do you agree with me that it does in no way. I have to do it.

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
Check from the meeting of that sentence. I will show you the very last. Now, do we proceed Mr. O.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
Sorry for signing them. It is a question of politics at all. It is a question of the integrity and fighting morale of the Army.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
And therefore, everybody in my opinion, who has a concept of what this decent will break their back to help you in any way they can.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
I would never have gotten near him if I could help it.

24:15.000 --> 24:25.000
You were going ahead.

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
The next call I have is 1-2-3. Sorry for signing them calling.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
Sorry for signing them.

25:38.000 --> 25:45.000
I will send you the senator signings and returns.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
That is not a direct call. That is not a direct call.

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
I will let him get on the phone on time.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
I will give him a second. I will look at my notes.

26:04.000 --> 26:20.000
Mr. O.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
I will give you a little piece of your tooth to survive.

26:27.000 --> 26:34.000
My friend gets to disay it.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
This guy got any steam in him.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
I said, sure right.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
I believe one word have a not.

26:44.000 --> 26:51.000
He was me that is no wise changes the meaning of that statement.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
He said, if he had steel, he can do a great service.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
He said, also, he has got to be careful of each move he makes.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Carefully thought out.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
I think you may have put this fellow on the running a little bit, but he has to be at job in getting around something.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
Did you read the lead editor of the New York Journal of Preview, Secretary of the Army? No, I haven't.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
Senator Simonton. It is the worst of the fact against him that has ever been made.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
I think you are in shape to protect your army provided you don't miss one and provide you stay tough.

27:26.000 --> 27:34.000
I don't mean silly tough. I'm firm. Secretary of the Army. I've got to do that, Stuart. Senator Simonton.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
One other fellow that is on your side, and I know he is absolutely top.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
That is Bill Rogers. You can't go wrong with Bill.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
Secretary of the Army. We have been in touch with him, of course.

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
Senator Simonton. This fellow might be sick to know. Secretary of the Army.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
I thought by now he would have come out with a public statement.

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
I have here.

28:11.000 --> 28:11.000


28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
You go ahead Mr. Rhodes.

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
Starting with the statement of Senator Simonton, not the light, Senator Simonton.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
I would doubt that he would do that.

28:29.000 --> 28:36.000
Another thing we have got to be very careful because we don't want to push him in the place where he has to do his to preserve place.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Place because on that place is he will do anything.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
You read this year I will editorial. Secretary of the Army. I will do that.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
Is that all of that monitored telephone call Mr. Rhodes? Yes, sir.

28:49.000 --> 28:55.000
Do you have another monitor telephone call between Senator Simonton and Secretary of the Army? Yes, sir.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
What is the date of it? 21 February 1954.

28:58.000 --> 29:05.000
What hour of the day? 1050. Am. Is this substantially correct? Yes, sir.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
And did you monitor it? Yes, sir.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
How do I excuse and now read that in the record? 1050.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
Senator Simonton called Secretary of the Army. Senator Simonton.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
One thing worried me a little bit. I wrote that letter to McCarty yesterday in which I said I requested.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
There will be no hearing of you or anybody from the Army until I got back.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
And I read it to you and you thought it was all right.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I was talking with my friend on some other matters this morning.

29:34.000 --> 29:41.000
Just before taking off and he dealt me, that the Washington Post says you are going to volunteer to appear.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
Secretary of the Army. They must have dreamed that up. I have made no statement like that.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
On the other hand, Stu, I can't create the impression in the minds of the public that I am scared of this guy.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Senator Simonton.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
If you said you would come to on your own time, if you would come at your own convenience, Secretary of the Army,

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
I haven't made any statement at all. There are some rumors going around.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
They are all interested in this thing, of course. Senator Simonton.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
If you and I are going to work together, we have got to be on the table with each other.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Total Father told me he got it out of the Pentagon. Secretary of the Army.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I am with Father Bruce Marrake.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Yes, sir Bruce. We serve you and we are working together.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Senator Simonton.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
If you and I are going to work together, we have got to be on the table with each other.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Total Father told me he got it out of the Pentagon.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Secretary of the Army.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
I am other than amazed if he did. Senator Simonton.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I know he got it from.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
If you are going to play with McCartney, you have got to just get about me on those marks,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
or Queenbury rules.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
The thing I wanted to tell you is that here is the way they operate.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
If they felt that you had gone too far and you just conversations with you, they would leave you to a reporter.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
But maybe you had asked to come instead of the fact that they had instructed you to come.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Secretary of the Army.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
I would issue a statement and deny that.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Senator Simonton.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
On the Washington Post, you have one of the very best reporters who will be in your camp.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And that is Marie Margaret.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.000
And I thought, Reston, who is one of the best, I've won the best articles I have read in New York Times.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Secretary of the Army.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
You can see call me yesterday and I told him what I knew.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Senator Simonton.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
I thought he wrote a very excellent article.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Secretary of the Army.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
I haven't seen the post to tell the truth.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Senator Simonton.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Otter Rokit.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
He did get it on the Hill.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
The only thing I want to do is just don't put me in a box by going up there to the day.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I will not go.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
We can throw the box in his thing.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Secretary of the Army.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
I would much rather have this thing post-cone in line with your letter.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm not looking forward to going up there on Tuesday.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
Because he were actually to Safina me while I have the technical right not to go.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Senator Simonton, he can't Safina you.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Here are the rules we drove through.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
If the three Democratic members of the committee are unanimous enough foraging a hearing,

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
then the hearing will not be held unless the majority of the full committee agrees to it.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
Now I think I have got to show the majority of the full committee will not agree to it.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
However, I just ask you not to make me look silly.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
If you decide to go up before I get back, that is 100% with me.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
I would talk to McClellan about it.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
It might make me look silly.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Secretary of the Army.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I am not going to do that.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I am not going to put you in any box.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
Senator Simonton, the only thing is I don't want him to unload on me while I am gone.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Did all of that conversation throw out?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Yes sir.

32:52.000 --> 33:00.000
All of the monitored telephone conversations that Chiefs is packing between the security of the Army and Senator Simonton.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.000
Now let's keep the stand aside and let Mr. Lucius take the witness stand.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
Mr. Obama, Mr. Lucius comes to the witness stand while we have this opportunity.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Let's return to our studio.
