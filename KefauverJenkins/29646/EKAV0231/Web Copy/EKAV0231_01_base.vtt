WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I don't want to start.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
I knew it was under McCarthy first.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Yes.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Under McCarthy.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Only more than I'd like to have Mr. Pike if I may.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
You make the right thing.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I have a question to ask this, with this manager,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
because I do that before you retire.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Two out.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Just one or two.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Really?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
It would not be collect, delete, delete, delete.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
I'm not going to retire.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
We collect, delete, the impression that three people do nothing but monitor calls in the office with Mr. Lucas.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
It would be far from correct.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Is it true that you sell each other at that time?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Is that right?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
That is right.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
We all have other duties.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
What are your other duties?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
My other duties are to handling the sex care appointments.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I've talked to a great many people on the telephone that want to speak with him.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Many people will call him up.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
They want to talk to the sex care of the army.

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
It turns out to be some problem that someone else that's not a better handle than he is.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
He wouldn't be available anyway.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
I'd like to get them to the proper people.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
It's been helpful.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I arrange his appointments.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
I call people and there are many cancellations and adjustments and so on.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
It goes on all the time.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm busy with that.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
People call in and the reception room.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
One of them, I talk to them.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
I start to help them.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I start to see him.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I talk to them.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I start to help them.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
That's an appointment.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Some of these other people.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I try to deal with it.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
When you say people call in to appointments, you mean people turn up physically.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
They turn up physically and they call on the telephone.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Both.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Do you occasionally take any of the indications?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I know which pipes are now.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm not sure what I've taken.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Those are taken from Mr. Tasis.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
They've taken indications from people.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm just getting there and we're going to get to the bus to carry or just something down fast.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Because I'm here now.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Now, ordinary, you don't have to try what you take.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Do you?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Do you mean the telephone call?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Right.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
I think this is one of the very, very rare occasions when I've ever done stuff.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You just let come.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
You don't know it's without making any restrictions.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes, really.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
The whole point is to get it on paper.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
If it's just something goes by me or I've got it thrown there, I can try to handle it.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Situation later, if the file put it down first, simply the memory.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
The next thing I know, somebody will be asking me, what are these days about for?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
My memory might fail me.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And when you monitor a telephone conversation that calls for action,

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
you simply look at your notes, institute the action and get things going.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Is that right?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
That's for it.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
And when you transfer it to RLE, what is in your notes?

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
The appropriate people that you want to educate and get to work,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
then that's the notes that serves the perfect.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
That's right.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I also use this in different mechanical ways.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I might write a little note this day in an executive technical office

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
where he would be in the first and to get the information that one of the things that that's for.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
And one other thing I suppose is that the orders you issued when you hang up the telephone don't get tied out,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
you can look back on something failed and say,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
here is what I knew was to be done and this is the order I know I gave.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes sir, but I don't really give orders.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
I just thought it was an internal business and that's very wrong.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I don't know what happened and what job needs to be served.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I certainly didn't mean to indicate that you actually issued orders.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
But after you hear on the telephone, monitor call, certain actions taken,

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
you say to be appropriate people, this is the action that Mr. Stevens expects to have happen.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
This will resolve what he just talked about.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
I don't mean to use those words, but in the fact that's what gets back.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
You'll serve.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
And in the present.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Before I ask Mr. Smith to look,

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
if I'd like to have Mr. Smith's place, do you say right there?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Mr. Price is not too loud.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
We better have some issues.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Just one question.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
The phone call to some of everyone from Secretary Stevens on the 20th of February,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
was at 10 o'clock.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
You have an o'clock in the morning, right?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes sir.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Now, last time may or may not become important, I don't know.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
But can you be reasonably certain that the time was either 11 or roughly 11 o'clock?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Yes, I always make that a note all the time, in the notebook,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
that's the time that the call is put true.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
I'm afraid this may not be a proper question, ask of you.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And you need an answer.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Unless you have some information on it.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Just like that.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Did you monitor the call from Mr. Stevens to me at 10 o'clock that morning?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
No, sir.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Do you know who I'm going to hear that?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I...

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Mr. Rhodes, monitor that one.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm not a curious mill finder at the Stephen's told center of Montpitt,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
he doesn't find me at 11 o'clock in the morning,

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
and there's a Montpitt's call with Mr. Stevens, hand of me at 10 o'clock.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
As I say, you may not be able to answer that.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Unless you just have put Mr. Stevens to some of the...

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
some else to monitor the call.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm afraid I'm afraid that's not a question, I should have to.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And don't know for the first time.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
What's your look at?

05:57.000 --> 06:10.000
Mr. Lucas, could you tell me definitely who monitored the call between Mr. Stevens and me

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
and the 20th of February at 10 o'clock a.m.?

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
You've completely discussed the other two young people who monitored calls at 11 o'clock.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
Mr. Rhodes, monitor that, and could you tell me who monitored the call?

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
Did the MPI all turn to him or can't he return the secretary at Stephen's call?

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
14 January, 1954, 243 p.m.?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I did, sir.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
And then there's one other one.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
They call 7 November, 1953, 12, 19 p.m.,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
7 November, 15th, 18th, 18th, 18th, 18th, 18th, buying the secretary at Stephen's, you know who monitored that?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I did the world, that was November.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I think.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
No.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Mr. Lucas, I'd like to make it very, very clear here, the mile.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
I think the practice of eavesdropping is highly improper.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
I do want to make it clear that I don't attach any wrongdoing to the part of the youth's three people who've been doing it.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
You've an order to do it, you've no choice but to do that.

07:28.000 --> 07:40.000
I hope in the appropriations to many we take up the question of why the money for the eavesdropping is hidden from the Son of the Public.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
But be that as it may let me ask you, if you question,

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
did you ever monitor any calls with Mr. Charles Morgan?

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
And he was a secretary or anyone else?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
No, sir.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Did you ever monitor any calls?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Right then.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
Did you ever know of any calls between the secretary or anyone else who was a two-master Morgan?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
No, I know, I know.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
How about Mr. William Rogers of the Justice Department?

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
I believe at some point I monitor calls between the directors and Mr. Steven.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And with those calls we available.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
Forget to give him up a presidential directive, I mean how they physically available.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
I think all you could ask him send him a copy of whether he has his notebook, he wouldn't know about the availability of it.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, I mean, do you have your notebook, do you have any way of getting those calls?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
I've had just possible audits, I'm not sure.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, I prefer an important amount, I'm Mr. Rogers of the Deputy Attorney General.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
They claim as the major public lay time and time again to Mr. Rogers

09:01.000 --> 09:10.000
but one of those who took the part in lighting the fuse or setting up the machinery

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
for the charges against Mr. Carmichael Cohn myself.

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
Therefore any phone calls, Mr. Steven, Mr. Rogers, would be very important from that doubly true view of the fact that Mr. Rogers

09:24.000 --> 09:36.000
was getting a transcript of this testimony every day and he's being asked to fairly and inflectuate past upon legal questions.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
So could you tell us whether or not those calls would be available?

09:43.000 --> 09:53.000
I'm not asking you to produce them, that might be a violation of the presidential directive in regard to what I think is that we can't ask you to violate them.

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
I think what this is the question is that the chair understand them and get so its appropriate, whether or not you have the notebook or you have the records.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Well, nothing that you was making them available, that's clear outside of your purview resource.

10:08.000 --> 10:19.000
It's time to find out I think whether the hand jibble report, if your monitoring is in your position or wherever you find your other monitor report.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
If I took what I'm right, I'd be leaving with the available, yes.

10:26.000 --> 10:36.000
Well, I'm not going to get such a thought, you've put some I know that's taking the last number of calls these days and possible for us to accept your memories call,

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
but they call with the Attorney General's office I assume would leave some in question on you.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Could you give us some ideas or other not just did monitor such a call?

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
I believe I did, so the Democratic Party. Could you do this then?

10:52.000 --> 11:08.000
And again I'm not asking you to produce the call, that's up to the chairman's decide, but can you produce the date and the time that you monitor call between Mr. Stevens and the Attorney General?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
You mean by that senator just technically possible to do this one?

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
Well, I think I don't need physically possible, but I would like to ask you to do this, and I think that's a little violation when you direct them.

11:19.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm not asking him at this time to tell what was in the monitor's conversation, I really would like to know these dates, the dates of the call for a man to time they were made.

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, senator they had to test that that would cover perfectly in the chairman's period of time you see.

11:41.000 --> 11:59.000
And make a quite a gigantic pass, if I think you make a good point, let's talk then, let's see, the whole last box is over, that's from the efforts to call her and that fish was coming into some questions.

11:59.000 --> 12:08.000
And the military became very known up to the West Side by a stocked silver and bring it down to a date.

12:08.000 --> 12:23.000
Could you check your book, Mr. Lucas, with a few of the difficulty and let's give it a date to the call, with Mr. Rogers, Farmingshire Brown, L, but that's extended with anyone else in the Justice Department.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
I'm from Luzzo. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I can ask about the present term on the morning.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Can you bring it over to Mr. Lundy Martin, if you're coming back in and present in the comments, questions any questions?

12:37.000 --> 12:45.000
Mr. Chairman, I would say it's always difficult to know just what the extent of a presidential order is.

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
What I do is that he could state whether or not he took such conversations and on what states Mr. Sonny McCarthy.

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
If it turns out that I'm wrong on that, I'm just wrong, but it seems to be no harm in my thing that I guess that can be done.

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
Certainly the witness will do the physical work and if it's proper to disclose the result of his work, it will do no feat as well.

13:07.000 --> 13:18.000
I think that's extremely important because we've heard so much conversation about letting the Chips fall early in May.

13:18.000 --> 13:27.000
The Justice Department has so much done the job of deciding where the Chips will originally fall.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
For back reasons, I would like to have the community know just the number of phone calls.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Then we can determine whether or not there is some way we can do.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
The President, if that's possible, I don't know.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
So far, he has been too anxious to take my advice.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
Whether we can induce the President to make those calls available.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
But this time, I do think that the witness could be ordered from Mr. Chaplin to return one morning with that information for him.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
The President here understands the witness has immediately used that without any questions.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I'd like to welcome you.

14:07.000 --> 14:19.000
What I have said is that the information will be looked up and if the offer to disclose it, and I have made a well-skinned guess that it is offered

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
to disclose that they're working on that being however only a little sketch.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
If it's offered to disclose them, you will certainly be told the number right next to the call.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
I think that's a clear left problem.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
Mr. Elyk, look at the honour above the...

14:49.000 --> 15:13.000
...but the list of between the 15th and 21st of January, and that again in February, you've one of her calls between Mr. Brownhill and Mr. Elyk.

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
I don't believe I did. It would be a very unusual thing if I did.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
Maybe we'll take a little space. Mr. Beavons, lovely country, I know.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
From the time to my nose, when you're wrong, let's make it general.

15:34.000 --> 15:49.000
Did you, after January 1st of this year, monitor any calls between Mr. Beavons, or Mr. Adam, and the one hand, and Mr. Brownhill on the other?

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
No further.

15:54.000 --> 16:06.000
That may be... is having information that has had the impression of one of the presence of Brownhill was not as far as this deal.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
I find that Mr. Rogers is making a call from Mr. Brownhill.

16:10.000 --> 16:22.000
Can you tell me for certain you did not know of any calls in Mr. Brownhill with receiving Farm Mr. Brownhill on the track?

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
After January 1st of this year, I would not call if that was such.

16:28.000 --> 16:37.000
I wonder if you would discuss this with your crew monitors and ask them whether or not they know of what's called.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
They indicated they did not.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
If you have any calls from Mr. Beavons, look at it.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
Do you know of any calls from Mr. Henthal and Mr. Beavons?

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
Yes sir. Were those monitors...

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Some calls were monitored.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I don't know whether all of them were or just what.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
I know I monitored some calls between Mr. Henthal and Mr. State.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I have a question.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I ask you to produce the calls when you give us the date.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
The time of those calls subsequent to the first of October 1953.

17:18.000 --> 17:25.000
I want again to tell you that we did the other request that we will ascertain that that's a month of travel.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
How about Vice President Richard Nixon?

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Any calls from Mr. Beavons and the Vice President?

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
I don't move.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Mr. Beavons, is there any doubt about that?

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
It's certainly not about this case or if there ever was one.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
I'm not sure if there was any.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
It would have been one and I'm not sure if there was one and it would have been something social.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
Well, look at the next set of calls and be asked.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Let's return to our chair.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
When Dr. Confield Jenkins and the chair has been advised,

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
the understanding correctly that the sound and signage and the suggested that you take up his calls next.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
I assume that the chairman of Mr. Chairman, I have one question.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Have we been easy to go around?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
No, I think President McCurkley wanted to be.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I have one question.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
You have one question.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Very well.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm very delighted that it is your question.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I'll be very brief.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
I'll give you all my time in other than minutes.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I don't believe Mr. Lucas and I may be an air hall.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Will you just state your college graduate?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Yes sir.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
And what university?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
North Western University.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
North Western University. You got your BA degree.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
It was a B.S. degree.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
B.S. degree.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
And then you took some demographic courses in addition?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Yes sir.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Baseball, midlife, school, per...

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Have you defeated your college?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yes sir.

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
So that you're fully qualified in effect to a court stenographer?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yes sir.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I have worked in a court that I've done that...

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, an army that is worse than solveth would be that you could do the work of my court stenographer.

19:15.000 --> 19:24.000
Rapid, short-hand notes of conversations of people, whether it's in a hearing or a meeting or a telephone.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yes sir.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Any sentence in the right?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
In the direction?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
And the bothers?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
And the voice acts?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
And the assignments?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Mr. Welp, shall.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
And Mr. McCarton.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Mr. Cohen.

19:34.000 --> 19:43.000
Mr. Lucas, do you have a monitor of a call made by Mr. Stevens to General Wattenon October the 2nd?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
At a present?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Do I have a monitor?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Did you monitor such a call?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
What date?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
October the 2nd, 1953.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I may have served.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I don't remember.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Well, sir, do you recall?

20:01.000 --> 20:10.000
I do and I were together at a meeting with Mr. Howard, so Mr. Chankin's bag and Mr. St. Clair representing Mr. Welchop's bag in the court for this building.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Yes sir.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
And at that time, I asked about a call by Mr. Stevens to General Wattenon.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I told the second you recall that.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I recall being here.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I don't remember whether or not you asked me.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
In any case, you have not checked.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
And yet to see whether there is such a call always monitoring.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Most of all, what you do that, sir, will search.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
And if there is, and if such a call has been monitored, would you produce that?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
For this committee on Monday morning.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Well, that may act as a desk best to call.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And we treat that as we do the other monitor.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
The other monitor.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
The other monitor.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I have to keep them out.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
But what to do?

20:50.000 --> 20:58.000
Similarly, Mr. Locust, did you or what I say you right speak here of the call monitors as well?

20:58.000 --> 21:07.000
Monitor, phone call, which we missed this evening and Mr. Adams on November 24th and November 25th, 1953.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I make up, sir, I don't remember.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Well, hasn't anybody else been able to check on that?

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Well, if we missed this evening, Mr. Adams about to remove the general law.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Well, sir, I haven't brought anybody else made up.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Me, sir, all the discussion that's going on about those controls in this area,

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
from you have never been asked whether they existed in my perspective.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, there's been so much discussion about 124 now.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I don't know what I've been asked to do.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Somebody who's been tracking just what I'm supposed to tell you.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Oh, my sir.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
In any event, sir, you are now asked by me if you would be kind enough to

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
and that applies to the mic and the controls.

21:47.000 --> 21:57.000
So we weathered very serious monitors of telephone calls between Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams on November 24th and November 25th, 1953.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
If they do exist and I assume they must, I would ask if those be produced in this role.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
They will be treated just as follows the outfit.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
They will ascertain if they're worse that, too, that and find out how the position is served.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Well, I'm asking that they be produced.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
But there's going to be an objection to serve it to it, of course.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
There will come going one step further than Senator McClubby, too.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
Now, similarly, we can check and see whether on December 16th or December 17th,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
there are telephone calls between Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams,

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
which were monitored by you or either of your co-enters.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Yes, sir.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
Now, have you monitored any telephone calls since October?

22:45.000 --> 22:58.000
And with particular reference to the January Peabewary period between Mr. Stevens and Mr. Sherman Adams?

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
During the period, I monitored calls yesterday between Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
or I don't know.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
No, I didn't get all that.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
You see, you did all that.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
The question, sir, not a very good question.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
Have you monitored the telephone call between Secretary Stevens and Governor Sherman Adams?

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Well, but I already called, so you don't be called.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Most of all, did you check that for us?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Yes, sir.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Have you monitored telephone call from the Chief Commune?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Yes.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And, by the way, Mr. Lopez, the Senator of mine, to me,

23:29.000 --> 23:36.000
addressing these questions to you, unlike vice-talking to Ms. Pike and Mr. Rhodes.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.000
Can you tell us whether in February and January February and March of 1954,

23:43.000 --> 23:52.000
you or they monitored telephone calls between Mr. Stevens and members of the White House there concerning this conversation?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Yes, sir.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm John the Valley Callsor.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
You don't be called any telephone call, which will monitor between Mr. Stevens and any members of the White House there.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
You know, sir, that's good.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Yeah.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Would you check that for us?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Well, sir.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
And I think that about this battle I have.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Jim.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Mr. Warner, two questions.

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
Mr. Luther, could you look at the appears of this month?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
You hear me?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yes, sir.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
If I'm going to look at the appears of this, I will know.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Phone calls between Mr. Frank Trier,

24:28.000 --> 24:37.000
they chiefed my staff and Mr. Adams until the day after Mr. Adams came to my apartment.

24:37.000 --> 24:48.000
At this time I refuse to call off the investigation of communist infiltration refused to suspend the subpoenas of the loyalty board.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
I don't want the subpoenas over in your office.

24:52.000 --> 25:00.000
Would you be the man who started to take the side and monitor the call between Mr. Adams and Mr. Trier?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Was that being someone who offered?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
That would be a still-of-the-office.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
I would be a very rare occasion, there was rare possibility, but generally speaking, it was being his own office.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
He was offered to snap right next to us or right next to us.

25:15.000 --> 25:24.000
A man said, if not very rare, I found out that the day after Mr. Adams was turned down on what I have referred to as a black wheel trot.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
And when I started calling Mr. Trier, consistently in make self-serving decorations,

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
a sizable number of calls, none before that.

25:35.000 --> 25:44.000
I wondered Mr. Welch, who could tell us who did that monitoring and did we have them here?

25:44.000 --> 25:51.000
I should say, though, it's called Senator Tripp, he treated the same as the others who talked about it, who stayed to date with your interstitial,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
the areas in which you were interested.

25:53.000 --> 26:00.000
Well, there's no presidential directive in regard to the call, and Mr. Adams, Mr. Trier, the president's directive,

26:00.000 --> 26:07.000
I'd like to think we exempted anything between Mr. Adam and Mr. Steezen and Mr. Thomas.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Quite a few now, if you have the details, I'll go ask for a few.

26:11.000 --> 26:21.000
Well, I would like to have someone over there make a thorough check, give us the dates and all the monitored calls,

26:21.000 --> 26:29.000
and I'd also like to, possibly Mr. Chairman, have a man here who started the monitor of the trouble,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
so I have to use to call off the investigation.

26:32.000 --> 26:43.000
And also, that time, I would like to have Mr. Adams available to explain why the staff that has certainly monitored calls of Mr. Adams.

26:43.000 --> 26:52.000
I mean, with Mr. Clark, the day after the Black Wheel threat failed, I think that's very, very important for the committee.

26:52.000 --> 26:59.000
And if we can have that, I wouldn't sure I want to do it, but that's the Chair's convenience.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Let me ask you this Mr. Ralph, how soon can we...

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
In the full of this place of the Chair, we'll know when he must be called.

27:08.000 --> 27:16.000
We went to Mr. Adams, how soon could we get a complete and thorough rundown,

27:16.000 --> 27:25.000
how all the monitored calls and Mr. Clark, and the email from the Pentagon.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
Can anyone else... can we have a gun?

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Yes, I think it's all ready to deliver the signatures.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
You're talking about all the calls, but I'm going to have to be on the floor.

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
So, I think we just, we've been working through the monitoring, come here, swear that we have all the calls.

27:45.000 --> 27:54.000
I should think, the answer is, I'm guessing that I assume, sorry, vacations are all down, something like that, that's absolutely possible.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Just one further question, Mr. Lucas.

27:58.000 --> 28:08.000
There's very close, Mr. Steve, the testifying that there was no monitoring of calls between his office and the White House.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
That I assume does not really mean we're doing humanly questions.

28:12.000 --> 28:21.000
We're certainly not the... more in-profit than the other being, but...

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
In view of the fact that there is evidence now of a meeting on January 21st, I believe,

28:29.000 --> 28:36.000
that which two White House agencies will provide them with justice, department lead, others...

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Well, could you tell us what are not?

28:39.000 --> 28:48.000
You were ordered not to monitor any calls, Mr. Steve, the office, and anyone on the White House stand.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Probably, I have any orders on that.

28:51.000 --> 29:00.000
Now, just how did you do it there? When you were going to call the police, I assume you'd pick up the phone, you would write down on the phone.

29:00.000 --> 29:11.000
If you find it was, we'll say, Sherman Adams, Page Smith, John Dunes, on the White House ramp, would you hang up the phone, didn't say not to monitor at Margaret?

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
I'm not going off on that he has enough to monitor calls.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
Calls rather rare. And those rather rare, sir, I don't set up what about now often.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
We're not supposed to look down on first about two words up until this day.

29:29.000 --> 29:36.000
Now, could you give us some rough idea of not going to be... time per week or per day?

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
We're told not to monitor any calls.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
I'm just told you I have not you and I, the other day, all I know is that I just don't remember.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
There was being called not to monitor calls during that period.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
I met up with him during the time he was in office and I know he came in.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
And he said, in the office, he said not to monitor the phone where you're indicated that.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
I don't know what he said.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I'm not concerned about his family.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
That's not true. I'm not talking about calls to the White House ramp.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
The secondary attempt that those calls were not monitored.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
