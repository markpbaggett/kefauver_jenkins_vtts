00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm sorry.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Charlie needs speaking from your center to his office in the capital of our nation.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Once again, Senator Estes-T-Fauber is here to bring you up today on the activities and trends on chemistry.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
And after we missed you on this report period last week...

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Well, I'm just made of Charlie and we'll have it stuff that's just playing out with taking from past study where our time investigation was in progress.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
The Washington was about three hours late.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
But I'm glad you went ahead with our weekly report.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
I was on the agenda for this week's challenge.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
First of all, Senator, there were several items of local interest in Tennessee coming to the city.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
And I'd like to ask you about some of the effects of the Korean situation as it relates to these people's ten states.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
But before that, I'd like to ask you what Tennessee municipalities were included in the 100 largest American cities.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, methods are largest study ranked 20th in the list of largest American cities.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Outstripping as land is as surprising as many people.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Our state capital, Nashville, is 56 largest cities.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
Our home city of Chalanooga is 73rd and Knoxville is 80 seconds on the rural city.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
So what is the largest city in the South now?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, that's a big question, Charlie.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Technically, Maryland is in the South and Baltimore is nation's sixth largest city.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
But the normal emotion keeps from Texas in the South largest fallout by your means.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, after the special legislation, I believe the Senate passed your so-called mocketing bill, Senator.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Well, it's not particularly my bill.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
All of it was for parts, Charlie.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
But on Wednesday, the Senate passed the bill, which had been previously passed in the House of Representatives,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
to commit the Secretary of Interior to accept the most recent land of parts purposes.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Does the bill and the long struggle do assure that the preservation of the beauty of this area,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
which is a part of the lookout now, in one of them?

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Much to the advantage, you know, occupied an understatement kind of city in America,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
because I'm certainly glad the Senate approved this report.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Why isn't it you, Senator, who wrote this bill loose from the committee?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Well, I couldn't say that I broke it loose, Charlie,

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
but the bill has been lying, dormant, and the Senate interior and insular affairs committees have been presumptious.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
I made a personal deal to Senator Joe O'Money, a biomext, who is chairman of that committee,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
to report the bill favorably.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
And he promised he would do so at the very earliest, needing a document.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
He made good on his word, and the bill was wise, reported favorably,

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
based on the Senate calendar and passed by a million Wednesdays without any officers.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
And I thirst, he both how did the Congress pass the measure,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
committing the barrel in a national cemetery of the right of young men,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
to lost their lives and its tragic actions after their lives?

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes, Congressman Persia increased the national function of the bill in the House,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
originally, and I was a poor manager in the Senate.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
We felt that our Tennessee National Guardsman, who died for the security of that country,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
just as much as the civil war had on the start of the federal waste of the region,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
we found the direction not even that, but that people with military energy,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
and the American National Secretary of State,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
who had the President's speech of the Secretary of War, agreed with us.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And both houses of Congress concurred in this bill.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
So now, I have heard in here a word of the Tennessee National Guard

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
who had burials and a national cemetery at the time of a resting place.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, that was certainly a horrible tragedy to follow in our boy, was it?

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
Yes, Charlie, a demonstration of the other waste that used to be the Minister of War.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
I hope this incident is striking still near to all of our homes,

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
and it's hard to re-double our efforts to find the risk of war over the world.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
In that connection of the Senator, there is new education and official circles

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
to view the international unrest, while the institution of a program of universal military training.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
What are your views about that?

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Charlie, I've always been for universal military training,

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
and I'm afraid the instability of the world situation is going to keep us on noodles and cans

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
for many years to come, even if we escape actual shooting as is nine progress in the core of the international.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
If that is true, we can leak an ill report to take a chance on it,

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
then we must tell our young men trained at least in the elementals as they reach the age of military service.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
The thing this caused me concern is the fact that universal military training

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
would interrupt the education of all of our young men.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
With this in mind, I've been thinking in terms of suggesting a program of military instruction

04:37.000 --> 04:45.000
in our high school, the program to extend for the last three years of students,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
of our students high school students.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Because I go to camp the last two summers of this high school,

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
and you and I, by the way, get the necessary training without any interruptions of this education.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
This plan is in the consideration stage,

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
but I intend to close the subject and submit it on services committee in the near future,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
and I remember that somebody who knows.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Certainly, it sounds like a good idea to meet the senator.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
The military training of our youth is in effect.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Then it would seem amazing to your plans to prevent it interrupting a young man's education.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, at least we will suggest it in the right place as a child.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Of course, I don't wish the death and to commit myself on the subject

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
until the observations of all of the experts have been taken into consideration.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Well, now to the Tennessee situation against the senator.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Our office has been deceased with requests for information as to the reopening of ordinance plans,

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
airports, former arms services camps, and so on, by our friends who can see.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
Now, what installation of a military nature do you think may be included in the new mobilization plan?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, so far as I know a child, our military is thinking in terms of three ordinance plans,

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
reopening at this time, although no definition of decision at this time has been made.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
But of course, they are looking over all of the standby plans that they have in the United States

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
to see which ones can best be put into operation if they need comes around.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
The plans in Tennessee are the volunteer ordinance plans in Chattanooga,

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
the malign ordinance plans in Gibson County, and the host ordinance plans near King's Fort in Sullivan County.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
There may be others, and the ones I have designated may not be opened at all,

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
but that is the best information that I have at this present time as to the thinking of the military people in this matter.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, there has been a great deal of Andrew Stolock's role in the location of the so-called H-bombs relations

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
on the part of our Kennedy's friends. What's the word on that school?

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Well, I've been in touch with Mr. Gordon Dean, the new chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission about this.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
I understand that the commission does have in mind, dealing with plans that can be used,

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
either to make bomb or to tie the principle to teach time to suit.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Mr. Dean has advised us that the commission does not yet know itself

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
what the essential requirements as to the location will be.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
So, of course, we do not know whether any penalty location or any location in our section

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
that we can offer will be needed. The first and primary consideration will be the placing of this plan

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
for it will not be vulnerable to any mere tax.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
You need only to look at the mass of the sea as kind of sea as about as far removed from the Soviet Union

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
as any other place in the United States.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Of course, we have the AEC plan that Oak Ridge and the TBA defense relations

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
as well as other plans and projects vital to the war at.

07:37.000 --> 07:45.000
And such as the aluminum plan in Al-Qawe in Blunt County, the military made a sigh that it will not want to put all of its important eggs

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
in one basket and immediately eliminate the TBA region as a possibility.

07:49.000 --> 07:57.000
Now, what's your chambers of commerce and other industries do you do in the interstimulatory and agency location?

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
Well, until the criteria are established by the atomic energy commission, there is little attendees on.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
However, we do know that some 200,000 square acres will be required.

08:09.000 --> 08:18.000
And any low-cap locality with that area available together all of the essential data and poverty either to us or to the atomic energy commission.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
Frankly, Charlie, at this stage of the game, I doubt that we tend to see and have much to get under the excited about.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
This election will be made on a security and resources base.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
If we can provide what is needed, we have a chance for the plan.

08:32.000 --> 08:41.000
The United will go to the place where the jobs can be done best and all of us have to be handled exactly in that way.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
That's certain that the thing to do is to do the job in the right way.

08:45.000 --> 08:56.000
Now, another item of interest with John mentioned in your absence last week was the endorsement of the developments by the TBA of the coming of the river basin on the part of the secretary of the interior.

08:56.000 --> 09:04.000
Why is that important? Well, the department of the interior is the governmental agent who has to do with all public power development.

09:04.000 --> 09:14.000
Therefore, this endorsement is very encouraging. The secretary of the interior, Mr. Chastlin, said that the project authorized or constructed on the Cumberland,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
should be turned over to the TBA for completion and operation.

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
Are these eight projects, they all hollowed, already in operation, centered yield and willed, free, or under construction?

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
And the project was free island, durup, ferry, old, history, cottage, and the land. And now, yet, been started.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
This is the secretary of Chapman advised that this plan for projects from the core of engineers to the TBA,

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
for eliminating unnecessary expense and ensure continuity of operation of the project and the sale of low-cost power to ultimate consumers.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
Well, how is the power distribution handled from the core of engineers' land on the company?

09:53.000 --> 10:01.000
Well, all of the work done by the Army engineers, the interior department, the federal power commission,

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
and the TBA is useless and merely a bookkeeping transaction by which the engineers' dams generate power,

10:09.000 --> 10:18.000
which is turned over to the interior department, which delivers the power to the TBA for distribution and rates the food by the federal power commission.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
All this time stirring expense in the avoided of the power is handled exclusively by the TBA.

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
But controlled and navigation on the entire humble and talented assistant can be handled more effectively by one agency,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
which will relieve the burden on the movement, except the immoral.

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
Unfortunately, quite a few of you have gone on, I may be a prediction that some people reported the TBA, which is coming September 15th,

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
on the basis of survey, which is ordered by the President.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
If I report the state world as I saw it, I can predict that some action might be taken early in the 80s,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
like the Congress.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
Now, one, do you think that there will be any action in this Congress on this matter,

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
that you call the priest bill, who is the cobbling in the TBA system?

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
And two, do you think it's not going to be acted on early in the next session?

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
Achalia, the first part of your question about whether there will be any action in this session.

11:17.000 --> 11:27.000
I do not think so because the policy committee, all of the Senate and the House of Representatives have already decided that only a very few items

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
are having to do with foreign policy will be considered in the remaining weeks.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
We hope it will be remaining weeks for this session of conflict.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
We're out of luck to this session.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, yes, and then, furthermore, the TBA final report has not been received,

11:41.000 --> 11:50.000
and we can't get all of the facts before Congress about the inclusion of the cumulon into the TBA system

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
until the final report of the TBA and of the core of engineers has been received.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
But I do think that all of this, well, all of these reports will be coming in as follows,

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
and we should have all of our facts together in the end of the position we got early action in the next session of conflict.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
Well, now, in his recommendation and report, if the Secretary of the Interior recommended any changes in your bill,

12:15.000 --> 12:24.000
for the Festival Change suggested why the retention of the membership of the TBA board at three instead of five is my bill's revised.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
The other suggested changes are manner and effect, and as a matter of fact,

12:29.000 --> 12:36.000
I have no particular notion or interest as to how the board these three are fast.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
The Secretary will agree in situation, colliding with the data of work in the Johnson Bill.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
Well, Senator Matlow and the Arkansas, the President of the National Rivers and Harvard Congress,

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
at least to me that we should defer all non-war connected public works projects.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
The same favor of feeding up the work on a sexual project such as the TBA's team flat as new jobs keep up.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
We have an interesting, increasing need of power for electric power for the war efforts,

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
and if the H bomb plant does locate in the TBA region, we shall need a great deal of power from that one project,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
not to mention the others in our section.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Senator, I see that our time is gone, so until next week at this period,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm on force thing development, not to mention it.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Senator, keep all the return with this next report.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
We now be viewed as by your Senators Office in Washington.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
We invite you to be tuned to this station next week for that report.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
This program is brought to you as a public service at the expense of the station to which you are now listening.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
Until next week, same time, same station, which is job in need from your Senators Office in Washington,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
we're trying to use it to your local announcer.
