WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm going to take you to the police.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm going to take you to the police.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
May I please come, do I?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I'd like to say, Mr. Secretary, that all is not going to be

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
exactly according to plan.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
He is happy that you have had virtually one full day removed

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
from the test.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Any questions, the suggestions?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
No questions, Mr. Chairman.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Chair has none.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Mr. Holland, and you have a benefit to my right?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
No, please.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
And you have a benefit to my left?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
No, but Mr. Wilk?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
No, but Mr. President, I'm Mr. President.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
I'll take you to the police.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I'll take you to the police.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Mr. President, have you or some of your subordinates located

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
a copy of a memorandum from John Edgar Hoover

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
who, your intelligence department,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
dated January 26, 1951, the original copy, sir.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
That's right, we'll have.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
And has that been brought here into this room?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I don't know whether that's here or not, I think, here.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
And any event that is available for samples

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
isn't one we secure the permission of the Attorney General

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
to have both plots or do not feel as secure as they may

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
talk about the threat.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
And Mr. James, I don't know if I'm going as properly,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
but we would like the full flow of the production

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
of the other FCI warnings.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
I don't know whether they are letters or memorandum.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
The other FCI warnings on the Fourth Line of Situation,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
including Army between 1950 and 1956.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Very nice, right?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Of course, yes, sir.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I understand that.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
In other words, to be held about,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
so many we will get the permission of the Attorney General,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
to tell the full story of the full sector and the rest.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Will you ask the Secretary to produce the specific documents

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
you have in mind?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
So the pilot will have those.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
This is the mystery of the Attorney General.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Mr. Secretary, I will formally ask the deputy for those.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Mr. Chairman, tonight you get to discuss each of this

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
and we have a memorandum.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
We'll take a time to do this.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I'll talk to you later, sir.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I'll give you a memorandum.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Thank you.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
At the end of the day, listen to the 11 FCI reports.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
So I'm at the station.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
First and last.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
First and last.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
First and last.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Sorry.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Good afternoon.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Mr. Secretary, I need your strike for this FCI memorandum.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
What else would you like to ask?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
A genuine, 20-feet of that.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
How many others FCI reports on Port Monmouth did you find?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, the only one that I actually looked over is the one

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
in which you referred.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
January 26, 1951.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I know there are other parts.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Now, Mr. Secretary, important to ask to know,

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
how many times the FCI has been over a report?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
FCI has been over a report, meaning FCI has been over a Russian

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
concerning Port Monmouth.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And whether or not action was taken on those reports

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
before our committee started their hearing.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
But that's reason, if you haven't done it now,

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
or please use the night, or tomorrow, a time someone.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
They go through the finals and not give us

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
the content of the report, you know.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
But give us a day through the report.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And if Council and the Chairman decide today,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
they want them making available.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Do you do that?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Well, if somebody gets that up,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
you might introduce you to no Senator McArthur,

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
but on April 10, 1953, the Army has the FCI

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
to undertake a full-scale investigation of Port Monmouth.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I request you have to bring that back out.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
But in view of the insinuations that have been

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
with respect to Port Monmouth,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I now advise you that that's the fact.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, now, six weeks later,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
the question is not whether or not the FCI has been read.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
We know that it has been investigating,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
not planning in April of 1953.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
But along before that, Mr. Secretary,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I'm not going to let the Army head under my jurisdiction.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
All right, Mr. Secretary,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
we know that under your federal legislature,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
they were requested to do a white client,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
since the report, the summary of the report

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
is January 26.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So you don't see youré“¶irt.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
By the very thing, we have to be happy

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
to get a report.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
The question is probably,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I think you agree the FCI has the final conduct

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
to file a file either way,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Mr. Steven, about where we went.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
On that, we will have to agree.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Let me ask you then,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
if you have before you,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
the report of January 26, 1951,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
if that's in the file's over a cent,

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
the report entitled S.V.N.I.S. Russian,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
will you tell us why some action wasn't taken

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
against the various individual names

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
until our committee started its investigation?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Why did you hold up action when you had this report

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
which was, we did not hold up action.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
We were working on it all the time,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
and we actually FCI,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
and I put forth scale investigation on the test day of April,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
1953, before we knew anything about you going

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
in the Port Montenegro.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, you're working as rampantly on this,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Mr. Secretary, if you are working on the press tape now.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
We're working rapidly on the Port Montenegro.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Right now, when you answer this question,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
you had a complete detailed report in January 26, 1951.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
That was available to you.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
That's the forthcoming,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
and you're working on the communist connection.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
A large number of individuals working in the secret radar laboratory.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Can you tell me, and I am friendly to you,

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
I think it's been made clear that I know that you can't do all of these words,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
you must rely upon the board,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
but can you tell me why some of your subordinates

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
were such a secretary?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Did not take action to have these individuals

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
to stand at least.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Madam McCarthy, I have touched the fire repeatedly,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
with respect to the situation at Port Montenegro.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
And to 35 pages.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I can go lower that again if you want me to do so.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Now, just one person, I'll hand this over to Mr. Cohn.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
You say if you have to fire repeatedly.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
You saw a fort indigenous in your file,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
showing that a man holding an important job at Port Montenegro

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
was a part of the Solbal Rosenberg,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
rather indicative of the solbal Rosenberg firing.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I will not forget that now.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Mr. Cohn.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Welk, your counsel,

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
who you've bested speak to you,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
shows considerable disturbance this morning,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
over the fact that the senator had in his possession,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
a document indicating that the army had been ruined some time ago

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
about turning his infiltrations at Port Montenegro.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Mr. Welk made indications of early gality

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
and thought of a highly improper.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I wonder if you can explain to this committee,

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
your consistent violation of Section 605 of Title 47

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
of the United States' toll,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
and having impeached author on your telephone without notice

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
the other party to the time to say,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
objection, misdeeds, misdeeds.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Now, likewise, Mr. Cohn.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
This is the same.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, if you have any suggestions for the objections of someone

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
or if it's a time spent by, if I say the question correctly,

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I'd like to say this properly.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I think it's a very relevant issue here.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
You have a second key question of law in the first place,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
and not a question of fact.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
The second day is not a lawyer.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
So, what's that?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Secondly, do you hear your question?

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Please suppose is the existence of a fact

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
that has not been established on those two grounds

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
and perhaps others, the question is objectionable.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I'll try to apply by that as there are objections here

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
but I can get this in proper form.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
My first question in response to Mr. Jenkins' comment

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
says, is it a fact that without modifying the other party

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
for the telephone conversations,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
you have somebody on the other extension

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
in your office to listen to.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
For lots of persons following you, it's same.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
I've talked in sentence.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Mr. Secretary, I say you're not saying straight on the third ground

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
that it is repetitious you have here to open the question

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
about that.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Mr. Jenkins, are you just saying that I had not...

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
There is nothing in the records at all

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
but this practice was engaged in.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
That's why I am the subject of today.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I have a question.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I have a question.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
The comment will be stated.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
The first question is about the questions of law.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
The question has already been asked.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Whether or not he has a man listening on the extension.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
The man has been identified as Mr. Lucas.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
The man has classified.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
The question has been answered in the affirmative.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
The chair is wrong.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
The Secretary tells the chair he's wrong.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And you may be answered the question of the way that the repetition is.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Mr. Chairman, may I raise the question?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I think Mr. Jenkins will be right when he says

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
that the question even of itself and repushes, however,

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
in order for us to determine whether or not we have all

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
of the monitored conversations.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
I have asked the council to go and go to this question

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
to press in the Secretary as to whether or not

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
all conversations are monitored.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Now, laying a basis for that and assuming

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
you might have forgotten the question the other day,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I assume Mr. Cohen asked the question which was repushes.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
But I would like to ask Mr. Cohen to proceed

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
to press in Mr. Stevens as to whether or not

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
all of the conversations to him and Trump have been monitored.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
I think that's important in determining whether or not

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
to have missed the monitored conversation, but I would like to say

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
to be attentive that you're up with all conversations

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
and he'll be right to bring that out because we are attempting

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
to get all of the conversations we want to know

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
we have with some big fights.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
And I think it's a big question.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Mr. Cohen, you're going to be right.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
This is a fight.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
But for all conversations, to you and to you are monitored.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I will geben you a monitor if that is not

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
applying the body on the other line to participate.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I have a solution to this.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I have to testify on that.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Explain the details.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
They both were saying here exactly how it works.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It's all in the record that's great length.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
On my first day of testimony, I'll tell you a follow.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
With the secretary, you can see.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
The front of the point staff, we still don't have the answer.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Is it maybe how we state the question?

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Is it a factor that every conversation

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
calls on conversation, which is participating?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Call to you and call from you, our monitor.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
So, out the consent of the body on the other end.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Mr. Chairman, on that, the board's first act

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
were testified to by Mr. Luther, who will recall

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
the New York District Conversation.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
He did not want to.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
If the question do not testify to the Secretary,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
then we share a little bit of the Secretary's name

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
should be entitled to that.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
What's your answer, Mr. President?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Exactly the same as Mr. Luther, testify.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
What do you answer, sir?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
My answer is just the same as he is.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
There are certain calls that are not monitored.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
That's how you select one of the number one.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Well, it's a pretty good family.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Call?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Constantly?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Yes, any other call?

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
I'd say that's practically all of us.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
As far as I know, Senator, a monitor except family call.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
A practitioner of these, that was the same testimony he heard

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
before stated that it should be testified to the next one.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
There's all those monitors.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
You check family, all the church and the rest of the laws.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
The rest of the measures are practically all.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I'm going to know whether or not there are any kinds.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
When you make a phone call, there is not monitored.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Other than 12 years family, and my children,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
there may have been calls from friends occasionally,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
but not monitored.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Well, Mr. Secretary, we generally answer your question

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
as an outside of family and immediate friends.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
They are.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Mr. Secretary, if you know the first of this question,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
we're going to have the question of whether or not monitored calls

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
should be just never.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
And we want to use the simple information of whether or not

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
all calls having anything to do with the work of this committee

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
or calling off the work of this committee.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Any calls with our staff, with their White House,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
with anyone else, regard to this situation.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Those are monitored and are available.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Certainly not the White House.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
In other words, you would normally request any calls

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
affecting the business of this committee would have been monitored.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
I'd like to explain to you that the only ones that were not

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
much of a look at such spots with us, too,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
will respect the calls from members of my family,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
and I would say it may be a few personal plans

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
to call me sometimes.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
But you're not in relation to committee business.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Are you pleased that you're in a position to say it?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
That's right.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Mr. Dickens, please.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Mr. Larry.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
There's only one question with the old chairman,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
mainly the termination of this question of monitored calls.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Is not the chair correct in his belief that these are you,

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
or Mr. Lucas, or both, have testified that all of the calls

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
coming to your office or leaving your office except those

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
involving your family, or friends, or social engagements,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
are monitored by Mr. Lucas.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
That's right.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Tell him it comes.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
That does not include the White House.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
It does not include the White House.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That has been the practice with your predecessors

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
to testify to by Mr. Lucas.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
That's it.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I have told the board of Mr. Chairman,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I think somebody is being impressionary

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
that it is on law for the monitor at telephone calls.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
That is not true.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
In a man's hand, have a telephone call monitor

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
if he wants to.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
But question arises into the legality of this clothing,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
and not that he has somebody to take note

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
so that he might refresh his memory.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Please may I, for the first time available?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Have you applied a varkage yet?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
For the amount of the customers, the amount as well?

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah, I call his attention to section 47, section 605,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
which makes it illegal to monitor calls.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Judge Hanz has interpreted those two,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
and me and both the mechanical monitoring

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and monitoring by a stenographer,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
and if the stenographer wants to be the decision

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
we can get it for him,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
may I quickly read this?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
First paragraph, a no-person nothing authorized

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
for the sender,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
so under self-identification,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
and evokes or publish the existence content,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
public support,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
or the fact that you're meaning of self-interference,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
in a self-identification, no any question.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And the balance of the demo is the same way,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and if the chair carries heavy visit,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
so this would seem to make it illegal

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
to either drop the wheel or you want to.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
I take this position as I have a telephone call monitor

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
and then at the time I want to,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and my office now not by late to law,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
and I'm going to go it again.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
But I don't see all these businessmen

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
and these officials can possibly operate without doing so.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Mr. Chair, the second presenter,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
from Wisconsin and the senator from Arkansas,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
is assessing a question of law.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
I've needed to amount by the chairs I have here for them,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
that the mere monitoring of a telephone call

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
is not in itself illegal.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
It is the divergence of the contents,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
the context of that call,

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
without the consent of the parties of both members of the line,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
that make it illegal.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Do you understand the only 20-40 raised,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
which I rather have to tell you,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
but 20-40 is dependent on the current grades,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and it does not feel call upon the rule,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
and this point of order has to finish your question,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
since it's about 10 minutes.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Any questions, the senders, am I right?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Any questions, the senders, am I left?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Go ahead.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Party night under service.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I'll send the chairman,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
but we're going around again.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
We're going to reach that.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
We're going around until 4.30.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I'm going to 30 now.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
25 minutes to five.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
The chair is advised.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
But the president of the committee,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
do you want to reach that to the present?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
I would only ask in the chair.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Thank you, sir, we'll reach that,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
then we'll come ready.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Come on, one.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
I'm so, this day of the Senate's subcommittee hearings,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
it's been consumed for the major part

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
by a controversy which develops

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
over the authenticity of the letter introduced yesterday

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
by Senator McConnie.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
For the first time during the hearings,

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Senator McConnie occupied the witness chair,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
briefly, in an attempt by the subcommittee

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
to certify the origin of the letter

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
of the president of the committee,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
and the president of the committee,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
and the president of the committee,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
and the attempt by the subcommittee to certify

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
the origin of the lettering question.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Secretary of the Army, Steven,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
resumed his position as a witness,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
making this the 10th day

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
where the secretary has appeared for testimony.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Now, at 10.30, tomorrow morning,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Eastern Day Lifetime,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
the Duma Television Network,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Department of News and Public Affairs,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
to resume its coverage

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
of the Senate's permanent investigation subcommittee hearings

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
from Washington, D.C.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Thank you.
