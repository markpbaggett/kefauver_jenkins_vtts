WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
I've been to 249 St. Office buildings, the following materials.

00:05.120 --> 00:11.240
And that is produced all memorandum, data or documents, dictated or prepared by G. David

00:11.240 --> 00:12.560
Chine.

00:12.560 --> 00:17.580
And all memorandum or data prepared by other persons from information furnished by said

00:17.580 --> 00:18.580
Chine.

00:18.580 --> 00:25.520
But I've contained in fire of the CEP subcommittee except memorandum, disposing names of information.

00:25.520 --> 00:30.580
We now have brought the half of David directly in the harmony with the instructions that

00:30.580 --> 00:34.560
the care received and the understanding that he believes the committee members had in

00:34.560 --> 00:36.320
mind when they asked for the speech.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.320
Under Jackson.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.320
Mr. Chairman, I merely want to make this brief.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.320
I'm going.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.320
Mr. Chairman.

00:41.320 --> 00:48.320
I don't know that I'm authorized to serve it on you.

00:48.320 --> 00:49.320
Mr. Chairman.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.320
Mr. Chairman.

00:50.320 --> 00:56.320
I regret that all this time has been taken up on a matter that does not relate to the matter

00:56.320 --> 01:00.320
immediately before us.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.320
However, when certain statements are made of necessity, one cannot stand idle by, let

01:05.320 --> 01:07.320
it be construed as acquiescent.

01:07.320 --> 01:12.320
Now, first of all, I have not said that the chairman has violated the law.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.320
I don't know.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.320
That's not my job.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.320
That's the responsibility of the committee members.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.320
I want to say this.

01:18.320 --> 01:24.320
That the attorney general of the United States and the head of the federal bureau of investigation

01:24.320 --> 01:35.320
Mr. Jay at your Hoover and said that it is a violation of the law for the employee of the

01:35.320 --> 01:41.320
government and trusted with classified and secret information to give us the one not entitled

01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
to the main.

01:42.320 --> 01:49.320
Now, that's a clear cut statement by the attorney general and the head of the federal bureau

01:49.320 --> 01:54.800
of investigation and I'm not going to be a party to any proposition which would encourage

01:54.800 --> 02:02.320
employees in the federal government to turn over classified documents to people not entitled

02:02.320 --> 02:05.240
to receive the same under the law of the land.

02:05.240 --> 02:11.320
I do not believe that you can have any kind of security system in the United States.

02:11.320 --> 02:18.320
We are going to place a subjective cap on whether an individual can determine whether

02:18.320 --> 02:22.320
a citizen's document can be turned over to one not entitled to.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.320
I think that is clear as anything can be and I do not have to position taken by the

02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
president.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.320
If the entirely different matters for an employee of the government or for any citizen to

02:33.320 --> 02:38.320
give information which is not illegal to give which will help that out any of these things

02:38.320 --> 02:45.320
that are not allowed to be taken by the government.

02:45.320 --> 02:52.320
I hope that you have been talking about there too entirely different matters and I hope

02:52.320 --> 02:56.320
that you can get back on the subject matter.

02:56.320 --> 03:03.320
I hope that you can get back on the subject matter and if I can read me and I hope that you can get back on the subject matter.

03:03.320 --> 03:09.320
I will try to answer some of the statements you made in the federal on feelings and directly give my opinion.

03:09.320 --> 03:14.320
First I do not agree that I said anything about dealing with the chairman and the general.

03:14.320 --> 03:21.320
I will say that the sincerity and respect of the son of Wisconsin states that my position is

03:21.320 --> 03:27.320
such and my position is such does not necessarily make it a fact.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.320
Secondly I will call that from now on.

03:30.320 --> 03:38.320
We never again say based on the issues that we are discussing at this time that all we were talking about

03:38.320 --> 03:41.320
of a shining and private shine shoes.

03:41.320 --> 03:51.320
Third I would like to say that the things in the leading lawyer in the government

03:51.320 --> 03:54.320
is opinion even though I am of a different party.

03:54.320 --> 03:59.320
There is something which all Americans much consider as much as they consider relationships.

03:59.320 --> 04:05.320
For the best of my recollection he was appointed by President Eisenhower and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.

04:05.320 --> 04:09.320
I may be wrong in the latter but I don't remember any major difference.

04:09.320 --> 04:15.320
And last I think on even as later today they press conference with the president.

04:15.320 --> 04:23.320
It is now clear that he and the unionists and other former presidents are not in agreement.

04:24.320 --> 04:32.320
The next point that the chairman that I would like to raise is that one of the reasons we left this committee,

04:32.320 --> 04:39.320
we demotat, was because it was a committee which we felt had one main rule.

04:39.320 --> 04:47.320
We came back on a committee for the understanding that a majority of the members of the committee could make a decision.

04:48.320 --> 04:56.320
Therefore I was both surprised and disappointed to hear the chairman say that on his own,

04:56.320 --> 05:05.320
without any committee vote, he had decided and I might add that therefore without any authority,

05:05.320 --> 05:14.320
he had decided to withhold a relatively simple request that was made by our distinguished counsel with respect to these files.

05:15.320 --> 05:22.320
Now I would suggest to the chairman of this committee, Senator Munch,

05:23.320 --> 05:35.320
that we both do have one for public and missing and we have one, demotat, and it seems to me that he is a very foreign,

05:35.320 --> 05:40.320
do we follow the cons that the president of the United States?

05:41.320 --> 05:44.320
The attorney general of the United States?

05:44.320 --> 05:47.320
I would like to work short or should not be done in this matter.

05:47.320 --> 05:53.320
All do we follow the opinion of the junior senator from Wisconsin.

05:53.320 --> 06:02.320
And therefore Mr. President, Mr. Chairman, I recommend and I would like to, I would like to,

06:02.320 --> 06:09.320
I would like to, attention of the chair. I would appreciate the attention of the chair.

06:09.320 --> 06:15.320
I'm calling the committee to make a decision. I'm going to have to put in a microport.

06:15.320 --> 06:24.320
I can't imagine a more fortunate rent. I can think of many, many happier positions to be in our position.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.320
May I get back to my motion, Mr. Chairman?

06:29.320 --> 06:32.320
I would like to propose now the fifth committee vote.

06:32.320 --> 06:41.320
As the weather or not, the council of this committee, Mr. Jenkins, Susanna, approved by the chairman,

06:41.320 --> 06:51.320
or not be honored, we can decide then how our Republican colleagues feel and how our Democratic colleagues feel.

06:52.320 --> 07:02.320
And in that way we can decide whether we're going to get the files we're instructors to check to make sure the fence of our candidates go through one month at one time.

07:02.320 --> 07:07.320
And in that way we can decide whether we're going to get the files we're distracting Mr. Shine or whether we are not.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.320
Mr. Dr. Durham. Mr. Gerham. Mr. ned woas just accepted.

07:09.320 --> 07:14.320
Mr. Dr. Durham that's good. It's theukaん I. Have a feel for the O 금 hierarchists over there.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.320
Mr. Schneider. You said it's better to defend your Democratic office and one one on those kinds of things.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.320
� No. No. Number one I just wonder if the State of America is something I definitely won't be aware of.

07:18.320 --> 07:27.320
I think the owner of this only calls for material produced by Dave Shine.

07:27.320 --> 07:33.320
The original propiner called all the files. And this propiner is very wise.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.320
And I want to compliment the chairman for his good judgment.

07:36.320 --> 07:42.320
Provides last so we're not going to produce anything which would dispose the names of any informants.

07:43.320 --> 07:46.320
Mr. Aaron I talked about that during the new art.

07:46.320 --> 07:51.320
Well you're great that this will be available.

07:51.320 --> 07:58.320
Now I'm going to come here from the jury and make that most and I'm sure he's not making it with the idea that he can...

07:58.320 --> 08:10.320
I'm curious to anyone. I'm sure that he was busy talking to someone or something who may be very clear that there's no question about this production of material.

08:10.320 --> 08:14.320
But we are talking about now as the production of other material mass way.

08:14.320 --> 08:19.320
The answer to Senator Jackson says that the deadger Hoover,

08:19.320 --> 08:24.320
who will find how often deadger Hoover is used as a shield to tell his friends.

08:24.320 --> 08:31.320
The deadger Hoover says that it will be a violation of the law to give information on unauthorized people.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.320
Suppose that's fit.

08:33.320 --> 08:37.320
Senator Jackson knows that the chairman of the committee,

08:38.320 --> 08:42.320
when he set up another reorganization act,

08:42.320 --> 08:46.320
to get all into my system executive,

08:46.320 --> 08:49.320
does not deny a person.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.320
But I don't think that...

08:50.320 --> 08:52.320
Well, I'll let you know when we just finish by May.

08:52.320 --> 08:57.320
I don't think we should ban the vote between the following the other day.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.320
He talked about him just a minute.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.320
Can we bring out of information?

09:01.320 --> 09:02.320
We're not talking about that.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.320
We're talking about...

09:04.320 --> 09:06.320
Chairman, for years.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.320
Giving the chairman of the committee.

09:08.320 --> 09:13.320
Which has been set up to investigate the executive.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.320
The member of the reorganization act.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.320
That chairman getting information.

09:17.320 --> 09:21.320
And I certainly hope to reject that.

09:21.320 --> 09:26.320
But at some point, I've gone under television light for some time.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.320
My demographic friends will agree with me.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.320
But we do have the job.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.320
We do have the job of exposing graph,

09:33.320 --> 09:35.320
forcing feminism.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.320
I hope my demographic friends will finally,

09:37.320 --> 09:39.320
at long last, agree with me.

09:39.320 --> 09:42.320
But we should not try to come.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.320
The loyal old federal employees.

09:45.320 --> 09:51.320
They say I will not protect any cookin' that any dishonest in government.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.320
Nearly because one of us is on the right track for a secret stamp.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.320
I'm a document.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.320
If we can do that, I think we can perform a great service.

10:00.320 --> 10:04.320
The thing that the chairman of each land has taken to his family list.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.320
Is because I do want to make it very, very clear.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.320
To all of the federal employees.

10:10.320 --> 10:16.320
As I said before, that there is no power on earth.

10:16.320 --> 10:23.320
Which will force me to disclose the names of individuals

10:23.320 --> 10:26.320
who are expecting no.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.320
The old federal officials.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.320
The United States, you can go on enemies,

10:31.320 --> 10:32.320
foreign them, and make it.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.320
And giving the head of a committee information.

10:35.320 --> 10:40.320
And I, I, where I strongly urge my demographic friends.

10:40.320 --> 10:45.320
And I, I think clearly I know that they don't love coming with any more than I do.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.320
You won't go on the limit.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.320
But they think it's not over over the weekend.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.320
And since they can't sort of join forces here.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.320
And have a committee that can get the information in need.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.320
And maybe we can also persuade.

11:00.320 --> 11:04.320
Maybe we can also persuade the Attorney General, I hope so.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.320
I think he's an honest man.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.320
The swearing him that he does have the duty to enforce the law.

11:10.320 --> 11:17.320
But we have the duty to expose any failure to enforce the law.

11:17.320 --> 11:22.320
And I would like to disclose his attention to the situation back in 1924.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.320
And so does somebody who is, remember that?

11:25.320 --> 11:30.320
And we have the Attorney General involved in a dishonest situation.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.320
We advise the President of that time.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.320
We have the care of attention.

11:35.320 --> 11:39.320
We advise the President of that time.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.320
The Attorney General who's involved in this crooked deal.

11:42.320 --> 11:48.320
We advise the President to issue a secrecy rule.

11:48.320 --> 11:52.320
Which is almost identical to the one that was issued last.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.320
This is something that needs to make.

11:54.320 --> 12:02.320
Fortunately, we had a Republican President to trick that.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.320
No, let's just be taken as any reflection on the President's heart.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.320
I have regular respect for him.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.320
He's a truly busy, I think, for getting that advice.

12:12.320 --> 12:17.320
We had a man then who, instead of appalling the President of the Attorney General,

12:17.320 --> 12:22.320
said, Mr. Attorney General, you are out to take your advice.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.320
You didn't enough at all, Cabinet members, really touch the firing.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.320
People went to jail.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.320
If we had the same rule in 1924, do we have now?

12:30.320 --> 12:32.320
You have had a complaint to cover up.

12:32.320 --> 12:36.320
And again, make a firm up for just the Attorney General, Brown L.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.320
Resign, you know anything like that?

12:39.320 --> 12:44.320
I am in crime to think that that's happening.

12:45.320 --> 12:50.320
On the 21st, I picked up a second motion from the machinery to try to swear at us young men.

12:50.320 --> 12:55.320
Over here, it was done with, I think, more than any man I know.

12:55.320 --> 12:59.320
To come back, to come and to confess it.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.320
When I was at the motion with Mary, I guess now.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.320
I have good reason to believe.

13:04.320 --> 13:08.320
But Brown L. was not a part of that interest.

13:08.320 --> 13:13.320
And I just hope that maybe at some time, we can get to the other ones and find out who am I meeting.

13:14.320 --> 13:19.320
A poll, what is, and moves up emotionally, plans, mayor.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.320
One of them is a part of that.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.320
I think you recognize them as the power next.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.320
Well, it's like, you know what it is.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.320
We're doing that now.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.320
I have a favor from the power next.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.320
We're going out now.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.320
Something over 30 minutes and a minute.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.320
We have no issue before.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.320
Let's get to the point.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.320
I'll send it to you.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.320
Let's get it.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.320
I want to get the issue before it's done.

13:40.320 --> 13:46.320
The chair has been served and accepted to produce the material that we all desire.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.320
The chair has made it clear that in the issuance of the earlier subpoenae, we see a sense of thought.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.320
Thearian sent to reserve.

13:54.320 --> 13:59.320
The language is talking, but he conveyed the intent over the phone, not to the satisfaction of the Sunday was content.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.320
The intent of the two of them, I don't know if we are going to get to material.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.320
Now, I'll send it to you.

14:04.320 --> 14:09.320
Let's tell them, say the wargack of myself, from the lowly down the center base.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.320
I would just like to comment.

14:11.320 --> 14:17.320
We've seen a lot of clear and unusual things in this area during the past 20th of the day.

14:17.320 --> 14:24.320
I think that the Babas with all of this history is the first time a committee of Congress has ever seen themselves again as the old workers.

14:24.320 --> 14:29.320
In a gun, this thing has done the job of our people.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.320
How did you get it?

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
You've been in the fire?

14:32.320 --> 14:34.320
How did you get it?

14:34.320 --> 14:37.320
It was all useless without any service of the thing.

14:37.320 --> 14:42.320
I found it the committee this morning, the material we put in was the produced and it will be produced.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.320
And I must say...

14:43.320 --> 14:44.320
The commission is right.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.320
Well, I think we have a card.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.320
Let me just...

14:47.320 --> 14:48.320
Let me just run it around.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.320
I think the state is just a legend.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.320
No, let me just make it.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
Let me just make it.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.320
I just wanted to share again, I think we should make this a good deal.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.320
Let me make two brief points.

14:56.320 --> 15:03.320
I didn't raise at all from this question that Senator McCarthy brought in to the discussion today.

15:03.320 --> 15:18.320
But I'd merely want to say again that I'm not going to be a party to a proposition where a clerk, whether it be in the FBI can give classified information to anyone in contra-hated instructions of the head of the agency.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.320
Mr. Hoover says no one to give this out.

15:20.320 --> 15:26.320
Do you mean to say that a clerk is a no-go-for or an employee and that agency can give up classified information?

15:26.320 --> 15:31.320
Now, obviously, if we're going to have that kind of a security system, the FBI would be a shambles.

15:31.320 --> 15:35.320
The whole federal government would be a shambles the Islamic Energy Commission when they would offer it.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.320
Come in to Chairman.

15:37.320 --> 15:41.320
I don't think there is any need for a subpoena in a case.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.320
I'll let it lose that it's committee.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.320
Every member is entitled to all information in the file.

15:46.320 --> 15:50.320
The Chairman, I mean the chairman of the full committee.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.320
The number card that you've stated time and time again is a theory.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.320
So we started over all our acts up to these files.

15:57.320 --> 16:01.320
Now, the federal government card, these cannot change the rules of the committee.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.320
I don't think.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.320
Not at least with my hand.

16:04.320 --> 16:10.320
By a penance money here, but we're not going to allow the Democratic members of the committee to have this information.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.320
What kind of government doing that?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.320
It was a solve deal from one to the one to the one to the one to the one.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.320
No, this committee's system is free state.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.320
No, we've all been feeding anything.

16:19.320 --> 16:24.320
With reference to the right to the full of this information, to which I believe we're all entitled,

16:24.320 --> 16:28.320
as members of the committee, under the existing rules, there's no change to my knowledge of the rules.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.320
The date, other than communal adult things.

16:32.320 --> 16:40.320
I would say, Mr. Chairman, that the last part of the subpoena except the number and the disclosing names of informants.

16:40.320 --> 16:45.320
That such number and that should be turned over to you.

16:45.320 --> 16:53.320
And I'm sure that would be an amicable arrangement with the Chairman Month and Senator McCarthy.

16:53.320 --> 16:59.320
And I'm not going to concede that we're not entitled to it, but for the state's expediting action on this.

16:59.320 --> 17:05.320
I think any member and that, Mr. Chine, has prepared regarding informant ought to be turned over to the Chairman.

17:05.320 --> 17:10.320
So we know that he has actually written out such a member and that with all our committee members,

17:10.320 --> 17:13.320
going over the names of such individuals.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.320
We're not interested in names.

17:14.320 --> 17:18.320
We will hold what we're interested in here, whether he's written such a member and that.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.320
Now, I think that should be a lot of us.

17:21.320 --> 17:24.320
I don't think there should be any dispute on that point.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.320
We just have record of it.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.320
You know, Chairman, you know what I'm saying?

17:28.320 --> 17:29.320
I'm just...

17:29.320 --> 17:31.320
You know, you're listening to the federal government.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.320
I'm not asking any of this.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.320
And I think, before you leave, I just wanted to do this.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.320
I think with reference to the requirements for subpoena,

17:39.320 --> 17:43.320
that the committee, Mr. Ray Jenkins, can set it back to explain that.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.320
And I'd just like to yield on that point.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.320
I think I have a board now.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.320
I'm not sure if the Chair is not working out anybody.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.320
I have a chair.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.320
We're working out somebody from the Digital Commons, whether or not the adjustments are used.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.320
You, the Chair, is a councilor.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.320
I've been working on the Maccastor.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.320
I'm working on the Maccastor.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.320
I'm working on the councilor.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.320
I'm working on the councilor.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.320
What's going on?

17:59.320 --> 18:00.320
Well, let me...

18:00.320 --> 18:00.320


18:00.320 --> 18:02.320
In the face of some allocation of time,

18:02.320 --> 18:05.320
may I just be able to fund this by me then and then...

18:05.320 --> 18:06.320
Are the assignments...

18:06.320 --> 18:08.320
Of course, I think it's there.

18:08.320 --> 18:12.320
The reason the subpoena was just incentivized was because the council had a committee stated...

18:13.320 --> 18:17.320
That's one of the Maccastor's, he would not give the record to the committee unless it was a pre-nage.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.320
That's point one.

18:19.320 --> 18:23.320
Now point two is regardless of what the opinion of any member of this committee is.

18:23.320 --> 18:28.320
In my opinion, the majority of this committee has the right to see anything that the committee has.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.320
And on the third point, we had pretty good success by...

18:31.320 --> 18:34.320
When we said that we would take the matter with Mr. Pra,

18:34.320 --> 18:36.320
if he didn't have the right to the front and floor,

18:36.320 --> 18:38.320
a medical hall will be straight right now.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.320
But if the member of this committee can't do the work of the committee,

18:41.320 --> 18:43.320
I think that's the right path to the front and floor too.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.320
See what the front and front is.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.320
Finally, it's a straight different to the opinion here.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.320
With the Supreme Court of the Noise and Now, I'm the attorney general and the junior technical Wisconsin.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.320
And I want to say, right, frankly, without saying...

18:54.320 --> 18:58.320
I have a humanitarian about it, but in my opinion, if the senate can work hard on his rights,

18:58.320 --> 19:01.320
we haven't got a good government, we haven't got a poor government,

19:01.320 --> 19:03.320
we just won't have any government at all.

19:03.320 --> 19:08.320
Finally, I'm getting a little astonished that the amount of the census this administration gets...

19:08.320 --> 19:12.320
...from the Democratic members of the committee and the additional silence on my right.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.320
I'm looking very happy to have you here.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.320
Can I have a seat?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.320
Can I have a seat?

19:18.320 --> 19:20.320
Can I have a seat?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.320
I have a seat.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.320
Can I have a seat?

19:24.320 --> 19:26.320
I have a seat.

19:26.320 --> 19:30.320
And I'm sure it's not because we are trying to defeat the people.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.320
Trying to get some tears.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.320
I've here to go in this place.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.320
I've here to go in this place.

19:36.320 --> 19:40.320
There's no attempt to the part of the Senate of Wisconsin.

19:40.320 --> 19:44.320
To deny this committee any information, which is the chair one.

19:44.320 --> 19:48.320
The chair knows that I have told him that our files are white open to him.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.320
The chair does no hover.

19:50.320 --> 19:56.320
Then I have stated, and I will continue to say, that my Democratic colleagues will not get the money...

19:56.320 --> 20:01.320
...of the loyal government employees who give us the evidence of the treason...

20:01.320 --> 20:04.320
...to be enjoying over the past 20, 21 years.

20:04.320 --> 20:10.320
Because I will not give those names to them when they say that our functions are coming back on the committee.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.320
It's not for a small, difficult, difficult, commoners.

20:14.320 --> 20:18.320
So maybe you want to hear this, it's about you.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.320
But when it affects where our functions are not to expose...

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
I've always liked to do something like that.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.320
When I was around you, you were like, you were like, you were asking me.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.320
You were asking me, you were asking me.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.320
And I was like, now that's coming.

20:28.320 --> 20:32.320
And if you don't have to know everything about it, look and have to all the time you talk.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.320
What is all that?

20:37.320 --> 20:39.320
I should be asking questions.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.320
I can put it now in about 30 seconds.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.320
I'll hold both of them.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.320
I'll do it again.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.320
I thought from my dinner, I told you you came back and it's money.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.320
They were coming back.

20:49.320 --> 20:53.320
For the part of the company you need to get, you need to trust in the party.

20:53.320 --> 20:58.320
If you have a Zoom app, I don't know until we're aversors and...

20:58.320 --> 21:03.320
...and aversely, the individuals to give us the information we need as a committee.

21:04.320 --> 21:08.320
We do not get to know you about any information.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.320
I never thought you'd know.

21:10.320 --> 21:13.320
How to get all the tower to the point of personal purpose?

21:13.320 --> 21:16.320
There's nothing in the world about me that I want.

21:16.320 --> 21:21.320
But again, I ask you not to talk about my beloved colleagues in the Senate of the Marcon Swal.

21:21.320 --> 21:25.320
In this fashion, only their aid and the Senate has met these areas.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.320
I'm not going to say another word to the Senate.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.320
The Senate reached that, and I hope it resumed, but the color clear is easy.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.320
In a rocket tank, continue.

21:36.320 --> 21:40.320
The fact is committee group now has the Senate of Maccopy and Mrs. McCartney working.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.320
And the session will now be convened.

21:42.320 --> 21:47.320
So, those are all the most honorable and meaningful, the Congress will be convened.

21:47.320 --> 21:55.320
The committee will be convened. The audience knows of the admonition of the chair of the suggestions that Constable Trump is going to carry getting the witness in the comments on the Senate's suggestions.

21:55.320 --> 22:00.320
Let's turn on the chair.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.320
Let's turn on the chair.

22:02.320 --> 22:11.320
Before we left the board of boards, one of the time is in the bed of tables that's the members of the member of the committee been changed.

22:11.320 --> 22:15.320
I would like to say this to my next guest, Ms. Arden.

22:15.320 --> 22:21.320
As your member of the committee members are here to ask the table for action and make political speech.

22:21.320 --> 22:25.320
We have an April call to who has been dressed in questions to what.

22:25.320 --> 22:31.320
The television camera I assume has been on you, but we're soon for a turn.

22:31.320 --> 22:36.320
I would like to say that I have a great respect for the man who's fashion and vital, first and right.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.320
I think the other members of the committee reflect in the likewise.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.320
He's a great administrator and a great American.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.320
And it's evil.

22:46.320 --> 22:52.320
A man who's been campaigning for the things that the president has said for to tell us.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.320
But we should do it. Now we should run our part.

22:55.320 --> 22:58.320
I would like to say first.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.320
Please send him to the right.

23:01.320 --> 23:06.320
We'd have no government that's for this condition.

23:06.320 --> 23:12.320
Thank God we live in a country where we can have the people's representants.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.320
Can you tell me what?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.320
Think they can define the government.

23:16.320 --> 23:20.320
Our government is a 5-48 government.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.320
And we are the people's representants.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.320
I'm the first food mayor.

23:25.320 --> 23:29.320
That's the enough to get you to many of the Congress's come down to the federal line.

23:29.320 --> 23:33.320
Do we get our, we get our phones, phone, phone, as we should?

23:33.320 --> 23:35.320
Five of the same food.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.320
I think many times they can define the government.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.320
Overstep there.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.320
Responsible in authority.

23:40.320 --> 23:43.320
What I'm going to do is be Congress as they get.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.320
This is going to pass them to us.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.320
Just create a committee like yourself.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.320
So I, I would make that committee.

23:49.320 --> 23:52.320
So what committee is not waiting as they, as they, as they,

23:52.320 --> 23:55.320
the government, part of the Congress.

23:55.320 --> 23:58.320
And I, I, was this.

23:58.320 --> 24:04.320
As they, not only as they were puppets, but I was doing as they, as they, as they remember the stuff.

24:04.320 --> 24:10.320
So, who you have your puppets, are, are, are, are,

24:10.320 --> 24:11.320
letting down the president.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.320
I, the president's a great man.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.320
And I belong.

24:16.320 --> 24:22.320
Those that is in power for at least eight years.

24:22.320 --> 24:28.320
I know some things you think are coming on, but I,

24:28.320 --> 24:33.320
I really have to do, I love to have time with my friends and colleagues at the

24:33.320 --> 24:37.320
distinguished junior service, the Michigan, for the great deal of respect.

24:37.320 --> 24:43.320
I think he knows that there's nobody in the Senate for whom I have more affection and respect.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.320
President, I'll speak to you in a moment.

24:45.320 --> 24:51.320
Chairman, before doing so, I want to bother in his heart to a little time consuming

24:51.320 --> 24:54.320
discussion, and that is for the purpose of clarification.

24:54.320 --> 24:59.320
I've publicly declared responsibility for the agents of the Supreme Union.

24:59.320 --> 25:03.320
I'll assert for this reason that the pilot of the UN research act,

25:03.320 --> 25:06.320
this grossing zoning, Mr. Cohn, with respect to the CAG,

25:06.320 --> 25:10.320
or work that has been done by Mr. Shine, multiple foreign entries in the

25:10.320 --> 25:14.320
election in the Army, and particularly with records to the CAG, or work that he had

25:14.320 --> 25:16.320
done, by the needs of absences.

25:16.320 --> 25:22.320
Out of the records, which would reflect, if possible, the extent of work that was

25:23.320 --> 25:28.320
done by Mr. Shine officially, I called Mr. Cohn during the lunch hour,

25:28.320 --> 25:33.320
I told him that I was with the members of my staff, that in addition there,

25:33.320 --> 25:38.320
too, I have with me the attorney for the three Democratic members of this committee,

25:38.320 --> 25:43.320
that the four others wanted to come to his office and examine those records.

25:43.320 --> 25:48.320
Mr. Cohn replied that he desired to discuss that matter with the senator from Wisconsin.

25:48.320 --> 25:53.320
He noted so whereupon the senator from Wisconsin called me, and the stated that the records

25:53.320 --> 25:56.320
would not be made available except by the seniors.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.320
That he thinks they were, were the seniors they would be made available.

25:59.320 --> 26:04.320
Presumpt to that, if the senior was requested and positioned for the chairman,

26:04.320 --> 26:09.320
I confess that it was too broad in its scope, through now having you and different

26:09.320 --> 26:13.320
one, which has been issued, and which has been accepted by the senator from Wisconsin,

26:13.320 --> 26:16.320
which clearly defines precisely what we want.

26:17.320 --> 26:21.320
And I trust Mr. Chairman that once and for all, and finally, that settles the question

26:21.320 --> 26:24.320
of the Slovenian. Now it's because that's what we think.

26:24.320 --> 26:31.320
At least one point, and I want to make it clear, I have that based on the rules of the committee,

26:31.320 --> 26:35.320
whereas members, all members of the committee are entitled to this information,

26:35.320 --> 26:41.320
and I don't. Thanks for one moment, that it should be construed from the subpoenae

26:41.320 --> 26:45.320
that we're not entitled to that as members of the committee.

26:45.320 --> 26:50.320
And I do say that a lot of part of the subpoenae, Mr. Chairman, which excludes

26:50.320 --> 27:00.320
member and related to informal information, but Mr. Schein, they have worked on,

27:00.320 --> 27:05.320
is not acceptable on our side for the reason that we're entitled to that information,

27:05.320 --> 27:10.320
and I do think, but I'm not asking for the names of informants by do think,

27:11.320 --> 27:16.320
but you are chairman and the other and the council should have the information

27:16.320 --> 27:21.320
as to whether or not in fact such memoranda exists as a result of the evidence of Mr. Schein.

27:21.320 --> 27:25.320
And the chairman from the Wisconsin toward him, no.

27:25.320 --> 27:29.320
About information with the committee, available to council and to the chair,

27:29.320 --> 27:34.320
without a subpoenae, all of the injured informants, and the chair that you've been gathered at,

27:34.320 --> 27:37.320
and they thought of a number of the memorandums that he does not expect to be a vehicle

27:37.320 --> 27:39.320
for conveying the names of informants.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.320
So I would like to give a little bit of a careful of the committee and,

27:41.320 --> 27:44.320
uh, bring the best information we may develop on.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.320
Because if we all write to the chair, it's fine very well.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.320
I would appreciate the idea.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.320
And I would like to give a little bit of a little bit of information

27:50.320 --> 27:53.320
to the mind of my secretary, that would respect it as a fire discussion.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.320
I understand that this morning I was directed to the professor.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.320
He's very think.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.320
Most of the insolent necessary of any kind.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.320
I have prepared to obey that direction.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.320
I will obey the secretary, who I would respect, and as well,

28:04.320 --> 28:06.320
he's been in peace to go through everything to date.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.320
Now I will continue with the secretary.

28:08.320 --> 28:12.320
Well, I want to make it clear that he's with us, uh, without the...

28:12.320 --> 28:14.320
He's a very good, very good lady.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.320
Comforter, you informant's name is a little bit of a chair.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.320
He's getting the same room.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.320
He will not be told the information.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.320
He's been in the number of the schools.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.320
This is very tough.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.320
So well, I would appreciate your noble legal aspirations.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.320
I do wait for Mr. Jenkins to ask the question.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.320
Before adjourned, Mr. Jenkins,

28:32.320 --> 28:35.320
would you be to the master ascertain from this went to the heavy human fire

28:35.320 --> 28:36.320
from ownership need thee.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.320
The name of this...

28:37.320 --> 28:41.320
The number of herds and secretary, who took the signed vacation.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.320
Which, only you do that.

28:42.320 --> 28:47.320
Uh, as Mr. Walshler will know, sir, I have not testified that Mr. Shine

28:47.320 --> 28:51.320
dictated anything down in Washington to any of his denominations.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.320
We have no stenographers in New York.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.320
They're all in Washington.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.320
Mr. Shine was not one in Washington so far as I know,

28:57.320 --> 29:01.320
during the entire period of time that he was at for a date.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.320
So, no such thing as Mr. Walshler, I could.

29:03.320 --> 29:07.320
I'm sure he knew that, but since he knew that statement,

29:07.320 --> 29:09.320
if he would like the names of stenographers in our office,

29:09.320 --> 29:13.320
I imagine that there are a matter of record, and we would be very happy to give that.

29:13.320 --> 29:16.320
I might say, sir, that if I'm never given the chance,

29:16.320 --> 29:20.320
we will supply to the committee all documents, memorandum,

29:20.320 --> 29:23.320
reports, and any other information worked on by Dave Shine,

29:23.320 --> 29:26.320
but he came with the committee, which might be of interest.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.320
Sir, the committee, and to Mr. Walshler.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.320
Mr. Walshler, there's all four and eight years in November's latest school.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.320
Yes, sir, we're going to get you everything.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.320
And as we understand it, that would be made available,

29:35.320 --> 29:37.320
if 50 gives possible for this committee,

29:37.320 --> 29:39.320
by not later in the next few months.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.320
Yes, sir.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.320
We'll be specifically part of that.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
I'm going to say, sir, I'm in Eastern August, this is a second day,

29:44.320 --> 29:46.320
it's Mr. Shine, the chief in the station, whatever.

29:46.320 --> 29:48.320
Winning to likewise, we made a request.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.320
Yes, sir.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.320
Now, Mr. Walshler, please.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.320
One is one, Mr. Senador.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.320
One is asking, go ahead.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.320
I am not interested in documents, Mr. Shine,

29:54.320 --> 29:56.320
and worked on.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.320
In the sense of looked at, or read, or thought about.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.320
I want his work, sir.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.320
And I want to be calling to understand, that's what I am now.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.320
I think Mr. Walsh has been the prosecutor.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.320
Mr. Walshler has been the prosecutor.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.320
Mr. Walshler has been the prosecutor.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.320
Mr. Walshler has been the prosecutor.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.320
Mr. Walshler has been the prosecutor.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.320
Well, sir, the only thing that's...

30:12.320 --> 30:15.320
I'm going to go through the files, and if you have anything we have to say,

30:15.320 --> 30:17.320
Shine, work done, have anything to do with it,

30:17.320 --> 30:21.320
and anyway, with the exception of the name of confidential informer.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.320
Shine, already.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.320
Please, just about that.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.320
I believe I'm already pleased if we may.

30:25.320 --> 30:28.320
He testified a probably much too much length about the work

30:28.320 --> 30:32.320
which he did in the fact he participated in the writing of these reports.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.320
I have turned into Mr. Walshler's reports,

30:35.320 --> 30:37.320
which he participated in writing,

30:37.320 --> 30:40.320
and have taught Mr. Walsh to enjoy it at the end of this point.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.320
I will be very glad to state, under my whole care,

30:43.320 --> 30:46.320
that when Mr. Shine, after his training,

30:46.320 --> 30:49.320
was out to work on committee business.

30:49.320 --> 30:52.320
That's to my knowledge, he was working on committee business,

30:52.320 --> 30:54.320
did work on these reports,

30:54.320 --> 30:58.320
did confer what the staff members of this committee on committee business,

30:58.320 --> 31:00.320
was not in Florida,

31:00.320 --> 31:01.320
but anything else.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.320
And that is the fact that Mr. Walsh has my sworn testimony.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.320
And of course, at the right time, I'll be open to cross examination from him about that.

31:07.320 --> 31:11.320
I am on change the morning, make sure you will furnish the list committee,

31:11.320 --> 31:14.320
all documentary evidence,

31:14.320 --> 31:16.320
whatever it may be,

31:16.320 --> 31:18.320
which embraces the work of Lady Shine.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.320
I will, sir.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.320
The colonel of mass, that will last me,

31:21.320 --> 31:24.320
and I hope once and for all the questions of the issue,

31:24.320 --> 31:27.320
and to the subignion, the question of whether or not,

31:27.320 --> 31:31.320
the union senator from Wisconsin, Willer, will not go to jail.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.320
And that says,

31:32.320 --> 31:38.320
the new value, and I had completed our crossing examination with respect to the occurrences

31:38.320 --> 31:42.320
of October 20th of Fort Mahler, the exact length.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.320
I forgot, and just what we ended on, sir.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.320
I believe I was there.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.320
Do you recall the testimony, Mr. Conor,

31:48.320 --> 31:50.320
Mr. Head, to the effect?

31:50.320 --> 31:53.320
That's between October 20th and November 1st.

31:53.320 --> 32:00.320
He and he had several telephone conversations with respect to special assignments for Lady Shine.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.320
I don't think all of our special assignments are, if you say that, I...

32:03.320 --> 32:07.320
Where was respect to Lady Shine?

32:07.320 --> 32:09.320
Unicolored with that of Mrs. Fettimony?

32:09.320 --> 32:10.320
Oh, I know that, sir.

32:10.320 --> 32:15.320
That is, I covered a ten-day change, and I'd like to read to you, Mr. Conor,

32:15.320 --> 32:17.320
what he says about that, shall it?

32:17.320 --> 32:22.320
I'll check my notes. This is the testimony of Mr. Adams on 325, 22 of the record.

32:22.320 --> 32:26.320
No, the regular telephone calls, 2 out 3 A.D.

32:26.320 --> 32:31.320
I can't say every day, I were 2 out 3, but I was in telephone contact,

32:31.320 --> 32:35.320
quite regularly with Mr. Conor, but most of the time in New York and Mr. Kars,

32:35.320 --> 32:37.320
but most of the time, in Marchington.

32:37.320 --> 32:41.320
You mean, since the conductor of the 20th studies, correct, sir?

32:43.320 --> 32:45.320
Then, continue.

32:46.320 --> 32:49.320
What I'm trying to tell you is that Mr. Jenkins is a bit not so much money

32:49.320 --> 32:51.320
from November 1st, I assume.
