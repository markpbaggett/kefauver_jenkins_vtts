WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
But just as a matter of taking, I would say, more than good possibility, no.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Mr. Adams, we will shoot for those in mourning just as nearly as can be.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Mr. Garb, I will say keep the Indians working and you will be here.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
And I will say not until next week, unless you guys first go.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Mr. Adams, here.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Mr. Adams, we'll be exception on the divisions.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
We'll be exception on the divisions on the main rivers, the right-director rivers,

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
for a new transcription of the monotid call in March 5, 1964 at 525 PM,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
between Mr. Garb and Mr. Adams.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
So, before the bomb, the line was about, and it's nearly and it should be early.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
One time, the staff didn't even change the line.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Let the gate go back from the bomb.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
And, gentlemen, we will shoot for Thursday morning just as early as can be.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
So, what day is it?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
So, the last one.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
What word did I use in the summer?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Did I use early?

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
No, me, me, me, and it should be early.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
In other words, what Senator should read?

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Mr. Adams, we will shoot for Thursday morning just as early as can be.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Now, with exception, what one?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Correct, Jim, did I read it correctly?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Yes, sir.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I'll be there.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes, sir.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Yes, sir.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yes, sir.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Yes, sir.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Another witness will now be called to the stand to test device to the monitor telephone calls.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
And, last year, coming to the station.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Mrs. Miss Glancy.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
What is the next call between the two gentlemen that you monitor?

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
Um, probably four in the afternoon and the eighth of March.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Do you have a transcription of that call in front of me?

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I will read my transcription and I'll ask you a problem.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Mr. Carr, hello, Mr. Adams, hello Frank.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Mr. Carr, gentlemen, I take it.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
You are not going to get a chance to get over here, Mr. Adams.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
Gosh, Frank, I have been sitting here working on a paper.

02:46.000 --> 02:55.000
Now, Mrs. Miss Glancy, I need a minor correction in that both words and adjectives.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
I am very apologetic.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Until this second, I forgot about it.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
I have been sitting here with the pencil in hand, writing up music.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
Mrs. Glancy is the correction that I made as that materially effective meaning of that.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Mr. Sennish, no face.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Mr. Carr, it is either a blast, a bash.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
What do you think?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It is about four o'clock.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Adams, it is too late today.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Maybe we are better do it tomorrow.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Carr, let's get together tomorrow.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
What do you have on your mind, Carr?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I want to continue our talk on the other day.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I don't want to talk on the phone.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I think I have been successful to some extent.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Adams, or do you going to be in charge of the rest of the week?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Carr, making a speech in New York tomorrow.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Adams, then coming down here.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
Carr, once again, we have this one guy of yours, Mr. X.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Mr. Adams, oh, Mr. Carr, plus the FTO.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
First thing we probably will have, more FTO.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Killings going on solely.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Adams, oh, Carr.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So I would say in town of Teens.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
I would say maybe you and I hope to have a chat sometime soon.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Adams, well, I will try and do it tomorrow.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I am, Mr. Vista.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Thank you.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
It should be FTO, meaning federal of national communication.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Thank you, sir.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Mr. Adams, well, I will try and do it tomorrow.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I am very apologetic.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I just forgot.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Mr. Carr, okay, gentlemen, time is over.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Yes, Mr. Adams, okay, thank you.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Now does that conclude the call of March 8th?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yes.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
In a by correctly, ready to acceptions of the one change,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
we have to go to the rest of the week.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yes.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
But now, we can cross bond with the transmission of yours.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
We are transferring of yours, stomach-like ignores.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yes.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Did you monitor a call between these two gentlemen,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Mr. Carr and Mr. Adams on March 9th, 1950?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yes, sir.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Was that the next call?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yes, sir.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And what was the time?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Oh, it's here in the afternoon.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
I will read my transcription and I'll ask you to follow.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Carr, hello, Adams, hello Frank.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Carr, John, let me get my machine on.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It is fouled up.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But, don't you have a machine that has a buzz?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Carr, not automatically.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Adams, I see.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Carr, I have the old car and I have to switch it on.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Adams, I see.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.100
Carr, John, I ask you a week or so,

05:38.100 --> 05:42.000
hello, about this Mr. X,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
what's more, what is how come of that?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Is someone working on it?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Are you going to get that?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Joe will ask me when he gets back.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Adams, I should have that Dr. Ma on the moon.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I had a target on that and a few other things.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Carr, that will come over tomorrow noon, right?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Sometime tomorrow.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Adams, I don't know Frank, that I indicated

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I would ever get you a paper.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
You ought to know what happened,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
where he used in the army,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
what his duties are, something we can give.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Carr, just a second.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
I know, then, well someone will ask him about that

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
and he will be asking me.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
You will try to get that tomorrow, right?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Adams, right, I will get you back for you

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
in what mood.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Carr, all right.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Adams, all right.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Carr, the next one can you give us

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
the 201-File on this guy, Mr. X.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Mr. Adams, Mr. X.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Mr. Carr, all right.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Adams, right.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Carr.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Now the next one describes the men

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
he which I just referred.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Is that correct?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Correct.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Mr. Adams, is he and so this man

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
are Carr no ease out?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Adams, then we will have to send the state

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
north for the fall.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Carr, right?

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
He born this age and the next

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
two words also describe the men.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Is that correct?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Correct.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Mr. Adams, discharge.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And there are also the script he was

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
to meet with me following that.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
That's correct.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Mr. Carr, right?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Mr. Adams, right.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Mr. Carr, his service number is

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Frank.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Adams, Frank.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Carr, he has previously had other

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
serial numbers with the Army,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
while it would be out of mold.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Adams, that's the Carr, he was an

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
enlisted man in previous service.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Mr. Carr, I have one, Frank.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Adams, right.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Carr, and the other number,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
probably, enlisted does not seem to

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
be long enough.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Frank.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Mr. Adams, that is long enough.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I think.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
No, it isn't.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Frank.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Mr. Carr, I don't know if that is

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
long enough.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Frank is supposed to be his last

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
number.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Born, born, Frank.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Dave.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Mr. Adams, you know a lot about

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
him.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Mr. Carr, a little about him.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Born in Frank Country.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Adams, right.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Carr, another thing you could do.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Now, St. Louis takes time.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Adams, I am sure it would be out

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
there because he is out of service.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I don't know where he is.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
We will have to find out.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
It probably never was in here.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Carr, look up in the works anyhow.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I guess that is all.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Okay, I have some other things.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Adams, I see.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Okay, what else?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Carr, that is all.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I take it, you are not interested.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
In getting together with me.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Adams, that is not so.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I am working myself to the bowl.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I am working my head off.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Carr, I thought you possibly

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
were when I talked to you last time.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Frank, don't say that.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Carr, I am serious, John.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I have gone to great lengths.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I am a little disturbed.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Three dots.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Just Adams, that is not so.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I have not been able to get away from my best.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Carr, it is all right with me, John.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
It does not make that much difference to me.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I thought I was working with you.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Adams, I hope you are.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
I hope you are working on the same problem.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Carr, I did want to talk to you.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
It is up to you, boy.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Adams, I will be up to see you.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
Carr, I have gone ahead and got involved in a commitment.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Adams, I am itch, Frank.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Carr, this is my last offer.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Frank, Adams, okay, bye.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Now, does that conclude?

09:49.000 --> 09:57.000
The call to which we already made reference.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
And with the exception of the deletions,

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
which I called your attention to, if I correctly read your transcription,

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
the deletions.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Now, Mrs. Lancet,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
where you put dots,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
does that mean that something was left out?

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Yes, at least I did get a word in the end.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Now, on all the calls that I have read, on all the transcriptions,

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
is it your testimony that those transcriptions,

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
just substantially, reflect the conversations between Mr. Carr and Mr. Adams.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Yes, Frank.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
And nothing in a material way was left out.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Yes, did I know?

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You, to the best of your ability, took down everywhere that was saved.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yes, Frank.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Is that correct?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yes, correct.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
Now, are there any more monitor calls

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
that you took between Carr and Adams?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Yes, there's two more calls, but I did not take them.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
And we concluded all the calls that you monitor.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yes.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Well, Mr. Chan, Roger.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Please.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Mr. Chan, Roger.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Roger.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
At least you, Oneway.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
Jesus, I'm sorry for trying to handle you, but still,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
the whole truth is that nothing but it's just the whole truth.

11:32.000 --> 11:42.000
Evacuate me, please.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
And do I MISS CHаний trigger?!

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Yes, it, MIS or MIS ist.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
MIS is strike.

11:48.000 --> 11:58.000
Now, Mrs. Shun, Roger, are you also Secretary to Mr. Adams?

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
So I am Secretary to the Duptitt Accounts Hall.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
And who is the Secretary Council?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
The Secretary.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
And do you all occasions take dictations to Mr. Adams?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
You try to, when you Secretary is there to...

12:17.000 --> 12:28.000
And what it's been, are you here to take short ear notes and transcribing for those notes?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
You don't take any notes for many years.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, I'll take you down next, but I'll see you now.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Wow.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
You've had a lot of exchange.

12:40.000 --> 12:51.000
Now, did you monitor any telephone calls between Mr. John Adams and Mr. Frank Carr during the month of March?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yes.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
What's that?

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
How many calls between these two gentlemen to do monitoring?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Why?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And the date of that call was one.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
30th of March.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Two, you have a transcript, you know, that monitoring in front of you.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I don't know.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
And you only monitor the one call.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Right.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
March 6, 1954, and that was a flop time of date.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
147 am.

13:16.000 --> 13:26.000
There's a transcription which you have in front of you for accurate transcription of what was said between these two gentlemen.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yes, sir.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You better work today.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Good afternoon, Madam Taylor.

13:32.000 --> 13:50.000
Madam, here's what I can't believe Mr. Carr stipulates that all the longer calls that you have before you will be just by two as accurately monitored by the witnesses to say to some time.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
And that way, we have to read them in the records.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Thank you, sir.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
I will read the transcription which I hear in my head.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
And I will read it again when I ask you to follow me in, see if I will read correctly.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
And this is called 8 at March 6, 1954, 10, 147 am.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Is that correct?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Between Mr. Adams and Mr. Carr.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Mr. Adams.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Man, man, man, next.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Four pages.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Yesterday.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Are you sure you got the right guy?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Carr.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
No, that's why I told you we might let him off.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Adams, here's his cleanest ivory soap.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
There's another man by that name, who lives in New York.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Used to be in service.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Who is...

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
X.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Mr. Carr.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
In service recently.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Adams, on the go.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Carr, how long ago?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Adams, six or seven years ago.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Carr, do you have the file?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Adams, no, I just had a call without effect.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
They say the file is clean.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Carr, that's why we wanted to a one-file.

15:01.000 --> 15:09.000
Adams, I think you will find man by same name, practicing in blank.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Mr. Carr, blank.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Mr. Adams, I think you have the wrong man.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Mr. Carr, I am inclined to think so too.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
If the young man's background and we can be jazzy.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Adams, I don't know.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I haven't seen the file.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
That's why my people just told me.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Carr, can you send me the file?

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Adams, yes, I can send you the file by one of your excuses.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Maybe if I didn't, you would tell me you have mistaken identity.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Carr, all right, fine.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
What's all this blank in the paper?

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
Mr. Adams, I don't know why he's in.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Mr. Carr, what the hell?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I think the guy must be on the wacky side.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Is he trying to fit himself in the position of promise?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Adams, he has a public remission.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
He's fellow.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
Carr, unless he was, guy that took over during recent practice.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Mr. Adams, I am completely in the dark about it.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Somebody may know more about it than I do.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I think too much.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Carr, he looks like an Indian.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Does that conclude your call?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Or is it like six?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Did I correctly read it?

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
What is the exception of the deletions to which they brought us?

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm a gentleman, Adams, I'm a stage one.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
You said why, and it should lead better.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
What, my people just told me.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Does that change the meaning of the call?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
I will put it so.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Well, with exception, we have one question to our leader.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh, I'm going to keep my voice.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Bye, Adams.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Thank you.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, as I understand, that was the only call that you monitored

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
between Mr. Clark and Mr. Adams.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Thanks.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Thank you.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
When you call, is it Mr. Blue or Mr. Blue?

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
In the first, uh, the first time I can, uh,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
calculate whatever you have before you is, uh,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
pat the scene where you can stand on.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
There's things that come out.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
So that you can now just lead the call.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Very good.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Raise your head, you're in the empty air.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
You found me to want a testimony about to give me the truth

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
for how truth I'm not in the truth.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
You have to go out.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
You mind to see it?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
State your name, please.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Let me know.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
And that is Mr. Blue.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Mr. Blue.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Mr. Blue.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
Mr. Blue, you have the transcription of the monocle

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
between Mr. Clark and Mr. Adams.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Made in March 1854.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Plan 35 and 8-Hm.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yes, sir.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
You monitor that call.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Thank you.

18:20.000 --> 18:28.000
No, when you follow me, I read from the copy that I have in my hand.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Can't be forgetting, uh, there's a following range.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
And I quote, record a telephone conversation between Mr. Frank Carr,

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
and investigating subcommittee of Senate and Mr. Adams Department Council.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
Mr. Carr, could I borrow the youth for a couple of minutes on a couple of names?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
If you want us to, we would borrow up with a letter.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Mr. Adams, go ahead.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
If you can, let us know where these are located.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
The first one.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
And the school, our only greeting,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
any further from our paragraph,

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
do you agree with me that it's all from the nature of giving names and describing.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
The persons whose names are given.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
So, Mr. Carr, Mr. Adams,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
they inspect me.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Mr. Carr, oh, well, find out where he is.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
What is the possibility of asking him in the proposed morning,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
depending upon where he is stationed?

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
Now we would like to have the 201,000 on these guys, also where they are.

19:50.000 --> 19:59.000
Now, do you agree with me that there are follows the names of some five persons

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
with seven descriptions following the names of each of the persons?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Yes, sir.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
And there's no other information contained on the first page of this transcript.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
No, sir.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
There's no information about the names of these five persons.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Is that correct?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Yes, sir.

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
Mr. Adams, if I ever get away from my desk, I'm coming over there.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Mr. Carr, good.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
We're having hearing a 1030 this morning.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And another one tomorrow afternoon.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
Mr. Adams, I think Barry is catching the one this morning.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
You've got Mr. X this morning.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Mr. Carr, that's right.

20:45.000 --> 20:53.000
The exception of the deletions to which we made reference to not correctly read the transcription

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
of that monotid call.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
That is the one David Martin in 1954 between Mr. Carr and Mr. Adams.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You did, sir.

21:02.000 --> 21:11.000
There are no other monotid calls between Mr. Carr and Mr. Adams.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
It's not correct.

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
You know, I'm addressing that not only to you, but to the other two ladies in test drive.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
That's correct.

21:21.000 --> 21:29.000
Mr. Carr, is it intended to follow Mr. Colman's hands?

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
The other side has a test drive.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Oh, that's one of those.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
In ours, we do not keep driving.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
We do not mind the call.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
When we, and we don't intend to, sir.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
When we want to get down some information to be quoted or a point to check on,

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
what we will do is have the person say, Mr. Carr, talk and commit to Adams.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Mr. Carr, I'll explain it to you.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
John, I'm going to have a girl get on the phone to get down this information.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
So it happens in one case.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
And we were trying to get a call from Mr. Adams for use in our annual report on the Army Security System.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
It's sure that that's not a particular variant on this controversy.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Well, the only thing is this whole case.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
We don't care whether it goes in or whether it doesn't go in.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Bill, you may all hold a close to the other side.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
On the phone, we would prefer to have it in, Mr. Colman.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
But my only time is, we're going to have a five minute recess.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
And as we have a very busy meeting today, we have a recess.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Because we have just told you this.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Mr. Jenkins has a minute and a month and we're very happy to have this.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
We'll have a five minute recess.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
And we'll meet you in the next problem.

22:37.000 --> 22:46.000
I'm sure I'll get to all the conversations with the committee rules.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
For a bidding of honorable manifestations of approval of this approval on the following year.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
It would be necessary if you would use those now.

22:54.000 --> 23:03.000
It was agreed immediately prior to the recess that the first item of business following the recess

23:03.000 --> 23:12.000
with the reading into the letter, the telephone call supplied by the so-called

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Kohn Macarty side of this country.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
And Mr. Menard, do you have that call?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
And can you take care of that?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Or is it somebody else?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Mr. Chairman, I have it.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
I want the party here to look at as a witness.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
I believe she is here.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
It's me.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Mr. Memes in the room.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
Mr. Duckett, will you send for Mrs. Memes?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I think she's on the way.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Senator Macarty is not yet in the caucus room.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
There's Mr. Lee.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
Chief Council of the government operations committee, the parent committee of this temporary committee.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Mr. Emesia, Senator Macarty is apparently not in the caucus room.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
There's Mr. Meanor on the left, the associate council, Mr. Jenkins, and Senator Mutt.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
While we're waiting, we can start the question go around with these last monotony.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
Anybody have any questions to ask them? The chair has none. Do you have any Senator Macarty?

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
You have none, Senator Jackson.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
No, no, sir.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Senator Jackson?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
No, sir.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Senator Potter?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
No, sir.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Senator Simonton?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Senator Boyshank?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Mr. Welch?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Mr. Clare?

24:35.000 --> 24:43.000
Mr. Macarty isn't here, so we've got back to the same point now, waiting for Mr. Meanor.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
All of the monotony telephone calls in possession of the Army have not been placed in the record of print.
