00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I said if he does call him, he could say, quote,

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
with you I can do this and this and this.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
But I can't do this and this.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
One quote, two dashes.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Of course, then you people will not be able to say then.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Oh, what about us?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
I am not in a position to ask you.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
I have not been mocking with it at the moment.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
There's some here another question.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
What is Roy doing?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Car is backing you off the game.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
He's never here when the fireworks are on.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
What?

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
You assure you are not see-roeing Adam then as a collateral target.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Car, no.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Adam, I have reason to believe that is so.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Car, I am not.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Adam, but do you know anybody else?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Car, no.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Adam, let me ask you a question.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Do you think I have ever done anything?

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Ever to indicate that I've discounts the ability of the FBI?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Car, never to meet John No.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Adam, do you think I have ever done anything to indicate to you or to anybody else in the committee?

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
That I thought the FBI had no protest in the field of security.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Car, I can't say for anybody else John, not to meet.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Adam, from your conversations with me,

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
would you think I was a supporter of what the FBI was trying to do for all of us in this field?

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm asking that because I have particular reason to believe that I'm used to a friend that told the director.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Car, that you are not a friend, Adam, where I can't ask isolate today.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I don't remember when it was two days since.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
But in one of those days when we were two days since,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
maybe even the afternoon when I got fired from the committee,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
two days since, it may have been before that.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Two days since, in one of those violent things,

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
maybe in a hallway or over the phone, two days since.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I have a recollection that was in a car.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Boy was bringing his head.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
He said, quote, the FBI told you.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And so forth, and so forth, and so forth.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
And in response to that, perhaps,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
pushed to exasperation.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Beyond all bearing, I may have said something to him,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
quote, above the hell if we were.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
What is an FBI report?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It is only a report, and quote.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
The only thing to do is to stand on your records.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Adam, I have written clearly as so that to the director.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Car, I can tell you this.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't know whether he has or not.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I do know that he is close, of course, to him.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Adam, so are you close to the director?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Car, meet personally, Adam, yes.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
So I would say I am on more friendly terms.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Adam, I am not asking you to do this,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
because the artillery is firing up the directions.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
But today might come when you would have an opportunity.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
My name would be discussed in front of the director and your president.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
I would appreciate it if you would tell him what you have told me in that regard.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Car, I will tell him exactly what we have said.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Adam, that is all I will tell you.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
If you have any needs on the guys between the Committee and the Director,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
which I thank you have, two dashes.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Car, right.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Adam, guys that you are familiar with,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
if you wanted to pass that word on, two dashes.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Car, let me ask you this.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
There's a issue on this thing.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Adam, I have reason to believe that the director has no support.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
The director has been told that I consider SBI reports of no value,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
and that I have so stayed.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Car, can you say you have reason to believe somebody has made an issue?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Adam, it has come directly to me from the director.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Car, hold him there, he's definitely an issue on him.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Adam, drive.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Car, no, I'll stick by my guns.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
You have never said anything to me that way.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
No.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Adam, so have you ever had any reason to believe?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Car, are you voting me?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
No, the only thing I would say that would indicate that you had it.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Ever in any way, three dashes, could in any way be involved,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
would be the fact that you were once an applicant.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Adam, that is correct.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Car, on this other thing, then you cannot say.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Adam, it could have happened today, but I don't know whether it is this.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
The right thing that has been signed from all directions.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Car, I suppose I am putting you on the spot.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
If you say you don't know or can't know, I won't even ask you.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Adam, I know what is going on in this particular field.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
It is too hot, but our position is the same as it was in the month of meetings.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I am in no position or thought on the secretary to tell you whether she has or has not been.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Car, I will press you on it.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
If I correct me, read the transcripts of the month of February 25, 1954,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
between John Adams and Frank Carr, Mr. Lucas.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
There's one remark by Mr. Adams.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Oh, I thought that's not the way it's the last page you have there.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
So is that guy's that?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I believe you read the lawyer and the word here is friendly.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Yes, you correct.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Is that the only correction you've got to make?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yes, sir.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
And I read it correctly, except for that one change.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Yes, sir.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
Now, Mr. Lucas, they do monitor any other calls between these two gentlemen.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Mr. Adams and Mr. Carr.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
No, sir.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
The other call for monitor died.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Is it Miss Quincy?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Miss Quincy is Mr. Adams, okay.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
And Mr. Shan Bajer?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Yes, Miss Shan Bajer.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Is Miss Quincy available with us?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Mr. Chairman, I have a question for you.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
You're not going to wait until the call is over.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Yes, you will have all the other data in the next seven months.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
If you look, if you're a man in the room, then I need some questions by the way.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Miss Quincy, the L.A. is the one.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
The class A is the standard point.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
While the ceremony is going on, while we have the opportunities, let's return to our studio as a cost account.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I'll be back.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Will you state you fully, please?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I have a question for Mr. Langston.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Mr. Chairman, may they cherish the justice of the officer in the doorway?

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
I have the attention of the officer in the doorway, please.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
I ask that there are some sounds of confusion emanating from the outside of the committee,

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
when you ask those who are not in the committee room to stand back a little further from the doorway,

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
please keep a quiet space between the doorway and the audience outside.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
It's not the people inside the room and the noise is coming from the first outside.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
All right, five minutes.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
You make a big one.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Is that Miss or Miss?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Yes, yes.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
You are Secretary to Mr. John Adams, is that correct?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
That's correct.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And have been for how old?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Since October 1, 1953.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
I think it's you, an expert, just a knock on the door.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm not a writer.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I'm a secretary there, and not a cost reporter, and I can still look at that.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
Have you yet much of a little experience in taking the short-hand notes?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm about to give you a second.

07:05.000 --> 07:14.000
You consider yourself able to monitor calls and take down substantially how they'll say it in short-hand?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I didn't get every word you say in time.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Are the calls which you monitor in the transcription, which you have in front of you?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Substantially.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Will you represent substantially what we'll say?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I'll be here.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
A monitor call or transcription of a monitor call between Mr. Car and Miss Adams.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
They get much sad, 1950-fold.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yes.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Did you take that call?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I did.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
You were on the line.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I worked on the line.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And you took it down in short-hand?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I did.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
And the two gentlemen conversed.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
So, correct.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yes.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And what you hear, they are substantially what we'll say.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
What is the time of that call?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
45.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Two.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Now, I will read the copy that I hear.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
And if you call it with me and say it's my reading directly.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
The last day in March, 1950-45, 45.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
So, you, is that the first call that you hear?

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
I mean, you do not have to look.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Mr. Car, hello, my car.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Mr. Adams, yes, the moment until I get my teletype running.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
My tape, beige, my wire recorder.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Mr. Car, your recorder.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Mr. Adams, right?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Yes, Mr. Car.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Senate to sign it.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Mr. Adams, right?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Mr. Car, hello, the Senate to Dixon.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
As requested, that the thing be held off so that they can appear.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Sign it to news in Europe.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
And as expected back at any time, and Senate to Dixon.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
As he told you, so that the thing will be held off.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
The date we will agree on.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Now, that ought to take care of your situation.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Mr. Adams, right?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Mr. Car, you have to be in there.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Mr. Adams, good.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Mr. Car, I guess that is about it.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Anything?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I ain't a rep or English friend.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Am I going to hear it?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
No, I was just going to ask.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I think that that is on the little first.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I could have gotten it on March.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Two, 1950-45.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
That's about it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I have 45, I have to be here.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Thank you.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
Mr. Car, I guess that is about it, except that I was very much like to get together with you.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
So we could have a private check sometime while we have a client moment.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Mr. Adams, I will give you a ring tomorrow.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And see if we can get together then.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Mr. Car, I would like to see if we can get together.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Mr. Adams, right?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
How?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Now, is that...

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah, that correct me.

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
You read the transcriptions of the call between these two men on the date which was already indicated.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
And what car has found the track that is through the transcriptions you have?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
That was taken from your short hand notes.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
I'll get to the front.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I'll take the left.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Yes, that is back.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I'll take the left.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
You will see.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I'll take the left.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
You'll see.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I'll take the left.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I'll take the two copies from my short hand notes.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yes.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
What is the next?

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
The monitor call that you have between Mr. Car and Mr. Adams.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
A 305 and the estimated March 19th of the fall.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
March 3, 1954.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
The date following the first call.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Yes.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I will read it and I'll ask you if I read it correctly.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Mr. Adams, how are you?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Mr. Car, fine.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
John, would you arrange to have a man come here Friday morning?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
She'll ask.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
They need to leave.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
I think I'll go out with these a name of I just back in time.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And I said no objection.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I would ask.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Maybe they'll leave it there.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Any objection at all?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Anyone wants it in?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
All right with us.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
My last objection, the name of this is...

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Here's the station.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
It's cone.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
It may be better if I don't give the scripted information back to someone.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Get a full outside.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
This is all right.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
I don't give a general description.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
But if with the permission of the committee, you can stay away from name.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I'd like to inform them in theory on this.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I'd say that we'd probably be okay.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
The station that walked through the hospital.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
In a new road, sappy at the exception.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Now, Ms. Colsey are here.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Oh, me.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Left portion of Mr. Car's answer.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Or which described the person?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yes.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
There.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Mr. Adams.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
What do you want him for?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Mr. Carch.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Go.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Next here at 10 o'clock in the 50 room.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Mr. Adams, what room?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Mr. Car, 357.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I'll tell you what.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Don't have income to 357.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Send him to 101.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Mr. Adams, right.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Okay, right.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
When there's a notation,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
at the bottom of this transcription,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
this follows.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Start to reach Mr. Car 916.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
March 4, 1954.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
They're not in.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
They're not correctly read.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
They're your transcription with the exception of stating.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Or facts which would have been a fire.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
The particular man who was the subject of this conversation.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
You have.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
That's great.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
What is the next call that you hear between Mr. Carch and Mr. Adams?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
940,000.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Morning, 4 marks, 19.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
4.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Now we'll read it.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Now ask you to follow me to say,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I read it correctly.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Mr. Adams.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Frank.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Mr. Car, yes.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Mr. Adams.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Frank Car.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
How are you?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
How are you happy?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Mr. Car, I don't know why.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Mr. Adams, what is this new investigation you have started?

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Mr. Car, what we have investigated.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Mr. Adams, you have a phone.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
I understand you have been a fellow who worked for us named

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
FIX.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Mr. Car, what's for you?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Mr. Adams, what's for the Army?

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I've just heard a phone call.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
That you called him, but I can't find him.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
They will probably get in touch with me about two minutes

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
after he gets to your place.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
There's no top secret.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
You have the secret?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I don't mind you telling me.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Now it, if you're with that.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Mr. Car, it is the secret.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I continue this.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I don't think it affects the Army.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Mr. Adams, both of you affect his activities in World War II.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Mr. Car, I am being guarded because I don't want to tell you

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
it's telling you something not so.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Mr. Adams, is it in connection with someone famous a few years ago?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Mr. Car, no.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
It affects one piece of knowledge which he is supposed to have.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Mr. Adams, the trouble is, if it affects his covert operations,

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
which has been his business for the past ten years, he has stopped my law.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
Mr. Car, I would say this in the first place, so that your mind isn't used.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
So far as any new investigation is concerned,

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
it does not in any way affect the Army.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
In the second place, any information we want, there's one bit of information

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
which he is supposed to have.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Mr. Adams, you wouldn't be willing to tell me.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Mr. Car, I would be willing.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I would have to tell you the confidential status.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I can't tell you over the phone.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
You are coming over, aren't you?

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Mr. Adams, no, I have a meeting in about one minute and fifty seconds.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
The roof area is coming over.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
You wouldn't walk to a roof.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Mr. Car, please, now I am being so kinky,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Senate the Navy, and strict conference.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
All the Senate's don't know about it.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
They're held, but not in detail.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Mr. Adams, the only reason I am hit is to help.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
I employ you in such a way that they can be of help to committee.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Yet not to violate regulations in action,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
every not-answering questions.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
All in so do we get any trouble with the committee.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Mr. Car, what is your fault?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Mr. Adams, I have an un-fated meeting, you would allow it.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I can come up and see.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Mr. Car, when are you going there once?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Adams, I'll make these specific points.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Two dots.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Car, I want you to come over on other things.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Mr. Adams is growing in town.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Mr. Car, he is, but not in the office.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Mr. Adams, do you think it is better not to try?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Because he's out of the building and needs to launch.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Mr. Car, yes, where?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I prefer to do that.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Mr. Adams, you want to walk across the street to the left of the garden?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Mr. Car, good case.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Nobody goes there.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Mr. Adams?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yes.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Mr. Adams, how about meeting you at the lobby of Memphis?

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Mr. Car, go, double duty time on this.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Now, have I collected?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Go, in the chain script, you don't monitor any of the things.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
You don't monitor any of the call of March 4, 1954, 9.25 a.m.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
between Mrs. Car and Adams.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yes.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
There are no divisions in that call.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I'll make this question.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
What is there ever I want?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Not to bother.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
That means that we have other things.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Well, so you work with the mic up a little closer.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Very pleased.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
Do I look too dark to make me look at the way they are?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
There are no divisions.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't know what you're going to do.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Oh, I'm not so good at it.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Did you monitor a call?

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
Or March 5, 1954, at 5.25 p.m.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
between Mr. Car and Adams.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
You have a transcription of that call in front of you.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
I will read from my transcription and I'll ask you for.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Mr. Car.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Hello, Mr. Adams, hello Frank.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Mr. Car, John Howe.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Mr. Adams, fine how are you?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
From where the hell have you been all day?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Mr. Car.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
We had a hearing this morning and after that I went down town with Joe

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
and looked at the airport with Roy and stuff like that.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Mr. Adams, is Joe going on vacation?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Tell me the truth.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I will repeat it to the press.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Mr. Car, answer is officially no.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Mr. Adams, is he going to be back for wings to hearings?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Mr. Car, just a couple of days.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Mr. Adams, are you going to change signals on us?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Car, what do you mean, change signals?

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
Adams, we are grinding away on what it is proper to tell.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Three dots.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Car, we are giving you ample time.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Adams, in a very applicable manner.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Car, we are giving you adequate time.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Adams, are you recording this conversation?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Car, there is no sense of both doing it.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Cut tape to pinion.

18:00.000 --> 18:08.000
You cut off yours and then I cut off and when we have run and when we.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Well, evidently you don't have the whole substance of that substance.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
And when we run, we have conversation that isn't understandable.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
If I read that, it's okay.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
Mr. Adams, but I want to know, I have a couple of questions I want to ask.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Did you make any headway on what we discussed a bunch?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Car, I think.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Yes, let's put it this way.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
I will say without talking too much on phone, generally yes.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Specifically, three dots.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Adams, no.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Car, maybe in certain instances, no.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Generally yes.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
A good thing for Adams.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
For a certain instance, Car, I have another name of guy we would like to have you bring in.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Adams, what is name?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Car, what is that?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Mr. Car.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
X.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Adams, X.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Car, say, number X.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Mr. Adams, X.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Car.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
Here's of all places in gun detachment, face.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Mr. Car, Mr. Adams, what do you know about him?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Mr. Car, same type of thing, John.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Like these other people.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Adams, I see.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Car.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
We would like to request also as expeditiously as possible, the two of one's out on him and

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
we would like to have him directly to come in for a brief ejection session on Wednesday.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Adams, on our faces.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
We're both ethnic.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Mr. Car, no Wednesday morning.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
This is prior to the problem.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
One thing to tell you, Adams, I see.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Car possibility.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
This could be set back.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Put back a couple of days.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Adams, how can you do that?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Car, by no time you.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Adams, do you think you could arrange that?

19:47.000 --> 19:55.000
Car, well, maybe when I say progress, I do think definitely some progress has been made

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
along that line.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
Adams, you would be interested to know that a guy came in.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I won't tell you who.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
When you're controlled in a way or a way we were discussing until we saw things happen

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
today.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Everybody's very pleased with it.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
He is behaving in second-sector manner.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
His very hipstick.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
His arms are so good.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
For God's sake, no tell the role what I'm going to take in.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
They are considering him for leadership course.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Car, what is that?

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
Car, they take these guys that are going to leadership school for three or four weeks

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
at completion of basic before he goes into any place and go to leadership school.

20:37.000 --> 20:45.000
And the guys by the flag whenever he goes, he is the graduate of the leadership course,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
apparently good.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Three, the bus.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And God will let us travel out.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
We're going into Augustine and got a second hand in Shevvy.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Mr. Car, that is being dispeased.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
Adams, I think he was the sweetest of my big boys.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
It was the wise thing to do for his own well-being.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
They don't get used to cars much, but when he does, he goes in in a second hand Shevvy.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
Mr. Car, he has been behaving and as I told you, he has never complained.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Adams, I don't want you to tell me what I'm going to do.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Because I don't want him to think he has a commitment to leadership school.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Car, three stars.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
He will be just really to know if anyone will change other things.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Adams, what other things, what he expect us to do.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
Car, I would like to report, looks around, looks about things before.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Which part I will, Adams.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
I think all you should report is that you are going to have to change your position.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
This will only keep the EU would get whatever he is supposed to get.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Adams, I can't make any commitment to change.

21:48.000 --> 21:55.000
Reason I can't you remember trouble we got in because I spoke before I knew the numbers we'd see would have to stay in trouble.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
And Roy almost blew the roof off the building.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Car, let me ask you, is this the only way to change your position?

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
And Roy almost blew the roof off the building.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Car, let me ask you, is this thing going through?

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
Adams, I'm very pleased to be behaving at Gordon.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
The way I was trying to persuade you and Roy should behave at fix.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Car, I hope you turned off machine, quote,

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
the way I tried to persuade you and Roy, quote, Adams, why?

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
Car, with this bit, what he did to lay in it, Adams, he was in full for a fifth week of basic.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
He just won with basic about April 1st.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
I think a leadership course comes to about three or four weeks.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I think school is April 17th.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
In his math section, a leadership course is something that would be three parts,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
in two and would be done with.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
If he was selected for next school, that would be way to his town.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
It would occupy his town.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
If he graduated and did get leadership, and did go to next CRB school,

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
when he came out, would not only be CRB graduate,

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
but going to know this guy is graduated from leadership and potential non-car.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
And that is the way they go up in the car more and also,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
in other words, he is putting out.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Car, that sounds very good.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Adams, of course, four weeks does not make him an engineer.

23:29.000 --> 23:36.000
Car, but don't you tell Mr. Roy, Adams.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
I will. Car, I want a commitment on that.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Adams, reason I will.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
Car, he will start calling me, quote, what about leadership school, info.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
And Dave will start pestering to go through leadership school.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Car.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I will tell that.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I will.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
I will tell that everyone is free, and shape continues.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
And it continues for everything that works for as much as a situation

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
as I will wait there.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Right?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Adams.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Well, both of them put anyone in the arm in the way of any commitment.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
No.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
I have told you from the very beginning, we absolutely could not make a commitment.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
There's a car to tell a Roy.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Sixty times.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
If he would let the car be in the arm, it would bring him workout.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
The other lot better than if he kept on his.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Now, what?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
To talk to you about lots of eggs.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
It would go beyond the scope you told me.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Mr. Car, no it didn't.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Mr. Adams will be helpful on Mr. Car.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
Mr. Car, I would rather talk to you and drive.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I would say not too successful.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
Mr. Adams will buy a somewhat two-day two-dance to Mr. Car.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
I will say all I can tell you is it has to do with something strictly personal.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Something under civil service.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
And people get called upon something strictly personal.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Three guys.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
I don't want to talk generally on the phone, but let's get together between some time.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
Adams, Monday or Tuesday, Car, Monday or Tuesday, preferably Monday.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
On the other situation I see general progress.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
Adams, now you have eggs scheduled to come back Wednesday.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Car, that was because he wanted to.

25:21.000 --> 25:28.000
Adams, if you have him in this, why Wednesday?

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
Car, I indicated Wednesday is the day we won't.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Adams, you put off to try.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Car officially wins.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
On general situation, things does not.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Three bucks with mail.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Four dots in this position.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
In fact, much better than when I told you before.

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
Adams, I don't want to bring eggs down uniform X-wink.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Car, I let you know.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
X isn't too far.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Adams, is there possibility you know as well?

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Mr. Stevens, next week.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Car, I would say good possibility.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Car, I would say good.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Car, I would say good.
