WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
That's you, Pat, other individuals.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
I assume that the reason is that he wants to go

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
by the other individuals made fire

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
or amongst me to him.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
I try to accept his original offer.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
If he wants to go by,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
the retired and his call

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
by Mr. Corner, Mr. Coy,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm sure that I can get them to agree to have those

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
within the record that there is some very serious question

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
in my mind as further we should think

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
of all of that, and you do with the lawful case.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
The attempt of breaking the lawful,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
unless we have the call from the Ministry of Justice

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
and the Ministry of Justice,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Mr. Adams testified the other day.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I think that someone should perhaps

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
the chair should do it.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Should call the president and point out to him

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
that he's called the role that testified to

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
and there can be nothing sacred about them anymore.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
And he should be early to change his order.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I may say I think the chair might have more influence

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
than I would have.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
But I will say to Mr. Center Stamington,

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
if as he said, when the call was based,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
he's called a February 20th.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
When the base upon a call that I am in,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
he says, a minute left, call, they put in his or they put in.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I will ask counsel to go down and get those calls.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Number one, number two, Mr. Chairman.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I think we should clear out the implication

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
in Center Stamington's press.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm sure it wasn't deliberately done.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Yes, the press, my mother and I.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Mr. Colman, Mr. Curran, I had seen the document

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
which he drafted.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
I have not seen any of Mr. Stamington's documents, however.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I would like to make it clear at this time that I may

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
that we requested the defense department

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
long before Mr. Stamington did to give Mr. Jenkins

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
all of the calls by Mr. Adams,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
rather by Mr. Colman, Mr. Car,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
myself, all over the place.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Those calls for them to possession of Mr. Stamington's

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
weeks before Mr. Stamington grew up as ductymist

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
of his.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Could I get a confirmation of Mr. Jenkins?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Senator McCarthy, what you have said,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
conforms to my recollection.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Thank you.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Mr. Chairman, send a sentence.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Now let's clear this matter up once and for all.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
We thought it doesn't recognize the recommendation

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
of the counsel of this committee.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
He knows that I know that what Senator McRotten's

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
signed gave him a right to look at the call from the committee

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
members and did not give any right that the calls would be

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
published and made a point of the record for the people to see.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
That's the first point that I would like to make.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
The second is that this statement that I drafted this

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
resolution is not true.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
The resolution was presented to me out of the executive

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
hearing and I simply signed it along with everybody else.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I don't know who drafted it.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I have got the fingers tied here.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Who did drafted it?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Does anybody know?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
James and Wilk, the door.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Can I?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
That I signed it.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm beginning to wonder why it is that any question

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
I signed as long as $26 a day.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm beginning to wonder why it is a cent of a flat

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
to your two languages to put the appropriate one

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
that's not putting your call then on the democratic senator.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Why it is that he doesn't want Mr. Con and Mr. Con telephone

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
conversations in this record.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
We signed everything to put in everything.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I'll be glad to put in everything.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
When he puts in everything, not the war and not after.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Mr. Terry, Mr. Terry, Mr. Terry, Mr. Terry, Mr. Terry.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Good to meet you.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Good to meet you, Mr. Chairman.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
I would not for the world a union just as any of the

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
parties in the matter, are to any member of this committee.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
My recollection is that in the very beginning,

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
the proposition of Senator McCarthy and Mr. Con was the

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
table agreed by all monitor telephone calls to be

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
introduced in evidence provided all calls were introduced

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
between the parties and interests,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
between the members of this committee and perhaps,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
and what they be introduced in chronological order

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
or suit to that, that time.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Senator, I'll raise a motion.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Senator signing them if perhaps he is the result of a motion.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
I do not for all of us in the silent agreement to

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
that effect that proposition was made in an open

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
hearing and that proposition was confirmed in a letter to

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
me from Mr. Con, I could raise a goal in which he stated

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
as I remember that he and Senator McCarthy that we

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
were able to be introduction of these calls provided

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
they were all ever, that is calls in keeping calls

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
of certain dates which have not been given to me for

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
inspection, now for soon to ask under his attention,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm confirming what you have said today.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
The calls were delivered to be some 50 or 16 calls for

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
the purpose of this section of the monitor that I have

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
a number of last half-night determined whether or not they

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
were relevant to the issue.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
I don't think that in my, just to the best of my recollection,

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
covers the entire agency agreements, the proposition,

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
and all matters to things of those telephone monitors,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
telephone calls, is the handful of an answer given to us.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I don't know what you meant to be a nod.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I want to thank you for every member of this committee

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
and voting the senators, have signed the principles

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
of the Army side, have signed a document which I have here,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
and which does not say anything about whether or not they're

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
relevant, except we said that all calls should be put in.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
And what I'm beginning to wonder is why don't Mr. Carr,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Mr. Cohn, want their telephone conversations,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
relevant or relevant to them monitor,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
placed into the record.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
I would put this in the record again, except it's already

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
in the record.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
And anytime that the principles in this case

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
want to put the all their calls in, relevant, irrelevant,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
that have been monitored,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
body officer secretary Steven,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I will be very glad to have my calls for this.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Mr. Cohn, are you going to recognize

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
the president of the University of New York?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Have you seen some included grimd between the various parties

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
interested and recognize nobody else on the seven-step phone call?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Everybody has said three or four times,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
he definitely will stand on that.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
It wasn't getting any clearer by reputation,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
and all the concerns that you're doing is to get his own calls in

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
without any change at that.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
He doesn't care.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
He's not involved in the else he wants his calls in the record.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm sorry that I brought up this morning with the wait of the chapter.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Let me crack this.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
It's very briefly, and I would prefer a problem with the thing here.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
If you would, this is just a problem.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
This is a problem, you know.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
I will always listen and not do it like this.

07:41.000 --> 07:51.000
Mr. Chairman, the three Republicans have gone on the stand

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
that have taken the oath as to the conversations they have with Mr.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Steven, Mr. Adelman, Mr. Cohn has been on the stand

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
on the stand after about four or five days.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
He has testified and crossed the exam in regard to any conversations

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
with his last phone conversation.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
I understand I am scheduled to take the stand, Mr. Coyer scheduled to take the stand.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
We will be open to cross-contamination and attorney questions about any

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
phone calls, even though the monitoring was illegal.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
We still want to answer questions from them.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm not going to advise the senator from Missouri,

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
but I do think that the public care may wonder why he's here

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
to the front that he was not on the committee when he had the first conversation

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
with Mr. Steven, Mr. Adelman.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
Upon any, within a matter of six days, I believe it was because he came back on the committee.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
Also, conversations with my friends from Arkansas, Mr. McCollum was not on the committee.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
I know we can't speak to the senator, but I do think, I do think that regardless of the

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
committee, he will be the one for calls, right here, Senator Sunker's coming.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Senator Sunker's coming.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Senator Sunker's coming.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
You have a set of chances, but it's the same time.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Well, could I finish and move with our funder, Senator?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Just let's move on and run it to the front.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Please.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Pop this for me, Senator.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
You have to finish.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
You are canceled for me.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Talk to mine.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Senator Sunker's coming.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I think you will be, that's entirely fixed.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Which is full of verbal information.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Just give me the last thing worth.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
All right, I think everything.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I think everything, the number is coming from.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Glad to reveal the importance of this.

09:44.000 --> 09:52.000
Bill, the fact that we have accomplished nothing since my number for our phones came back on the committee.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
I shouldn't say nothing but you hearing the one which you offered and we must adjust.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
We've been tied up in these hearings every second.

10:02.000 --> 10:11.000
Your contact and by-eum, Mr. Schindler, Mr. Adams, we know they were trying to call all the hearings.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm not requesting my advice.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
I would strongly advise that you take the spam and take the oath, the same as I'm going to.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
And, for example, if you ask me to come back on the committee and I would like to know that I'm under oath,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I would also expand the title of that in my under oath.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, Mr. Schindler, I'm a commenter.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I'm not going to continue to call you.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
The misdemeanor of the state is just fact that seven of the parties made about me today.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Any board in the island asked me to misdemeanor the fact that he made free of the state about me and the hearings.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
So I'm just going to say this.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
Did I never had any telephone call with Mr. Stevens until some time after I came back on this committee?

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
And it again is amazing to me that he will go to all these actions with respect to these telephone calls.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
But all we want to do is to get into the records of calls of Senator McCliffy, Mr. Caw, Mr. Caw.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
We've all signed documents that we will put our calls in.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm not sure that we should have, but I'm glad to do it.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
We're not defendants in this situation.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
We're judges.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
But I'll be glad to put my calls in.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
So I can't just bring up the fact that this whole matter can be classified by this document right here.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And here it is, Senator.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
You're talking to your council. I think that's proper.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Here's the document.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
You sign it.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
You sign it.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Let Mr. Caw sign it.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Mr. Caw sign it.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Mr. Caw sign it.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
And all the conversations will go in the right.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
There it is.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Everybody else has signed it except you.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Mr. Caw sign it.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Mr. Caw sign it.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Senator McCliffy, you have an end to discussion.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Senator McCliffy, you have ten minutes.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
I'll let him see.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
I think I have a right answer.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
You've got to sign that.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I think I have a right answer.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
You've got to sign it.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
We must get out of this.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
He's hearing.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
You can't see.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I'll let him.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I'll let him.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I'll let him.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
That's my question.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I'll take it.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Are you in ten minutes?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm down.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
It's go out on his side.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Now, Mr. Caw, I don't try to get anybody off the hook here.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Let's get the fact.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Are you going to sign the document?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I say that he gets better.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
And if you do, Mr. Caw sign it.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Mr. Caw sign it.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Then all the conversations will be on the record.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
We can just see.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I'm going to move now.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
I'm going to.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I'm very quiet.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
I know.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Don't get it.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I can be a little more quiet.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Senator McCliffy, you are on the ten minutes.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
The chairman of the chairman is always interested in my opinion.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
And you're position.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Now, I'm interested in it too.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
All right.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Now, you're on the nine minutes.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I'm going to do my decision.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
No, no, no.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I don't want to go.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
I want to know if Mr. McCliffy and Mr. Caw and Mr. Caw

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
are going to sign this document.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Now, we'll start talking about these minor dissaulks.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
We'll put them in the record and let the people see them.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Mr. Chairman, I know what's the...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I know what's happening.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
No, let's take 15 seconds to do it.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
My position is the frame of the twers weeks ago.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
And that is that I will not allow anyone to select the situation calls that...

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
...their footprints within these trolls that follow them must be put in.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
All the trolls having a difference of controversy.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
No reason or error.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
That should not be done.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
That is my position.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I will find such a dark moment right now.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I'll make that agreement here in the record.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
And that is my position.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
And the plan is to remain my position.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I'll leave the hearing position.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
That's for them.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
And the McCliffy and Mr. McCliffy.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
And that's the main, that's the call.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
That's the record.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
And that's for them.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
And the McCliffy and Mr. Caw and Mr. Caw and Mr. Caw

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
are going to get the chairman taking two.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And the McCliffy and Mr. Caw and you have ten minutes to meet.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
I do not know.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
This is not out of my time either while the witness gets back on the stand.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
That's your answer.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
While the witness gets back on the stand while we have the opportunity to let's return to us.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
These are the downs and not realizing.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
The sonnet of the most consumable is going to be addressing the committee.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
I thought I was going down there and to give him a little advice when I make it public.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
I'm going to suggest that one of the reasons why I want to pick it up in addition to what I've already said

14:14.000 --> 14:22.000
Mr. Lucas here to testify it so that we can interrogate him also as to all of the calls.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Now, whether we get them all in the record or not,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
we can certainly identify those that are in dispute.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
And I don't want to take up all of my ten minutes time.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Finally, get these in the record.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
I was going to suggest the senator who was responsible that we're all on the take.

14:38.000 --> 14:46.000
So identify all of the calls that were monitored and also those that are regarded as they feel that this

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
presidential directive prohibits for them being interviewed.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Well, the witness that's going we'll turn back to our famous document.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Yes sir.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
And we'll start with paragraph 22.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I read from it.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
You have it.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Yes sir.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Failing in his tactics, as senior referring to Mr. Adams,

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
of having investigation posted to help him personally.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Right.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
Mr. Adams next attempted to cause the chairman and personnel of the committee to end it on the ground

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
and it was becoming personally embarrassing to Mr. Stevens,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
who was a very nice man who shouldn't be heard.

15:34.000 --> 15:43.000
Mr. Adams attempted on this place, on this, but the tempo on this place was supported by Mr. Stevens on November 6, 1953.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Is that true?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
That's true sir.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Yes.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
When the attempt was made by on November 6, 1953, was it not?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Yes.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
You had no knowledge of it at that time.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
It was a thing.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
He was attempting to get the hearing stock first on a personal basis as a favor to him.

16:01.000 --> 16:12.000
And based on that, then he injected as for the support of his argument and the attempt at persuasion or intimidation or whatever you want to turn it,

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
and other injected, the situation was respect to his most secretary's people.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
What surprised him to make a persuasion on that basis?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Yes.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Which was an ineffective, as you say.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
It was ineffective.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
What these, all these acts have proceeded now, November 6, 1953.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
What's the service?

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
So by that time you had a pretty good idea of the tactic,

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
so you referred to him here, Mr. Adams, did you not buy that thing?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh, I know he was trying to get the hearing.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
You knew that, sure.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
For that time.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Or just a weird search sent in the phone, I might say this.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
This is press release of October 19th, which he wanted sent in the McCarthy to issue saying that he was going to stop the hearing.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
It's coming.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.000


16:54.000 --> 17:02.000
Placing in that situation all that you did in his actions that you did, you were fully homeless of all of them as of November 6, 1953.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Yes sir.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
All right, and we read the rest of that sentence.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
One out of lunch in his office called of his request.

17:09.000 --> 17:19.000
He stated that if the fact he knew what was, what fact he knew was fully developed, he would have to resign as Secretary of the Army.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
There's a Secretary of Stevens or a Secretary of State.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So Mr. Adams makes that statement.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Secretary Stevens made that he admitted on this witness stand.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
There's not quite clear here as the lady.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
You state now that Secretary Stevens made that statement that he had after.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Yes, I heard him and he's admitted on this witness stand that he did.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I read the last sentence.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
The next sentence.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
He made an appeal to the end of the hearings all the ground of his personal friendship with the chairman.

17:45.000 --> 17:53.000
He was appealing to the chairman that day on the basis of personal friendship that he stopped the hearings in order not to embarrass him and compel his resignation.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Yes sir.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
That's your statement.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
That's right.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
Mr. Stevens was assured that there would be no effort to embarrass him personally.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
But the fact that there would be no work large in the investigations of hearings would continue.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Did that seem to be...

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That's right.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Did that seem to be, as he was given the Mr. Stevens at that time?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, I don't know.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
How was he still unhappy about the hearing?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Well, I would say he was still unhappy, sir.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Well, he didn't agree to that, did he?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I wasn't a question of agreement, Senator.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
I thought he wanted a lot and if he could get a little, he was happy with that.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Well, he wasn't satisfied with that as he was.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
He wanted the hearing stuff.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
There's no question about that, sir. He wanted it to start.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I understand these questions, but I might be new. Are you?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Yes sir.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
Allegations not that I'm in fine and I believe all other than any other?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, no, no.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
I'm trying to make this record from those...

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Just a...

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Number twenty-three.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
My read's coming.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
As a part of the account.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
So, what the committee's investigation of communist infiltration in the army?

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
The bad mind that all of these acts was justified by you and that has alleged here

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
are attempts to stop the investigation of communist infiltration in the army.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
Mr. Adams, frequently, and Mr. Stevens on tour occasion, offered up the Navy,

19:19.000 --> 19:28.000
their force and the defense establishment offer as substitute targets as follows.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And did he do that?

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
Yes sir. In other words, he wanted you to investigate the other branches of the military establishment,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
including the banks above him.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Just in order to get the heat all far from him or get...

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
Get someone else the substance that he does a target usually in your land.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yes sir.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Are you just to find that definite later?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I guess so.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
As far back and reading the next paragraph, as far back as off to the 13th, 1933, and our read's comment.

19:58.000 --> 20:07.000
All of our about off to the 13th, 1953, Mr. Adams suggested that the committee to go after

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
come to the Navy and our force and drop its full of communist infiltration in the army.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Is that correct?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
It's either the 13th or the 14th, sir.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I say honor.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
You want to know?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
No, honor about the 13th.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I'm pretty sure it was the 13th.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm not trying to be exact.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I guess I have to get the reality.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
It was the most one day of Mr. Jenkins'...

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
I knew it was right.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
The age of my will be another witness.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
So I'll testify to that.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I can appreciate your might be mistaken as to the exact date.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
But that is relatively the correct date.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Yes sir. There will be another witness to testify on that.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm just there.

20:44.000 --> 20:52.000
Now then, in paragraph 25, you state that all about off to the 21st.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
Mr. Adams renewed his suggestion that the committee conduct an investigation of the Navy

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
and our force and drop the investigation of his department.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Is that true?

21:03.000 --> 21:13.000
Just how many different times during the course of your friendly social relations with Mr. Adams?

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
Did he urge you to drop the investigation of the army

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
and the Association of Communists into it and make the Navy and the Air Force

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
and the Defense Department of New York Target?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
How often did he do that?

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
Senator McCroellen, I can't give you the exact number of times because I know that there were occasions

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
when he did want us to stop and go after somebody else.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
But I can't recall a specific occasion.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
There are some I recall so much other people who are here to recall.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
We try to set forth those specific though other inhibitions.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
Let's go then to the next paragraph, paragraph number 26, to make you specific again.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
This is all there about November 6, 1953.

21:57.000 --> 22:04.000
Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams suggested that the Navy, Air Force and Defense Establishment's offer

22:04.000 --> 22:10.000
would be a corporate object of an investigation instead of our administration of the army.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
And Mr. Adams, all for to supply information about them.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Is that true?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yes sir.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
That is true.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yes sir.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I'll go on to the next one and then we'll come back for it.

22:22.000 --> 22:30.000
On our about November 14, 1953, Mr. Adams advised that in his opinion the time was right

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
for the investigation to turn to the Navy. Is that true?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yes sir it is.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
On our about November 17, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams,

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
a new fabric vest that the Subcommittee should investigate the Navy and Air Force.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Is that true?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Yes sir.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I think you have the same thing in number 49.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
On our about November 30, 1953, Mr. Adams made its specific suggestion on all four of the systems.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
In switching the committed tools, from his departments to another branch of the service.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Is that true?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Yes it is.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
On our about December 30, on our about December 9, Mr. Adams again urged that the Subcommittee

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
to begin to investigate security risks in the Air Force.

23:11.000 --> 23:20.000
And all four specific information in return for certain information he desired to us.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
I guess he means desired to give us.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
No, desired promise.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
I think it should be said.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
What?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Desire.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Plumber instead of two of us.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Uh.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Desire, it might be desired to use.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Well, whichever it is.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Yes sir.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Last one on the top is our type of personnel.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Make the plan out of it.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Then four stallings for the investigations of his department.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yes sir.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Longer number 31.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
As a further part of Mr. Adams attempts to impede the investigation,

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
he sought to finish those who for operated with the Subcommittee

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
and the silas those who were about to for operate.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Is that true?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
It is.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Now that's answer by.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
So it's just what actually did.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Who?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
He attempted to punish.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Yes sir.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
First it was all stories.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
I would say sir the question to example about would be,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
yes.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
No important.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I say to them across the class of example would be general,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
law, major general, courtesy, law, commanding general.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
That's what my student has been first to general law.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yes sir.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Who has explained that and then tell us any other.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yes sir.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
I don't know sir if you want me to repeat all of the testimony concerning general law

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
and the details in the next two part.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I don't care about all of the details.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Just enough to make this short.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
So what we're talking about.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
All right sir.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
So as far as general law and his concern, Mr. Adams was present on October 14th

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
and very general law and testify that until this committee came along,

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
he had had no success in his efforts to get security risks and people with communist records

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
and a radar laboratory.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
So that point on Mr. Adams made it very clear that general law and had displeased him

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
and had likewise displeased Mr. Stevens by making by stating that Mr. Stevens

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
had been garlic in performing his duty and getting these people out.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
They tell me my time is up and says I want back your two or three other questions at this point.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
If you've answered now as the general law and he's the principal key.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
He was the principal.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
I will tell you about it.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
We'll come back to it.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Sure.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
It has an adoptive.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
And this honor, Mr. Chairman, I really want to ask the questions alive.

25:32.000 --> 25:40.000
And one last, that's yesterday in order to give the Mr. Wolf to all the family needs

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
for close examination.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I'll wait my time as this guy.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Let me just...

25:44.000 --> 25:51.000
Mr. Cohn, I want to reverse now if I might to not too fall for the moment.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Come back to that, maybe a little later.

25:55.000 --> 26:02.000
But I would like to revert now to the document you offered in evidence from Mr. Couch.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Yes sir.

26:03.000 --> 26:11.000
You stated on page 3898 if you have that candy there for Mr. Julianne.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I'm sorry.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
3898.

26:13.000 --> 26:20.000
But this document contained information and I quote.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
About the number of communists in the military containing information about various things

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
for communists have done to get their members in the military.

26:31.000 --> 26:38.000
Come, in radar laboratories and explaining why it was essential for the communists.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
For purposes of espionage, sabotage.

26:41.000 --> 26:48.000
For the purposes of recruiting other people in the military into the party to bring about this infiltration.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Yes sir.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Now I want to ask you this.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
Where is there any information about communist infiltration into the radar laboratories in that state?

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
Well, I know we discussed with Mr. Couch, then the Jackson communists infiltration in the signal core and in the radar laboratories.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
Now, but it's not the use that you're referring to the document.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And I read the document.

27:10.000 --> 27:17.000
Now, the document is maybe interesting from a historical standpoint.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
So I think when I I consider.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Yes, certainly.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Thank you.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
It's very possible that this discussion about signal core and radar laboratories is not embodied in the document.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
I don't know.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I have not read the document in full lately.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Here, now I have on page 3898.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Your testimony of pop the page.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Yes, sir, you read that to me.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
There was committed to this committee and will not be part of it.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
It was complete.

27:44.000 --> 27:52.000
There was committed to this committee a somewhat detailed memorandum which I have here, sir, and will not read from.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I did read from it.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
Containing information about the number of communists in the military.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
Containing information about various things the communists had done to get their members in the military.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
In radar laboratories.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
Now, you were referring to the document and that's what you mean.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Yes, sir.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
I apologize if I threw you up.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
So I think the documents start there more than 1000 communists in the armed forces of the United States today.

28:17.000 --> 28:25.000
Prepare to carry on as being I sabotage any kind of disruptive activities during war war between the Soviet Union and this country.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
So I am not red this in detail.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Yes, sir.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Excuse me, sir.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
Excuse me if there's not contained specific information about communists in the signal core or radar laboratory.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
I'm sure you're right.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
I know that we did get such information from Mr. Krauch.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
But it's not in this particular document I am in erratiatic.

28:45.000 --> 28:58.000
No, as a matter of fact, Mr. Kahn, you go back to the document because you did make a considerable reference to it in your testimony.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I don't believe I did, sir.

28:59.000 --> 29:08.000
As they start, one of the software in evidence and it's the only memorandum that we have in evidence that indicated the time when the investigation of the Army started.

29:08.000 --> 29:18.000
I thought you were offering us for that purpose and to give the committee a general background of information that you had with reference to communists in filtration in the Army.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
So I think you're right.

29:19.000 --> 29:28.000
The first time I've done an ejection, I think I made it clear on the record the importance attached to that particular document was the fact that it established a date in which we had underweighed and investigated.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
I mean, that's the case.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Okay, now let me ask you this.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
There's a two that's going through this document of Krauch.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
The most of it relates to his trip to Europe.

29:40.000 --> 29:46.000
I mean to the Soviet Union in 1927 and 1928.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
I would like to ask Mr. Eiffel to remain the Mr. Will.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
So this is on my time.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I know.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
I know.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
I know.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I think Mr. Chairman, I'll wait for you.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Mr. Chairman, I'll yield.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Mr. Will's might have got a conference over something, and I think this is the chair.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
And I would like to have him make a statement on it.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Mr. Chairman, one more game.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Well, I'll give it a little bit of a business report.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
A very delicate.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Mr. Will's may make a statement. It will not be out of your car.

30:13.000 --> 30:23.000
Mr. Will's, Mr. Chairman, I'm under the impression that what I have to say, which is about which I have to be quite thoughtful as I phrase it, Will Davis.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Well, good news.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Good.

30:25.000 --> 30:33.000
When we start as a case, I think it will be remembered that I offered an telephone conversation in evidence.

30:33.000 --> 30:45.000
Senator McCarris says in simple English that he would not consent to any single-monitor telephone call going in evidence unless every telephone call

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
between every party and interest and between people like Stevenson Adams on the one side.

30:52.000 --> 30:58.000
And for example, Stevenson Lawson, and even other ones, will go in.

30:58.000 --> 31:06.000
And he is, consistently, I must say, unfairness to him, may not be that good.

31:06.000 --> 31:16.000
I would like to be ex-cultated if anybody thinks there was a purposeful delay in delivery to the monitor telephone call to Mr. Jenkins' counsel.

31:16.000 --> 31:26.000
I must say, I am sure Mr. Jenkins will say that he and I were so busy with work those days to be getting them out sorted and can deliver them like that.

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
I am sure he will quickly say there was no plan to delay their delivery.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
And could you just keep it enough to say that, Mr. Jenkins?

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Well, so now, please subscribe to that strike.

31:37.000 --> 31:47.000
Now, at half my interest, of course, at time, while we occasionally have heard in this room about what is going to happen to the telephone call,

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
the president's directivization.

31:51.000 --> 32:01.000
President McCarris was a lawyer and I, and I think Mr. Jenkins, agrees that that directive is pending in this area.

32:01.000 --> 32:11.000
And makes it no longer possible that every telephone call between every person can be in delivery.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
I know that it is going to say whether they are glad or sorry or anything else. That is just the fact. That is what has happened.

32:18.000 --> 32:26.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, if we bring Mr. Jenkins up and two other people and that is assurred to what is going to go.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Thank you.
