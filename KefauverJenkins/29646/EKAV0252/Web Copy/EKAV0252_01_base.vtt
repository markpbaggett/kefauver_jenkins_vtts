WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm getting a commission for two days at time.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
No, not not not.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
My name is Mr. Vite.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Can I go leaving the community?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
No, very good.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
We are coming for days.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
For the invitation first, there will be several organizations.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
If you'd like, I'll put them out.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
You'll explain to them, they're having a way.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
How are you doing about it?

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
No, I don't think they're my office anymore than the most.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Two minutes, I suppose.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Didn't you tell him to keep Mr. Collins' office?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
I don't think so.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
You don't think so?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
I don't think so.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
You're the next and he's definitely excellent.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll just leave it to him if you don't think so.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
No, I can say Mr. Jenkins, I don't think that's all I'm wrong.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
You don't think you told me that, no?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
I will ask you if you remember our medication Mr. Collins coming in.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm joining in the conversation.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
And Mr. Collins,

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
starting upon this generally important defeat in January commission of the Commission of the United States.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
This don't happen in our center.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Mr. Jenkins, I hate to document your questions when I frankly don't.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
With color, any kind of legislation,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
we must have color and mystery,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
but it's completely unimportant meeting.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
The five-hour concern is very brief.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm reading some different page 24 of the record.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Can you leave it?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
The month that time as I recall it was a few minutes late,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
so I initiated my conversation with the Senator.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Mr. O'I. Coon came in the room.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Mr. Collins, so emphasized this.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Now for the day and hour.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Robes, seems to have a phenomenal memory of the great conversation.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I do not tell that memory. All I can say is I don't.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
All I remember is that conversation with the governor.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
The American is that I asked if the liaison man come up.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I didn't know who he was.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I thought it was the general plan.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
When he came, I gave him the outline.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Mr. Collins, back down, the fact that he was the college graduate.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
The running of the president of a hotel corporation.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
He had been a lieutenant, a lieutenant in the lieutenant, served in Korea.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
And I asked for one of the circumstances.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
He should apply for a commission, whether it be federal one.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Mr. Ripper says yes, he would be in federal one, so I said good.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
When I was, when you explained to him, Dave and I think Roy was there,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
how did you avoid it?

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
That's the last conversation I had with Ripper as far as I know.

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
Senator, did you hear one of the recent fiscal year-assets of the administration?

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
Well, the level of private government that you have, you still do not know.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
Call him on 43 occasions, maybe inside.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
This is the site of the direct commission for the young man.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I heard him testify.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I frankly don't recall what he testimony was with me.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
I said that as far as I knew, I had no further contact with him.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
But then he says, now he's getting briefed to page 30.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
He's getting briefed to page 30.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm going to check him like that.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
He's getting briefed to page 30.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
So, 38.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
He made it happen.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
He's getting briefed to page 30.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
What about the state senator?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
General Ebert says that.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Life's over.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Fucking gnar about please.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I should bring that upon me, Army.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Something that's not.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Something that we're going to ask you special for this one private.

04:11.000 --> 04:21.000
General Ebert embraced the code from a custom at least 17 July until the end of the month.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
A welcome at the 30th of the one July in this connection.

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
I also received a free telephone call directly from the senator on the same situation.

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
That senator is the direct and policy testimony of General Ebert

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
that you not only on July 8th, out for a direct commission position, man.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
But for at least two and maybe three more times, saying that same month.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
You call him.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
And I, the public, about the public that he was making to the end of getting a commission policy thought.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
1840, 1840, 1850.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
Mr. Dixon, to the bus of my knowledge, I had no contacts with River except that one day he was in the office.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
To the bus of my knowledge, I made no phone call to him.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
Now it's possible he may be mistaken that if someone in my office was a call or someone we have called him, I don't know.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
But I am reasonably certain that if I had called him, I would remember that.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
And if you are not, they'd be certain about it, senator, as we get from your anxious.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, I can't be a dead person, but anything that happened a year ago.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
But in fact, I can see me, United States Senator.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Talk to this general, who is the liaison officer between the Army and the Senate.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
At least three times.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
About eight times.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
About a man who was in a civilian.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Don't you recognize?

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
In and if it's to get a commission, a direct commission brought.

06:08.000 --> 06:18.000
Then going to the Army, then the bodies, in surprise, this right system turned over to a million thousands of other boys going in every day.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
That would have been some considerable pressure.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Some pressure to save the police.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
The Army is being invaded by the Army.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You might say, couldn't it?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, the Dragonless.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
If it isn't, I don't say it today.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
If it isn't, then I'm saying you don't deny it.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
You say you don't remember it.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, I'm not saying it.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
But it is true.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
There are new situations.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
The most significant of the proofs that I did not.

06:50.000 --> 07:00.000
There's a fact that I not only told Secretary Stevens that it rolled him and told him to lean over backwards.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
And not to give shine anything to, but even appear to be a threshold consideration.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
What I'd like me to say was, my family's attention.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
That was unfair to Mr. Shine.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
So when I was saying we know the backwards, that's what that meant.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Don't give him what you give me normal graphics.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
I did it however, in the presence of Mr. Shine, in the presence of Mr. Cohns.

07:26.000 --> 07:34.000
And that is a complete contradiction of anything here within an intricate pressure on me.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Mr. Jenkins, the moniker's phone call.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
My man, my fellow.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
The moniker's phone call.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Or I don't like eavesdropping.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
I think those moniker's phone calls form the very valuable service.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
If you expect that moniker's call, you will find that I land the fest.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Don't give days anything that you wouldn't give any other private in the fact.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I get in free reasons for that.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
Now, my attitude to redemption did not change during all the spirit of time.

08:07.000 --> 08:18.000
I knew that if anyone in my committee would get anything that appeared to be any special consideration.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
That everything would break loose.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And my efforts were not to get something for him.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
But to make sure that he would not get something that would appear to be any special consideration.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
That's in there.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
So, I have to argue you take some now.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
I think you are fine clean.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I don't argue with you.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm up to high school.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
You are too good.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I want high school.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And we get to this.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
Said we should have seen about the phone calls to the secretary and others in which you made your position clear.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Including the call of November 7th.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
But why here is this general?

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, certainly, certainly no moody response.

09:06.000 --> 09:14.000
You didn't take that on the part of General Reaver to say that I call for you because you were the senator MacArthur.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
Mr. Jenkins, I will not go into the question of murder.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I think it's not important.

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
I will say that my staff had great difficulty with his brother over in Germany.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
I don't argue with him of me hearing him proper because of all I can tell you.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't argue with that to the very best of my recollections.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I only had one contact with Reaver.

09:45.000 --> 09:54.000
I am, I think, completely certain that if I had any other contact, I would remember.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
So, that's all I can tell you.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Did you know Senator?

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
Well, from July 8th to the latter part of July 8th, Mr. Roy Cohn calls General Reaver a number of times.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
A lot of these commissions were signed.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I don't know him.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm going to call Reaver.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
These are the call Reaver.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Going with the money on my foot.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I don't think so.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't think so.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm going to call Reaver.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
We're talking now about really not just from the official being bought.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Did you say he's so touched about our own money?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Nah, I don't know.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
What a lady for you.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Age 38, that's 38, Sarah Reaver.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm Mr. Lincoln.

10:36.000 --> 10:45.000
But going back, when this person up until the end of July receives numerous calls from Mr. Cohn,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
urging speed in this state.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
I'm urging you to be able to reserve the soonest possible.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
Now, Senator, Mr. Cohn will bring your chief counsel, but he was kind of...

11:00.000 --> 11:10.000
And you're an honest man, just about a year, that from July 8th to the very first of June, until the end of the month,

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
he receives numerous calls from Mr. Cohn, urging speed and brother.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
In answer to my question, he's going to leave us there as soon as I could only make an estimate, Mr. Lincoln.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
Because, of course, I did not see the record of those telephone calls, but I would say that at times,

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
I would see since these telephone calls a day.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
Senator McCracken, for two things, the theft was the duty.

11:44.000 --> 11:53.000
I was in the Army, or making the Army's conscious of the fact that there was a boy, a woman,

11:53.000 --> 12:02.000
who looked up in the United States, the first speaking to the Army through your mouth, through your first.

12:02.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm in line again over that period of some twenty-two days, calling this General of the Army

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
and impressing upon him the importance of giving this boy a commission.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Speed, speed, wasn't that Senator in your opinion,

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
certainly making the Army quite conscious of the fact that you were interested in your fact

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
was interested rather in ordinantly inviting this boy, commission, to to to to to to to.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
As I have been, Mr. Jenkins, you are showing that much of your reddold,

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
the truth with the columns of the government, that you are exaggerating.

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
Ladies, Mr. Cohn, tell you that he's this call generally bill as I remember he said he did senator.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
I don't die during the month of July, I'll be taking the screen in the month of July.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
Well, he didn't really well have, I just have to know whether or not this is a

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
a graduate or not, he says, go for a graduate.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Go for a graduate, right?

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Did you know senator McKracking?

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
Congress of the Lawyer is going on in the hearings, we're going to be turning up.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
The U.M. television network is bringing to you to the facilities the Army McCarthy Subcommittee hearings.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
2000 hours, first station hour.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
Overweights, got no pass, who is those guys getting there?

13:43.000 --> 13:50.000
Due to the president's speech related, now in the transport workers union around Able to telecast it.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
It's the same time that he's channeled for the voice of fire so,

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
the old favorite constant program on the United States 30 on track.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Call General Rebirth.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
15 times longest.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
They're being their record on local call.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
Over that period, I thought this is the general sense of time.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Do you know when it's possible, President?

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
What Mr. Shine and Mr. Coen, who have had with General Rebirth,

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
he is on a turn in who I am to stand up, nothing whatever to do with.

14:29.000 --> 14:38.000
The work of the committee, accepted the discussion with him, made shine and a commission today shine.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
I'm a committee general at work.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Jenkins, say whether or not he told me.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
14 longer than I thought it would be.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
I'm getting a look at these charts for the credit credit funds.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
If you say that the record shows the first 13 polls, we don't need to have a chart for that.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
They're really not out here.

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
The media is saying, Mr. Jackson, as chairman of the government operational committee,

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm going to find out at some time who is drafting these unmet support.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
I heard that if you have a phone call for spread,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
15 minutes, if you have a phone call for spread with the Jackson,

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
another, this is not your work, if a phone call for spread, that's sufficient.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
You say there are 13 phone calls for, they'll take you word for it.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I see that.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Now, Senator, I think you're both out of the point.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
What's your point, what do you call?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
13 times from the 10th day of July.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I see you talk to the brown age of July.

15:42.000 --> 15:51.000
Since the 29th of July, our 19 days nearly call every day from calling shine long distance.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
This day nothing of any of us will call just over any five, 20th of August.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I'm calling 6.50, talking about eight.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I'll ask again for that, and I will say Mr. Jackson,

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
if you were applying for a commission, if I were the liaison officer,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm charged with advising people applying for a commission,

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
and if you were being sure that it's an important command to next command,

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
the white command, the weak command, I think you would tell me in front of what do I do now, General.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I think I'm not a general.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't play 13 calls with a few men in 19 days, Senator.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
No, I don't play 13 or 11.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
It's practically equivalent of a call from some of the leaders of the former county.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Every time Mr. O.I. am home calling.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
No.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
In view of his, I've been a good review.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
No, that's no much.

16:46.000 --> 16:53.000
Mr. Reaver knew that there was taking and retaking examinations.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
He was being shifted from one place to the other upon the advice of Mr. Reaver.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
For example, I know you had to go to New York or someplace taking examinations

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
for the full commission of transport to man different places.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
And the logical things in the due, they call Mr. Reaver,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
when one gets there with the equivalent of McCarrick calling,

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
the interest, you know, because one made a very clear of the reaver to Steven.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
I don't know when you'll find out that I didn't want any special consideration for this young man.

17:28.000 --> 17:35.000
I went further, I advised them that they would get a lot of unsavable citizens

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
if they gave me many special considerations.

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
Did you move the senator out to a secretary's team in the foreign commission for the day of charge?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
No, sir.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
You heard the secretary's testimony on whether or not they did not think it.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I heard he's testimony.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
You heard the testimony that up at least on one occasion,

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
you asked him to give to this young man a commission with me on it.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Is that right?

18:02.000 --> 18:09.000
The secretary's restriction of the total supply, I discussed the first new commission

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
with the secretary of the Cheyenne department in New York.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
At that time, I was very, very positive in advising the secretary

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
to the VIA and I used the word,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
we know about backwards.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
We know about backwards.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
The avoidance, giving the evils, was my precondition.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
My new enemies and our enemies are special considerations.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
And there were witnesses there for that.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
I wrote him a letter and suggested a French letter to France.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Thank you.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
But still, I don't want to go off.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Why are you repairing the six day of the army?

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
And others, the mean-over backwards to the nothing-fine.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
The fact remains that these two members of your staff

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
are all generally for 13 times in 19 days.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Mr. Zengen, is there a special commission for this?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Well, that's a few 50 times.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Mr. Zengen, if you say they call 13 times, I know that you're completely frivolous.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
There's no doubt about the fact they call 13 times the field of calls there.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
May I say that I don't know what the study about time that I would say

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
but a man with a fine for a commission, making various examinations,

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
following applications, various departments of the army,

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
13 calls would not be too many calls.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Why are you making this, Mr. Zengen?

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
That I have gotten calls, I think it's many 1520s.

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
From the wire, this month, their husbands can get pipes at this side of that sort of thing.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Even though I tell them the first time there's nothing they can do.

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
In this case, the officers of two rebuts said yes, you are entitled to a commission.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
He said that positively in the office, you're entitled to a commission.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
And then they were shifting Dave from place to place,

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
and they were taking examinations, and it would be only logical that he would call him a number of times.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
Now whether the number of the five or 15, I don't know.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
I'm talking now, since I'm in the office about the months and two hours.

20:33.000 --> 20:41.000
Well, Mr. Pairing, there was at least one conversation between you and Weber

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
and he's been in the same common time in research.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Mr. Zengen's like an odd nothing of what I thought.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
During the months and few hours, and I was talking about whether or not,

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
in office conduct, there's been a charge to rise there for it to get this boy some space.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
He's keeping him over to me, and the other targets for the Army.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
Do you think there's any explanation, whatever, of how is your man?

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
Will be so bright, God's over to have Mr. Zengen.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Will be so bright, this is cold.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
The things that I haven't seen, shall I come over and hold up my hand?

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
They're winning, can I come over and hold up my hand?

21:22.000 --> 21:28.000
Do you know the reason why they shine, with the many things that's how he's exactly?

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Mr. Zengen was first, when we said that,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
there's time for us to come here at a twenty-long time, I've never seen him rise.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
I think it's the most modest young man I've seen, you've seen him on a witness's hand.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
What's the thing?

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
I'm not even ready to throw it all the right things with me.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I did it, number one, I don't know whether you've said it.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
Number two, if you're standing holding, you can get your commission tomorrow,

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
but he might roll up, fall off, sometimes when I come over, which one in?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
That's holding up my hand.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
But when he's here, does somebody tell him that he's the jail?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Mr. Zengen's your death, then.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
He didn't go?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
No.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Mr. Zengen's I know nothing about the, as we matter after...

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
When you heard this yesterday morning here, Senator?

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Ah, on the five hour drive, did they answer your questions, no?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
There he is, no.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
That you don't know why he shouldn't say anything over and over my hand.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
Do you know somebody who the women's young man gets over, and the family's arms over his hand?

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
I mean, the commission's been in there.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
And he was called, he was asked to fill out an application,

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
like he was calling for him, I mean, like he's hardly been called for him.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Do you know something, but he was not my favorite.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I like the official.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
So, this is Orange Gagging.

22:52.000 --> 23:00.000
In Part 3, filled out an application, leaving out substantial parts of it,

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
as though it were not important, and that his general in the army had the calling that's been getting back

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
and having come back over there at a later date, and really fill out his other application,

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
such as fill out, an application, a form, for a commission in the army.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
I don't know the slightest thing about the application.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
Oh, one thing about that, and the numbers, never saw anything about it.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Oh, I heard the person want to hear that, though.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Where's the little arrow next to this question,

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
with further reference to the upper scene, the something,

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
and extra ordination, especially for this part?

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Did you know all that?

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Your chief counsel, and finally advised us,

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
that the victory of the army,

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
that no commission was before coming for this boy,

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
went to the department of state,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
and talked to General Walter Beade Smith,

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
about him just feeding him using his high office.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
He just got things done for the gentleman.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I'm informed by an I-Chin Council,

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
and he's never informed by the army that he was not getting a commission,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
but that the cause of the...

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
Did they know the difficulty encountered between Ruth Noribis brother

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
and Mr. Shann, Mr. Cohn,

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
in Europe, Mr. Cohn, Con fact, Mr. Smith,

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
and I think Mr. Smith will testify to him out.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Now, Con fact is him to make sure that,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
not that he gets special consideration about that,

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
no matter go through the regular channels,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
and if he were entitled to commission when he get them,

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
I think that's a perfectly proper thing for a man,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
a different friend, and life-based, you know,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
sort of stuff, but I wrote,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
now here to be,

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
he is one talk in July.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Now, the Secretary of the New Concentrate,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
to General Beade,

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
he, apparently, are 13 long-distance telephone conversations,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
to General Beade Smith, I remember,

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
if you start to say anything of local calls,

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
is the word of local calls,

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
then I don't think they're wearing the hour and a half.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
Then here is General Watt-Walders,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Beade Smith,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
saying this, Senator,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
say 147 of the transcripts of Mrs. Cailin

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
that first month is July.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
The day's day, July 31st, day, July.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Making a plan,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
making this scene this week,

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
effort to overact on behalf of this young man.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Here's General Smith talking with the cone telephone,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
he's telephone me on this,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
and July 31st,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
he stated that Mr. David Cheyenne

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
of the committee's path was about to be drafted,

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
on the team with the cone and many democracies.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
So, my two-line senator,

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
there's the He-Shin-O-Havardalic commission,

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
so we're taking care of them qualified by education,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
and the reason the fact that during the last blow

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
he had as a civilian employee,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
held the Trumps in the first 20-wank of the Senate.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
I asked Mr. Coyne and White came to me,

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
but would you give him a pay?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Yes, please, please, 147.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I asked Mr. Coyne and White came to me,

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
as I was no longer an action military service.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
Do you reply to the Army aside as it's not been cooperating you?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
The General read where a commissary

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
for a commission from Mr. Cheyenne and has not done so.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
But I knew all the senior officers in the Pentagon

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
and with those who just walked in.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Senator?

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
I'm talking to you now about the event,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
so July, the month of July,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
you stay on for the 31st of years

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
and are what are beautifully been annoying, I'm sure.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And you know all that he's a man of running

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
teachable character reputation, don't you?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
I'm holding a high position in this administration.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
And the veterans of the Army have needed to do some 40 or 50 years

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
saying, uh, Roy Coole.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
On the last day of that first month,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
when we knew this boy was going to be dressed,

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
it said, here,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
shines about to be dressed in the...

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
He must be in the driver with the Pentagon,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
I want you to use your English to get in the commission.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
And Senators goes the former car they want to see.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
Now Senator, I'm not asking you whether it happened or not.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
But if you like, see it happen.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
These events are just one month only.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Senator?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I am looking.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Please, whether or not is it committee.

28:05.000 --> 28:12.000
In your opinion, that would at least make secretary students

28:12.000 --> 28:20.000
conscious of the fact that a United States senator

28:20.000 --> 28:28.000
and his staff had an unusual interest in getting this boy

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
some kind of a commission in with some rank in the Army

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
a lot of the inception of his service.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
Don't you think Senator McCartney, in all fairness,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
that's some of those activities.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
I've got one month alone to say nothing of what followed subsequent revisions.

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
To take care of the Army was justified in saying that

28:56.000 --> 29:05.000
him, suffer, him, suffer activities will go up to by upon

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
unusual activities in getting a commission for the young men.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Wouldn't it be just society that Senator,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
if all findings and in all this conscience will go to the larger folks

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
being present for the larger folks in the two parts.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
First, Mr. Adams, any attempt that they have shy in any other young man

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
makes the gotta commission as long as he does the best

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
and the only one that's completely proper.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
Years on, any other young man who tries to get a commission,

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
tries to get a worse point, anapolis, five-have-you,

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
for the perfect rights to do it and I know some young men have been trying for five years

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
to get into anapolis.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
There's nothing improper about that and how many phone calls they make.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I don't know how many phone calls Mr. Shion made.

29:53.000 --> 30:02.000
I say it was very, very clear to all those involved that I was asking for no special consideration

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
with suggestions that has made very clear by the monitored phone calls.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Phone calls I didn't know would be monitored.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
And let me quote General Smith on page 155.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
He was asked the question by Mr. Jenkins.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
The final question.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
Do you regard anything said by Mr. Stone to you?

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
And either of the two occasions you mentioned are being improper.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
General Smith, I do not.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Now General Smith doesn't think there's anything improper.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
I certainly wouldn't think of that as an ass again.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
There's nothing I can add to this, Mr. Jenkins.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
I think it was except that I made it clear to the Secretary of the Army,

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
both verbally and in writing,

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
that my advice to him was to lean over backwards,

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
and I just like having to repeat this over and over,

31:04.000 --> 31:11.000
lean over backwards, not to give Mr. Shion anything with the fear to be any special consideration.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
They knew that for never any question Mr. Adams-Meyon,

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
or Mr. Stevens-Meyon,

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
you'll note that Mr. Adams on a stand never once testified as I recall

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
that he thought that I was looking for any special consideration for Shion.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Now I'm a team member, I hope I'm direct to that.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
But be radar as it may,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
let me quote some letter of December 22nd.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
And this is the position I took so long.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
As soon as Bob Stevens, I'll leave out the first two paragraphs here, Bob.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
So I'm inclined to agree that Mr. Shion would never have been drafted,

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
except because of the fact that he worked for my committee.

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
I want to make it clear at this time that no one has any authority to request any consideration

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
for Mr. Shion, other than what other drafts he has guessed.

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
I think it is extremely important that this thing made very clear

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
in view of the present investigation which our committee has given.
