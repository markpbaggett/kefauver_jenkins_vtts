WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
I'm still quoting.

00:04.640 --> 00:11.280
Let me repeat what I have said to you before the course of this investigation will in

00:11.280 --> 00:20.600
absolutely no way be influenced by the armies handling the case of any individual regardless

00:20.600 --> 00:26.320
of whether he works for our micimuth or not, with kindness regards I am sincerely your

00:26.320 --> 00:27.320
Joe.

00:27.320 --> 00:36.320
And then Mr. Selen, I mean Mr. Jenkins, I want to call attention about Mr. Selen's

00:36.320 --> 00:37.320
side.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
Here's a matter I should know.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.320
And they may just finish this if I may, Mr. Glowhead.

00:41.320 --> 00:47.040
Mr. Jenkins, I know these answers may seem long, but we're going over this ground so often.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.320
I'm trying to give you all I know about it.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.320
I'm page 5311.

00:50.320 --> 01:00.760
Secretary Stevens is talking to Senator Saintington about the claim that there was some special

01:00.760 --> 01:04.720
influence exerted to get some special consideration.

01:04.720 --> 01:10.640
He says I personally think that anything in that line would prove to be very much exaggerated.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.640
That is my opinion.

01:12.640 --> 01:17.560
In other words, I think there's been some talk around that has been very much exaggerated

01:17.560 --> 01:19.520
over anything that is there.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.840
I am the Secretary, and I have had some talks with the committee and the chairman and

01:23.840 --> 01:25.240
so on.

01:25.240 --> 01:30.720
And by and large as far as the treatment of me is concerned, I have no personal complaint.

01:30.720 --> 01:36.520
He says another word when we got after his liquor, of course, then I highlight, but as

01:36.520 --> 01:42.520
far as I personally am concerned, I don't have a lot of stuff so far as my contact with

01:42.520 --> 01:44.520
Joe or the committee is concerned.

01:44.520 --> 01:50.520
Mr. Jenkins just finally let me tell you that I have gone over this over and over and

01:50.520 --> 01:54.120
over with my staff after these threats.

01:54.120 --> 02:01.120
By Mr. Adams's may, I've discussed this in the greatest detail with Mr. Cohn, and as

02:01.120 --> 02:07.720
far as I know, there was not one eye open of improper influence.

02:07.720 --> 02:13.720
Mr. Smith says, I would admit to Mr. Cheyenne as any young man has been able to do.

02:13.720 --> 02:18.280
Took all the examinations that he thought he could take.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.320
He contacted Mr. Weber to find out how to take them.

02:21.320 --> 02:26.920
There's no question that Mr. Cheyenne wanted a commission that he was not seeking for our

02:26.920 --> 02:29.440
committee and everyone involved knew them.

02:29.440 --> 02:36.080
And Senator, there is no question, but what you wanted, they should be prescient, is there?

02:36.080 --> 02:40.080
Mr. Johnson General Weber about it on G.I. 8, then if you hadn't wanted it, you wouldn't

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
have talked to him about it.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.080
You have been demand.

02:42.080 --> 02:46.080
No, I'm going to cancel that for you, Mr. Jenkins.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.080
I asked Mr. Weber for the reason title of the commission.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.080
Mr. Weber said he unquestionably was.

02:54.080 --> 03:00.080
Then when the question arose as to whether or not he might, not be entitled to a commission.

03:00.080 --> 03:06.080
In talking to Mr. Stevens, the first time I ever talked to Mr. Stevens about this.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.080
After the, there was some question of whether he's entitled to a commission.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.080
I said, Bob, lean over backwards.

03:13.080 --> 03:20.080
And don't give him a commission unless you are sure he is entitled to it.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.080
Unless you are sure he is justified in getting that commission.

03:23.080 --> 03:29.080
And Mr. Cheyenne as president, Mr. Cohen as president, and I may have by that conversation,

03:29.080 --> 03:32.080
I have done a grave injustice to Mr. Cheyenne.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
I don't know.

03:33.080 --> 03:44.080
He may have gotten a commission if I have an urgency secretary to be ten times certain before this young man got a commission.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.080
And all the time your chief counsel was talking near the way.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.080
No, no.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.080
You can say no to that.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.080
Right.

03:53.080 --> 04:00.080
But suddenly you will say that all during that time you were investigating the virtues in the Army one day.

04:00.080 --> 04:05.080
And you say that the secretary's did not want that done.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
Right.

04:06.080 --> 04:11.080
You say that the secretary is truthful and is honest.

04:11.080 --> 04:15.080
I think please look at that in the records pretty fairly in the very beginning.

04:15.080 --> 04:20.080
The, uh, the, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the charge of file.

04:20.080 --> 04:25.080
Uh, and the secretary's name will completely answer the specific list on a completely progeny.

04:25.080 --> 04:42.080
And the secretary of the Army just devoured here, positively and definitely under all Senate Democrats, that he revisions to 65 telephone calls by members of your staff.

04:42.080 --> 04:47.080
Raging special dispensation for day shines.

04:47.080 --> 04:58.080
That's the, uh, 19 personal contacts that the United States Senator from Wisconsin has came on at least one occasion.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
Far ahead for me.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.080
For this.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
Why you heard that didn't you?

05:01.080 --> 05:04.080
Mr. Jenkins, you, you have some, uh,

05:05.080 --> 05:11.080
so from this was in your question, you said the 60-fire and phone calls were urging, uh,

05:11.080 --> 05:12.080
special consideration.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.080
That's the least that's from my customers.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.080
And since you heard the secretary of the Army, who you decided to succumb to me on this interview.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.080
May I, may I?

05:19.080 --> 05:24.080
There's on one occasion you asked Neil, sorry, commission for Dave Shine.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.080
Did you or not, Senator?

05:25.080 --> 05:27.080
That's not true, but that's not true.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.080
That's not true. All right.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.080
Now, that's good.

05:29.080 --> 05:43.080
I'm going to say, uh, Mr. Jenkins, that I was surprised when I found there were only 65 phone calls to Dave Shine down at, uh, Fort Dick.

05:43.080 --> 05:58.080
Uh, any number of fans during the day, when we were drafting the info reports, the information program upon which Dave did more work than anyone else.

05:59.080 --> 06:09.080
Any number of fans, a question would come up about whether a certain witness should be called, whether you have further information, uh,

06:09.080 --> 06:14.080
whether certain information was correct or incorrect.

06:14.080 --> 06:20.080
And I would tell the staff, get some questions, Dave, he's the man who did all of the interviewing.

06:20.080 --> 06:26.080
And when I found the only had called in 65 times, I was very much surprised.

06:26.080 --> 06:32.080
I thought there would have been very many more calls and would do anything but make it clear.

06:32.080 --> 06:39.080
Those calls were not asking, there's no testimony, but they were asking for any consideration.

06:39.080 --> 06:53.080
Those calls were to get information from the young man who wore on anyone else, was responsible for the exposure,

06:53.080 --> 07:05.080
on communism, communist books, and the proposed waste of $18 million in the information program.

07:05.080 --> 07:17.080
And when we were writing those reports, I had to be 10 times sure that everything was correct because I knew that every comma, every period would be jumped down.

07:17.080 --> 07:30.080
So when I heard that only 65 phone calls at the mid, may I say I was surprised, I thought that many more phone calls would have been made to Mr. Shines.

07:30.080 --> 07:38.080
Being test the hour of detail, he will take a testimony, seven-pinning stretch, five minute minutes.

07:48.080 --> 07:52.080
You have dealt cards determined the Clara and brief recess.

07:52.080 --> 07:59.080
The ABC television network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army controversy.

08:17.080 --> 08:33.080
The Augustaer Senator Cobb months declared that there will be a five minute recess, but usually last much longer than that.

08:33.080 --> 08:40.080
Senator McCarthy on his own witness stand, he is under heavy cost examination by Mr. Ray Jenkins' committee council.

08:41.080 --> 08:53.080
There's a college that breaks up and leaves the caucus room, probably abandoning the seats, that there's so few and far between here in the Ten of Office voting hearing now.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.080
The gentleman I presume is the lead.

08:58.080 --> 09:05.080
Our lead is leading in the presence of primarily the gay mothers who are currently leading the lead just if not.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.080
I want to remind you of our committee rule again.

09:08.080 --> 09:19.080
In the absence of the audience by manifestation of an article made here, written here in the proof of it, they are forbidden.

09:20.080 --> 09:29.080
The uniformed members of the federal police and the leaders, the leaders of the government, the government, have been shut in the group, and the leaders of the community.

09:29.080 --> 09:41.080
Anyone by the community rules in order that we may have an executive faith in the government, before two of our members have to be absent tomorrow in town.

09:42.080 --> 09:48.080
I look really comfortable along about a four-day work, or something.

09:48.080 --> 09:57.080
Is that time, or anytime, you've come to some convenience, it's a culminating point on some particular line of cost examination.

09:57.080 --> 10:04.080
The president's illness, the president's illness, he's in the process of being cost examination, or a chief council member today.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.080
I mean, we're doing the presentation.

10:07.080 --> 10:14.080
Sir, the McCarthy sometime during the course of the day, at least time you made reference to Mr. Shine.

10:14.080 --> 10:22.080
Better not you make a statement of Mr. Shine, had served in Korea, or had been in Korea, I want to tell you that matter.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.080
Some question has been asked me about it.

10:25.080 --> 10:30.080
What was that? I did not get it, talking to you.

10:31.080 --> 10:41.080
It was not during the Korean War. It was before the Korean War, he had been...

10:41.080 --> 10:48.080
I don't quite know how you describe it, but it's a simulated range of Lieutenant's about it.

10:48.080 --> 10:57.080
In the Army Transport Service, and he sent some time in Korea, but it was not during the Korean War.

10:58.080 --> 11:05.080
I think it's in a very good way that there's no claim that he was a member of the Army Forces at that time.

11:05.080 --> 11:12.080
Just thought it was that a civilian was it not? Mr. Jenkins, I frankly don't know.

11:12.080 --> 11:16.080
I've asked some of my son's out in order to clarify that matter, which is a chief council about it.

11:16.080 --> 11:26.080
I have already consulted with the people in the Pentagon, and I asked them how he could be a lieutenant, and be a civilian.

11:27.080 --> 11:32.080
The very same, well, he was not a civilian, he was a lieutenant.

11:32.080 --> 11:43.080
He was the Army Transport Service, and I frankly don't know how you describe the situation.

11:43.080 --> 11:49.080
Get some army officers here, they might be able to give me some help on that, but I don't know.

11:49.080 --> 11:55.080
His first actual military service senator was on November 3rd, wasn't he?

11:55.080 --> 11:58.080
I think so, I do know. I think that's the correct state.

11:58.080 --> 12:06.080
And he had served five day or two in what's called the Army Transport, but as a civilian employee.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.080
Well, who's not in Korea, I think so here.

12:10.080 --> 12:21.080
I think that you could say a civilian, although they gave him the rank, what they call a similar rank of Lieutenant.

12:21.080 --> 12:27.080
This is what that means. I frankly don't know, but he was not in combat.

12:27.080 --> 12:39.080
He never has been in combat. The first time he was in a full squad, a member of the armed forces was on December 3rd, over there he was justice.

12:39.080 --> 12:49.080
I'm Senator, he never, anytime, had a commission from the United States Army, as a new tenant in the Army Transport.

12:49.080 --> 12:53.080
Mr. Jackson, as far as you know what you're understanding about it, this is not scientific.

12:53.080 --> 12:59.080
Mr. Jackson, I don't know what the sort of two-way commission is.

12:59.080 --> 13:05.080
I want to be very clear that he was not in combat.

13:05.080 --> 13:15.080
It was not an Army commission, it's what they call an assimilated commission in the Army Transport.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.080
The Army, I can tell you nothing about it.

13:17.080 --> 13:22.080
So there is this call, if you will, to the events of October 20th of Fourth Monument.

13:22.080 --> 13:26.080
You remember the occurrences of that lady, you not?

13:26.080 --> 13:28.080
I do.

13:28.080 --> 13:40.080
You will call with you in the Secretary and the United States Senator and the United States Congressman, and it's a highly secret laboratory of that installation on medication.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.080
Right.

13:42.080 --> 13:49.080
You will call if your chief counsel, Mr. Cohn, was not given admitted to that installation on medication, do you not?

13:49.080 --> 13:50.080
Right.

13:50.080 --> 13:59.080
So they will be known that your chief counsel became very highly incensed and belligerent on medication.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.080
Do you not?

14:01.080 --> 14:04.080
I wouldn't describe it as highly incensed and belligerent.

14:04.080 --> 14:13.080
He was extremely urinated, frankly, even in right-of-downs who expect the radar laboratories.

14:13.080 --> 14:23.080
He was the chief counsel of the commission committee and left-giving the laboratories, and then he was not allowed to run the lab.

14:23.080 --> 14:30.080
But for whatever reason, further justice ahead are not.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.080
Mr. Cohn became incensed on medication. He became angry, didn't he?

14:34.080 --> 14:37.080
You heard, Mr. Cohn, the silent on the register, didn't you?

14:37.080 --> 14:41.080
I would describe it as fairly irritated and disgusting.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.080
I'm that he was the master, didn't you remember what he said?

14:44.080 --> 14:46.080
Oh, no, I don't think so.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.080
You don't think he said that?

14:48.080 --> 14:50.080
I don't know what he said, but I'm describing.

14:50.080 --> 14:59.080
When I saw Mr. Rangel from the direction that Mr. Jones or Senator Potter had been sent to the assistant,

14:59.080 --> 15:10.080
Mr. Cohn, all of whom had been invited down there to inspect the laboratories,

15:10.080 --> 15:19.080
and I think they were all irritated.

15:19.080 --> 15:28.080
Now I would describe Roy Cohn as being disgusted and irritated with the procedure.

15:28.080 --> 15:35.080
But then he never did here either, Mr. Jones or Mr. Arbor Surrainville,

15:35.080 --> 15:39.080
and I think he needed further against the eye of the medicine,

15:39.080 --> 15:44.080
or as I would describe it as the ear of the ear of the patient.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.080
Oh, that's the ear of the patient.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.080
No, I didn't hear it.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.080
It didn't hear that.

15:49.080 --> 15:58.080
Now you were on the inside of the laboratory, and you personally did not hear the words of Mr. Cohn on medication.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.080
That's correct, isn't it?

15:59.080 --> 16:02.080
I heard his words before I went in.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.080
What were the sentences?

16:04.080 --> 16:12.080
Well, they were the effects that he hoped for some day he might have the same rights of inspecting the laboratories of the Communist Party,

16:12.080 --> 16:19.080
so if they had come inside the labs, he hoped that maybe the chief counsel for a committee that was invited down there,

16:19.080 --> 16:22.080
since the victim might be able to get inside.

16:22.080 --> 16:30.080
Now, I think we're going to find out how to fix a high, quick tip or death, let's back to that.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.080
Good thing.

16:36.080 --> 16:42.080
Maybe we can get back in a few minutes, but I am eating somewhat infamible, isn't he?

16:42.080 --> 16:43.080
Is that a good one?

16:46.080 --> 16:53.080
Well, I very seldom see him display any great temper.

16:54.080 --> 16:59.080
I have seen him get here a tad at a time.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.080
I think he's just a normal young man.

17:02.080 --> 17:05.080
He's a very brilliant.

17:08.080 --> 17:11.080
I don't think that he's got a hotter temper than a young man.

17:11.080 --> 17:14.080
He's a strong will, young man, isn't he?

17:17.080 --> 17:21.080
That's what appraising properly and I don't mean to be critical.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.080
I agree with you.

17:24.080 --> 17:29.080
I agree with you very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very strong will.

17:29.080 --> 17:36.080
But he's a strong will, young man, and sometimes as a matter of fact, his integer is 6.2

17:36.080 --> 17:41.080
And maybe the supreme force is real upon that as some of you might have seen.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.080
I think he's got a sense of it.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.080
No, I think he's got a sense of it.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.080
I'm going to chief counsel and chief to stand up for the latest death thing.

17:51.080 --> 18:02.080
Very freely and sometimes it is true that they convinced me that a certain course of action which they believe should be followed.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.080
Should be followed.

18:04.080 --> 18:08.080
I don't find any super important is their will upon mine.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.080
I'm open minded. I get a very very confident stance.

18:12.080 --> 18:19.080
And any one of them can prop and convince me that the credit convinced me.

18:20.080 --> 18:26.080
Of the importance of a certain investigation sometimes I agree and sometimes I disagree.

18:26.080 --> 18:33.080
On October 20th, as of October 20th, and for each fire there, to month fire there seems.

18:33.080 --> 18:38.080
Your committee has been investigating subverses in the United States Army.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.080
Have you not sent it?

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
That was correct.

18:41.080 --> 18:45.080
And you were in four conferences of that date, October 20th.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.080
That was correct.

18:46.080 --> 18:53.080
And this young man, chief counsel for the senator, is chairman of the investigation committee.

18:53.080 --> 18:59.080
I allegedly bow to sworn testimony on.

18:59.080 --> 19:03.080
I know who and for October.

19:03.080 --> 19:14.080
There are a fourth month when the secretary of the Army Robert Stevens is there, a man whom you described as being from the Middle East and to the Army.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.080
And a matter of carrying integrity.

19:17.080 --> 19:27.080
When the United Mission to that secret laboratory in the Fifth of Anger, right out there for all of you here, this is law.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.080
So I'm not a senator.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.080
So I'm not asking you whether you heard these or not.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.080
So I've got something correct to say of Fifth of Anger.

19:35.080 --> 19:39.080
I have never seen Mr. Cohn in any Fifth of Anger.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.080
I have seen him.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.080
Nobody in the Fifth of Anger.

19:41.080 --> 19:48.080
I have seen him fairly aerosatist and fairly disjusted in this situation.

19:48.080 --> 19:54.080
I have a Fifth of Anger indicates that you would be not using your best judgment.

19:54.080 --> 20:04.080
I don't think the Mr. Cohn ever lets him to motion John away with him to the point where his just common sense does not prevail.

20:05.080 --> 20:17.080
He was so angry or dolly or shady or upstate that he testified here on the witness stand that he would neither admit nor deny the testimony of Colonel Ballin.

20:17.080 --> 20:31.080
About his making a declaration of war on six days seasons of the Army, then some of the witnesses just say that he was at least just some extent deciding certain a bit of rage.

20:31.080 --> 20:38.080
Number one, only the up and down, the common on the Congress that the fair war.

20:38.080 --> 20:42.080
I don't think Mr. Cohn could.

20:42.080 --> 21:00.080
And number two, I think that Mr. Cohn has been very, very generous with the other witnesses that have appeared and not positively putting him in a position of justice.

21:00.080 --> 21:07.080
I think that he is a position where they might be guilty of prejudice.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.080
I have not ever seen him.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.080
Number of his friends are present.

21:11.080 --> 21:25.080
He doesn't know any one of the opposition he still refuses to put anyone in a position of being better for a jury unless he is completely positive.

21:25.080 --> 21:37.080
I assume that this way, it's impossible to know what is said but the first thing I declare war, I'm sure, of course, that it obviously had to be in justice.

21:38.080 --> 21:44.080
Now, Senator, I'm not talking about the things that say that they knew they should have in that answer.

21:44.080 --> 21:48.080
I'm talking about this situation here. I'm not talking about this one yet.

21:48.080 --> 22:00.080
When the McCarthy Committee was doing a thing that you say the Secretary himself had been wanting to do with investigating the Berkers in the Army,

22:01.080 --> 22:12.080
when you say that Mr. Adams came armed with a release that you would give to the President in which you stated you were committing a quitting that word,

22:12.080 --> 22:27.080
my question is whether or not under those circumstances is your chief counsel while I murdered or while everything is easy words.

22:28.080 --> 22:38.080
There that in the words of this Colonel Balloon, this is it. I'm reading from thirty-five sixty-four of the records.

22:38.080 --> 22:42.080
This is war in the Army.

22:42.080 --> 22:52.080
Senator McCarthy, if he said it, we are not publicly repediated, ideologically, and ratified in approval.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.080
I think it's a fact. Mr. Jenkins, I don't believe he said it.

22:57.080 --> 23:05.080
There's no war between the McCarthy Committee and the Army.

23:05.080 --> 23:17.080
I have some mental respect for armed forces. I think 99 plus percent are great Americans.

23:18.080 --> 23:23.080
All we are doing is trying to get us the human rights maples.

23:23.080 --> 23:34.080
We have seen that Mr. Jenkins, if there's a declaration of war, then I would suggest that someone tell us what witnesses we call but we should not have called.

23:34.080 --> 23:38.080
What situation we expose that we should not have exposed.

23:38.080 --> 23:43.080
What communist was called before the committees that should not have been called before the committee?

23:44.080 --> 24:06.080
If you can hear all this talk about a declaration of war, unknowing for an absurd point, there's no one who can give us the name of any individual or described the situation which is not properly handled by the committee.

24:06.080 --> 24:14.080
And of course, the investigation of Mr. Jenkins doesn't change one eye over from before a month until after.

24:14.080 --> 24:21.080
I know but there's a lot to do. I do respectfully say that you do that you have no brains.

24:21.080 --> 24:24.080
It's my question that I'll ask you again.

24:24.080 --> 24:30.080
The ground is standing at Mr. Corneth. I remember Mr. Simone correctly.

24:30.080 --> 24:34.080
You'd neither admit nor deny that Mr. Simone is vulnerable.

24:36.080 --> 24:44.080
So the burden of Mr. Simone being that he would hang it up further here, say it and this blanket, and remember.

24:44.080 --> 24:48.080
And here are the words of this young man.

24:48.080 --> 24:52.080
Will this war record believe battle star?

24:52.080 --> 24:56.080
This is war with the army.

24:57.080 --> 25:08.080
Words from the lips of your chief counsel, our own dedication, that we convey to this good man as you describe in the secret as the army.

25:08.080 --> 25:17.080
Now Senator McCarthy, Mr. Corneth's violent with our irritations.

25:17.080 --> 25:21.080
Make that threat. This is war with the army.

25:21.080 --> 25:31.080
Would you regard that Senator as proper conduct on the part of your chief counsel on that occasion and under those circumstances?

25:31.080 --> 25:35.080
I usually thought things I guess are no unexplained.

25:35.080 --> 25:40.080
Would you not, if it's proper conduct on the vote circumstances?

25:40.080 --> 25:44.080
Will this young man in his position as your chief counsel?

25:44.080 --> 25:50.080
Will this investigation going on, finding the fit of anger or temper of our safety?

25:50.080 --> 25:58.080
So this is war with the army. Talk to the senator. He has got in your opinion proper or improper conduct.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.080
Then you need strange under our circumstances.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.080
Do you have to know anything about that?

26:03.080 --> 26:07.080
That's why I asked me, have you quit beating your wife?

26:07.080 --> 26:11.080
No, I don't have a clean excuse.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.080
You know the circumstances.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.080
I know the testimony Mr. Corneth was.

26:17.080 --> 26:22.080
He didn't recall anything like that. He didn't think he'd said anything like that.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.080
He didn't. He was very generous.

26:25.080 --> 26:29.080
I'm not telling the young man that statement.

26:29.080 --> 26:33.080
A printer and I was very happy to see him do that.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.080
I don't think he made that statement.

26:36.080 --> 26:49.080
Number one, number two, there is no war between mischemed and anyone except communism, no guilty of grants and drugs.

26:49.080 --> 26:58.080
Granted, but if I ask it again, he'll plan into the circumstances with things that have been taken off over 20.

26:58.080 --> 27:05.080
Here is Chief's counsel while the United States Senator was mischumming with violence.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.080
No doubt within a few feet of him.

27:08.080 --> 27:12.080
Said the violent and exorcist war was the army.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.080
I excuse the senator.

27:15.080 --> 27:21.080
And I think we'll definitely yes or no answer whether or not you regard that as proper or improper.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.080
You regard that as proper conduct of a fighter.

27:24.080 --> 27:31.080
Comin' to dragons, I will not speculate on something which is not a fact until he was a proper and proper.

27:31.080 --> 27:36.080
When to Corneth fires by an own of amidst that statement, I was there.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.080
I didn't knew him against that statement.

27:39.080 --> 27:46.080
Mr. Corn, Mr. Corn, has never acted as long as he tells him that war with the army.

27:46.080 --> 27:50.080
Mr. Corn, I think, has treated every individual in the military.

27:50.080 --> 28:02.080
For the utmost consideration, we have only gone after those guilty of abrasions, communism, dishonesty.

28:02.080 --> 28:13.080
And this question of whether or not we have declared war on the army, Mr. Jenkins, I think is just a great waste of time for this day of Mr. Jenkins.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.080
I've got tremendous respect for you as counsel.

28:16.080 --> 28:24.080
I think you've done an almost impossible job here, of keeping this thing on a fairly even keel.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.080
I don't want this much of the record with the same.

28:26.080 --> 28:30.080
But with the bare-man assay, Mr. Jenkins.

28:30.080 --> 28:39.080
The charge here is that Mr. Toon, the Charsey, and Charsey, are in proper influence.

28:40.080 --> 28:46.080
To try and get special consideration for Dave Shines, such of course, to improve an on-tune.

28:46.080 --> 28:59.080
Now, what was said, when Mr. Renville, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Corn, were excluded from the radar laboratories, which were in regularism,

28:59.080 --> 29:08.080
that far, by and concerned, has nothing to do with this case, I will not speculate on something that I know is on-tune.

29:09.080 --> 29:16.080
In a very rough way, Mr. Chris, in this way, they had the critical question.

29:16.080 --> 29:29.080
Assuming very poor willary issues, assuming that your approach, not not to the point, under the first confidence described,

29:30.080 --> 29:39.080
Assuming that the relationship between you and Mr. Adams, had been as well as he has been specified.

29:39.080 --> 29:50.080
Assuming that Mr. Chief Counsel was denied his mission to a place where you, on another stature in a congressman, will have to go with the security of the arms.

29:50.080 --> 29:55.080
Assuming that Chief Counsel became angry and say to you, anything is over.

29:56.080 --> 30:06.080
What is that time Chief Counsel was conducting an investigation of the business in the Army that John Adams was trying to stop,

30:06.080 --> 30:17.080
or that the claim didn't exist, and that it is hurting the morale of the Army, and that this young man, there, within a few piece of,

30:17.080 --> 30:26.080
remember whom he was working to in the United States Senator, made that statement incorrectly in the persons with many people.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.080
This is what...
