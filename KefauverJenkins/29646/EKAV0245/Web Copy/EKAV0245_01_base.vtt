00:00.000 --> 00:02.100
I am at long last right once.

00:02.100 --> 00:03.400
Is that correct?

00:03.400 --> 00:04.900
Mr. Walsh, you can always get a last.

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
You're probably right.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.900
A thousand times more than your father.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.900
You are not talking about laughing matters.

00:09.900 --> 00:15.900
If there's a last, I suggest you search because it's so hard to guess you to say that

00:15.900 --> 00:17.900
you didn't actually yell.

00:17.900 --> 00:18.900
Sik of the seabed.

00:18.900 --> 00:19.900
Send them on.

00:19.900 --> 00:20.900
May I?

00:20.900 --> 00:21.900
May I?

00:21.900 --> 00:22.900
May I?

00:22.900 --> 00:23.900
May I?

00:23.900 --> 00:24.900
May I?

00:24.900 --> 00:25.900
May I?

00:25.900 --> 00:26.900
May I?

00:26.900 --> 00:27.900
May I?

00:27.900 --> 00:28.900
May I?

00:28.900 --> 00:29.900
May I?

00:29.900 --> 00:33.900
May I give an answer to that whole string of questions which Mr. Walsh has been throwing

00:33.900 --> 00:34.900
at me.

00:34.900 --> 00:38.900
I suggest that there is no pending questions as that there is nothing that needs an answer.

00:38.900 --> 00:46.900
Unless it's me, those lowly, freaking months, when we had that secretary over there in

00:46.900 --> 00:50.900
just a few years, then nobody would say it's Sik of the seabed.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.900
May I go ahead without a matter, Mr. Cole?

00:53.900 --> 00:55.900
Then I will wait for her now.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.900
Carefully, if there is no question pending.

00:57.900 --> 00:58.900
There is a question to be asked.

00:58.900 --> 00:59.900
Your comment will have 10 minutes of the new question.

00:59.900 --> 01:00.900
He can ask me the question.

01:00.900 --> 01:01.900
You can ask.

01:01.900 --> 01:05.900
Uh, Senator Monter, if you feel so that it's fair for Mr. Walsh to speak.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.900
I was in really good with that.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.900
I consider it fair and I think I'm doing on the fact that I saw no pending questions.

01:10.900 --> 01:15.900
I think some goodnight statements about Sik of the seabed as far as I remember.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.900
And you have a council here and there's a chair and a chair.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.900
There is a different sort of a function to come through.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.900
When these times come, so ask the question.

01:23.900 --> 01:27.900
Mr. Stoney, the information is in the world now denied to the opportunity to stay.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.900
Mr. Chairman, are you fine with that?

01:29.900 --> 01:31.900
Yes, I'm fine with that.

01:31.900 --> 01:36.900
Mr. Walsh, there's no way council wouldn't call up on safe circumstances.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.900
And what they found in the coming years, all get out here.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.900
They may get a laugh.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.900
You know, the ridiculous, he's wasting time trying to do it.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.900
He's trying to get a call from question nine with the judge.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.900
And after this morning, a series of ridiculous questions,

01:52.900 --> 01:57.900
talking about why you wouldn't go to the Pentagon and yell out certain things.

01:57.900 --> 02:04.900
So Mr. Cohn should be able to tell what happened after the documents was received.

02:04.900 --> 02:08.900
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,

02:08.900 --> 02:12.900
that's an answer to Mr. Walsh's question.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.900
And when they're in bay and have to survive,

02:14.900 --> 02:17.900
Mr. Walsh had even not confirmed about that.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.900
Except whether it happened since the beginning.

02:19.900 --> 02:23.900
You had a council from Mr. Cohn, I think it'd be highly appropriate for you to have him

02:23.900 --> 02:25.900
to ask him what did happen.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.900
Mr. Chairman, every other word that you have,

02:27.900 --> 02:29.900
allows them to have a win.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.900
Mr. Cohn, I think that has been answered every question.

02:32.900 --> 02:36.900
Winfully, there's any human beings that have an answer to it.

02:36.900 --> 02:42.900
Now, Mr. Walsh, how they say is a six and seven question.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.900
And answer these own questions.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.900
And play them to the gale right here, so they'll throw a ball of their own show,

02:49.900 --> 02:52.900
which it isn't just the three series, not only Mr. Chairman,

02:52.900 --> 02:55.900
but we are having fun here, Mr. Walsh,

02:55.900 --> 02:59.900
and it's time for Mr. Cohn to start their coming list.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.900
In the first round, having received the work,

03:02.900 --> 03:06.900
we had a fabric hide, the work of the nation's coming list,

03:06.900 --> 03:10.900
the way that this very moment may be decrieving the death,

03:10.900 --> 03:14.900
the reasons of some people in this very audience in this building.

03:14.900 --> 03:19.900
And with all through the long ridiculous series of questions about second season,

03:19.900 --> 03:24.900
I think Mr. Cohn should have a right to answer the implied questions.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.900
The questions that we've asked you to watch it, Mr. Cohn do,

03:28.900 --> 03:32.900
when we got a resume of an F.D. Eric Walsh,

03:32.900 --> 03:37.900
the show that they were coming in the secret red owl appetite.

03:37.900 --> 03:42.900
And why didn't he go to the door of a present-day gala and year all?

03:42.900 --> 03:44.900
But this is Mr. Cohn,

03:44.900 --> 03:47.900
Mr. Cohn, it's just the inside of an answer, this time.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.900
The evidence we gave his position to be understanding the situation.

03:50.900 --> 03:53.900
If you love something, you would not have anything to do with this.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.900
The other might have been having to do some of the time in the secret room.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.900
I think I have a known point, but I do not think this is going to be good.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.900
If the work of Mr. Cohn, you know what the days of it,

04:02.900 --> 04:04.900
but when you have your time, it's a tough work.

04:05.900 --> 04:10.900
Mr. Cohn, I would just like to say that the every little detail here,

04:10.900 --> 04:13.900
and he asked him, what happened in March?

04:13.900 --> 04:16.900
What happened in April? What happened in May?

04:16.900 --> 04:21.900
Before Mr. Cohn said, and even yesterday, after one word,

04:21.900 --> 04:24.900
a clever little friend here,

04:24.900 --> 04:27.900
playing to the board of the audience,

04:27.900 --> 04:29.900
he thinks it isn't a board of the audience.

04:29.900 --> 04:30.900
The American people in the back,

04:30.900 --> 04:33.900
seen her up for the purpose of playing to the left.

04:33.900 --> 04:34.900
We've been a lot of left here,

04:34.900 --> 04:37.900
but there are other essential aspects of the family.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.900
And I think this young man should be entitled to answer

04:40.900 --> 04:42.900
a series of questions with the rest.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.900
I'll share the questions to have done.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.900
Then come to me, if you see Mr. Cohn,

04:46.900 --> 04:48.900
and may, and you'll enjoy him.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.900
The answer is, the rest is nervous,

04:50.900 --> 04:51.900
but he'll cover up.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.900
He said, he thinks the fact that you had come for the Mr. Cohn

04:54.900 --> 04:55.900
and may ask him the questions,

04:55.900 --> 04:57.900
so let's be insinuating.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.900
Mr. Lowe, there's no answer to this.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.900
And that is what actually did that.

05:01.900 --> 05:02.900
Mr. Cohn, you're going to get the things

05:02.900 --> 05:03.900
whether he said, they're coming up.

05:03.900 --> 05:04.900
He said, no.

05:04.900 --> 05:05.900
Mr. Lowe, you're going to get the things

05:05.900 --> 05:07.900
that might be going to find the bodies over there.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.900
Mr. Cohn, I'll look for another one of them.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.900
I said it.

05:11.900 --> 05:16.900
Then can we have a ruling from the chair now?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.900
The family of the clients in the civil sector

05:18.900 --> 05:20.900
will also provide for all the companies.

05:20.900 --> 05:24.900
The money is really out to express them.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.900
The remaining clients until the list of the conams here.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.900
The chair will do exactly what I do.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.900
The heavy business is after a little bit of life

05:32.900 --> 05:34.900
with the loss of the clients in the right-up point of order.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.900
Each time, each time violates it.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.900
You're wondering, is this your district?

05:39.900 --> 05:40.900
I'm going to take it a few of our friends.

05:40.900 --> 05:45.900
I've given up my time so that we can get through with it.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.900
And instead of playing, you get through with the wealth of friends

05:48.900 --> 05:51.900
who create a district and fill up our city.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.900
But we can think about the television rights

05:53.900 --> 05:54.900
that I don't know.

05:54.900 --> 05:55.900
Period.

05:55.900 --> 05:56.900
The wealth of the internet.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.900
The main thing is I'm trying to get a five-year-older.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.900
Mr. Chairman.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.900
I'm listening to you, Mr. Chairman.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.900
This is quite a solemn moment with me this year.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.900
I'm having a read to the solemnly I say something.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.900
I don't often say a thing on my own behalf.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.900
You may have a peer to the cemetery in this room

06:18.900 --> 06:20.900
and this audience are even on television

06:20.900 --> 06:23.900
with properly armed and really unaware.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.900
As soon as you see a crown or to make a funny joke

06:26.900 --> 06:31.900
or to catch a headline, may I just claim this?

06:31.900 --> 06:34.900
I'm only trying to dramatize the fact

06:34.900 --> 06:38.900
that we had a new secretary of the annual event.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.900
The decidentist room was a communist caterer.

06:42.900 --> 06:46.900
And it seems to me that it would have been simple to have gone over

06:46.900 --> 06:48.900
and got some help.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.900
And this cemetery in time to dramatize

06:50.900 --> 06:53.900
and it seemed to you that I was playing for a laugh.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.900
I beg of you believe me.

06:55.900 --> 06:56.900
I was not.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.900
When do you accept that from me, sir?

06:58.900 --> 06:59.900
You were the one.

06:59.900 --> 07:00.900
I think so.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.900
You should do a profession, man.

07:02.900 --> 07:03.900
No, but he did.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.900
You may have been told to go over to get some help.

07:05.900 --> 07:06.900
Let me move along.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.900
May I answer the women's solemnly as the woman that you call?

07:09.900 --> 07:12.900
We have heard many days ago that there were 130 communists

07:12.900 --> 07:15.900
in defense plans and a letter was written

07:15.900 --> 07:18.900
for the Army saying let's have the names of those.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.900
And I haven't yet heard that they have gone over.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.900
Is it correct that it's not a junior or they have not gone over?

07:24.900 --> 07:27.900
As far as I know, the sendent of McCarthy has offered

07:27.900 --> 07:30.900
both names to be defense the party.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.900
I did under the rules of this committee.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.900
If there has not been an exception for the offer,

07:34.900 --> 07:36.900
that is something which I don't know.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.900
And let's have it, sir, but they just haven't gone over.

07:38.900 --> 07:39.900
It happened.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.900
No, sir.

07:41.900 --> 07:45.900
The entity of Mr. Ruches that the letter I heard of it was

07:45.900 --> 07:47.900
that the sendent of McCarthy has offered the name

07:47.900 --> 07:49.900
and that they have not been an exception to the offer.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.900
I don't know if there is been any change in the situation.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.900
Now let me go back to the memory of them

07:53.900 --> 07:59.900
that I was asking you about on January 14th.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.900
You remember Mr. Cohn that I was just from the point

08:02.900 --> 08:04.900
of asking you whether you strike that out.

08:04.900 --> 08:08.900
You were down in Room 101 when you talked to Latif,

08:08.900 --> 08:11.900
is that right?

08:12.900 --> 08:15.900
You were down in Room 101 when you talked to Latif.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.900
Other time, and there's a synonymous with that.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.900
And there's a synonymous with that.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.900
I don't think that there were synonymous with that time, sir.

08:25.900 --> 08:26.900
I'm not sure.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.900
You've even written there's a synonymous?

08:28.900 --> 08:29.900
No, it isn't.

08:29.900 --> 08:33.900
There was an arrangement made by a change made by Mr. Cohn.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.900
I'm trying to think about the beginning of the satellite.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.900
Under which he moved the synonymous with his oven

08:39.900 --> 08:43.900
to Room 101, which was formed with an occupied by staff members.

08:43.900 --> 08:47.900
And he moved from staff members within in 101

08:47.900 --> 08:50.900
and so another room.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.900
In any event you went up to say this and indicated this memory

08:53.900 --> 08:56.900
of Mr. Cohn that was that right?

08:56.900 --> 08:58.900
I think that was fair, just a...

08:58.900 --> 09:03.900
And I think that's the memory of Mr. Cohn that was that.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.900
And when you got out to him, I also asked him the conversation

09:05.900 --> 09:07.900
that he was convicted.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.900
How many ideas there was...

09:09.900 --> 09:11.900
I know that I went up to say, kind of, I'm a thought the end.

09:11.900 --> 09:12.900
He wasn't there.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.900
And I just indicated it.

09:14.900 --> 09:15.900
Don't you ever...

09:15.900 --> 09:17.900
I've never indicated anything down in Room 101.

09:17.900 --> 09:18.900
On the first floor?

09:18.900 --> 09:20.900
I just had to say something.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.900
That's not fair.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.900
No, not fair.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.900
Was there anything peculiarly secret about this?

09:27.900 --> 09:28.900
About this?

09:28.900 --> 09:29.900
No, I didn't say it.

09:29.900 --> 09:30.900
I didn't say it.

09:30.900 --> 09:33.900
Anywhere I'm peculiarly off, it was, like, you brought three flights

09:33.900 --> 09:36.900
with you there, indicated to someone when you got to know him.

09:36.900 --> 09:37.900
I thought that it was a secret.

09:37.900 --> 09:38.900
How much?

09:38.900 --> 09:39.900
Did you fly?

09:39.900 --> 09:40.900
Did you...

09:40.900 --> 09:41.900
Did you...

09:41.900 --> 09:43.900
Did you authenticate it as you heard Adam talk about it?

09:43.900 --> 09:45.900
I think that is much.

09:45.900 --> 09:46.900
No.

09:46.900 --> 09:47.900
And you made up your mind later?

09:47.900 --> 09:48.900
Did they get it?

09:48.900 --> 09:49.900
I think I had them with the world.

09:49.900 --> 09:50.900
No, no, thanks.

09:50.900 --> 09:51.900
You made up your mind later.

09:51.900 --> 09:52.900
I didn't know if I'm here for my mind.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.900
I went up to see if I had them talking and talking and talking to something.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.900
When he wasn't there, I left him at the memory end and with the secretary.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.900
They didn't wear this while I wanted them to know.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.900
And this is that memory end?

10:01.900 --> 10:02.900
Yes, they did.

10:02.900 --> 10:03.900
You indicated it to her.

10:03.900 --> 10:04.900
Is that right?

10:04.900 --> 10:05.900
Yes, I did.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.900
I don't think I am a third after that.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.900
Not until March 11 or the air of Oxford, did you leave them there?

10:12.900 --> 10:14.900
My father started around that time.

10:14.900 --> 10:15.900
I don't care.

10:15.900 --> 10:16.900
I don't think I started.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.900
I haven't been divorced for a while.

10:18.900 --> 10:19.900
You were lying to me.

10:19.900 --> 10:20.900
I was a little bit scared.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.900
You were a fat.

10:21.900 --> 10:22.900
So you got some?

10:22.900 --> 10:24.900
I just have one question, Mr. Chairman.

10:24.900 --> 10:28.900
The research doesn't matter when my time expires, Mr. Cohn.

10:28.900 --> 10:33.900
Now, you've stated in the court that a hearing that Mr. Cohn was,

10:33.900 --> 10:37.900
I believe, was an F-benaz agent and in contact with high F-benaz agent.

10:37.900 --> 10:38.900
You say F-benaz agent?

10:38.900 --> 10:39.900
Yes, no, I didn't.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.900
Well, I haven't you referred to him as being in contact with my F-benaz agent.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.900
Oh, I think in contact with him?

10:47.900 --> 10:50.900
Yes, I have a first of that, not stand by that statement, not so much.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.900
Yes, well, wouldn't that make him an F-benaz agent?

10:53.900 --> 10:55.900
If I could use in contact with him?

10:55.900 --> 10:56.900
Yes, my name is not.

10:56.900 --> 11:00.900
Well, the implication is that it has been in contact with high F-benaz agents,

11:00.900 --> 11:04.900
but he's not in contact with him about social matters,

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
and something like that.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.900
Well, it's the question of going into the implication.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.900
I would say that the contact will probably be enough not to have him working

11:10.900 --> 11:12.900
and it's a good way to allow that, sorry.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.900
But the weather is enough to say that he's just the afiolate in the F-benaz agent,

11:15.900 --> 11:17.900
well, that's been dependent on some other evidence.

11:17.900 --> 11:21.900
Well, I understand, but it's a pretty serious invitation if you make a statement

11:21.900 --> 11:25.900
and say that he's in contact with high F-benaz agents.

11:25.900 --> 11:29.900
I mean, the implication that comes from a mandatory theory is if he said that he had not

11:29.900 --> 11:32.900
met such people socially and didn't know who they were,

11:32.900 --> 11:36.900
but maybe he's a little naive, that's another kind of statement, wouldn't it?

11:36.900 --> 11:37.900
Yes.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.900
Well, my point is very simple.

11:39.900 --> 11:44.900
If Mr. Coleman was of this type of character,

11:44.900 --> 11:49.900
and I believe he was criticized Mr. Stevens, but the Army,

11:49.900 --> 11:54.900
we're not acting promptly on his security matters,

11:54.900 --> 11:58.900
in very situation that have been before the committee.

11:59.900 --> 12:05.900
How can you be critical of Mr. Stevens when these 35 names were known to you

12:05.900 --> 12:09.900
and not to the other members of the committee for months?

12:09.900 --> 12:10.900
I don't understand that.

12:10.900 --> 12:11.900
Well, very simple.

12:11.900 --> 12:16.900
You know these 35 names that were contained in this northern FDI,

12:16.900 --> 12:19.900
I'm going to say, you didn't know this number, two and a quarter, three and a quarter?

12:19.900 --> 12:24.900
I knew about it, but I don't think that these 35 names in that memorandum are identical

12:25.900 --> 12:28.900
to the name of the 35 people who are presented as what Mr. Coleman said.

12:28.900 --> 12:29.900
All right.

12:29.900 --> 12:30.900
You knew about this?

12:30.900 --> 12:32.900
This is what Mr. Coleman said.

12:32.900 --> 12:35.900
That's a serious one and that's a 35.

12:35.900 --> 12:36.900
He was one of the 30s.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.900
I was going to just talk about Coleman.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.900
It's one other way to say it's probably just a serious one.

12:41.900 --> 12:42.900
Well, this is what Mr. Coleman said.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.900
You knew about Coleman in March 3, around that time yesterday.

12:46.900 --> 12:51.900
And from March until September, nothing was done about him.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.900
And getting him removed for far as the committee was concerned.

12:54.900 --> 12:55.900
I wouldn't say that.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.900
Well, as a matter of fact, you first learned about it in March 4, April.

12:59.900 --> 13:00.900
All right?

13:00.900 --> 13:01.900
Yes, it was in the spring.

13:01.900 --> 13:06.900
Well, then if you knew about this man being in content with my empty energy,

13:06.900 --> 13:10.900
why didn't you tell Mr. Steven to have just been in the Army?

13:10.900 --> 13:12.900
I was trying to say it for two months.

13:12.900 --> 13:18.900
The Attorney General was in charge of the overall charge of the FDI,

13:19.900 --> 13:25.900
because I knew from this that the Attorney General and the FDI knew all about it already, number one.

13:25.900 --> 13:31.900
Number two, I knew that they had given appropriate notice to the people in Mr. Steven's organization

13:31.900 --> 13:36.900
who were charged with this responsibility not once but on a great number of occasions.

13:36.900 --> 13:42.900
And that despite that ample evidence and warning, which I'm sure will far more persuasive coming from the FDI

13:42.900 --> 13:47.900
than they would have been for me, there was no action taken over there in the arms.

13:48.900 --> 13:49.900
I want to get some more.

13:49.900 --> 13:50.900
Let's put one thing down right now.

13:50.900 --> 13:51.900
Get Mr. Brown now.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.900
No, I'll pop this in April.

13:53.900 --> 13:54.900
No, Mr. Brown now.

13:54.900 --> 13:55.900
No, no, no.

13:55.900 --> 13:56.900
You said the Attorney General now.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.900
So when I say the Attorney General, I don't expect Mr. Brown now as the Attorney General,

14:00.900 --> 14:04.900
so Mr. Steven is the Secretary of the Army, so no, that's content.

14:04.900 --> 14:08.900
So every five hour, that's him and I have anything like that in his office.

14:08.900 --> 14:12.900
Well, when I refer to the Attorney General, so I mean the Office of the Attorney General.

14:12.900 --> 14:16.900
When I refer to FDI, I mean the organization of which day I took over.

14:17.900 --> 14:23.900
Director, I don't mean that the head of the organization knows the content of every file or every penny taken the effort.

14:23.900 --> 14:27.900
Mr. Kong, you said it, that's the radar laboratory in Fort Monmouth.

14:27.900 --> 14:32.900
It's one of the most important in the whole country, that it is a key to our security.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.900
Again, a hydrogen atomic tank.

14:34.900 --> 14:39.900
Here's a man, Mr. Coleman, in contact with high air sea nitrogen.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.900
Is the benefit involved the very part of that?

14:41.900 --> 14:43.900
I think some of the retired people said in ivory with him.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.900
One man, one man, might be able to destroy this country.

14:47.900 --> 14:50.900
Why didn't you go to Mr. Brown now?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.900
Was that information?

14:52.900 --> 14:56.900
Because I knew that the organization headed by Mr. Brown now,

14:56.900 --> 15:01.900
which includes the FBI and Mr. Hoover, not only was aware of that information,

15:01.900 --> 15:05.900
but has passed that information along to the Chiefs of the Army,

15:05.900 --> 15:07.900
not once but on any occasion.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.900
I'm Mr. General.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.900
You know that it was turned over to Mr. Brown now.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.900
Heads that we've also seriously responsible.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.900
I could not see what advantage there would be in my going back to people

15:18.900 --> 15:22.900
who had already turned over the information to the right place and say,

15:22.900 --> 15:24.900
what was I saying, and they had already done the job.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.900
Mr. Kong, if you can't get action from the people down below,

15:27.900 --> 15:30.900
isn't it just a rule of common sense, you always go to the top-nance,

15:30.900 --> 15:34.900
but they had an action on the thought of the top in the FBI and the gun.

15:34.900 --> 15:35.900
No, no, no.

15:35.900 --> 15:38.900
I want you to say, whether you know of your own knowledge,

15:38.900 --> 15:42.900
that this information, that this man's home, and a high espionage agent,

15:42.900 --> 15:46.900
that information just a minute, and that a high espionage.

15:46.900 --> 15:52.900
All right, and agents are an individual in contact with high espionage agents in this country.

15:52.900 --> 15:57.900
What if that information had been turned over to the boss of the overall organization,

15:57.900 --> 16:03.900
the collect the information to the FBI and the organization that institutes Constitution?

16:03.900 --> 16:04.900
Mr. Brown now.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.900
I think it's a fair question.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.900
Sure, surely, I'm not trying to give you a fair answer by me.

16:09.900 --> 16:14.900
The far-as-I know, Mr. Brown now did not personally know about this particular case.

16:14.900 --> 16:19.900
The far-as-I know, director of the law might not even have known personally about

16:19.900 --> 16:22.900
or had in mind at that moment the particular case I did know there.

16:22.900 --> 16:27.900
That the justice of often in the FBI had carried out their job by sending over the information

16:27.900 --> 16:32.900
to the Chiefs of the Army so that their responsibility was passed an end.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.900
And there would be, would have been no point in my communicating with them.

16:35.900 --> 16:39.900
Mr. Cohn, I'm just trying to be fair to this new administration.

16:39.900 --> 16:44.900
And I want to say to you that when you have such information, it seems obvious to me.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.900
There's not a matter of law. You don't really have to be technical.

16:47.900 --> 16:52.900
It's just common sense that you have such information that it seemed to me it should have drawn

16:52.900 --> 16:54.900
directly to Mr. Brown now from you.

16:54.900 --> 16:57.900
Now, this next question, what's that?

16:57.900 --> 16:59.900
You say that they don't have to find out for me.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.900
Mr. Brown now, and Mr. Hoover, or their respective organizations,

17:02.900 --> 17:06.900
are the ones who have gotten the information and sent it over to the Army with the request.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.900
All right, now wait a minute.

17:08.900 --> 17:09.900
Let's send that down.

17:09.900 --> 17:12.900
You said that Mr. Brown, Ellen, his organization sent it over.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.900
When was this report sent to G2?

17:14.900 --> 17:16.900
Mr. Hoover sent in 51.

17:16.900 --> 17:17.900
They were other.

17:17.900 --> 17:18.900
So how could, what a minute?

17:18.900 --> 17:20.900
52, 53.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.900
I still remember some of the 54.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.900
How do you know that they sent other reports?

17:26.900 --> 17:30.900
I told you yesterday, sir, that this same man who went to the senior McCarthy told him

17:30.900 --> 17:36.900
this is 1951 report, it's about one in a long period, which has been sent over by the FBI

17:36.900 --> 17:37.900
to the Army for action.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.900
Well, then how can I, I gave the date, for some additional work?

17:40.900 --> 17:44.900
Well, how can you say that Mr. Brown now sent them over to the Attorney General?

17:44.900 --> 17:48.900
Obviously, he doesn't know, he can't know about every detail that there's something as his

17:48.900 --> 17:50.900
alarming is it?

17:50.900 --> 17:54.900
This is a matter of course, for the interests of really doing something out, let's go to the top line.

17:54.900 --> 18:01.900
Now the allegations that have been made in this controversy relates to the fact that Mr.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.900
Stevens had caught all coming in.

18:03.900 --> 18:09.900
Now he'd only been in office two months and you knew about this information, wouldn't

18:09.900 --> 18:13.900
he proper things to do and be just give this directly to Mr. Stevens?

18:13.900 --> 18:20.900
He couldn't possibly know of all of the files in G2, literally thousands and thousands of them.

18:20.900 --> 18:25.900
Then an action nobody has said here that Mr. Stevens didn't know or even should have known

18:25.900 --> 18:30.500
at that point about this particular situation and we were not investigating Mr.

18:30.500 --> 18:34.900
Stevens personal knowledge or lack of knowledge, but we were investigating what was well

18:34.900 --> 18:39.900
a department of which Mr. Stevens was at that time ahead, has been or in a pair of some

18:39.900 --> 18:41.900
continuing to the present.

18:41.900 --> 18:46.900
They also take action on warning that has been sent over by the FBI.

18:46.900 --> 18:51.900
I do not say and I am known in this room that Mr. Stevens was derelict and not having

18:51.900 --> 18:52.900
knowledge.

18:52.900 --> 18:58.900
We do say that people in Mr. Stevens' organization should have asked it while on the basis

18:58.900 --> 19:03.900
of this information and we say there that people who have been Mr. Stevens had worked under

19:03.900 --> 19:08.900
the photofaces of Mr. Stevens' life-wise should have taken action on this situation so

19:08.900 --> 19:12.900
that they're so longing that any more, but how I can say it to you this way.

19:12.900 --> 19:17.900
We get a lot of cases, we get information and a lot of communists, we process it as best

19:17.900 --> 19:22.900
we can, we can only handle one investigation at a time, we do the job effectively as we

19:22.900 --> 19:25.900
can whether we follow the right or wrong approach here, no one will ever know.

19:25.900 --> 19:31.900
All I do know is that when we got into this investigation these people will fire before they

19:31.900 --> 19:32.900
went that fire.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.900
Mr. Cohn, what was more important at the time?

19:34.900 --> 19:39.900
Did he try to prove that Mr. Stevens and his organization was negligent or did he go directly

19:39.900 --> 19:43.900
with the information about these alleged communists and give them the names and put them

19:43.900 --> 19:44.900
right on his box?

19:44.900 --> 19:48.900
Then you'd have a record saying here we turned them over in April, you did nothing about it.

19:48.900 --> 19:49.900
So we weren't trying to make a record.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.900
And you can't do that.

19:51.900 --> 19:52.900
And what did you say?

19:52.900 --> 19:53.900
I'm a copy.

19:53.900 --> 19:54.900
Thank you.

19:54.900 --> 20:03.900
Mr. Cohn, I would love to have you with that here, welcome to my friend from the State

20:03.900 --> 20:10.900
of Birmingham, the state of Birmingham, that we take this FBI document to take it over to

20:10.900 --> 20:11.900
Brown Mill.

20:11.900 --> 20:16.900
That's why after the people on his side of the aisle have been demanding over the past number

20:16.900 --> 20:20.900
of days that the young men will give us the information to be indebted.

20:20.900 --> 20:28.400
I just can't quite follow this going off and going full, one really wants to prove that

20:28.400 --> 20:31.900
it's going to be an obvious and a question.

20:31.900 --> 20:32.900
One day it's an attraction.

20:32.900 --> 20:39.900
I just want to be recorded in show that I did not face that Mr. Corn can bring the document

20:39.900 --> 20:40.900
over.

20:40.900 --> 20:45.900
I said that the information that they had to be made available to them without saying

20:45.900 --> 20:46.900
what they're going to do.

20:46.900 --> 20:50.900
I am rather amused by my number of programs here.

20:50.900 --> 20:56.900
So, I consider it as a new program, taking to Brown Mill, information that you knew came from

20:56.900 --> 21:00.900
Brown Mill's office and went to Army Intelligence.

21:00.900 --> 21:05.900
The information that you are there like in one way, they accuse you of being there like

21:05.900 --> 21:06.900
in the next way.

21:06.900 --> 21:13.900
So, I say that the young man who gave us the information about these formulas should be

21:13.900 --> 21:14.900
indebted.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.900
In fact, I believe it is suggested that I should be indebted.

21:17.900 --> 21:22.900
And I am having received the information about stamina.

21:22.900 --> 21:33.900
The simple facts of matter is that we do have all the information that had gone to the

21:33.900 --> 21:36.900
proper authorities in the military.

21:36.900 --> 21:40.900
There is no way we could order them to act upon them.

21:40.900 --> 21:48.900
The only thing we could do is to develop the facts, bring them out publicly and force them

21:48.900 --> 21:52.900
to act because of the pressure of public opinion.

21:52.900 --> 21:59.900
That was done after we made the facts public some 35 individuals.

21:59.900 --> 22:05.900
So, what the facts of the violating yesterday act was the subject of that fact.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.900
That's about it.

22:07.900 --> 22:12.900
And should we throw a power out to the HIST case?

22:12.900 --> 22:17.900
In the HIST case, the form of the information was given by the Littaker Chamber as early

22:17.900 --> 22:21.900
as 1939 or 1940 as we get with.

22:21.900 --> 22:29.900
The FBI, according to the information was made public in new places, it was over additional

22:29.900 --> 22:38.900
reports, time after time, finally when the sometime of the month, Vice President Nixon on a committee,

22:39.900 --> 22:45.900
made the information public as you may recall, there was speculation of the other

22:45.900 --> 22:52.900
they would indict Stettaker Chamber for having given the information about this time just by,

22:52.900 --> 22:55.900
although it was about an hour ago, your HIST.

22:55.900 --> 23:00.900
You recall that, from that time, even though the information was available to the state

23:00.900 --> 23:07.900
department for years, Mr. HIST does not be limited or it's a common because of it,

23:07.900 --> 23:13.900
but got the highest job, perhaps, with the state department at all frame,

23:13.900 --> 23:19.900
under the federal property of the United Nations Conference, that's St. Francis Sutter.

23:19.900 --> 23:23.900
And also, out of very important job in the state department, just before that he had to.

23:23.900 --> 23:28.900
And the information was all the attention of Mr. Burley, the assistant secretary of state.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.900
I believe there's not so many laws that he calls the defense of others,

23:32.900 --> 23:41.900
it's only when a conventional committee forced the fact out to the American people to see them,

23:41.900 --> 23:45.900
that they finally, undoubtedly, convicted Mr. HIST.

23:45.900 --> 23:52.900
Some of the state's answers to that, sir, yes, and I can stay here and now I hope once and for all,

23:52.900 --> 23:55.900
that's what the situation is.

23:55.900 --> 24:02.900
Perhaps, Mr. Lowe said in the same, we have a very small step of young men downstairs who do this work.

24:02.900 --> 24:07.900
We have maybe nine or ten against that, on the intelligence and people like that,

24:07.900 --> 24:10.900
have, I believe, thousands of people working for them.

24:10.900 --> 24:14.900
We get a lot of information, serious information about communists,

24:14.900 --> 24:19.900
and great our laboratories and defense plans and the government spending office and other places.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.900
We cannot develop every case at once.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.900
We can only do one at a time.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.900
They work out and they do it as well as they can.

24:26.900 --> 24:32.900
We move along with as much speed as we can, and I think that, as far as the young men downstairs concerned,

24:32.900 --> 24:38.900
the statistics of the number of communists say that, eliminated from the United States government and defense plan,

24:38.900 --> 24:41.900
it's the best testimony of the House of Tessles, they have been.

24:41.900 --> 24:47.900
It's very hard to define a method of operation and say, looking back,

24:47.900 --> 24:49.900
at what point should take what step.

24:49.900 --> 24:52.900
We try to do these things in order of importance and priority.

24:52.900 --> 24:56.900
We just government spending office, family business investigation here.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.900
There are about nine people downstairs.

24:58.900 --> 25:03.900
They work hard, and I think they do a very, very effective job,

25:03.900 --> 25:06.900
and I think they've gotten a lot of time in this out of government and defense plan,

25:06.900 --> 25:11.900
and I think that should be the judgment of their efficiency.

25:11.900 --> 25:15.900
I'm talking to you, my son is in attention and the color of that we've done that.

25:15.900 --> 25:18.900
We have to get to the reach right now, and you may address the enemy.

25:18.900 --> 25:19.900
We can't do this.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.900
We can't do this.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.900
We can't do this all the time.
