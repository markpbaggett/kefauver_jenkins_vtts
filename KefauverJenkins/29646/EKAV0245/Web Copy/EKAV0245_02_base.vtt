WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm going to do this for the first time.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
So I'm up, I'll plate you with the committee rules.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
The unanimous, the adopted, which is used to be a site auditorium.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
There are no auditable manifestations of approval or difficult rules.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Any time, at any time, from my guest in the audience.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
And the committee has in substance to chair to ask the uniform numbers of the chapter for each work that you see before you.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
And the plain flow of people scattered throughout the audience.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
To enforce that committee ruling by escorting from the committee rules immediately,

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
a likely but firmly, any of our guests who elect to violate the conditions under which you enter the rule.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
The plain lead to refrain from auditable manifestations of approval or difficult.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Our audience has been magnificent.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
The officers have done a splendid job.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
I think it's safe to say a congressional hearing that never before has so many behaved so well for so long.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
And we appreciate it. We hope that will continue.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
As we left off, Senator Mataji had four minutes left of his questioning period if he tries to consume it.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
After which, if the welcome conditions are at their time, they are not tired of that.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
If you give me the help and that's what's the chairman to ask.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
The first one getting the first look to, as soon as there hasn't come information,

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
both here after hearing and also the kind of form of a son of a son of a recall funders.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
That's a death of communism.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
For some reason, other could not be important.

01:56.000 --> 02:06.000
Now, did you take part in the position of a man for a man's bail, popman bail, yes?

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Would you tell us what his occupation was and how important he was to become a member of the emperor?

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
I think it was a problem, though, with a sense that he was convicted left here as a...

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
In the group of second-string leaders of the Communist Party of the United States,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
he was very important in the communist apparatus.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
He was one of the original communist theorist, Cishin.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
It occurred to me that he was a teacher and the head of a sacred communist training school for a period of time.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
He was, so the year it was one of the top leaders in the communist conspiracy in the country,

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
until his conviction uncharted the conspiracy to teach the United States all the throw of our government by force and violence last year.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
Now, I have mentioned to someone here that Sam Schumer is a surging point.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
I mean, we have played with the soldiers leading when we go overseas, we can back more overseas.

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
I don't know that it's true or not before the Trump Library, but to mention that to the people that I assume it's true.

03:11.000 --> 03:23.000
It's true that a justice in a state at a staging point would be able to get all the information,

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
not all information, but a great amount of information, about two movements,

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
where they were coming from, where they were going to, and that if he were a communist, as the first was,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
he could perform a tremendous service for the communist party in that process.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Yes, I think there's no question about that.

03:41.000 --> 03:51.000
Now, I would like to, if I may, Mr. Cohn, to reach you from the formerly royal Canadian commission,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
which was investigating coming to the West Bank in Canada,

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
but what will happen to the United States?

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
Let's see, what's 7.3499?

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
First of all, do you know what doctor that was an auto-war?

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
And so, I understand that telegram with this doctor lived blank streets.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I do not remember his address.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
But the doctor did not know it.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
And so, first and often, this particular case, I remember it, because it was quite a strange situation.

04:34.000 --> 04:43.000
One of the members of the military at a day, one of his staff, driver at worst called,

04:43.000 --> 04:55.000
a time with having his chiefs by the doctor, first and, he was a dentist and a dentist, at a time one of the agents.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
At the time one of the agents, I think it was Laura, was having her chiefs for the same place,

05:02.000 --> 05:12.000
Moscow found its convenience, therefore, but during this time, the materials with the place in the washroom,

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
after an auto-war, worst called, would go and take the materials out of the washroom.

05:19.000 --> 05:28.000
Their visits to the dentist or doctor would be explained by having their chiefs attendance here.

05:28.000 --> 05:39.000
Now, in view of that, I assume that you and I could not sub-bad to the series of the senators who made the speech here the day

05:39.000 --> 05:48.000
or to request new fear that nearly because the men were a dentist, you know, building importance in the communist background.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Most of them, in a cursing, they told us that there was still another census, which is very important.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
I believe that they were the one who was a key link in the Witticott Chamber's firing.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
I think there was some testimony about that by Attorney General Brown, now, before the general committee.

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
So, do not ask you both at all, so, if I could hear you, tell me exactly what you were firing.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
And sure, well, I meant, and it's all that sometimes when we can move to the first trial of this hearing,

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
you don't have all things that I believe that you know what we have a common that, around no matter why you do it.

06:30.000 --> 06:38.000
The thing that I really wanted to reassure in the country on was that he wasn't sitting right where in the middle of Port Mom,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
because I was afraid some people might think he was.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Nothing to be clear of that is that correct.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
That's right.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
No, I want one or two more questions, but you are about your memorandum of January 14th.

06:53.000 --> 07:01.000
You will remember that is the occasion or that day to see date on which you, as you put it, listened to some nasty talk

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
or was the occasion of Mr. Adam, like somewhat nasty in the sexy shot.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Is that right?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yes, that's that over the season.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
That over the season talk.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes, sir.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
And the key was that passing that those nasty suggestions to your friends, kind, that he might go overseas.

07:18.000 --> 07:27.000
He was trying to, what I got down to, he was trying to say that, unless you people co-op like with me, I'm going to do this.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
That's right.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
That's another word, this one of the blackmailic agents.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I would say it could be, but one of the blackmailic agents.

07:35.000 --> 07:45.000
Have you said anything to Mr. Adam, higher that date, that could have indicated to him that you had a considerable interest in higher the size?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Well, sir, just yet to know, I'd be said anything to him.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
I'm very sure that he knows private sign had worked on the committee staff.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm going to talk a lot of work to the answer, just of course.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Do you have said anything that indicated that you were peculiarly interested in signs?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
No, I was not securely interested in them, sir.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
He was a member of the committee staff.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
He was a friend of mine and happened before he came with the committee.

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
I think an answer to the question would have been fair, Mr. Adam, to assume that I or Mr. Carr,

08:15.000 --> 08:26.000
and anyone else in our fair, would resent the fact that straightness of a soldier within without committee was going to depend on our ability or inability to stop an investigation.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
Well, you were a grown man, then as Mr. Carr was a grown man, weren't you?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
That's right, sir.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
And you were working for a committee of the United States Senate?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
That's right, that was investigating the army.

08:40.000 --> 08:51.000
And it must have seemed human, because when Adam talked nasty about China some kind of a blackmail spread, it must have just been laughable, didn't it?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I don't know if it seemed laughable, sir.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh, it just couldn't move you, could it?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I mean, there couldn't move you, didn't it?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
And it caused...

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't think it's all he was saying was that he was a young soldier that was micro overseas,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
and the millions of others had, isn't that right?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
No, sir, if he was saying that, that would have been fine. That isn't what he was saying.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Well, he was saying that he might have more with these husbands?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
No, sir, it didn't happen that way at all.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Well, we know...

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
That was the least hard of what he was saying.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
He was nasty about private China, possibly the emblem on overseas.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
No, sir, not at all.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
So, wasn't it something to be effective if you didn't all offer me investigations by guys, shines after go overseas?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
It was, I'd say, I'd say all close to them at the right.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
A little close, sir.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
And that didn't pay you, did it?

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
That didn't have the slightest effect on you, did it?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I don't know what you mean by the slightest effect.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Well, it couldn't affect you, couldn't it?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
A little talk about somebody going overseas in uniform?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
No, that didn't affect me, sir.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
It could lead me to feel what I remember.

09:58.000 --> 10:10.000
Mr. Adams, suggesting that Mr. Karr or I, with the influence in our action by what they did or did not do, what's reckoned to do, what's reckoned to China or anybody else.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
And it wasn't even important enough to put him in your memorandum, sir.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
So, isn't he asking that no as far as importance is concerned?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Mr. Adams was stating me, I can take care of myself, I did not put it in a memorandum.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Well, it wasn't important enough, to ensure it wasn't.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I don't know what he could say with important enough to include or not.

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
He put in this little kickcat about a New York law, like I thought New York about a law事 parker ship, didn't he, I did, sir?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
And you knew that was supposed to be kickcat.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
You know what I was in that, well, in any of that, that went into the memorandum, didn't you, sir?

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
But that nasty blackmailing said about China didn't get him at all, did it?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
No, I did not put it into it.

10:50.000 --> 10:59.000
Mr. Cohn, I want to turn to private time and the words he did at Fort Dick.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Let me see if I can get this thing in perspective.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
He went to work for the committee of Alclam.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Oh, January of February.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Well, when we say February 1st is fairly accurate.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
So, he went to February and Mark, for the committee.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
April, I think you and me were in New York, is that right?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
That's right.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
And that work would be the concluded why you and they are on your return.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
No, it's never expected to be put out.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
But it wasn't a part of the hangover job that Mr. Cohn suffered.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Well, I thought that word hangover could be misunderstood.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I beg you, sir.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
I'm, I'm, I'm, I can't believe you.

11:46.000 --> 11:54.000
What I'm trying to get at is that as the pile of work that Shine had on hand,

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
what he had to do after he went at Fort Dick, not what's connected with that European trip, etc.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
So, that's the expense there was, some of it was connected with the investigation of which the trip was a part.

12:07.000 --> 12:15.000
Well, and then the end of, in any of the, and such work as I had, had piled up and was undone by the time that he was in duck.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
It came either from the month of February or March.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Did any come from those two?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
It came from the entire period of time, the entire period.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
So that, and even some from April then, is that right?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yes, sir.

12:31.000 --> 12:40.000
So for you, February, March, April, May and June, he had five months of work before you knew at the first of July that he was going into the arms.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
So he had July, August, September and October, to get cleaned up in, didn't he?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
For the question that's it.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Well, now let's go and let's be fair with each other.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
You'd had five months of work, fire to the time you knew he was going into the arms.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Yes, he didn't want to come any five months.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
And it turned out that there was four months between the time that you knew he was going in and the time he actually went in.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
That right, sir.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
So that he had four months in which to get his work, got even.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Wasn't quite that way, sir.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
No.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Well, it seems to be, it had to be just that way if he could read the calendar.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Let me try it once more.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
No, let me try it simply with you.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
He had five months in which work to the time that he was going to file.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Is that right?

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
In January, February, March, April, May, as a matter of fact, he mostly could say four months because April was a ball.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
He was a ball.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
That was a question of work piling up and so forth.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Well, do you have a minute to answer?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
No, sir, it was a question of that either.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
You were...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
No, it's one of the other.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
He's in the job all the work that he has down, or he's got time to work that you're handing to him.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
It's one of the other.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
No.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Well, then he's got all the work he's continuing on.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
It can't be anything but those three, you got it.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I'd be glad to say what it was.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Well, let me use the rest.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
When you mind using mine, it's just when you've lost the mouse.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
You've got some old work that is down, that's one thing you can have.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Is that right?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
It's a puzzle.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
And he's got some old work that he's continuing on.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Is that right?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
That's the thing.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Oh, that's right.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And he's got some new work.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
That does it.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Sure.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Now, do you give him new work?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
I don't think he gave him the word.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
The answer then is no.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
The answer is no.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
That's so simple, Miss.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm afraid it isn't just the word.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Well, do you even get all the answers?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yes.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Why do we have so much trouble?

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
I don't think I have the trouble with anybody else.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
The answer is this.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
We did not give him work on new and he got the gates.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Not a new, not a single new assignment.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
It isn't that way, Miss.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
You know.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
It can be that way.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Did you give him a single new assignment?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Did you answer to that, no?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Well, I'm trying to tell you what to articulate.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Answer that one.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
You didn't give him a new assignment.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
That's it.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Wasn't a question of answer.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
What do you...

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
The question now is,

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
did you work against him?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
He gave me that new assignment.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm trying to tell you what happened with the work.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I just want an awkward gave him a new assignment.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm trying to tell you.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
And it's just calling a lot of people are listening to it.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Tell us whether or not you gave him a new assignment.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I'm trying to tell you just what I did.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Well, I'll be telling that if you give him a new assignment.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
They left the no, Mr. Paul.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
The answer to the question is, no, we did not.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
No, we made...

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Is that the answer?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
It's not the complete one, sir.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Well, no but, and no but why?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
No but, I did give him a little one.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Well, Mr. Walsh, if you want to give the answer to Walsh,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
give that to your life, I do.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I want to know whether or not you gave him a new assignment.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Will you tell me yesterday, no?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
If you did.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I'll try to tell you what happened.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Will you give it yesterday, no?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I think you'll ask me to explain this door here.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So I've been trying to build the assignment.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
What is it? Yes or no?

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
The answer is we did not give him any assignments on new investigations.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
He continued work, which he had been doing on investigations,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
which were immense fires of that period of time.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Then the answers could have been given to me about two or a clock

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
that he didn't give him any new assignments, is that right?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I'm afraid it might not have been answered.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Well, it would be perfectly accurate.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
I didn't ask to whether he was going to continue to want to go or not.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I wanted to go if he had a new assignment.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Now, the answer is no.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
The answer is no.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
The answer is that there were no new investigations on which he worked.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
He continued working on the one which he had been working on.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
The investigation?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I understand this from how that.

16:33.000 --> 16:41.000
I would like that people who know that the gentleman's fellow has now tied up on a door

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
with a bell.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
It's very important.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Otherwise, he would be with it.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
That is the floor of the fence.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Thank you.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I'm very, very excited.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Let's go.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm in the afternoon.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
The line of threatening to do so is well about the work that the scientist has done.

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
I see you have had some difficulty in timing times to make the kind of an answer you want

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
to make so that the whole story will be told.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
Now, the senator from Illinois is not particularly in the left of him.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
The technicalities of the yes or no answer I would like to know myself.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
So now it's as though you responded that question in my time until that.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
So, we saw it.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Thank you for the opportunity, Senator Jackson.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
After with the parents that Sean was showing in the service, I already called it.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
We did not give them work as though on any new investigation.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
There were certain numbers of investigations already on the way of which he had worked.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
He continued his work on those investigations until the very time he went in.

18:17.000 --> 18:27.000
After he was in the service on a small number of occasions, we had to get some information from him about witnesses and things on which he had worked and we did that.

18:27.000 --> 18:38.000
And he helped write the reports on an investigation which he and he along had primary responsibility for and knew all the facts about.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
After an attempt on our part to get to know me and to write the report was on the set.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
I think that's about the thumb and thumb of the whole thing.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
The telephone is here.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I'll send him a text.

18:54.000 --> 19:02.000
Just one question Mr. Stone when I came on the phone with a text in the question, but I enough to,

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
as finally as fast as a little communist dentist could be important.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
I was talking on the page three hours seven on a foot of a canvas book to be witnessed.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
And he also testified upon this matter.

19:19.000 --> 19:35.000
There's a track that one of the top communist agents who doing a clinical chamber which worked was a dentist who had an office from place that I believe I'm in.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I don't know which of the address was in New York.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
We stored him in the door with that sound like a doctor was relatively ugly.

19:43.000 --> 20:01.000
And that was used as a meeting place for coming with that, you know, at the agent because they could basically go to a dentist, have their teeth worked upon, leased and not much suspected of that.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
That's right.

20:04.000 --> 20:14.000
The fact that this gentleman coming to the front was a death of what Mr. Welk saw at the moment.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.000
We're putting him according to the Canadian Royal Commission, according to the witnesses.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
He advised me more dangerous positions.

20:25.000 --> 20:47.000
A much more dangerous position, as though you were merely the commanding officer of a company because if you were planning off for a company to go down to private to the community and talk to him, the thing that doesn't anyone from the general down to private to the community and the stuff,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
that matters with him that he could pass on, unless you know this.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
And Mr. Pryor's plan was called, refused to tell us.

20:55.000 --> 21:06.000
For the number one, he was forming, coming to the cells, at the camp, silvers, and number two, and I may be wrong to live.

21:06.000 --> 21:14.000
As I recall, he also refused to tell us, he was ultimately self-confirmalized, he was made to privilege.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
For the number one, he was engaged and espionized, and at the time we saw him before the commission.

21:22.000 --> 21:29.000
I think it's right about that latter, Senator and executive session that occurred to me. He didn't involve the personnel in unquestionable, concerning that.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
I stopped the investigation directly, but I think that's right.

21:32.000 --> 21:43.000
So then when a senator goes on a plan of four, he'll ridicule the fact that you come up with, they've come to us, who's mean yes, that's it.

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
Either he is exceming naive, or someone is planting the words and he's not.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Yes, sir.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Another further, Mr. Pryor.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Hello.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
I'm half a week, with a little in the candidate.

22:06.000 --> 22:15.000
One senator goes ahead and then gives a last sentence, because I was having a whispered calligraphy with your senator.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
Did I understand you to say that Mr. Cine wrote?

22:21.000 --> 22:35.000
Mr. Cine, I think it was a sociable, tolerately, it was just a tolerately dealing, completely, at harm's length in regards to how much it's a threat from the nearer.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And you have the availability of the weapons?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
That's right.

22:39.000 --> 22:53.000
I didn't need to indicate that senator, that I wouldn't like to have a television audience think that wealth and mortality were colloquializing and anything, because so far we definitely have not.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I understand, senator.

22:55.000 --> 23:07.000
The position in life, I thought, that in spite of these, time I wish I had, and the time you obviously had, we cannot in this room be friends there.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Mr. Cine?

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
I didn't quite get what you said about time writing the report.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
We can get that red background shirt for this.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Well, it's a counter to the entity, wills.

23:19.000 --> 23:32.000
So I said that he helped write the report, which were reports, submitted by the committee on an investigation, and the court was trying to vote for the work and thought that he knew more about it.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Where did he do that writing?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I think that's in New York.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
In New York?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yes, sir.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
On the leaves?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
On the leaves?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Yes, sir.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
And what adjects in New York?

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
That is, at home, a lot of times he worked up for home with my family.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
He worked at his office on occasion, I imagine.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
And was Mr. Nogifer?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I don't know that he worked at the Nogifer, not.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
I know that he's rolled out a script deal with itself in long-hand.

24:03.000 --> 24:13.000
Before the end of the weekend, I would usually go over it and make changes and type it up on my typewriter, and then it would be sent down to Frank Cox.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
I don't think I didn't use the Nogifer.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I don't think that he did.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
Well, were you with Mr. Shion when he was on these leaves that were?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Yes, on a lot of occasions we worked together.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
And now on hot occasions this year, at home.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Why do you use the dilator?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
No, I don't.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
Are you going to be able to tell us when you were with him when he was out of four days?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I can give you a general idea, Mr. Welfare.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Well, let's begin with the...

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I can't give it to you a minute by minute.

24:43.000 --> 24:52.000
Let's begin with the eighth consecutive day that began with his induction on November 3rd in Lamb to November 10th.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Well, he wasn't for six centuries.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I'm sorry?

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
He was not at four.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Oh, no, he was assigned to New York for work with the committee.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
That's right.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
Now how did he spend like that?

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
Did he spend all of those days and left the consecutive month on Sunday with you?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
I thought we called her.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
I think that on some of those days we were having hearings down in New York and I think he was over at those hearings.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
All those hearings?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I think so, sir.

25:21.000 --> 25:28.000
You mean he was just over at him being a hearing when he ought to be working on this the old stuff?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I mean, oh, that won't do it at all, Mr. Cohn.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Oh, sorry, Mr. Playsman.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
You mean the county's adjourning the week beginning to be November 3rd?

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
Mr. Cohn was sitting around at some cross-guilling?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Is that right?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
I think he was.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
How many days left week for these two to hear that hearing?

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
I think I'd have to tell you how many...

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
I don't know, just two or three, whatever, why?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
All the evening.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Oh, have they hearing with Anna?

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
I told you they're there.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
And not working at all on his house or hearing work, Mr. Cohn?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Oh, what?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
That's not your name?

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
Sorry, he wasn't that they hearing for his amusing.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
No, but he's got the hearing.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
That's a funny place to work.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
He wouldn't have a stenographer in there, just think you or Woody.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
It might be a funny place.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Maybe it's Miss Lane, Mr. Cohn.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
Did he have a pad on his lap and would writing these long-hand things while he sat at the hearing?

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
So you might think hearing's a funny place to work, but I'm afraid that about 99% of our work

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
does get done at hearing.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah?

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
But Miss Lane, you were supposed to be working on that incident, come out of hearing.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
It's much earlier than that, wasn't it?

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Mr. Cohn, is that actually physical?

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
Oh, what Johnny did when the second area of the Army got involved in a fort,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
so he just worked on committee matters.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It's one of the things he did.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
It's a really difficult one.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Oh, I wouldn't say it's difficult, it's one of the things he did.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
One of the things he did was to get that listen to the test, and Woody.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Oh, I think that's the hearing, is that right?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I don't think he just sat in listen to this.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Well, he wasn't examining the witnesses.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Sorry, well, might've been said.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
You want to tell us that?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
That he might've been in listen to that?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Yeah.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I'll tell you that.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
He did have many occasions.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
He very well might've met.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Remember, sir?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
The ones at the left, he's very well might've.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Honest, Mr. Cohn.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Oh, what is that?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
I don't know.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I don't know.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
I don't know.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
What?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
I need to.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Honest?

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
What is that?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
He's got many witnesses doing that, we...

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
He's very well might've met.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Well, Mr. Cohn, I'm not the trouble, but he had to file off.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Got a work.

27:39.000 --> 27:46.000
And that you had to get somebody on the level of the sanitary of the Army to get him also into the finish.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Is that what I understood?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Is that what I understood?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
I'm not.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
Didn't he do anything on the pile that worked during those seven goals and days when you had him in New York?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Yes, he did.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
What did he do during those seven goals and days besides sitting in the hearings and listening to the testimony?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Sir, it was not a question of sitting in the hearings.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
You know what he was sitting in the hearings.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Go where he's standing all the time.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Sir, I was sitting in the hearings.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
Sir, I was sitting in the hearings, sir, and I don't think that I'm fired.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
I wasn't doing any work.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
I'm not the person that you're calling me if you weren't doing any work.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
I think sir, you have a reputation working very hard over some understanding.

28:21.000 --> 28:31.000
But you know who you are now that under these circumstances, Mr. Cohn was due to be as busy as a being.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
These are bullying.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Thank you.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I beg your pardon.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
I beg your pardon, sir, by him that it's after you knew him and I all have mixed up me.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Let me try it all over again.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Absolutely, Harry.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
You know that Mr. Cohn was supposed to be busy, don't you?

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
At the hearings.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
At the time, the hearings were going wrong.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yes sir.

28:55.000 --> 29:09.000
You've got a sexual discrimination from the United States Army that lets you come up and work on this people's work that you couldn't get finished between July when you knew he was going into the Army and November when he did go.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Isn't that right, sir?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It's right to be honest, sir.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
Now do you want to tell me that because you were at the hearings, time couldn't you work?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
No, it's right on.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
He's an old accountant, he's in life.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Very good.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Are you in this case?

29:25.000 --> 29:40.000
As a matter of fact, Mr. Cohn, did you ever see him with a stenographer dictating anything to her after November 3rd and until he finished the court day?

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I don't recall that I did this, but you never did.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
Did you ever see him, Mr. Cohn, with a dictating machine in front of him?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I don't think he ever used to be right.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Now aren't we all old enough to know?

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
I have seen him write a lot of material, aren't we all old enough to know?

30:00.000 --> 30:09.000
I told him that if you were in the Russian, this modern world about living something, the way they get us down is to have a secretary.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Is that correct, sir?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
That's certainly one way.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
And another way is to have a dictating machine, from sir, I just want to have a second way, sir.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Might be a second way, but I guess I do my work for third work.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Now let me ask you this.

30:23.000 --> 30:36.000
Wouldn't a very good way to adopt this trestling work done, wouldn't it have been a good way to do it in the room that General Ryan set out for you at four things?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Not particularly good.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Would it have been a beautiful way to do it, wouldn't it?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Nothing.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
What's wrong with the room down there?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
So there's nothing wrong with the room down there?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Thank you.
