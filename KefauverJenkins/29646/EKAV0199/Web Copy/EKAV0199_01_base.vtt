WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I was being made available for committee work.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.900
And I certainly were not a judge of private service

00:08.900 --> 00:10.040
that's the default at work.

00:10.040 --> 00:14.600
And so therefore I felt that although the resentment

00:14.600 --> 00:18.080
did exist, private service was being made available

00:18.080 --> 00:19.920
for important committee work and the passage work

00:19.920 --> 00:21.480
justifies.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.520
Now I understand from your testimony

00:23.520 --> 00:27.160
that private shine made a good soldier in supply

00:27.160 --> 00:32.160
of scaring off the training assignments given to him.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.480
Not a word, I assume the qualified

00:34.480 --> 00:37.880
as an expert marksman with AM1.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.800
Yes, that's not an expert, but very close to the expert,

00:40.800 --> 00:42.760
a very high score for that week of fire.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.720
And any event, I mean as far as carrying out

00:44.720 --> 00:49.320
the training part of the specific training assignments,

00:49.320 --> 00:50.920
he performed very well.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.480
Yes, there are no circumstances of his being frequently

00:53.480 --> 00:55.160
absent evening for committee meetings

00:55.160 --> 00:58.240
and doing extra work before I'm available.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.600
But the main difficulty in that you found with private shine

01:01.600 --> 01:04.800
was the attitude toward you and the officers

01:04.800 --> 01:09.280
and towards his fellow trainees in general

01:09.280 --> 01:12.080
or what, how would you summarize that?

01:12.080 --> 01:15.160
Yes, that's the way I would summarize it.

01:15.160 --> 01:19.040
For instance, on the 30th of November,

01:19.040 --> 01:20.920
Lieutenant Gabriolkkiy my executive officer

01:20.920 --> 01:25.000
was paying private shine and both to private shine

01:25.000 --> 01:28.840
and morale fact that connected with private shine passes.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.600
And private shine said that his work worked

01:31.600 --> 01:34.600
with much more importance than morale of the company.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.480
And I felt that in passing this remark

01:37.480 --> 01:40.400
to Lieutenant Gabriolkkiy, the thing got some currency

01:40.400 --> 01:44.200
in the company and I thought it was an underwise statement.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.960
Again, on the fourth of January,

01:45.960 --> 01:49.000
when I was speaking with my unit administrator,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.600
the unit administrators, again mentioned the morale fact

01:52.600 --> 01:56.080
when the company intended by private shine activity.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.840
And the unit administrator mentioned the number

01:59.840 --> 02:02.400
of 250 men in the company and private shine said

02:02.400 --> 02:05.400
that he wasn't worried about the morale of 250 men.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.560
He was worried about the morale of 160 million people.

02:08.560 --> 02:15.240
And that sort of a comment I didn't consider a good taste.

02:15.240 --> 02:19.720
Captain, did you or your platoon sergeant

02:19.720 --> 02:23.560
in his platoon or the platoon leader, the lieutenant,

02:23.560 --> 02:27.040
or your executive officer, other than what you just mentioned,

02:27.040 --> 02:30.040
receive any complaints about his attitudes

02:30.040 --> 02:33.040
and any complaints about morale in the company

02:33.040 --> 02:36.040
as a result of his thing there?

02:36.040 --> 02:38.240
I feel under circumstances morale

02:38.240 --> 02:41.560
was not affected to any great degree

02:41.560 --> 02:46.280
because I had only one AWOL during the entire training cycle.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.560
I had no complaints at all to the environmental chaplain

02:50.560 --> 02:52.720
concerning anything went on in the company.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.640
And I consider that an indication of morale.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.000
Now, you heard the testimony yesterday of Lieutenant Blount,

02:59.000 --> 03:00.240
where you hear yesterday.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.840
Yes or no?

03:01.840 --> 03:05.920
To what do you attribute Mr. Kuhn alleged remarks

03:05.920 --> 03:10.480
to Lieutenant Blount, which Lieutenant Blount testified to,

03:10.480 --> 03:14.480
by telephone that you had not treated shine

03:14.480 --> 03:21.360
as he felt he should be and that he was not going to forget your need?

03:21.360 --> 03:23.960
What do you attribute that to that?

03:23.960 --> 03:26.680
Allegedly marked, I say alleged because it's only

03:26.680 --> 03:29.800
been testified to by Lieutenant Blount,

03:29.800 --> 03:31.600
the connection to telephone conversation

03:31.600 --> 03:33.920
that he received from Roy Kuhn.

03:33.920 --> 03:38.680
So I could have said, did you or anything

03:38.680 --> 03:43.040
done to carry that out that you knew him?

03:43.040 --> 03:44.280
Would you testify there?

03:44.280 --> 03:48.680
Well, I mean, did you hear the testimony yesterday

03:48.680 --> 03:51.040
in which Lieutenant Blount testified

03:51.040 --> 03:57.000
that Mr. Kuhn had indicated that he would not forget your name.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.760
And I believe Colonel Ringler, I assume he's your regimental commander.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.920
And maybe there was some other name.

04:03.920 --> 04:09.200
I see no connection with the telephone conversation.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.040
Nothing has happened.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.960
Nothing happened after that alleged conversation

04:13.960 --> 04:15.000
as far as your concern.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.200
Love, sir.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.560
You're just about as kind of a friend.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.960
I'm just going to say, now it's Captain.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.600
Well, I don't consider that significant.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.480
Or at that point, if the two of us remark

04:25.480 --> 04:26.960
it doesn't apply to the matter, how?

04:26.960 --> 04:29.560
Well, I didn't make the remark Captain.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.280
What's the rest?

04:30.280 --> 04:32.280
Well, I think it all finished.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.400
We ought to point out that the whole division was

04:34.400 --> 04:37.360
the motive and the nitrogen should be the mission to the 69.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.200
Well, Captain, I think that it's fair to say

04:40.200 --> 04:44.560
that one of them command a company under the table

04:44.560 --> 04:48.040
of organization, rates the rank of a captain.

04:48.040 --> 04:48.760
Is that correct?

04:48.760 --> 04:49.400
Yes, sir.

04:49.400 --> 04:56.440
Oh, and you were actually doing a captain's job

04:56.440 --> 04:59.800
as the first lieutenant for a while, correct?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
That is correct, sir.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.840
When did you enter the army?

05:03.840 --> 05:08.920
I entered the army first in March the 15th, 1943.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.120
You've been in continuously since then.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.120
And also, I have not.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.000
I had a period in civilian life pursuing my education

05:15.000 --> 05:16.160
at the University of Pennsylvania.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.560
I would be called the active duty for the Korean War

05:19.560 --> 05:21.920
before completing my work for a degree.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.320
You served in Korea?

05:23.320 --> 05:23.840
Yes, sir.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.840
And in World War II.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.840
In World War II and Europe, we held the two leaders.

05:28.840 --> 05:32.120
In World War II, I went to tell that medic in Korea.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.080
I was a coordinator in the ninth assembly regiment.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.920
It's all.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.200
And it's right, sir.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.240
Mr. Chairman of the Fourth Amendment, sir.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.480
And in the cabin?

05:41.480 --> 05:44.600
I'd like to make a request of the members,

05:44.600 --> 05:46.480
like you may be, not as members of the subcommittee,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.480
but as members of the Fourth Amendment.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.600
I just want to talk to Senator Nolan.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.600
And he tells me that he would like to let get all the administration

05:54.600 --> 05:58.040
battles out of our committee, like on the floor.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.840
And be disclosed, though, before the final rest of work.

06:01.840 --> 06:02.600
It'll be impossible.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.320
I'm trying to do that as I like to do this.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.600
I mean, sneering for over.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.720
Therefore, I'm calling a meeting of the Fourth Committee.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.240
I have a 30-to-30 afternoon.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.760
So it's just the, especially the administration

06:14.760 --> 06:21.560
bill, trust the three citations of people

06:21.560 --> 06:23.880
joining the backgrounds where we're

06:23.880 --> 06:25.520
moved in contempt for the subcommittee.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.160
And I know that that's an imposition

06:27.160 --> 06:30.040
upon the members of this committee that work all day.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.000
But I just think of the right for going.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And let's be whole evening meetings for the Fourth Committee.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.240
We never can get the important legislation on the floor.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.120
It'll be held up to badly.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.560
And I do personally members of this committee can

06:43.560 --> 06:46.600
go as in the final 30-to-30 meeting of the Fourth Committee.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.880
I hope it won't last any more than two hours of the month.

06:53.080 --> 06:53.920
And enjoy.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.400
And enjoy, sir.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.080
Mr. Chairman, I'm off the desk.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.560
As I'm a part of the year, just a follow-away coming

07:00.560 --> 07:02.160
from the Fourth Amendment.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.760
Ready to make a feel to you is determined to confer

07:05.760 --> 07:09.480
with the council of all the international parties.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.600
The senior committee is not possible to expedite these years.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.000
That day is the 21st of New Year's Day.

07:16.000 --> 07:16.800
But for now, it's right.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.400
Being along without taking orange up there is hard-grang.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.160
There are five senators, high-pups,

07:23.160 --> 07:25.000
that distribute four members of the committee

07:25.000 --> 07:28.120
and Senator McIntyre, who should be working

07:28.120 --> 07:31.200
many hours every day in attending meetings

07:31.200 --> 07:33.360
in all of the appropriations committee

07:33.360 --> 07:35.320
and the subcommittee.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.040
Some of our subcommittees are marking

07:38.040 --> 07:41.400
a challenging, hyper-indulatory, important legislation

07:41.400 --> 07:43.240
that's morning of the Fourth Committee.

07:43.240 --> 07:47.160
On appropriations is considering a very important meal.

07:47.160 --> 07:51.760
And here, we are, the very same I would like your excuse.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.360
So will the moving hearings of the Fourth Committee

07:54.360 --> 07:58.920
on time spending and to consider as a military budget

07:58.920 --> 08:00.680
for the coming fiscal year?

08:00.680 --> 08:04.160
It seems to me that the American people have reached

08:04.160 --> 08:07.560
the point where they realize we cannot justify

08:07.560 --> 08:10.760
devoting days and weeks and weeks

08:10.760 --> 08:15.240
in such a thing as this, which certainly does not

08:15.240 --> 08:18.400
be matching importance, titlework,

08:18.400 --> 08:22.720
about appropriations committee, and other work of the Senate.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.880
And likewise, I think we ought to try to release

08:25.880 --> 08:28.520
the officials of the department beyond,

08:28.520 --> 08:30.280
so they can get back to work.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.000
We have important prisoners that find out the date.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.360
And I think that if you host the members of the subcommittee

08:37.360 --> 08:39.920
and the chairman and the council, then may they

08:39.920 --> 08:43.120
change share and diligent efforts

08:43.120 --> 08:46.720
for a tight date for terminating these work.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.880
Thank you.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.680
I believe you have a much better explanation

08:50.680 --> 08:53.200
here and without talking about expediting it.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.520
And we didn't listen all our time,

08:54.520 --> 08:56.080
expediting the hearings in line.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.080
And I will return any charge about taking time

08:59.080 --> 09:01.280
to talk about expediting the hearings.

09:01.280 --> 09:04.240
Day after day, I have refrain from taking up

09:04.240 --> 09:07.480
the time of witnesses because it seems to me

09:07.480 --> 09:10.120
we are dealing with a lot of inconsequential things

09:10.120 --> 09:13.520
and calling in witnesses who testimony doesn't seem to have

09:13.520 --> 09:18.000
much of sparing on the determination of the dispute

09:18.000 --> 09:21.200
with the committee's charge to a duty.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.840
Sheriff, he spends a night of hoes making no charges

09:23.840 --> 09:24.520
of any kind.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.440
He's simply recording, we spent one whole day

09:26.440 --> 09:28.720
talking about expediting the hearings and got no place.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.120
Sorry, well, very well.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.280
We're simply playing out now.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.080
We are making it.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.320
And we, I think, got a rapid headway.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.520
We're following our understanding with the party

09:37.520 --> 09:39.240
because it is useless to well-desert

09:39.240 --> 09:40.920
that they can then be called.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.040
There are other witnesses and as soon as the Army case

09:43.040 --> 09:45.400
has been presented, to the other side,

09:45.400 --> 09:47.520
which I hope will be sometimes today.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.800
Just for the day, the 41, the 41, the 41,

09:49.800 --> 09:51.000
the other side, the percentage of cases

09:51.000 --> 09:51.600
was the same.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
And now it's not.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.080
Mr. Chairman.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.960
Mr. Chairman, may I just say that I agree

09:55.960 --> 09:58.240
with some of the two, the watchful, personally?

09:58.240 --> 10:02.920
I think the view taken less time, as much as any man here

10:02.920 --> 10:05.320
to plan, get the show off the road night

10:05.320 --> 10:08.800
once you've come for money and for that.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.320
I have questions.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.320
Can we go back to it?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.320
Come in.

10:13.320 --> 10:17.800
Well, I'll have to sign it.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.720
Well, Mr. Chairman, with respect to the delays,

10:22.720 --> 10:25.200
I would like to respectfully point out

10:25.200 --> 10:28.160
to my friend and distinguished.

10:28.160 --> 10:33.160
Senator Pomito holds that he boarded to delay

10:33.160 --> 10:37.000
the hearings for a week.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.760
And all the Democrats boarded to keep the hearings going.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.160
Senator, may I ask the senator to you?

10:43.160 --> 10:44.520
I will always be glad to hear.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.520
My condolences.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.920
The members of the subcommittee

10:46.920 --> 10:48.640
to bring us our conference in attention

10:48.640 --> 10:49.640
to quite a section.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.040
Very important questions.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.840
May I ask the senator then, if that is his impression

10:53.840 --> 10:56.360
is that we would recess the hearings until the appropriation

10:56.360 --> 10:57.280
of the bill would be over and then,

10:57.280 --> 10:59.280
Stoner would be termed.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.360
That's what we spoke.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.760
Post-ponged the hearings and followed

11:02.760 --> 11:03.960
with a Congress of jurors.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.640
And when the subcommittee can remain here

11:05.640 --> 11:06.840
and continue the hearings.

11:06.840 --> 11:13.360
I can't believe he's going to ask questions of the list.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.280
I have a comment about it, but I didn't hear any.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.280
We will expert that in with my.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.840
I appreciate the fact that the chairman would like

11:19.840 --> 11:21.000
to get the hearings going.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I have 10 minutes.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.280
I respectfully like to say that the chair also voted

11:24.280 --> 11:27.200
to postpone hearings over 10,000 minutes.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.200
A few days ago.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.120
Well, therefore, with that premise,

11:30.120 --> 11:33.440
I'd like to ask the colleague,

11:33.440 --> 11:36.160
from Idaho, that he can prepare to spend 21 days hearing

11:36.160 --> 11:38.000
one side of the case, and then recess,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
or right to the other side.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.120
Certainly, I do not want that time to be.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.560
The chairman is helping to make sure that the committee

11:46.560 --> 11:47.360
is on the base.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
The president of the witnesses

11:48.360 --> 11:50.760
can have a political debate on the floor of the Senate.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.960
All right, the radio will be kept parallel in time.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.120
All right.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.160
Some of the time, we should ask your questions.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.120
I would like to respectfully ask the chair,

11:59.120 --> 12:01.200
how much more of my ten minutes he would like to have,

12:01.200 --> 12:04.160
because I'd be glad to yield his order.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.560
Take it all up at the pair of open doors.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.680
The next witness.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.960
Alive to have we now have the chairman back in the merry

12:09.960 --> 12:11.000
move that we all like.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.320
I'd like to ask the witness, did you say

12:19.320 --> 12:22.280
that flight of China was AWL on the New Year's Eve,

12:22.280 --> 12:23.480
Captain Miller?

12:23.480 --> 12:24.800
Yes, sir, I did.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.640
Who did you report it to?

12:26.640 --> 12:29.640
To the adjunct who reported to the Regimental Commander, sir.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.800
To who?

12:30.800 --> 12:32.040
To the Regimental Commander, sir.

12:32.040 --> 12:32.640
I'm sorry.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.920
I'm sorry, Senator McClellan was caught in.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.000
I didn't hear your answer.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.360
I telephoned the adjunct of the Regimental

12:38.360 --> 12:40.120
who reported it to the Regimental Commander, sir.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.040
Who is he?

12:41.040 --> 12:42.880
Colonel Earl Alive's wing writer.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.960
And what did he do about it?

12:44.960 --> 12:48.040
He called the report to be made to Colonel Lyonser.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.320
And what did General Lyon do about it?

12:50.320 --> 12:55.280
General Lyon stated that the private sign was to be left home

12:55.280 --> 12:57.560
and that there was a possibility

12:57.560 --> 13:00.680
of a misunderstanding which might be a true hit

13:00.680 --> 13:02.560
on Monday morning.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.400
And if a member of the committee

13:05.400 --> 13:10.000
called for a private sign for committee business,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.040
that he would be high-spent passed

13:12.040 --> 13:13.800
and made available for that work.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.120
He was saying, no, remember this committee

13:15.120 --> 13:16.400
stands gotten touched with you.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.680
Did you know that they're gotten touched

13:17.680 --> 13:20.480
with your high authority at Camp Dix today, John?

13:20.480 --> 13:22.520
I've found this out subsequently, sir.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.040
So subsequently, to what?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.400
To the weekend, sir.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.960
Well, while private sign was on the base or afterwards.

13:28.960 --> 13:32.040
Afterwards, sir.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.680
Now, I'd like to ask this question.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.360
What effect did these passes have?

13:36.360 --> 13:39.000
Excess passes as a gains average on the morale

13:39.000 --> 13:42.280
and the platoon or the company that you were in charge of?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.960
As I stated, the statistical indications were

13:44.960 --> 13:47.360
that there was no material effect upon the morale.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.280
There was no cover resultant by the trainees.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.480
Because I would say private myself for a couple of years

13:52.480 --> 13:54.200
and that anything that he would have

13:54.200 --> 13:57.760
gets the I don't get at the private service.

13:57.760 --> 14:02.040
And there was this resentment.

14:02.040 --> 14:06.560
It got to me through rumor and to report.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.800
And I don't know if it's effective.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.040
Most of the people in your company in that case,

14:14.040 --> 14:16.760
they, the trainees are all inductees.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.640
They are all new civilian elders.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.800
What is the average age?

14:21.800 --> 14:25.040
The average is about 19, now sir.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.440
But it is much as private sign was considerably older

14:27.440 --> 14:28.800
than the others.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.440
Wouldn't that normally put him in a position of leadership

14:31.440 --> 14:33.120
with respect to the company?

14:33.120 --> 14:37.360
Yes, I expect to use quake care and judgment

14:37.360 --> 14:39.880
and handling of a judgment-revaculous trip

14:39.880 --> 14:41.360
with the other trainees.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.200
Well, wouldn't that maybe justify some of the things

14:44.200 --> 14:49.080
which he did that you felt were out of order or improper?

14:49.080 --> 14:51.880
That you mentioned in what way?

14:51.880 --> 14:56.200
Didn't the younger men look up to him for leadership?

14:56.200 --> 14:58.880
No, sir, I don't believe that that was the case by the time

14:58.880 --> 15:01.240
with that squad leader.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.720
No further questions.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.120
Well, the next question is, shall we return to our studio

15:05.120 --> 15:06.640
to cost the country to permit our station

15:06.640 --> 15:08.880
to identify themselves?

15:08.880 --> 15:13.200
This is ABC, Tom Abishan, Nuttford.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.320
Most of the fans have three top thrillers for it and that

15:16.320 --> 15:18.240
have 7.30 feet in touch amongst the best

15:18.240 --> 15:19.720
starring Tom Connay.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.360
If 9.30 AMP Playhouse presents devil's other names

15:22.360 --> 15:25.480
starring Arthur Frank and a 10.30 foreign intrigued

15:25.480 --> 15:28.200
TV privately vegetaries starring James Daly

15:28.200 --> 15:32.560
for the American Channel 7.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.320
Equip!

15:33.320 --> 15:34.200
Perfect rest, Mattress.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.400
Regularly 59.75, now 39.75.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.760
Save $40 with Equip.

15:38.760 --> 15:44.720
That's really one A-Wall during that cycle.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.840
And that A-Wall was a young man who had finished

15:47.840 --> 15:50.840
who was the lengthened and had spent some time

15:50.840 --> 15:52.240
in form school.

15:52.240 --> 15:56.080
And it was blown in the fortune that he was a man who was likely

15:56.080 --> 15:59.160
to sell a wall so that I didn't consider that indicative

15:59.160 --> 16:01.560
of negative morale.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.480
That don't matter if he's continuing to do the day of this.

16:03.480 --> 16:07.480
Right, and he'll give him back on the morale of your company.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.120
Yes, and in addition, especially the support

16:11.120 --> 16:13.640
which comes from the chapel are indicative of morale.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.320
He may not compensate with that chapel.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.880
And the chapel can turn in four months of indications

16:18.880 --> 16:21.000
of form around our company so that we can take correct

16:21.000 --> 16:22.520
action.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.360
So Mr. Rope?

16:25.360 --> 16:28.840
No, I guess Mr. Metnayce still has it.

16:28.840 --> 16:29.360
That's right.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.160
Yes.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.320
And now I will give this to you.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.720
Mr. Nightseh, you have 10 minutes in which you can interrogate

16:33.720 --> 16:34.720
your list.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.640
If you say.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.280
I have just one question, sir.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.880
I guess it's about a fine one point.

16:39.880 --> 16:42.360
On 31 December, happened, though.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.720
After you discovered by the shines after,

16:48.720 --> 16:52.280
did you take any other action, by referring it to high

16:52.280 --> 16:54.200
authority?

16:54.200 --> 16:56.040
Right, close the telegram to the set,

16:56.040 --> 16:58.520
which is the normal telegram set to anyone

16:58.520 --> 17:02.040
who's on A-Wall must be sent within 24 hours.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.040
I close the data back to private sign.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.160
I arresting him to return for his big face.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.240
Mr. O'Liet, how's Mr. Shannon?

17:09.240 --> 17:11.240
Mr. O'Liet, send him to the garland.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.200
That's a fact.

17:12.200 --> 17:12.960
Yes, sir.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.320
So Captain, if you haven't eaten

17:15.320 --> 17:19.360
a macaroon, Mr. O'Liet, myself, I believe I previously

17:19.360 --> 17:21.040
testified that I had left there.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.440
You've never met anyone, right?

17:22.440 --> 17:23.720
There's no so I have left.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.800
I had anyone of us ever asked you for a influential treatment

17:28.800 --> 17:30.360
of any kind for private sign.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.840
No, so you have not.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.960
I see.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.400
I have no further questions.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.480
I have a condom attack.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.800
4 or 2, and then I say Captain,

17:38.800 --> 17:43.640
that was my staff here for the last hour and a half

17:43.640 --> 17:45.360
of first letters.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.920
And they say, a third of a year, I had it

17:46.920 --> 17:51.760
to see a Captain, a company commander sitting there

17:51.760 --> 17:53.360
searing a private.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.600
But then I began to think it over and realize

17:55.600 --> 18:00.400
that you must know what happens to even a general who

18:00.400 --> 18:02.240
comes in and gives us all the facts,

18:02.240 --> 18:06.200
and cooperates by glockens, a threat to breaking.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.200
I don't know, he can't testify.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.640
But I'd like to ask you a few questions.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.960
You saw that Mr. Shine was AWOL.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.600
Mr. Ryan on page 3423.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.680
Do you have that sample?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.600
Get 3423, please.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.440
Just a moment, Ryan.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.440
Close the money.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.360
Time out for there.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.360
Get in here.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.280
I'd like to ask you a question.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.200
What's your reference, sir?

18:41.200 --> 18:44.440
Well, Ryan is testifying you

18:44.440 --> 18:46.600
through his conversation with you.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.440
Does that correct?

18:50.520 --> 18:51.720
But for the bottom of the page.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.960
Yes, I've looked at it.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.000
Right.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.040
According to Ryan, he said I asked.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.840
Meaning he asked you a direct reference.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.000
To describe what he asked you, I said,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.240
I believe you're a question.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.760
I don't see the reference, sir.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.880
But I've left me a quote the whole passage.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.240
He says, I asked whether or not

19:15.240 --> 19:17.440
part of a giant out of path.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.000
A rippin' path, when he said, quote, yes.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.800
Part of a giant had a path.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.560
I've been in the military a file myself,

19:25.560 --> 19:28.680
and I've often applied a cut of path

19:28.680 --> 19:30.640
so the way I'm conformed with that path,

19:30.640 --> 19:32.680
he could not be a W.O.L.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.920
I may have to cut a niche line of the path.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.840
Jennifer, I believe that.

19:36.840 --> 19:37.840
I may have to be questioned,

19:37.840 --> 19:40.680
or be a captain of the state.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.520
The question is, I'm a captain.

19:42.520 --> 19:46.680
Well, Mr. Chairman, I believe that question was asked

19:46.680 --> 19:49.040
of Lieutenant Blount and Johnson-Captain Lulla.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.160
I just want the captain explain that,

19:51.160 --> 19:53.160
but I just want to point that out.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.920
Well, that's the matter of the captain.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.240
And who's General Ryan?

19:56.240 --> 19:57.240
Who are we?

19:57.240 --> 19:58.080
That's the kind of problem.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.920
I can handle the question, all right, sir.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.480
May I just get the fact,

20:01.480 --> 20:04.040
this is General Ryan Captain,

20:04.040 --> 20:08.200
it's the gentleman, what is your name again?

20:08.200 --> 20:09.560
Lieutenant Leighton, sir.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.560
Lieutenant Viewer referred to page 3422.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.840
You'll find that the local Lieutenant Blount Captain

20:14.840 --> 20:16.560
is General Ryan.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.160
Oh, sir.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.160
What happened?

20:20.160 --> 20:22.560
I didn't say that, Lieutenant Blount was Captain.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.200
I merely stated that General Ryan was

20:25.200 --> 20:27.320
a suspect, a convoy, and he had

20:27.320 --> 20:30.200
with Lieutenant Blount and not with Lieutenant Lulla.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.160
I think you're right.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.440
I think you're right.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.720
That's what we're going to ask on Captain.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.280
The Ryan apparently was talking about a convoy

20:38.280 --> 20:41.480
that he had with Brown.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.320
Who is Brown?

20:43.320 --> 20:44.640
He is fellow, why is he?

20:44.640 --> 20:47.240
He testified yesterday.

20:47.240 --> 20:50.200
And this was following a convoy

20:50.200 --> 20:52.440
that was Brown had with Viewer.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.360
That's right.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.480
That is correct.

20:54.480 --> 20:58.000
So the Ryan was asking Brown about a conversation

20:58.000 --> 20:59.920
that he had with Viewer.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.480
And when we found this person on the Yes sign

21:03.480 --> 21:06.360
had a path, is that correct?

21:06.360 --> 21:07.760
Good to have you know.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.960
I'll answer the answer, yes.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.440
And then I'll qualify, sir.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.520
Don't don't like the speech too long, but yes.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.000
I'll qualify.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.440
The question was quite long, so I'll

21:16.440 --> 21:18.200
qualify the answer by May.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.600
OK.

21:20.600 --> 21:24.680
The pilot's trying to pass a pass form in his possession,

21:24.680 --> 21:27.600
a pass form that was granted to him

21:27.600 --> 21:30.240
on the first day he was in the company.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.400
I stated to private service that time

21:32.400 --> 21:36.160
that the pass form was for the purpose of proving to people

21:36.160 --> 21:39.640
off post that he was legally unpaid.

21:39.640 --> 21:43.360
And it was not for itself authority to be absent.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.320
I stated to private service authority

21:45.320 --> 21:46.840
was come from higher headquartered.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.640
And this authority had not come.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.280
The path was not anything other than a piece of paper

21:52.280 --> 21:53.360
in his possession.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.840
And, incidentally, if I heard your testimony correctly

21:56.840 --> 22:00.400
as I was reading some material here,

22:00.400 --> 22:03.040
you said that you became angry when you were talking to him

22:03.040 --> 22:06.640
through private sign, and he asked you to lower your voice.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.640
And we now agree that Mr. Cohen does not have a monopoly

22:09.640 --> 22:12.200
if I'm getting angry, but even some people

22:12.200 --> 22:14.000
near me get angry also.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.720
Oh, that's correct.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.680
The pilot.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.200
Now, just one other question was going to act

22:18.200 --> 22:20.080
as an example.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.840
General Ryan, I believe, justified

22:21.840 --> 22:26.480
that there's an inspector general's investigation

22:26.480 --> 22:30.080
of private signs, activities as a result of charges

22:30.080 --> 22:34.080
made by the New York Post.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.840
I assume you're aware of that, I have the investigation.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.120
I answered.

22:38.120 --> 22:45.520
Now, the New York Post had men down at Fort Dick's interviewing

22:48.280 --> 22:51.080
military personnel at that night.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.960
I get the inspector by the doctor.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.000
Did any of the interview you?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.160
No, sir, I interviewed all interviews

22:57.160 --> 22:59.640
because that matter was under investigation

22:59.640 --> 23:01.680
by the inspector general, and I didn't feel

23:01.680 --> 23:03.440
that it was my fault that the inspector filed.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.680
Now, let's get this to the sequence straight.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.200
You said you accused all interviews

23:08.200 --> 23:10.200
because the matter was under investigation.

23:10.200 --> 23:10.720
I did.

23:10.720 --> 23:15.720
And General Ryan said the inspector general's investigation

23:15.720 --> 23:19.080
was a result of charges made by the New York Post.

23:19.080 --> 23:24.800
Their story showed they had men down at Fort Dick interviewing

23:24.800 --> 23:27.520
a ton of things like it, because they need to provide it.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.880
In interviewing people on your post,

23:30.880 --> 23:32.880
the question is that anyone from the New York Post

23:32.880 --> 23:34.240
talked to you.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.080
So no one from the New York Post talked to me.

23:37.080 --> 23:41.160
But did they talk to people in your command?

23:41.160 --> 23:42.040
Yes, they did.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.640
Unfortunately, I was out of reach.

23:44.640 --> 23:49.320
Now, who authorized that particular activity

23:49.320 --> 23:52.320
on the part of the New York Post?

23:52.320 --> 23:53.960
I cannot think there.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.280
Are you aware of the fact that the man who is now

23:56.280 --> 24:01.560
the editor of the New York Post has admitted on their old

24:01.560 --> 24:07.280
that he was a top official in the Communist Party?

24:07.280 --> 24:08.840
Are you aware of that?

24:08.840 --> 24:11.520
I know of no such incident there.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.560
Do you know that Mr. Wechler, James Wechler?

24:15.520 --> 24:18.880
Who is now the editor of the New York Post,

24:18.880 --> 24:23.120
the post of some investigators down here at the company.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.040
The bank had a frame on.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.200
Down to the tee, he had admitted on their post.

24:28.200 --> 24:33.280
Number one, that he was on the National Committee

24:33.280 --> 24:35.920
of the Young Communist League.

24:35.920 --> 24:40.280
But he organized tours to Moscow.

24:40.440 --> 24:44.800
You know, that is the man whose reporters came down

24:44.800 --> 24:49.840
to court dicks and their activities resulted

24:49.840 --> 24:53.640
in the inspector general spending a vast amount of time

24:53.640 --> 24:55.320
investigating private time.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.840
Mr. Chairman, the witness has stated

24:57.840 --> 25:00.120
that he was not present at court date

25:00.120 --> 25:02.760
when the New York Post people came down there.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.480
So I don't see how it would be material whether he knew

25:06.480 --> 25:10.160
as the background of anybody of the New York Post.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.520
I think that's the correct decision we've done.

25:11.520 --> 25:15.440
Leave that and you will not ask for a picture to the time.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.080
Further, all the material presented by a McCarthy

25:18.080 --> 25:21.680
is not an item in which I would have first to acknowledge.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.680
When was your leave, Captain?

25:23.680 --> 25:30.680
My leave commend about the 18th of January,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
and continue to the week after Easter.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.440
For one week, it's about as the conjecture this time.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.760
I don't really glad they kept it.

25:46.760 --> 25:47.560
It's a night out week.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.240
For me, it's youth for the 21st about doctors.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.840
When I have the article,

25:53.840 --> 25:55.040
I've turned to the first article,

25:55.040 --> 25:57.240
I'm not sure if it's the first or not,

25:57.240 --> 26:02.240
from the New York area, from the New York Post.

26:02.240 --> 26:06.680
It is January 29, so those were four days after you

26:06.680 --> 26:09.440
returned the chapter.

26:09.440 --> 26:14.080
I'm just curious to know how number one a paper.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.480
And the editor has been one of the top officials

26:17.480 --> 26:19.880
of the terminus market.

26:19.880 --> 26:23.480
Who is the most happy left via I consistently attached to have it?

26:23.480 --> 26:24.880
Let me finish my question.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.480
I lie.

26:25.480 --> 26:26.480
I finish my question.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.880
And I'm going to bother.

26:27.880 --> 26:28.880
I finish my question.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.280
I gave it all to Justin morning.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.480
It was given this time.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.360
There is no justification in my opinion for stating

26:34.360 --> 26:38.880
that Mr. Waxler was the top official of the Communist Party.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.160
Mr. Chairman, can I have the understanding

26:41.160 --> 26:43.440
that at least the son of his will not interrupt me

26:43.440 --> 26:45.600
halfway through a question?

26:45.600 --> 26:48.240
If Mr. Waxler signing in wants to access defense counsel,

26:48.240 --> 26:53.040
Mr. Waxler can do that for my cut to his finish.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.080
Mr. Waxler appeared for a committee.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.340
He admitted on our thoughts examination, Mr. Simon

26:58.340 --> 27:02.360
can know this, but he was on the national committee

27:02.360 --> 27:04.520
of the young Communist League.

27:04.520 --> 27:08.520
But he organized tours with what the Moscow,

27:08.520 --> 27:12.240
he admitted that while he claimed was already formed,

27:12.240 --> 27:14.280
that he never went to the FBI and gave

27:14.280 --> 27:21.040
him any information except to complain sometime in 1948

27:21.040 --> 27:25.480
about an investigation was being conducted of his wife,

27:25.480 --> 27:27.920
who also mentally remembered the part here

27:27.920 --> 27:31.080
of the young Communist League which is a part of the fight.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.520
So let's get the facts straight.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.160
It's all other rules, all a matter of record.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.200
And I would like to keep the subject of Missouri

27:37.200 --> 27:39.520
will allow me to finish my question

27:39.520 --> 27:41.680
before you raise this kind of order.

27:41.680 --> 27:44.120
Now, will the reporter read my question

27:44.120 --> 27:45.920
over our words when I was interrupted?

28:02.400 --> 28:04.360
I have a parent who is the first article.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.700
I am not sure if it is the first or not from the New York

28:06.700 --> 28:08.680
today, but from the New York Post.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.120
When would you read it again?

28:10.120 --> 28:10.640
First?

28:10.640 --> 28:13.760
I didn't get it.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.160
I have a parent who is the first article.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.520
I am not sure if it is the first or not

28:18.520 --> 28:21.600
from the New York Daily, from the New York Post,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.680
dated January 29.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.560
So this was four days after you returned, Katherine.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.320
I am just curious to know how, number one,

28:29.320 --> 28:32.400
pay tapers, whose editor has been one of the top officials

28:32.400 --> 28:35.440
of the Communist Party, who has been attacking the FBI

29:05.440 --> 29:07.840
company, that's correct.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.000
That's correct.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
Now, Katherine, you may not be able to give me some information,

29:16.000 --> 29:20.120
but I am very curious to get your comments on this

29:20.120 --> 29:21.920
if you have any.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.280
We have General Ryan testifying the other day

29:24.280 --> 29:28.160
that the Inspector General's investigation was

29:28.160 --> 29:33.520
a result of articles and written particular sheets.

29:33.520 --> 29:38.120
We have a testimony of the editor under old.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.000
That he was one of the top officials

29:40.000 --> 29:42.240
of the Communist Party, namely, that he was

29:42.240 --> 29:46.840
on a national committee of the young Communist believe.

29:46.840 --> 29:51.600
We have his testimony to the effect of the organized chores

29:51.600 --> 29:55.360
to go to Moscow, young people.

29:55.360 --> 30:03.040
His paper has consistent play, attacked the head of the FBI,

30:03.040 --> 30:07.040
everyone who has ever dared to expose to him.

30:07.040 --> 30:12.960
I am curious to know how this paper, above all others,

30:12.960 --> 30:15.480
apparently, has a three-round of your post,

30:15.480 --> 30:18.760
and how it is so powerful that I think

30:18.760 --> 30:22.160
it gets him to inspect your General's investigation,

30:22.160 --> 30:26.040
which costs I assume a considerable amount of money.

30:26.040 --> 30:30.480
Would you be able to comment on that?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.280
I am definitely inspired by Captain May and Captain

30:31.280 --> 30:35.280
but I would like to answer the question, sir.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.080
Please.

30:36.080 --> 30:50.240
I have no personal knowledge of the article in the New York

30:50.240 --> 30:51.240
Post.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.240
They were reported to me.

30:52.240 --> 30:55.240
I never read them to any extent.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.320
I know of the allegations which were presented.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.920
Some of them were critical of me.

31:01.920 --> 31:09.760
The New York Post's report did not come to my company,

31:09.760 --> 31:14.320
I lied election, if any came there at all.

31:14.320 --> 31:18.320
It is accustomed with newsmen, a report

31:18.320 --> 31:21.760
to a post to go on the public information officer,

31:21.760 --> 31:24.040
when they are granted or denied permission

31:24.040 --> 31:27.800
to interview people on the post.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.800
I understand that I want an occasion,

31:29.800 --> 31:31.880
the occasion on which I was asked to permission

31:31.880 --> 31:35.720
last-led it for newsmen.

31:35.720 --> 31:39.120
I, to visit the company and introduce

31:39.120 --> 31:42.280
members of the company.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.200
If I were present, I would not have given

31:45.200 --> 31:48.880
any information.

31:48.880 --> 31:54.800
However, they did interview members of my company.

31:54.800 --> 31:58.080
I do not know what newspapers they represent,

31:58.080 --> 32:03.280
and I know nothing of the activities of New York Post.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.360
Conclusion, any further questions?

32:05.360 --> 32:08.240
I believe you're the counsel's patient.

32:08.240 --> 32:12.680
Yes, I believe that the principal item on which private

32:12.680 --> 32:15.200
shines, characterizing the state,

32:15.200 --> 32:17.000
was the New Year's imp...
