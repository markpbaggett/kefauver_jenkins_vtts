WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
At the time of the incident, Monday morning,

00:07.760 --> 00:13.760
Poverty was to be investigated by Captain Patterson of the

00:13.760 --> 00:14.760
Reckon.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.760
The order stated to investigate the circumstances

00:18.760 --> 00:20.360
surrounding the ablution.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.240
Sir, my question was, any disciplinary action taken against

00:23.240 --> 00:25.600
private shine by reason of that incident?

00:25.600 --> 00:26.600
No sir.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.000
Does his service record show that he was absent without

00:30.000 --> 00:31.400
legal medication?

00:31.400 --> 00:34.120
No sir, no further questions.

00:34.120 --> 00:34.920
The chair has none.

00:34.920 --> 00:35.840
Senator McPhallum?

00:35.840 --> 00:37.080
No further.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.720
Mr. Durek, can I send it to my right?

00:39.720 --> 00:41.080
And the senator's in my left?

00:41.080 --> 00:42.080
I have a question.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.400
And your senator?

00:44.400 --> 00:48.040
First, I'd like to make a statement.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.960
It's my understanding that Mr. Waxler testified before

00:51.960 --> 00:56.560
this committee that when he was around 17 or 18 or 19,

00:57.560 --> 01:01.960
he was a member of the young communist lady.

01:01.960 --> 01:06.560
And that he left that organization when he was young.

01:06.560 --> 01:11.360
And that since that time, he has been more and more

01:11.360 --> 01:15.160
actively against communism.

01:15.160 --> 01:19.560
It is my understanding that I've only seen Mr. Waxler twice

01:19.560 --> 01:22.360
in my life, and I don't read his paper.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.440
Both times, as I saw him, had connections, or rather,

01:25.440 --> 01:32.520
was in connection with executive hearings held by this committee.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.160
And I have never seen the article referred to with respect

01:36.160 --> 01:41.560
to the activities of private shine at this king.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.200
Now, Captain, questions have been asked.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.640
You, I'd like to ask you a question.

01:44.640 --> 01:49.000
And some of you, just mention that point.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.080
Point being that when the point of one of his ways,

01:51.080 --> 01:53.280
the chair did not rule upon us for this reason.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.640
He was not present at any of the hearings at which Mr. Wax

01:56.640 --> 01:57.440
testified.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.280
He has never read the testimony.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.560
He is entirely unable to have a rule on the point of

02:01.560 --> 02:04.280
what he's concerning testimony about Mr. Waxler,

02:04.280 --> 02:06.400
which he had been a very nursing resident.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.840
Well, the record was big for itself.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.080
But I would like to ask this question because I take to say

02:12.080 --> 02:15.720
anybody's life destroyed in the American system.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.320
In fact, I will apologize to the junior senator from Wisconsin,

02:19.320 --> 02:21.960
but that is the way I remember the record.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.880
The question that I would like to ask you is,

02:23.880 --> 02:28.560
did you know the former Communist in the last 18 months

02:28.560 --> 02:34.120
have also been paid members of the staff of this committee?

02:34.120 --> 02:35.800
Well, I did not.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.520
No further questions, Mr. Chairman.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.320
Well, thank you, Sergeant.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.080
Thank you, Sergeant.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.000
Mr. Waxler, it's Lieutenant, Lieutenant Mike.

02:43.000 --> 02:43.840
Do you have any questions?

02:43.840 --> 02:44.840
That's right, sir.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.840
Oh, I just have two short questions, sir.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.360
Please, you're right.

02:50.320 --> 02:57.080
Captain Miller, will you please relate why

02:57.080 --> 03:01.760
private shine was given this piece of paper which

03:01.760 --> 03:03.240
constituted a path.

03:07.960 --> 03:11.560
I gave private shine a path form on the first day

03:11.560 --> 03:15.840
he arrived in the company because I knew that private

03:15.840 --> 03:17.680
shine was received passes the science

03:18.040 --> 03:19.560
during the first four weeks.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.120
And I felt that to make private shine available for committee

03:23.120 --> 03:27.440
work as soon as possible, I should place no administrative

03:27.440 --> 03:31.680
restrictions in the way of making him available.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.680
I usually keep the passes locked up in the state.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.720
And they are available only to myself and the executive

03:37.720 --> 03:39.240
officer.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.120
I gave private shine his past so that he's

03:42.120 --> 03:44.480
invented a past.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.200
The private space is better than the long pinching

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
of the road.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.360
So long as I've recommended you, I hope you keep

03:49.360 --> 03:52.200
our present up.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.200
Go ahead.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.600
The time has been there.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.080
In a very messy opportunity, the team

03:57.080 --> 04:00.200
was a table, and it seemed to witness.

04:00.200 --> 04:04.200
I felt that since I kept the passes locked up in the state

04:04.200 --> 04:08.800
and since the private shine was called very fine for these

04:08.800 --> 04:11.080
passes, if I am my executive officer,

04:11.080 --> 04:12.200
we're not present, we're not

04:12.200 --> 04:15.040
be possible to get private shine passed to him

04:15.040 --> 04:16.920
within any reasonable time.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.040
I therefore gave it to him to keep in his possession

04:20.040 --> 04:22.920
for that reason which I stated to him.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.840
The fact that private shine was on pass

04:24.840 --> 04:29.560
on all a part of 30 of the 59 day, if he was with my company,

04:29.560 --> 04:35.880
bears out my reason for giving him the pass in his possession.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.680
The debt passed that written piece of paper

04:38.680 --> 04:40.480
comes through the authority for him

04:40.480 --> 04:44.280
to be absent at any time from his duties.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.920
It did not, unless authority was communicated to me,

04:47.920 --> 04:50.760
he channels, and I specifically authorize private shine

04:50.760 --> 04:51.920
to be absent.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.360
Then he would use this pass if he were

04:54.360 --> 04:57.400
adopted by military policeman or others

04:57.400 --> 04:59.360
and asked whether he were legally off the post,

04:59.360 --> 05:00.800
he would show this.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.120
But it would be indicative of the trust which

05:03.120 --> 05:06.160
I placed in private shine to show this pass

05:06.160 --> 05:10.160
at only foot time as he was authorized to be absent.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.560
My last question is this.

05:12.560 --> 05:17.360
Is it unusual for an IG investigation

05:17.360 --> 05:21.320
to be commenced when any charges are made by anyone

05:21.320 --> 05:24.080
against anyone in a military service?

05:24.080 --> 05:26.960
That is not all unusual.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.840
It's all I have, sir.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.960
Oh, no, it's economic tragedy.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.720
Any further questions?

05:30.720 --> 05:32.200
Your question is from Mr. Schumann.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.240
I would like to comment on the statement just made

05:35.240 --> 05:39.600
by the senator from Missouri, Senator Simonton.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.040
I want your attention, if I may have a minute,

05:41.040 --> 05:42.280
Senator?

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
Senator?

05:43.280 --> 05:44.520
I think so, sir.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.600
Senator, the senator just commented

05:48.600 --> 05:52.800
upon the fact that former communists have worked

05:52.800 --> 05:55.360
with this committee.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.920
He was trying to find a way to put them in the same flash

05:57.920 --> 06:00.080
with Mr. Wicksworth.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.560
We have a former communist sitting

06:03.560 --> 06:07.720
behind this monthly over here.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.680
She has worked with this committee.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.360
She has worked with grand juries.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.640
She's worked with the FBI, by only for Wicksworth

06:15.640 --> 06:16.800
and the fucking way of the FBI.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.640
Shinyan, every former communist who

06:23.640 --> 06:27.680
has honestly reformed and who has, by their own custom,

06:27.680 --> 06:31.120
on the absent fighters of jail,

06:31.120 --> 06:34.880
are consistently feared by the Wicksworths who claims

06:34.880 --> 06:36.720
every form.

06:36.720 --> 06:41.720
I intend to always utilize these services

06:41.720 --> 06:45.720
and generate them on a completely free basis

06:45.720 --> 06:48.400
of those individuals who have planned

06:48.400 --> 06:50.320
that they made them a state.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.320
Now provenant, provenant by helping

06:54.320 --> 06:57.240
our law enforcement agencies and grand juries

06:57.240 --> 06:59.240
to some communist jail.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.760
I may say that to the senator from Missouri,

07:01.760 --> 07:04.360
I have deeply disturbed when I saw

07:04.360 --> 07:06.840
an African back in the committee,

07:06.840 --> 07:09.560
apparently for the first of helping

07:09.560 --> 07:12.280
a gigascarminous.

07:12.280 --> 07:16.960
The only time I hear him raise his voice at this table

07:16.960 --> 07:21.880
is when we appear to be hurting those that

07:21.880 --> 07:22.880
offend communism.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.200
I'll make it clear.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.040
I am.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.040
I am.

07:26.040 --> 07:26.880
I am.

07:26.880 --> 07:27.720
I am.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.560
I am.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.400
I am.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.400
I am.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.400
I am.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.400
I am.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
I am.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.440
From Missouri and Jim Prop simplement in Telugu

07:36.440 --> 07:39.240
and I am the finishminist.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.520
It would regard one of the rules.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.320
And I ask you if you would tell the senator from Wisconsin

07:44.320 --> 07:46.920
that his remarks were a stones pleased I personally

07:46.920 --> 07:49.400
and my gefallen I'm going to have a little over

07:49.400 --> 07:52.560
there with a scaring in our order in this bar.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.000
Hope the sales agents showed that this takes

07:55.000 --> 07:57.640
to chair coming under the wing of our players.

07:57.640 --> 07:58.760
The chair says earlier today he considered

07:58.760 --> 08:01.320
a decent deal of the call but he

08:01.320 --> 08:04.420
is taking place between these his college

08:04.420 --> 08:06.320
at this table as being your relevance

08:06.320 --> 08:08.920
and Jim Propor and certainly not

08:08.920 --> 08:11.320
conducive to expediting the year.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.520
We just do it without engage in political discussion.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.960
We suggest we do not engage in attacks upon each other.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.600
Now in all fairness, it seems to me

08:20.600 --> 08:22.760
that Senator McCrabby's entitled to say something

08:22.760 --> 08:24.920
in response to a challenge which

08:24.920 --> 08:26.840
the chair believes he had decided from Missouri

08:26.840 --> 08:29.920
make that he was employing time in his sentence committee.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.680
I think the whole discussion is entirely out of order.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.080
But on half a leaf chair, the wishes

08:36.080 --> 08:39.320
he had the authority of a judge in this procedure

08:39.320 --> 08:40.920
has only the authority of a chair

08:40.920 --> 08:44.000
on the regional committee in the United States Senate

08:44.000 --> 08:46.480
where people are accustomed to engaging

08:46.480 --> 08:48.080
in freedom of direction.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.320
But he would like to please if we get back on the beam

08:51.320 --> 08:54.800
that we get back on the issue that we interrogate this young man

08:54.800 --> 08:56.520
and get onto the next one.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.080
And he will ask respectfully to the senator

08:59.080 --> 09:01.360
who has come to be as had an opportunity

09:01.360 --> 09:03.440
now to reply to what I thought was

09:03.440 --> 09:07.080
and the fact that he was a committee by some of his findings.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.280
And I hope you will make it three then get out of reach.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.080
I make a point of order on that.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.160
Well, I thought I did not make any effect on this committee.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.400
I stayed in fact, and the fact that I stayed in was

09:18.400 --> 09:21.960
that he made for me, for the senator McCrabby.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.800
Remember this staff, that he was being paid by this committee,

09:24.800 --> 09:28.000
and he was formally a member of the Communist Party.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.360
And that is all I said.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.440
I stayed in fact, as the weathering communist is reformed,

09:33.440 --> 09:35.400
the weather he has not performed.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.920
I believe from the bottom of my heart

09:37.920 --> 09:41.200
that God will decide with respect to his true reformation

09:41.200 --> 09:43.960
and no one will man.

09:43.960 --> 09:47.040
Chair is not in position to communicate differences

09:47.040 --> 09:49.800
existing between the members of this commission.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.920
Chair, there was nothing about the background

09:51.920 --> 09:54.400
of any member of this committee that may or may not

09:54.400 --> 09:55.840
have been a commentator.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.680
He doesn't think this is the appropriate form

09:57.680 --> 10:00.920
of extreme support that might have been the issue raised

10:00.920 --> 10:02.760
by the senator from his jury.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.160
I think certainly that he will agree

10:04.160 --> 10:07.760
that the senator from Wisconsin has some right to explain.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.560
Well, you can say this has to be an act of its statement.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.080
I asked the chairman of this committee

10:12.080 --> 10:15.120
to withdraw the statement that I attacked the committee.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.360
I was told that you were attacked, and the McCrabby.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.240
I asked the chairman to withdraw a statement

10:19.240 --> 10:20.560
that I attacked the Democratic Party,

10:20.560 --> 10:22.720
because the record will not prove that to be correct.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.120
Very well, I was told he's taken to that withdraw,

10:25.120 --> 10:27.400
and he simply says that the senator is now

10:27.400 --> 10:30.080
submitting a hint to say something about Senator McCrabby

10:30.080 --> 10:32.320
and about his employing.

10:32.320 --> 10:33.720
I said for a moment, I'm an entity

10:33.720 --> 10:35.760
who didn't consider it to be a compliment for the senator,

10:35.760 --> 10:37.160
so we've done the right to reply.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.520
I simply say it is correct.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.000
I did not criticize the fact, and I thank the chairman

10:41.000 --> 10:42.120
for his gracious good.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.240
Very well.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.080
Now, Senator, could you go on with the question

10:45.080 --> 10:45.600
of the witness?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.160
I think you have made your point.

10:47.160 --> 10:51.320
And then we can never get an obligation like this

10:51.320 --> 10:53.120
in the stages of equilibrium, which

10:53.120 --> 10:55.800
I hope is about to be equally improvised by now,

10:55.800 --> 10:59.480
so we can continue with the business of hand.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.240
Kind of a grandly.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.840
I like the chair of the question that I made.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.880
I know that he has a gavill poised most of the time.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.200
Can we have a member standing here for us

11:09.200 --> 11:12.800
for hearing, but some of her is all not

11:12.800 --> 11:16.160
brought in and are up halfway to a question.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.200
Let's have a agreement that we can have the question finished.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.120
I think that's common question.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.040
The chair of the high committee that sent it from Wisconsin.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.440
I think I was perhaps a little in touch with,

11:26.440 --> 11:28.920
and I assure him I will do my best in the future

11:28.920 --> 11:30.720
to follow the suggestion.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.600
There are a lot of us can perform that I have

11:33.600 --> 11:35.480
in the nation, including the man who made it,

11:35.480 --> 11:36.720
so we can make it to them.

11:36.720 --> 11:37.720
OK.

11:37.720 --> 11:38.720
OK.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.720
Thank you.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.720
Senator McKay.

11:42.720 --> 11:48.720
Mr. Chairman, I think I should start that.

11:48.720 --> 11:53.440
Mr. Johnson, you've got counsel to your right, and I'll find it.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.080
Yes, sir.

11:55.080 --> 11:59.120
I'll find it, Mr. St. Clair.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.160
I have counsel for the Army, and I'm part of the Army.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.480
They represent me as well as the kind of life that's in.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.720
And you can sit at a perfectly, naturally

12:06.720 --> 12:08.640
a perfectly proper situation.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.960
And even in customary, I should have counsel, certainly.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.120
That's right, sir.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.680
Now, can you tell me whether or not

12:13.680 --> 12:18.120
when Mr. Shining and a preface in the Army?

12:18.120 --> 12:20.320
So, tall dinners are as well for those charges

12:20.320 --> 12:23.840
originally to play a paper.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.960
And I'd like to have that many softwares of the party.

12:27.960 --> 12:32.200
But when Mr. Shining was allowed to counsel, why not?

12:32.200 --> 12:35.640
I know because I was told, and I can state,

12:35.640 --> 12:38.080
so the fact that if you wish, sir,

12:38.080 --> 12:39.720
one year would be not allowed to counsel,

12:39.720 --> 12:42.640
yes or no, I will say, no, he was not,

12:42.640 --> 12:44.200
and then I will qualify to find it.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.440
You mean, you're not allowed to?

12:46.440 --> 12:50.680
In such a general investigation,

12:50.680 --> 12:53.120
persons being asked questions,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.160
are being asked questions willing to accept

12:55.160 --> 12:57.000
or possibly paying back?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.640
And counsel has never been allowed

12:59.640 --> 13:02.720
for persons in such a general investigation.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.080
I happen to have been included among the persons

13:06.080 --> 13:09.560
questions since the charges were made

13:09.560 --> 13:11.120
and since the criminal poverty,

13:11.120 --> 13:14.000
the domestic investigation sometime in January,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.160
and has constantly testified without counsel.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.960
And I didn't consider that in any way, your regular,

13:19.960 --> 13:25.160
I nearly was given counsel the facts

13:25.160 --> 13:27.920
which to make recommendations to the committee in general,

13:27.920 --> 13:32.800
and the fact that a counsel is denied in that

13:32.800 --> 13:34.800
to an infant cell in a relation with a child

13:34.800 --> 13:35.960
and a pre-configured child.

13:35.960 --> 13:36.960
I am sick.

13:36.960 --> 13:37.800
I am sick.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.440
I'm an infant cell, but the machine denied counsel

13:41.440 --> 13:43.720
when he was interrogated in regards to the trial.

13:43.720 --> 13:47.200
The trial was investigated by a communist chief.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.320
I can't deny counsel.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.440
That's the only question was he denied counsel.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.280
Yes, he was.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.400
Did he tell you he wanted counsel, President?

13:54.400 --> 13:55.320
I was not present.

13:55.320 --> 13:58.480
I was trying to get the court when he was interrogated there.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.680
Do you know the repressives?

13:59.680 --> 14:00.200
They're right.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.040
So he's owner of our presence.

14:03.040 --> 14:03.520
I know.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.160
That's who he is, right?

14:05.160 --> 14:07.960
And you know the reason I was asked, right?

14:07.960 --> 14:09.360
I believe.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.640
You know, I will say, sir.

14:12.640 --> 14:15.200
I was entwined to the word believe, once in proper.

14:15.200 --> 14:19.080
I will say, sir, is tonight Alex Private Sign

14:19.080 --> 14:22.840
had requested counsel and was not interrogated by former

14:22.840 --> 14:25.760
authority at that time, because he had been

14:25.760 --> 14:27.360
out screening all life and night.

14:27.360 --> 14:27.880
You will work.

14:27.880 --> 14:28.960
Don't give me a speech, Captain.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.920
I just asked a simple question.

14:30.920 --> 14:35.040
Did Cheyenne ask you to have a lawyer, a resort in prison,

14:35.040 --> 14:40.000
whom he was hired personally, and pay, have him present?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.880
At the time, there was being investigated.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.120
The charge was initiated by a communist chief.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.200
Was he tonight, Councillor?

14:49.200 --> 14:49.680
No.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.360
I don't need a speech, come on.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.440
I would have to qualify that, sir, because I

14:53.440 --> 14:55.760
know that Private Sign was given the opportunity

14:55.760 --> 14:58.800
to consult with counsel, and he had the allegation before him

14:58.800 --> 15:01.640
before he was questioned by the IG, which was not

15:01.640 --> 15:03.160
true of myself.

15:03.160 --> 15:03.660
No.

15:03.660 --> 15:06.400
The question is, Captain.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.600
There is no reason why you can't tell if they

15:07.600 --> 15:08.920
fit to the court.

15:08.920 --> 15:09.600
Was he the...

15:09.600 --> 15:10.520
Sir, I was the only one.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.320
That was true.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.000
Was he the night?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.840
They were right, because I think he was so close.

15:14.840 --> 15:15.720
Yes or no?

15:15.720 --> 15:16.440
He was.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.320
Right?

15:17.320 --> 15:20.760
Now, you know, he was also instructed not

15:20.760 --> 15:25.680
to tell anyone, including the chairman of this committee,

15:25.680 --> 15:28.720
but the charges against him were.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.360
You know that?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.560
I believe that all persons giving testimony

15:32.560 --> 15:36.640
are instructed not to tell any of their testimony

15:36.640 --> 15:39.600
to other persons until the completion

15:39.600 --> 15:41.520
of the investigation and findings are in it.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.400
That was a process.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.200
Would you have back the first?

15:43.200 --> 15:44.480
Do you know what the charge was?

15:44.480 --> 15:45.480
Yes, he was.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.640
Did that go through to the court?

15:46.640 --> 15:50.000
Do you know what the charge was instructed not

15:50.000 --> 15:53.040
to tell anyone, including the chairman of this committee

15:53.040 --> 15:56.400
myself, but the charges against him were.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.640
But he was specifically instructed not

15:59.640 --> 16:03.440
to tell anyone on my staff or tell me what the charges

16:03.440 --> 16:04.040
against him were.

16:04.040 --> 16:04.920
Do you know that?

16:04.920 --> 16:08.880
Yes, Sir, Private Sign, as well as I, and the regist...

16:08.880 --> 16:09.720
I will.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.080
I will call the secretary.

16:11.080 --> 16:11.920
The chairman?

16:11.920 --> 16:13.960
He has erected a file of identity as an attorney,

16:13.960 --> 16:15.600
but then he asked him if anything should say.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.680
Oh, Mr. Chairman.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.200
Oh, no.

16:17.200 --> 16:21.120
They looked at his testimony that he was not present at the time

16:21.120 --> 16:24.400
when Private Sign was interrogated by the IG.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.720
And all these questions of court are here today.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.120
And things that the captain picked up from other people.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.280
I just want to point that out.

16:32.280 --> 16:32.800
No.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.800
That's clear.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.720
Because he's going to be there.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.720
I believe I made that clear because I'm a car thief.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.680
I met my family with questions.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.960
And the answer accepted all that thank you.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.320
Now, on the answer this, maybe you can

16:44.320 --> 16:46.360
say some light on this captain.

16:46.360 --> 16:51.800
The other fact that Private Sign was instructed by the inspector

16:51.800 --> 16:55.320
general, I'm not suspecting the wisdom of that order.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.640
Maybe it's lies, maybe it's unwise.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.000
We don't determine that today.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.960
From the view of the fact that he was instructed not

17:01.960 --> 17:07.800
to tell anyone what the charges were.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.040
You totally couldn't have a lawyer present.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.480
You totally couldn't tell the journalist

17:12.480 --> 17:14.880
committee about the charges against him were.

17:14.880 --> 17:20.280
Could you perhaps tell me how we had to go to this New York

17:20.280 --> 17:28.000
post run by a man who admittedly was a high-commodest

17:28.000 --> 17:32.080
at one time to find out what the charges were?

17:32.080 --> 17:33.400
But how did they get to them?

17:34.400 --> 17:39.080
The charges, I believe, were first printed in the New York

17:39.080 --> 17:39.560
post.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.120
That's right.

17:41.120 --> 17:46.200
And the charges were available on a public basis.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.280
I believe that Private Sign was provided as well as high

17:49.280 --> 17:53.360
with a copy of the allegations of the New York post.

17:53.360 --> 17:59.520
You just say that the counsel chair has nothing to do

17:59.520 --> 18:01.240
before the next turn and begins.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.320
And while we have this opportunity, let's return to our studio

18:03.320 --> 18:05.000
of the cost of country to submit our statements

18:05.000 --> 18:06.120
to identify them.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.400
So this is ABC Television Network.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.760
Did you have counsel at the ID investigation?

18:12.760 --> 18:15.760
I did not.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.880
Would you offer the right to have counsel at the ID investigation?

18:17.880 --> 18:20.040
The EMA Television Network is bringing you

18:20.040 --> 18:24.240
through its facility drawing off the property committee hearings.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.720
We pause now for station identification.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.520
This is the EMA Television Network.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.320
Let's go to the investigation.

18:30.320 --> 18:36.680
This is WABD Channel 5, serving New York

18:36.680 --> 18:40.280
best in public affairs.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.120
Particle of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as well as

18:43.120 --> 18:45.320
a Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution

18:45.320 --> 18:49.760
before they are asked any questions by the Inspector General.

18:49.760 --> 18:53.920
Yes, in all cases of investigation within the Army, Article 31,

18:53.920 --> 18:56.200
which is based upon the Fifth Amendment,

18:56.200 --> 19:00.360
is read to each person interrogated in any investigation.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.960
Were you told by the IG not to discuss your testimony

19:03.960 --> 19:05.760
with anyone else?

19:05.760 --> 19:09.320
I was instructed not to disclose the subject of my testimony

19:09.320 --> 19:11.360
to anyone else who comes into the testimony

19:11.360 --> 19:14.880
because it was confidential material.

19:14.880 --> 19:19.640
Do you know whether or not the IG investigation

19:19.640 --> 19:24.120
was a result of the charges made by the newspapers or vice

19:24.120 --> 19:25.880
versa?

19:25.880 --> 19:27.880
I have been told the death suspect.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.880
Oh.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.880
Truth is the fact.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.720
The investigation was started as a result of the newspaper

19:35.720 --> 19:36.920
allegation.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.440
Then that's how the newspapers would know the allegation.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.560
The fact correct?

19:40.560 --> 19:41.560
That is correct.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.240
That's all I have, sir.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.760
Mr. Cohen or Senator McCrack?

19:50.760 --> 19:55.840
The thing was spent two hours now on something that's

19:56.800 --> 19:57.600
completely relevant.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.920
In this case, maybe we should spend a few more minutes

19:59.920 --> 20:06.160
and let the public know exactly what some of the charges were.

20:06.160 --> 20:12.000
One of the charges, first of all, if you

20:12.000 --> 20:16.240
said the file of the chain, the copy of the charges,

20:16.240 --> 20:17.680
I believe that that's personal.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.320
You told me he could not make those available to anyone

20:20.320 --> 20:21.680
those are sick.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.360
I don't believe that the charges were

20:23.360 --> 20:26.240
taken away once that they were printed in the New York Post.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.480
Well, before they were printed.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.240
So I assume you gave him the charges.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.200
He didn't have any more copy than New York Post.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.360
I assume you handed him the charges in some type of informant.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.120
I had a private charge, nothing.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.840
I was not a part of the investigation deal

20:40.840 --> 20:43.040
in conductance.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.120
The charges were printed.

20:44.120 --> 20:49.440
I believe in New York Post after the before the investigation

20:49.440 --> 20:54.440
was a result of the article appearing in the New York Post,

20:54.440 --> 21:02.000
which were adverse to the publication of 4th X.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.040
Could you give me some idea how much time and money was spent on one of the allegations?

21:09.040 --> 21:13.960
For example, Miami said that I have asked for the allegations and have been denied them.

21:13.960 --> 21:19.400
I must have had it like I had to come in the middle for this coming to see to get them.

21:20.400 --> 21:26.400
I must have had money was spent by the IG determining the question of whether or not I quote

21:26.400 --> 21:29.400
Shion had he shoes commercially polished.

21:29.400 --> 21:33.400
I would know money alone.

21:33.400 --> 21:41.400
I know nothing of the amount of money being spent in the IG investigation is not something

21:41.400 --> 21:45.400
that I can cover.

21:46.400 --> 21:57.400
You know how much time and money was spent on allegation number 16?

21:57.400 --> 22:05.400
Mainly that he had books with buckles on the fly.

22:05.400 --> 22:09.400
Now I point out that I understand that they didn't have shoes with a fifth day if you get

22:09.400 --> 22:13.400
a size acting quickly or bite them down town.

22:13.400 --> 22:20.400
Now how much time does it take to determine whether or not the buckles were on the side or not?

22:20.400 --> 22:27.400
I cannot say how much money was spent on such an investigation.

22:27.400 --> 22:32.400
I do know how the incident took place.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.400
The man can one other question.

22:34.400 --> 22:39.400
Do you know how much time and money was spent on the return of whether or not they had on the

22:39.400 --> 22:45.400
reign one day some plane mass they were there was rather cold.

22:45.400 --> 22:49.400
Do you have a time with money was spent on that?

22:49.400 --> 22:50.400
No, I do not.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.400
No brother, I don't know the chairman.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.400
Do you have any questions?

22:53.400 --> 22:55.400
Do you have any questions?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.400
Do you satisfy the time, my sir?

22:57.400 --> 22:58.400
They dismiss.

22:58.400 --> 23:04.400
