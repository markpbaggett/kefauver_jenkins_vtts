WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.280
Well, I suppose a U-Straight in an informant in the Pentagon has the right to come over here

00:08.280 --> 00:10.600
and give to this committee, a secret document.

00:10.600 --> 00:16.520
Now, what I'm asking you is if a member of this committee staff for the same reason,

00:16.520 --> 00:22.240
felt he was doing what was right for the United States and came over here and rather

00:22.240 --> 00:29.320
left us and gave out to somebody else to be a 30-general saying, a secret document in

00:29.320 --> 00:33.040
this committee, if you think that would be right, if the document first of all, sir, we

00:33.040 --> 00:34.040
have no power to question.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.040
We have no power to question.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.560
If I haven't got too much time, I'll just read you a series.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.560
I say we have no power to question by document.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.920
The second, if the document from another department, sir, I think what you're getting at

00:43.920 --> 00:49.960
it, if a member of the staff for this committee, no of an act of corruption or violation of law

00:49.960 --> 00:54.840
on the part of somebody else in the committee and went to the FBI, who was the Attorney General

00:54.840 --> 00:58.760
of the Investigator Branch, I would say you would have a right to do that, sir.

00:58.760 --> 01:02.160
I believe that he had the right to disobey anyone in the committee and his chairman.

01:02.160 --> 01:07.000
Sir, Mr. Vice President, sir, I have heard a little time on a free state not being

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
in the office.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Well, there is no authority.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.600
Sir, suppose there was such a rule, do you have the right to disobey it?

01:13.600 --> 01:16.160
If there were such a rule, sir.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.240
And it involved a violation of law.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.240
That's right.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.240
And he had evidence of that.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.240
Violation of the committee rule.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.240
And he had evidence of a violation of law.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.240
Violation of the committee was taken by the Office of the Office.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.240
So, in the end, we talked about the other.

01:29.240 --> 01:34.520
So, I think we'll be up to him to decide whether there's also office to his country and

01:34.520 --> 01:39.760
to his job whether it's installing the office.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.280
He feels the only way he could have followed according to his conscience and the guard would

01:44.280 --> 01:48.320
be to go with that information to the FBI.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.200
In other words, make that the other word.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.560
We've got it to what the committee regulations are.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.480
Any staff and other committee would keep count.

01:55.480 --> 02:01.480
Decided on the result to support the constitution and he could participate in that so committee

02:01.480 --> 02:03.560
ruling he was not the right to do it.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.840
So, a violation of law being covered up by the committee, sir.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.640
He might very well.

02:08.640 --> 02:12.800
He might, as I'm sure there wouldn't be any such situations here, but he might very well

02:12.800 --> 02:15.200
decide that his office would require him to go to the FBI.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.520
There would be his decision.

02:16.520 --> 02:17.520
Yes, sir.

02:17.520 --> 02:23.480
Would the fact that the committee has just ended swore to uphold the constitution of the

02:23.480 --> 02:28.160
United States and defend and protect our nation justify him and your opinion in revealing

02:28.160 --> 02:34.960
the names of informants to the state, Senator McClellan or Senator McCrathy of classified

02:34.960 --> 02:37.480
secret material on the ground.

02:37.480 --> 02:42.880
It would be the best way to protect the constitution of the United States and the law of the country.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.880
I can't say against it.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.480
All right, let me repeat.

02:47.480 --> 02:52.880
The fact that this is just on the committee we were talking about has sworn to uphold the

02:52.880 --> 02:59.400
constitution of the United States and defend and protect our nation justify him and your

02:59.400 --> 03:04.360
opinion in revealing the names of informants to such people as Senator McClellan or Senator

03:04.360 --> 03:11.400
McCrathy to reveal to them classified secret material on the ground that this is the best

03:11.400 --> 03:18.400
way to protect the constitution of the United States and the law of our country.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.400
Mr. Sonny, may I say that the witness man is man, but I don't.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.400
May I say that perhaps that doesn't surprise me?

03:25.400 --> 03:32.440
Well, sir, I think I want to give you an answer, Senator, but I'm not sure.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.400
Do I understand the question to me this?

03:35.400 --> 03:40.400
If somebody on the committee's fair for it to give to Senator McCrathy and Senator McClellan

03:40.400 --> 03:43.400
inform, inform, let's read it again.

03:43.400 --> 03:47.400
Very, very slowly and I'm sorry my time, but I will never.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.400
I'll have to move anyway and get to say me the time.

03:50.400 --> 03:57.400
Suppose that a member of the committee, Stan, has sworn to uphold the constitution of the

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
United States.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
I got that.

03:59.400 --> 04:05.400
Now suppose that he also believes he should defend and protect the nation.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
Yes, sir, I got that.

04:07.400 --> 04:14.400
And your opinion has need a right to give classified information, classified secret

04:14.400 --> 04:20.400
material to Senator McClellan, Senator McCrathy, because he believes this is the best way

04:20.400 --> 04:22.400
to protect the United States.

04:22.400 --> 04:27.400
Remember the death of our committee, sir, that is information that he received wrongly.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
Classified information.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.400
Sir, I just don't understand the question.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.400
How are you going to take it right?

04:31.400 --> 04:33.400
I would have so many information.

04:33.400 --> 04:40.400
I remember the staff would have with the information concerning an investigation which the committee

04:40.400 --> 04:41.400
was conducting.

04:41.400 --> 04:46.400
Well, now I say, let's say to pose that you have, there are some members of the staff.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.400
I understand several who have not been cleared by the Department of Defense.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
You know if that's true or not?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
No, sir, I don't.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.400
Why do you mind checking?

04:53.400 --> 04:55.400
I would be very much interested in that, sir.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.400
I know that every member of my check, and if I made a mistake and say it, well then,

04:59.400 --> 05:03.400
I know that every member of my check, every member of my check, now let me go on to the question.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
Do you have a document?

05:04.400 --> 05:09.400
Would you ever see, will say, a document for board to be signed by Mr. Hoover?

05:09.400 --> 05:12.400
That's part of the files of this committee.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.400
That document, sir, was given to Senator McCrathy.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.400
Yeah, but it wasn't a committee file.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
Well, you have to take that up.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.400
It was supposedly in the committee file.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.400
Whether you had to take that, the status of information that is given to Senator McCrathy.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.400
I see. In other words, you don't know whether it was ever in the committee file or not.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.400
I can front of the administration that's finding some.

05:28.400 --> 05:34.400
There are certain people who find information to Senator McCrathy, certain people in this country.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400
Now, let's suppose it was in the committee file.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.400
Let's suppose a document like that was in the committee file.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.400
Yes, sir.

05:40.400 --> 05:44.400
And suppose that the instructions were that it should not be taken out of the committee file.

05:44.400 --> 05:50.400
Then it was a document that was obtained from another agency and put in the committee file.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.400
Suppose that you have a man on the committee staff who thinks that he has the right.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.400
To take that document and to give it to somebody else.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.400
Do you believe that he has that right?

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
All right.

06:02.400 --> 06:08.400
In other words, it's the same law applied to a member of the committee staff that applied to the young intelligence officer who gave us.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.400
Sir, the letter that was reported to be signed by the civil.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.400
The same old office and the same obligation.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.400
The concentration in the country would apply.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.400
The members of the committee staff, just as well as they would apply to anybody.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.400
Well, you agree, won't you?

06:20.400 --> 06:25.400
I just wanted to say that if it was right for the young intelligence officer to give it to anybody on this committee.

06:25.400 --> 06:31.400
The same rules would apply if a member of this staff wanted to break the rules and give it to the attorney general.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
Right?

06:32.400 --> 06:38.400
Sir, I'm going to try to make a long story and it was very short time.

06:38.400 --> 06:46.400
I feel that if there is evidence of violation of law covering up a criminal situation in this committee and the members of the FAFROs of the FBI,

06:46.400 --> 06:50.400
I can conceive of circumstances where that would be proper.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.400
Yes.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.400
I'm talking about giving a secret document.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.400
I can conceive of circumstances where that would be proper.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.400
Sir, we don't have any power.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.400
Now, to ask why any document there, we just don't have.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.400
We have to follow the decision.

07:04.400 --> 07:15.400
Working in the FBI, handing classified secret material, dealing with a trapping of communists, decides in his judgment that the FBI is acting vigorously enough.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.400
And he would prefer to relieve it.

07:19.400 --> 07:25.400
Contrary to Mr. Hoover's orders, this secret document would say a newspaper fighting communism,

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
would you consider that justified?

07:27.400 --> 07:32.400
Can I get that exact right back in the name of the president?

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
Very well.

07:33.400 --> 07:42.400
Suppose an assistant working in the FBI handling classified secret material, dealing with communists.

07:42.400 --> 07:48.400
Decided in his judgment that the FBI is acting vigorously enough.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.400
Yes.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.400
And that he would like to relieve the document,

07:52.400 --> 07:58.400
I'm trying to Mr. Hoover's orders, to a newspaper which has been fighting communists.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.400
Would you consider that he was justified in doing it?

08:01.400 --> 08:05.400
I would consider that the hypothesis which you suggest could not happen.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.400
That's not an answer to my question and you know it.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.400
The matter is, as long as you have a consistency of give space and a question,

08:12.400 --> 08:19.400
in my opinion you're setting up one set of rules, for people that will give you information and another set of rules as to what you do with the information.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.400
I think that's the contrary.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.400
Well, we'll continue this tomorrow.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
I'm sorry.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
All right.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.400
Send it once again.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.400
I'll suggest we end this room.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
Is there any questions at this time?

08:30.400 --> 08:31.400
I'm sorry.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.400
You have three minutes remaining on your go-around.

08:38.400 --> 08:54.400
Mr. Cohn, we've heard a lot about one man's committee, especially by those object to that committee conducting an investigation.

08:54.400 --> 09:07.400
I wonder if you would, for the record, give us the reason why we vary it in investigating committees and the families of the House that adopted the one man for a rule.

09:08.400 --> 09:15.400
I believe the primary reason for it to be found in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States and the Christophal case.

09:15.400 --> 09:35.400
The general law, I believe, is that a necessary element in a conviction for contempt or a criteria or some conduct before a congressional committee includes that a form of the committee was certain at the time that the witness gave the particular answer.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.400
In other words, there might be a quorum with three people.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.400
There might have been three senators there at the beginning of the hearing.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.400
One of them might receive a telephone call and walk out of the room for two minutes.

09:45.400 --> 09:53.400
Now unless the government could prove, and then there was no longer be a quorum there at that moment, on the other hand, that might not have happened.

09:53.400 --> 09:58.400
All three might see there all the time, but people might not remember that they were there all the time.

09:58.400 --> 10:11.400
And unless the government could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that all three were there at every minute when the stupid question was being asked, the conviction would be reversed and thrown out due to that technicality.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.400
That's very funny.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.400
Mr. Mayor of the House, you mentioned the Christophal case.

10:16.400 --> 10:21.400
Perhaps some of our juries do not know who Christophal was.

10:21.400 --> 10:26.400
And I tried to, this Christophal was a member of the Communist conspiracy.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.400
Yes, sir.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.400
He was convicted in case of the feud.

10:30.400 --> 10:45.400
And the conviction was set aside because at that time the committee had the rule that a majority of the senators on the committee had to be threatened to take testimony.

10:45.400 --> 11:06.400
The conviction was not set aside because he was not guilty, but because the actual as a parenthood possible to prove that at all times during the testimony, a majority of the senators were threatened to commit a theft of a drink of water, some sick of cornthal, and down the line of some next time onward.

11:06.400 --> 11:29.400
As far as the UNI know, every investigator getting smitten has protected itself by passing the rules that one man comes to put the form so the kind that's not a valiant self for the same defense Christophal valiant self of a trite term, because one man at the quorum doesn't mean that the other can't be there.

11:29.400 --> 11:47.400
And let me ask you this, if he were to go back to the old rule, that existed before the Christophal case, it was making it difficult beyond words, but it's not to convict anyone for contempt of the committee, for the contrary, for any crime before the committee.

11:47.400 --> 11:53.400
It was present, what does the Supreme Court has found to be a precedent obstacle to a saying he's such conviction.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.400
It gets under time, it gets under time.

11:55.400 --> 12:11.400
Well, in 10 minutes, well on the other hand, if you have the one member that's been a complete committee rule, it wasn't had any to have another member to around that a hearing with it.

12:11.400 --> 12:21.400
No, sir, wouldn't Mr. Louchin, as I said just a moment ago, the fact that only one of necessary does not mean the other, or not welcome, or should not see there when their other duties permit.

12:21.400 --> 12:31.400
That's right, I wanted that totally to one, the 20, you don't have to have one man committee, it's just convenient to be able to have one.

12:31.400 --> 12:41.400
Oh, oh, surely, sir, it's up to one man must be there, and if the others come on out of the matter, their own independent judgment is to whether their other duties permit them take time to be at the meeting or not.

12:41.400 --> 12:48.400
And you don't really have any serious difficulty about it, as long as the chair is there and running the ears.

12:48.400 --> 12:54.400
We have had no difficulty by the chair, so that they check it out.

12:54.400 --> 13:03.400
Now, it's gone because of the way the club seemed to go here, some people may be directing their attention with one thing and some of another.

13:03.400 --> 13:13.400
The Senator Gerkson and I have been then merely trying to illuminate, let us say, this is first about loyal to Gord, so we've all understand where we are.

13:13.400 --> 13:19.400
And you and I have had what I'd like to think of the lawyer like and the pleasant discussion about that.

13:19.400 --> 13:32.400
Maybe at the point I think when I've exhausted my life, probably the check, could you move forward slightly or are you helpless?

13:32.400 --> 13:38.400
I know you've got a bench in front of you, sir, I didn't mean to say you couldn't move, but you have a bench there.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.400
Thank you.

13:41.400 --> 13:51.400
Mr. Corn, we had reached this point where you had, I certainly beg your pardon, I know you have a bench that I have faced myself and I thought you were against it.

13:51.400 --> 14:06.400
Mr. Corn, we had reached the point where you had, I think, made it clear that in any case where a lawyer of the Gord has made a decision affecting what a fair commonist or a subversive.

14:06.400 --> 14:19.400
But your committee was something to be to call the members of the lawyer who had passed from that case and inquires the deriities for deciding if they did.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.400
So a lot of qualifications to write this to us, but I'll give you a yes answer if I don't have one.

14:23.400 --> 14:28.400
I don't want to get civil, that's because while I hear a few, that might be some of those leads, he's done a lot of things to ask.

14:29.400 --> 14:41.400
And then I have gone on to ask you this, if you had said to the lawyer, I'll give you a second number of lawyers or I'll give you a second before you, I was asking you whether there would be any reason not to ask him.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.400
Now what have you got pending, what have you got pending on the doctor?

14:44.400 --> 14:53.400
And I think you, I'm not sure whether you've answered that or not, but I am somewhat under the Christ now I haven't seen the transcript that you thought under some circumstances that might be proper too.

14:53.400 --> 15:02.400
But I can see what the net, the welches probably have meant, but might say how many times will be sitting on now, how many cases do you have under consideration now or something like that?

15:02.400 --> 15:10.400
On the other hand, then perhaps you weren't going to find today, well now what are the facts of the ones that you've heard and are ready for decisions?

15:10.400 --> 15:13.400
Yes sir. You wouldn't want to be married to those?

15:13.400 --> 15:16.400
I can't say a judgment in advance on that sir.

15:16.400 --> 15:21.400
Well let's, let's tie one, suppose he said, well we heard, we are the case last week.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.400
Now the 10 witnesses, we've heard them all and we haven't under consideration and we're going to decide it next week.

15:26.400 --> 15:33.400
Now if you feel it's gone that as a legal proposition you would have a right to inquire as to the fact they had heard?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.400
Yes sir, I would say we had a right to inquire.

15:36.400 --> 15:44.400
And you can stand if you find out the facts that were before the law of the board for an investigation of the following week.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.400
Well sir that would be, I think we have a right to inquire whether it is that.

15:48.400 --> 15:54.400
If another right could then the answer is that you could, if you want, we could ask. I'm not saying we could get an answer.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.400
Well now that's the point that is interesting.

15:57.400 --> 16:02.400
You and I as lawyers know there are great many questions you can ask that you can't inquire the answer.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.400
Certainly that's the reason I think we have been understanding each other I hope we have.

16:06.400 --> 16:12.400
Did you know as instance as well there are decisions of the law of the board that have already been made and are in the facts?

16:12.400 --> 16:18.400
And if we can't inquire in particular whether it is resolved in what we have, you are calling this room, clearing the counter.

16:18.400 --> 16:25.400
You're quite sure that you can ask for the reason that the law of the board member to reach that decision.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.400
Yes sir I can think of a lot of appropriate questions along those lines which could be asked.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.400
And having asked the question you are told that you have a right to answer?

16:32.400 --> 16:37.400
As a certain of the questions I am sure we have a right to answer. As a certain sir there might be a question.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.400
Now let us understand each other on this point.

16:40.400 --> 16:48.400
If you would hear that people were wiping the law of the board member the thousand dollars of tax could decide in favor of Congress.

16:48.400 --> 16:53.400
You and I would be in the enthusiastic agreement that that side could be gone into.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.400
No I certainly would be just. There's no doubt about that.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.400
But as you know that you are calling on a quite a different area.

16:59.400 --> 17:08.400
I am talking now you want to understand about a perfectly honest number of the law of the board in the sense of not accepting bias and not being corrupt or anything of that sort.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
Your following?

17:10.400 --> 17:13.400
You are excluding bribery or corruption.

17:13.400 --> 17:19.400
Are you also excluding Mr. Welch having a communist front wrecking himself and having a crisis?

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
Yes I think I would rather exclude that.

17:21.400 --> 17:30.400
That's also the matter and things like that. But you just had an ordinary honest well meaning but let's say a lot of the board members of you didn't have no agreement.

17:30.400 --> 17:36.400
Yes sir. Now if you take that honest the law of the board will always have nothing wrong with you.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
And you already made a decision.

17:38.400 --> 17:44.400
I understand you now and that you and I are in agreement with the effect that I asked the decision which you have made.

17:44.400 --> 17:48.400
You have a right to inquire what were the facts and which you made.

17:49.400 --> 17:55.400
For qualifications again but to move along I will say yes there and at the appropriate time I will help to explain.

17:55.400 --> 18:04.400
And you have a right to inquire that we are that he adopted and we can you think of certain standards under which such an inquiry would be brought back.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.400
Yes sir.

18:05.400 --> 18:12.400
Now Mr. Cohn you have been in effect set up a thought of a power practice for me.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.400
A lot of these boards have you now?

18:15.400 --> 18:20.400
No sir. Well you review what they have done in the committee do you not?

18:20.400 --> 18:30.400
It's not quite that simple as well. It is not quite that regular either but it amounts to some kind of a review of the law of the board action before the committee does it not.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.400
Not exact picture.

18:32.400 --> 18:43.400
Well let me put it here this way. After this policy of mine isn't it yours? Isn't it quite clear sir that any member of the law of the board is about to decide the case today?

18:43.400 --> 18:56.400
I realize that he has a radio or television. Let's conference from now he may be called before the committee your committee have with your counsel and ask to talk about that case.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
But it's not for sure yesterday.

18:57.400 --> 19:04.400
And he must be reasonably well the fact that he decides in favor of some subversive law that's the first.

19:04.400 --> 19:09.400
Oh let's come but he may have a week of legal time before your committee would do not say.

19:09.400 --> 19:14.400
I don't believe so I don't believe that it's fairly close.

19:14.400 --> 19:25.400
Then he may not have any anxiety tonight about any decision he makes on the ground that he may someday be called here and have the case reviewed by you.

19:25.400 --> 19:32.400
The action sir and according to his call that the exact answer under proper standards.

19:32.400 --> 19:40.400
In determining loyalty and certain other elements of presence that I would say no he would he need have no anxiety.

19:40.400 --> 19:46.400
I suppose he honestly think he decided right and you must call on.

19:46.400 --> 19:54.400
When will you do that? Well that brings us right up to the question here and at some point I'm going to have to give me the opportunity to go into a little detail on this message.

19:54.400 --> 20:01.400
I think it's very fair that you should be sure this is the most interesting subject and one where you would qualify a violation.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.400
Yes sir.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.400
Any government will be part of it.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.400
You understand this is only we're not talking just about the Army don't you?

20:07.400 --> 20:08.400
No I don't.

20:08.400 --> 20:14.400
Sorry I understand we are talking just about the Army because in the only other experience we had we got cooperation and not the fight.

20:14.400 --> 20:20.400
Well I will take the Army but but we might get the economic energy information for example.

20:20.400 --> 20:25.400
You would hesitate to bring one of those well everybody was out there and you fly off and listen to what they didn't do.

20:25.400 --> 20:29.400
Just a lot that's probably being a better grounding if I can talk about what actually has happened.

20:29.400 --> 20:34.400
Now we have had the Army situation the other one we thought is the government hunting on us.

20:34.400 --> 20:42.400
I'm aware of that one and there is just something that I can hear is whether or not the same principle will apply to the hunting on us.

20:42.400 --> 20:46.400
Yes but just be honest we like it because there is a case where we understand each other.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.400
How about that is what I can talk about that.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
Any news?

20:49.400 --> 20:50.400
Okay.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.400
Where I can tell a powerful producer that is my call it.

20:53.400 --> 20:58.400
A couple of our new boys have done in the Army when you get a chance at the matter of the carrying silver.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.400
Alright sir I would say we start on this premise.

21:00.400 --> 21:05.400
As far as well the boys in general are concerned and the Army in particular concerned.

21:05.400 --> 21:10.400
We start on a premise of the state we're off we start on this premise.

21:10.400 --> 21:21.400
We have information to the effect that loyalty for us has without any justification and by using improper standards of evidence.

21:21.400 --> 21:30.400
Clear communists and been responsible for the return of communists to secret radar laboratories and to other sensitive states.

21:30.400 --> 21:39.400
I would supplement that Mr. Wells by saying that people who have subsequently been found to be communists and convicted as communists such as William W. Renekton have received the word.

21:39.400 --> 21:50.400
I would go on to say that in the case of the Army loyalty board which you want to talk about sir.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.400
We have had one case that occurs to me or pan.

21:53.400 --> 22:04.400
For somebody was cleared by this top army loyalty board and subsequently invoked the Fifth Amendment as to communists' activities when appearing before this committee.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.400
We have another case there for the Army loyalty board.

22:08.400 --> 22:12.400
Clear to man I looked at the record and we had a lot of evidence.

22:12.400 --> 22:22.400
Clear to man who had a record of pro-communist activity who had been circulating in a secret radar laboratory of which he was one of the top people.

22:22.400 --> 22:28.400
A pamphlet against military conscription against the United States building up any defenses against Russia.

22:29.400 --> 22:36.400
That man was found this floor of our regional board, the Fifth Amendment top army board, cleared up and sent him back with a secret clearance.

22:36.400 --> 22:40.400
We had the same thing the Army had no monopoly sir. We had the same thing in the government cleaning office.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.400
Now a no thing happened something is wrong.

22:43.400 --> 22:53.400
We tried to find out in the light of our obligation as the government operations committee to find out what in the operation of this set-up and system is wrong.

22:54.400 --> 23:15.400
In addition to that general thing, there are cases in their war and are in the case of the Army loyalty board where we had specific information of personal misconduct and in one case of communists' activity on the part of a member of the board which was trying to decide whether other people had engaged in communists' activity.

23:16.400 --> 23:22.400
Now when we first met up with this experience as the well-schirm in case of the government's printing office, we got into members of the loyalty board and they came.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.400
And...

23:23.400 --> 23:29.400
I had said that Mr. Wilson's time was inspiring and just ruled as General Edda, which is completely down to his if he wanted to.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.400
He's done to Mr. Wilson's fine otherwise.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.400
I take it each for the year at the end.

23:33.400 --> 23:40.400
I try to say this once there and not again. It is as long and complicated as I thought I'd try to make this short as I can.

23:40.400 --> 23:49.400
When it came to the government's printing office, we had just about the same situation you had in the Army. We had a man named Edward Rothschild, Mr. Rothschild, who was a fifth amendment communist.

23:49.400 --> 23:58.400
We know you have been named as a communist. As a man who has been swiping papers out, secret papers out of the government printing office, who have been trying to recruit other people into the communist body.

23:58.400 --> 24:03.400
But despite that, he has been cleared by the loyalty board. But that was an incredible situation.

24:03.400 --> 24:14.400
So this committee, particularly Senator McCarthy and Senator Dirton, called in the members of the loyalty board and said, now here, you've got this man Rothschild, a communist, a fifth amendment communist.

24:14.400 --> 24:21.400
Witnesses say he tried to recruit them into the communist body. He was swiping papers. He came to work with the daily worker every day.

24:21.400 --> 24:27.400
And you people say that he's a great loyal citizen. How is it conceivable that you could have cleared such a man?

24:27.400 --> 24:34.400
Well, the members of the loyalty board came in and they started to get answering some questions. And we found out how they had cleared such a man.

24:34.400 --> 24:44.400
We found out first of all that they were under the impression. And I quote, but in me a membership in the communist body was not sufficient to borrow a worker under the loyalty program.

24:44.400 --> 24:58.400
So here was an official of the loyalty board of the government printing office, who was operating under the assumption that if you found, if he found an employee of that printing office, the communist body member, that was not an access to the loyalty.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.400
And he could still vote that that man was loyal and ordered to say on the job.

25:02.400 --> 25:08.400
Some more questions for you by Senator McCarthy and Senator Berkson, the name of the witness was Mrs. Fiskley.

25:08.400 --> 25:14.400
And he thought of describing the procedure, which they followed. And he said, well, we heard a lot of witnesses.

25:14.400 --> 25:22.400
I remember Senator McCarthy said, well, you heard a lot of witnesses. Did you hear? X who said that this man tried to recruit him into the communist body.

25:22.400 --> 25:31.400
And I think it was Mr. Miller, remember the loyalty board that knows that we didn't call him. And Senator McCarthy or Senator Thurkton said, well, did you call?

25:31.400 --> 25:39.400
Mrs. Y who said that this man came to work with the daily workers stuck in his pocket every day and that she saw him swiping out coat books.

25:39.400 --> 25:42.400
Well, no, sir, the loyalty board meant that we never called him.

25:42.400 --> 25:52.400
So finally, Senator McCarthy says, well, who did you call? And it developed that the only witnesses they call were witnesses who could get testimony favor to the man under investigation.

25:52.400 --> 25:57.400
And that they had failed to call any witness, so that any testimony unfavorable.

25:57.400 --> 26:07.400
So they had to call him all at one side and none of the other side. Number one and number two, the standard they were using was communist body membership didn't bother the loyalty board.

26:07.400 --> 26:16.400
They thought that was not a ground for disqualification. And we then knew why, at least at a very good clue, as to why this loyalty board actually had come.

26:16.400 --> 26:25.400
So that was called to the attention of the head of the agency involved Mr. Raymond Blattinger. He removed the members of the loyalty board.

26:25.400 --> 26:43.400
Their way was the procedure established a new procedure and a new standard. That is one example, sir, of what this problem is and how we went about solving it and what we were trying to do in the case of this army loyalty board, which are similarly been clearing people with communist records. I'm sorry, I just so long.

26:43.400 --> 26:50.400
And for our seventh and the sixth, I think we'll take a five minute recess and then we do with the question.

26:50.400 --> 27:04.400
You have just heard the chairman declare a brief recess. I'd like to tell you that the ABC television network is bringing you the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army controversy.

27:04.400 --> 27:17.400
The seventh inning stretch. The lady in the background against the wall is Mrs. Robert Kennedy, the wife of the minority council.

27:17.400 --> 27:28.400
This president also in the committee room yesterday, the lady almost obscured by Mr. Jenkins and the tall and the broad black hat is Mrs. Alice, the boss of both long wear.

27:28.400 --> 27:35.400
The daughter of President Fee of our Rosable, the wife of the late speaker of the House of Representatives, Nicholas Longworth.

27:35.400 --> 27:47.400
Under divorce, I, temper him, honor, to welch, leave walking toward the exit to the office room for this seventh inning stretch.

27:48.400 --> 27:54.400
One of the months still getting congratulations to frankly honest birthday, strictly for birthday.

27:54.400 --> 28:04.400
Now the deserted committee table is on the 100th leaves, earlier Senator McClellan and Simon from left and Senator Thurkson.

28:24.400 --> 28:39.400
Mayor of the arms to gun her back who may have come in to talk with the just a moment. Senator Thutters is there. Senator Thutters, we're currently sitting back in a special reserve guest section.

28:55.400 --> 29:01.400
There as I'm Mr. Walter Wentchle standing in the middle of a class section, chatting with another reporter.

29:01.400 --> 29:12.400
Mr. Wentchle with the hat. Mr. Jenkins is still here in the office room. Mr. Crow of the stuff's leaving now.

29:13.400 --> 29:26.400
Senator Carter is still in the committee room. Gunner back is ready now to talk with Senator Charles Potter of Michigan.

29:26.400 --> 29:36.400
This is Governor Banks taking again from the Senate talk of the room. I thought we might take a few moments during this recess to talk to Senator Charles Potter, the Republican of Michigan.

29:37.400 --> 29:46.400
Senator Carter, I have to talk to a number of Democrats in the course of these interviews discussing this whole question of what Senator McClellan has called across roads.

29:46.400 --> 29:54.400
As the weather and not the presidential directive is the one that ought to be obeyed or whether the evocative relationship be taken.

29:54.400 --> 30:07.400
Senator Carter, I've heard that if someone has information that it's useful to him under the reorganization act he has the right to accept that information from a government person, even if it is classified in accordance with his oath to protect this country.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.400
I don't have a Republican to do it. I don't know the truth.

30:10.400 --> 30:18.400
Senator Carter, I don't want this Republican part of you, but this is my point of view. I'm afraid it will find as many different points of view that you have people on your program.

30:18.400 --> 30:42.400
I think you have to make it a distinction. I think certainly any document, a classified document, that document is removed from the file without authority and given to congressional committee or a member of Congress or any 20 unauthorized person, then that person is not necessarily an inviolation of an executive order, which is in this case.

30:42.400 --> 30:51.400
For the last oldest inviolation, the astronaut acts and whether it's what you agree with the act or not, it is a violation of all.

30:51.400 --> 31:04.400
Now I make a distinction between classified information as a differential with that information, which is not classified.

31:04.400 --> 31:20.400
Now I think that information that's not classified and it falls and if it's covered by a presidential directive, however, then I think that a person shouldn't release that information.

31:20.400 --> 31:25.400
It'll be the same thing, for example, I think you know of the president of the cabinet.

31:25.400 --> 31:37.400
Suppose a committee of Congress should submit a member of the president's cabinet to gratitude to the government for transfer, what took place in the cabinet meeting.

31:37.400 --> 31:50.400
Now I don't think we have that right. Anymore than I would think you have a right for one committee, for example, for the committee, another member of a committee, the people within the cabinet are advised to the president.

31:50.400 --> 31:57.400
And the president stands or falls by the decisions that are made as a result of that information.

31:57.400 --> 32:10.400
Senator, let me ask you this. Now Senator McCompia says there's no presidential directive that's going to speed him and that would expect you know that Mr. Shrein and his committee found by little being said on behalf of the president by the Republican government's committee.

32:10.400 --> 32:15.400
They remain silent because they have some doubts.
