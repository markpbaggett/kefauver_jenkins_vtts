00:00.000 --> 00:18.200
DonimiTA

00:18.200 --> 00:23.800
Nuclemonis

00:26.060 --> 00:26.440
against the

00:26.440 --> 00:30.440
any audible manifestations of approval or disapproval at any time.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.440
Just before we meet us,

00:34.440 --> 00:39.440
Council Jenkins had concluded his 10 minutes of questioning.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.440
So, Councilor Welch, I think that's it.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.440
And so we start now with,

00:43.440 --> 00:45.440
Council Jenkins, if he has any questions, that's it.

00:45.440 --> 00:49.440
Mr. Chairman, I may make 30 seconds to make one reason off.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.440
I was talking to

00:51.440 --> 00:54.440
the Council's Secretary of thinking

00:54.440 --> 00:57.440
and he said that he was sending over a letter by hand

00:57.440 --> 01:00.440
in regard to the situation.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.440
I answered to Senator Coffee to Mr. Welch,

01:02.440 --> 01:04.440
to Coffee to the Chair.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.440
And the statement comes, I'd like to read it number one.

01:06.440 --> 01:11.440
Number two, Mr. Chairman, unless there's some bigger subjection

01:11.440 --> 01:15.440
on the part of the members of the regular investigating committee,

01:15.440 --> 01:19.440
I would like to call a meeting of our investigating committee

01:19.440 --> 01:22.440
down in room 357,

01:22.440 --> 01:25.440
immediately after the adjournment here

01:25.440 --> 01:30.440
to hire and out a number of things that have arisen,

01:30.440 --> 01:33.440
which I'd rather talk about in executive session.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.440
I would like to have a portion of Jenkins

01:36.440 --> 01:41.440
and presently share to the panelists.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.440
Let me take this slide.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.440
Chair, now is the call.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.440
We may be discussing if he wasn't special in investigating committee

01:49.440 --> 01:51.440
and if he wasn't special in any way,

01:51.440 --> 01:53.440
then we shall try to adjourn his promptly

01:53.440 --> 01:56.440
around the other five in front of the camp.

01:56.440 --> 02:02.440
Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.

02:02.440 --> 02:08.440
The chair feels that out of these hearings,

02:08.440 --> 02:13.440
there is a good possibility that something constructives can come

02:13.440 --> 02:15.440
in the nature of a better relationship

02:15.440 --> 02:19.440
and a better understanding of the functions,

02:19.440 --> 02:21.440
the appropriate functions,

02:21.440 --> 02:24.440
about the executive and legislative branches of government

02:24.440 --> 02:28.440
in these particularly difficult problems of committee investigations

02:28.440 --> 02:33.440
and the safeguarding against a global manor-like communist.

02:33.440 --> 02:37.440
A lot of reason he is going to interrogate Mr. Cohn at this time

02:37.440 --> 02:39.440
in that connection somewhat

02:39.440 --> 02:41.440
and to make a brief statement,

02:41.440 --> 02:43.440
growing out of the fact that the hiss case

02:43.440 --> 02:48.440
has been mentioned for many times by so many of the committee members

02:48.440 --> 02:51.440
and witnesses during the hearings.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.440
In his mention as the chair served as acting chairman

02:54.440 --> 02:56.440
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities

02:56.440 --> 02:59.440
at the time we had the hiss case before,

02:59.440 --> 03:02.440
it seems that it might be appropriate to have the truth

03:02.440 --> 03:04.440
back to that connection in the record,

03:04.440 --> 03:06.440
that case in the record.

03:06.440 --> 03:11.440
It is true that a young security officer communicated with me

03:11.440 --> 03:16.440
and came to my office after midnight in the new House Office building

03:16.440 --> 03:18.440
and brought me from the materials

03:18.440 --> 03:21.440
and from the security files of the State Department

03:21.440 --> 03:24.440
in violation of the presidential directive,

03:24.440 --> 03:27.440
a directive issued by President Schumer incidentally

03:27.440 --> 03:29.440
as he was working on the hiss case

03:29.440 --> 03:32.440
to stop just from having access to certain files

03:32.440 --> 03:36.440
which we had previously been able to explore.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.440
This young man dropped some information

03:38.440 --> 03:41.440
which enabled us to go on with the case,

03:41.440 --> 03:46.440
with the realization and assurance that we had information available

03:46.440 --> 03:48.440
if we could prove.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.440
We could not use the material he dropped

03:50.440 --> 03:52.440
because he took it back to the files

03:52.440 --> 03:54.440
but he gave us the assurance that the critical juncture

03:54.440 --> 03:57.440
that for what is in fact

03:57.440 --> 03:59.440
golden them down a hill.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.440
It was simply a question of digging it out to the hard way.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.440
Primarily however the chair wants to call attention to the

04:05.440 --> 04:07.440
development of the case

04:07.440 --> 04:09.440
because we had some understanding

04:09.440 --> 04:12.440
and others doing the hearings

04:12.440 --> 04:14.440
and very interesting discussions of what might be

04:14.440 --> 04:17.440
in appropriate ways for the government employees

04:17.440 --> 04:19.440
to contact his Congresswoman of Senator

04:19.440 --> 04:22.440
if he felt there was dishonesty or disloyalty

04:22.440 --> 04:24.440
that he should be slow.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.440
In connection with the hiss case

04:26.440 --> 04:29.440
this information had been made available to the FBI

04:29.440 --> 04:31.440
by what he could change.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.440
The FBI as it all was done quickly

04:35.440 --> 04:38.440
and effectively transmitted that information

04:38.440 --> 04:41.440
to the Secretary of State

04:41.440 --> 04:44.440
but nothing was done about hours of hiss at that juncture.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.440
If a change was led

04:46.440 --> 04:49.440
it communicated information to Mr. Adolf Bowie

04:49.440 --> 04:51.440
who was an M-Bloy in the State Department.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.440
Mr. Adolf Bowie took the information to the White House

04:54.440 --> 04:56.440
and gave it directly to President Roosevelt

04:56.440 --> 04:59.440
who was then President of the United States President.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.440
President Truman,

05:01.440 --> 05:03.440
President Roosevelt, I beg your pardon,

05:03.440 --> 05:04.440
Roosevelt.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.440
I think he was already on the phone before that.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.440
He had done that.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.440
We give you the back down now.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
There is no information that was ever brought

05:11.440 --> 05:14.440
direct to President Truman's attention.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.440
If it was after that

05:16.440 --> 05:18.440
that the information was made available

05:18.440 --> 05:21.440
to the House Committee on Unemergent Activities.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.440
I point that out to point out that in this discussion

05:24.440 --> 05:26.440
which I hope can dissolve,

05:26.440 --> 05:28.440
evolve around policies and principles

05:28.440 --> 05:30.440
and not personalities

05:30.440 --> 05:33.440
that can fight with something very genuine and very real.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.440
Just where it does the interest of the public law

05:37.440 --> 05:41.440
just what are the responsibilities of people in government

05:41.440 --> 05:43.440
or out of government

05:43.440 --> 05:46.440
as the young officers in the State Department

05:46.440 --> 05:49.440
as in the case of pretty-to-change.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.440
We had information which we all now know

05:51.440 --> 05:54.440
dealt with one of the most notorious spies in American history

05:54.440 --> 05:56.440
out of your history.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.440
In the federal telepensary now totally because

05:59.440 --> 06:03.440
things were done in violation of an executive order.

06:03.440 --> 06:08.440
Now I want to ask a question of Mr. Cohn in that connection.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.440
Is it not entirely possible in your opinion, Mr. Cohn?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.440
For executive's effect,

06:14.440 --> 06:18.440
understandably, to be reluctant to have disclosures

06:18.440 --> 06:21.440
made in public about the fantasy of this loyalty

06:21.440 --> 06:23.440
within the executive branch

06:23.440 --> 06:27.440
and isn't it entirely possible that we reluctance can be manifest

06:27.440 --> 06:32.440
without there being any desire either to encourage communism

06:32.440 --> 06:34.440
this loyalty or his honor?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.440
It's not entirely possible that it's happened that way

06:36.440 --> 06:38.440
I think on many more than one occasion.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.440
I think so. It seems to me that you do not automatically assume

06:41.440 --> 06:46.440
that those who have a reluctance to have this thing brought up in public

06:46.440 --> 06:48.440
are necessarily desirous,

06:48.440 --> 06:51.440
so continuing to such a bad state of effect.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.440
Is it not also possible for an alert

06:54.440 --> 06:57.440
congressional investigating committees

06:57.440 --> 07:02.440
to try to figure out and disclose an eliminate dishonesty and disloyal

07:02.440 --> 07:05.440
without being guilty of attempting to encroach

07:05.440 --> 07:08.440
upon the affairs of the executive agency?

07:08.440 --> 07:11.440
The head case, the running case, the lost child case

07:11.440 --> 07:14.440
and for that question in the affirmative, yes sir?

07:14.440 --> 07:18.440
And do you not feel that we can learn through our mistakes

07:18.440 --> 07:20.440
through the examples of history

07:20.440 --> 07:23.440
to develop a cooperative formula whereby

07:23.440 --> 07:26.440
people interested in the common good,

07:26.440 --> 07:29.440
what is the executive agency or the congressional committee

07:29.440 --> 07:33.440
instead of competing and conflicting against the justice

07:33.440 --> 07:38.440
can cooperate in an effort to eliminate every last

07:38.440 --> 07:42.440
and still of disloyalty and dishonesty in this great government of ours?

07:42.440 --> 07:45.440
Absolutely sir, there should be no conflict of interest whatsoever.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.440
Each has its particular place

07:47.440 --> 07:51.440
and all certainly from our level should work together.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.440
This is nothing new in the history of government,

07:55.440 --> 07:58.440
even in this country for a wrong.

07:58.440 --> 08:02.440
I think it appeared in hell and the great way

08:02.440 --> 08:05.440
worked to fix for one time who said

08:05.440 --> 08:09.440
if our could be to die country's face

08:09.440 --> 08:13.440
which happily for knowing may avoid,

08:13.440 --> 08:17.440
or speak that goes back along not

08:17.440 --> 08:20.440
in the history of human effect.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.440
And it seems to me that you and Mr. Adams,

08:23.440 --> 08:27.440
President McCarthy and Secretary Stevens for a while,

08:27.440 --> 08:31.440
were working on a more commendable effort to cooperate together

08:31.440 --> 08:35.440
in the common good when you agree that during the early stages

08:35.440 --> 08:39.440
of your Port Mademois investigation you were at least pioneering

08:39.440 --> 08:42.440
in an experiment of cooperation which had its continues

08:42.440 --> 08:45.440
could have brought great good to the American people.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.440
Yes sir.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.440
Unhappily it did not continue.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.440
One of the problems we have in this committee is to find out what.

08:51.440 --> 08:55.440
One side there did not continue because it's the shine.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.440
One side there did not continue because of the

08:57.440 --> 09:00.440
loyal divorce investigation.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.440
Maybe we can determine whether either one of those

09:03.440 --> 09:06.440
or both of those are part of both,

09:06.440 --> 09:08.440
are involved in this.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.440
But I hope if there's not discrepancy,

09:10.440 --> 09:13.440
there's a continuation on the part of executive agencies

09:13.440 --> 09:17.440
and conditional committees to try to walk down the same road together.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.440
To eliminate this dishonest,

09:19.440 --> 09:23.440
to eliminate this is loyal because we have had too much

09:23.440 --> 09:27.440
of late to seem to me of quick criticism of each other.

09:27.440 --> 09:32.440
And not enough of our good, dirty American efforts to work together

09:32.440 --> 09:36.440
against evil which all good Americans have worked.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.440
So while this experiment is within you and the Army

09:39.440 --> 09:42.440
will engage for a while, I'm happily told that.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.440
It was Mr. Welk, pointed out,

09:45.440 --> 09:50.440
and created this unhappy situation which we now find there.

09:50.440 --> 09:54.440
I hope that out of these hearings, out of these discussions,

09:54.440 --> 09:57.440
out of this firmest effort to get us a truth,

09:57.440 --> 10:02.440
we can recommend some proposals and suggestions and formulas

10:02.440 --> 10:06.440
for working together instead of constantly pulling apart.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.440
Is there anything in your experience, Mr. Kohnen,

10:09.440 --> 10:13.440
happy as the event you are at the finally beginning,

10:13.440 --> 10:16.440
which leads you to believe that it's still possible

10:16.440 --> 10:19.440
to work out a arrangement such as your attempt

10:19.440 --> 10:22.440
which might, in the future, happily continue

10:22.440 --> 10:24.440
to use successful culmination.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.440
No, sir, in the case of the government printing office

10:27.440 --> 10:30.440
investigation, such an arrangement was worked out,

10:30.440 --> 10:32.440
was carried into effect,

10:32.440 --> 10:34.440
and into completion, to completion,

10:34.440 --> 10:39.440
and there was a more happy result for everybody in fact.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.440
They had another investigation too, Mr. Kohnen.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.440
And we, sir, have been through with certain departments

10:45.440 --> 10:46.440
and certain agencies.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.440
Now, seeking a matter about this...

10:49.440 --> 10:52.440
a matter of employees in the sometimes class.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.440
So the chair and the chair and the chair directly

10:55.440 --> 10:59.440
that where you have an individual who has been classified

10:59.440 --> 11:01.440
or clerked for classified material,

11:01.440 --> 11:04.440
that in those instances, the defense,

11:04.440 --> 11:10.440
plan, and or the army, can remove the opinions.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.440
But in the instances where you have security,

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
you have to in the defense,

11:14.440 --> 11:17.440
in the defense plan, to do not have classified

11:17.440 --> 11:19.440
as clerked, is impossible to do so

11:19.440 --> 11:22.440
because of union restrictions and other informants.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.440
That's certainly the assumption

11:24.440 --> 11:25.440
for the defense department's letter,

11:25.440 --> 11:28.440
it's not a month, and I would say that there's a lot...

11:28.440 --> 11:30.440
A lot of actors be in the letter,

11:30.440 --> 11:33.440
there are some things which have not been born out

11:33.440 --> 11:36.440
in the course of the investigation to the committee.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.440
It is true, sir, that the defense department

11:40.440 --> 11:45.440
has certain control over employees who work

11:45.440 --> 11:48.440
on classified material because of control,

11:48.440 --> 11:50.440
the letter and not they should be given clearance.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.440
They can withdraw that clearance,

11:52.440 --> 11:55.440
because it is missing them from that time.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.440
But yeah, except for the senator,

11:56.440 --> 11:58.440
my... that's the same idea in qualified statement,

11:58.440 --> 12:00.440
I believe, might be wrong.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.440
That's not correct, though,

12:01.440 --> 12:04.440
because we found one major defense plan in the country.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.440
I think it was a general electric plan that's connected to it,

12:07.440 --> 12:10.440
where the defense department had surrendered its right

12:10.440 --> 12:12.440
to give clearance to its upflow confidential

12:12.440 --> 12:15.440
and have turned that over to the private company,

12:15.440 --> 12:17.440
and said, you give clearance, you give confidence

12:17.440 --> 12:19.440
and restricut in confidential clearance.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.440
I don't think the private company wanted to give those clearance

12:21.440 --> 12:23.440
to say, I think, sir, that's...

12:23.440 --> 12:25.440
people, some people in the private company felt

12:25.440 --> 12:28.440
that was the obligation of the defense department,

12:28.440 --> 12:31.440
but nevertheless, that was given to the private company.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.440
And not part of our big problem in defense plan,

12:34.440 --> 12:37.440
the fact that they drink many security drinks,

12:37.440 --> 12:40.440
wealth, their way into the defense plan,

12:40.440 --> 12:44.440
or services, without the necessity of getting a classified clearance,

12:44.440 --> 12:46.440
but where they have contact with the people

12:46.440 --> 12:47.440
who have the classified clearance

12:47.440 --> 12:50.440
and some civilization become conveyor belt,

12:50.440 --> 12:53.440
our security information direct to much thought.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.440
Absolutely, Senator Martin,

12:54.440 --> 12:56.440
if I make it one example on that point,

12:56.440 --> 13:00.440
if you have a time you're not working on non-clairified information,

13:00.440 --> 13:06.440
that can be just as dangerous as a communist working on classified information.

13:06.440 --> 13:10.440
That, for instance, engines and things that go into air planes

13:10.440 --> 13:12.440
and ships might not be classified,

13:12.440 --> 13:16.440
if you have a time you're not working on those, that's just as bad.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.440
The second point is that in a month with these hits,

13:19.440 --> 13:22.440
there are people, just as you pointed out here,

13:22.440 --> 13:25.440
who might have a security clearance was drawn,

13:25.440 --> 13:27.440
but they still work in the plan.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.440
They have a close relationship with people who do have security clearance,

13:31.440 --> 13:36.440
and in a number of cases we found up in some of these wall plants in Upstate New York,

13:36.440 --> 13:40.440
Communists, active leading members of the communist conspiracy

13:40.440 --> 13:42.440
who did not have security clearances

13:42.440 --> 13:44.440
where the forces in the union

13:44.440 --> 13:47.440
of people who did have security clearance.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.440
They had to write to send for the union members,

13:50.440 --> 13:52.440
and in connection with the grievance procedure,

13:52.440 --> 13:55.440
get the union members who did have security clearance

13:55.440 --> 13:59.440
to give them all the details about the types of secret classified works

13:59.440 --> 14:03.440
to union members who are likely to be sure to get in one of the questions

14:03.440 --> 14:04.440
during my ten minutes.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.440
And I like to just straighten up my memory on this point,

14:07.440 --> 14:08.440
but if my memory is correct,

14:08.440 --> 14:11.440
it's the last public hearing held by our commitment.

14:11.440 --> 14:15.440
Before we became involved in the present country,

14:15.440 --> 14:18.440
did we or did we not have a witness who under-owned testified

14:18.440 --> 14:21.440
that in order for him to get a job in a defense plant,

14:21.440 --> 14:24.440
he had to join the communist party and the communist youth.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.440
That's what I thought I heard him say that,

14:26.440 --> 14:27.440
but I am not sure.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.440
Senator Douglas, exactly the touch of the testimony he gave.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.440
He said, I believe his name was Peter Craig,

14:32.440 --> 14:36.440
and he said that one of the reasons he joined the communist party was

14:36.440 --> 14:41.440
to get into the union and get this job in a defense plant.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.440
I thought I remembered that,

14:42.440 --> 14:45.440
but I have told it once it writes to people that sound is so shocking

14:45.440 --> 14:47.440
when I heard myself say it,

14:47.440 --> 14:50.440
it sounded so unbelievable to the people who whom I said it.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.440
I wanted to have that confirmed to be sure that that wasn't situated.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.440
It is, and you have one final question.

14:56.440 --> 15:01.440
It seems to me there is no great conflict between our experience in defense plants.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.440
As you related it, the difficulty of getting people out of union

15:05.440 --> 15:09.440
to the communist control and compiling them to move out of a defense plant,

15:09.440 --> 15:13.440
and the letter with Senator Simonton read from the Panaghan Building,

15:13.440 --> 15:16.440
I think, from the Secretary of Defense, in which he pointed out

15:16.440 --> 15:19.440
what could be done from the standpoint of classified points,

15:20.440 --> 15:23.440
but that in no way affects what cannot be done,

15:23.440 --> 15:27.440
concerning that vast number of people not working with classified clearly,

15:27.440 --> 15:29.440
but having contacts to the people who do,

15:29.440 --> 15:31.440
as a perfect taken of it, Senator.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.440
Perfect.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.440
Senator, my time is expired.

15:36.440 --> 15:40.440
Mr. Senator, let's inform our way down the stand as the problem is,

15:40.440 --> 15:45.440
will respect the getting information that may be classified as secret,

15:46.440 --> 15:49.440
do we all eat on the stand as the problem of the fault

15:49.440 --> 15:52.440
as with the executive's plans to the government?

15:52.440 --> 15:56.440
I don't get the reference to that Senator Simonton.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.440
Well, there's been a lot of study in the last few minutes

15:59.440 --> 16:04.440
about the classified documents in how it's properly taken

16:04.440 --> 16:08.440
in violation of executive orders and gives them out.

16:08.440 --> 16:13.440
I just want that to be clear, if it wouldn't all be clear to us,

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
if the president and the guest was both the executive officer,

16:17.440 --> 16:20.440
would not settle a violation, let's accommodate what ever it wants.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.440
Would that be an issue?

16:21.440 --> 16:23.440
That would certainly be one.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.440
I don't think so in my level on the advocacy of my public health.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.440
That's the issue.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.440
Let's start off by now, now that's the way we want to go.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.440
I think yes.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.440
As far as it ended, these reasons are that these ahead of the administration,

16:35.440 --> 16:40.440
the same way they're both pending orders, the right citizen that will settle a regular.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.440
You're entitled to an answer on that at my...

16:42.440 --> 16:44.440
I want to give it to you at my opinion.

16:44.440 --> 16:49.440
My only opinion, sir, is that the directive for fitting Congress

16:49.440 --> 16:52.440
to have loyalty and security information should be revolved.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.440
Yes, sir.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.440
That is the real problem, that's the real problem.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.440
That is a major problem.

16:57.440 --> 17:02.440
Otherwise, if you had that order, it would both, and the law prohibits it,

17:02.440 --> 17:05.440
rather than the song, it should get whatever it wants,

17:05.440 --> 17:08.440
and that it has in somebody by the law, by the law,

17:08.440 --> 17:10.440
it's a directive order to give it to us.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.440
I don't say there are other ways, but I do fully agree with you,

17:13.440 --> 17:16.440
that that directive presents a major obstacle in a major...

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
That is what I said, that there's to a goal,

17:18.440 --> 17:21.440
that that is the issue that needs to be settled.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.440
It's an important one, you're absolutely right.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.440
There are important.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.440
Although there may be different opinions about it.

17:26.440 --> 17:31.440
The first conflict between the legislative branch and the executive branch

17:31.440 --> 17:35.440
in my opinion will continue until it is settled.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.440
I want to ask you now, a request, please.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.440
Yes, sir.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.440
The point I wanted to make about that is guilt.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.440
That was the way to settle it.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.440
This administration has the responsibility of this government.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.440
They're in awful.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.440
They have the authority, they have the majority, both in the Congress.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.440
They have the responsibility of an executive branch,

17:56.440 --> 18:00.440
and the business conflict is here, that I have to be resolved,

18:00.440 --> 18:05.440
or remain un-resolved by responsibility, as old as you are now in power.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.440
This is the directive, of course, was promulgated under the last administration.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.440
It is still an effect to a certain degree,

18:13.440 --> 18:18.440
and whether or not it should be completely not upholding the last administration

18:18.440 --> 18:20.440
and defending it at all.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.440
I've lost some disobedience, I think you know that.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.440
Yes, sir.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.440
Now let's get back to your thoughts, please.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.440
Yes, we were all in number 19, and the word that I had referenced to when we concluded

18:29.440 --> 18:33.440
while ago was that a sensible purpose.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.440
God met their atoms who were appointed for our state as in that paragraph.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.440
We have stopped, we have now maintained, and still maintained,

18:41.440 --> 18:45.440
and rules have stopped with the principle purpose of their department's guilt.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.440
And I use your code.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.440
The handle of the committee?

18:49.440 --> 18:53.440
Yes, sir, we would call that by Mr. Allen, and I think you know what do you mean by the word handle?

18:53.440 --> 18:57.440
Did you mean to cast some assertion on his purpose by the word handle?

18:57.440 --> 19:07.440
No, sir, it was Mr. Allen's, I think, what put in there on the theory that he would be able to work things out with this committee.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.440
Did you mean by that to him properly influenced the committee?

19:11.440 --> 19:14.440
So I don't know if there was an implication of impropriety.

19:14.440 --> 19:19.440
That's what it implied to me when you put the handle in full occasion.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.440
Yes, sir.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.440
Did you mean to him properly influenced the committee?

19:22.440 --> 19:26.440
I meant, sir, that's the case Mr. Allen told us after he was appointed.

19:26.440 --> 19:30.440
That's the principle purpose for him being put in the job, why is the handle for committee?

19:30.440 --> 19:34.440
Now, you mean, handle the committee or handle that committee works?

19:34.440 --> 19:40.440
I think all you have is liaison also, all the time, to work for sure and effective,

19:40.440 --> 19:44.440
and what occurred to me is that that was the nature of his appointment.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.440
No, sir.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.440
It was not.

19:46.440 --> 19:50.440
You think we have a regulatory liaison, General Pann?

19:50.440 --> 19:53.440
Well, I understand if there's a regular liaison, that's right.

19:53.440 --> 19:57.440
But I mean, this is especially his armwork that he was to be engaged in.

19:57.440 --> 19:58.440
Yes, sir.

19:58.440 --> 20:03.440
Glad he demeaned you implied by the word handling that it was unduly or improperly influenced the committee.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.440
That was the principle purpose of his appointment.

20:06.440 --> 20:10.440
Well, sir, without characterizing, I think it became clear if he was appointed.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.440
I'm going to ask him if he's characterized what you said.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.440
I will know what you meant by.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.440
I meant by a sir, what Mr. Allen told us.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.440
Well, what did you tell you?

20:19.440 --> 20:25.440
He told us, sir, that's the principle purpose of his appointment was to handle the committee.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
What do you understand he meant by Allen?

20:27.440 --> 20:28.440
How do you interpret it?

20:28.440 --> 20:32.440
I interpret it in the light of Mr. Allen's later actions, Senator McCrawling.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.440
What do I do use them, property influence?

20:34.440 --> 20:41.440
Which was to try to work out an arrangement whereby we would stop our investigation of the Army and stop holding here?

20:41.440 --> 20:43.440
But he told us that it was involved with him.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.440
Well, we said it was.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.440
We didn't do it, sir.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.440
I didn't ask you what you did.

20:47.440 --> 20:51.440
I said you thought it was improperly influenced and you thought it was important to that purpose?

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
Certainly, it could be not the reason you used the word handle.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.440
Yes, it could be used to.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.440
Certainly, it could be considered as being a professor yet.

20:57.440 --> 21:02.440
Of course, it can be and it was so consumed by you, wasn't it?

21:02.440 --> 21:03.440
So I was around.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.440
Well, sir, I talked to the series.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.440
Now, there is no doubt in the world.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.440
Yes, Mr. Allen was right.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.440
So, I wanted to say what's not the investigation.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.440
No doubt.

21:11.440 --> 21:17.440
If it was used in that sense and you inducted it in that sense, then I won't be accepted in that sense.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.440
Yes, all is always a flexible.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.440
Yes.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.440
All right. Now, let's go to number 21.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.440
Yes.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.440
Now, it's full.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.440
From that time, here's full.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.440
And I assume that time, here's full.

21:29.440 --> 21:33.440
It refers back to September 28, 1953, does it?

21:33.440 --> 21:36.440
Yes, sir. All the way only saw him briefly on that day.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.440
I would say he really got down to business.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.440
That was...

21:39.440 --> 21:43.440
Can you see Mr. Allen's own September 28, 1922?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.440
I believe I did.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.440
I thought you told me you first met him on October 2nd.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.440
No, I believe that as I said it five previously.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.440
He came before he was actually in the job.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.440
He came over here into this.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.440
You have met him in the go-off, October 2nd, and then I assume.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.440
Yes, sir. I believe I met him.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.440
I think you testified to that.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.440
You liked it, right?

22:01.440 --> 22:02.440
I think you did.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.440
I'm not very confused.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.440
I'm going to...

22:04.440 --> 22:05.440
An affair, five.

22:05.440 --> 22:09.440
Yes, my recollection is that I met him for the first time in the world.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.440
It's up to her over there on the morning of September 28th.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.440
Very, very briefly.

22:13.440 --> 22:17.440
I came to know him at the beginning of October up in New York.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.440
Well, what about those?

22:20.440 --> 22:21.440
Would you...

22:21.440 --> 22:23.440
Would that's what you desire for your future?

22:23.440 --> 22:26.440
Just trust them on their same corrective taste?

22:26.440 --> 22:29.440
So, September 28th is being the first date.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.440
Now, from that time, here's for it.

22:32.440 --> 22:36.440
And repeated instances both personally and telephonicly,

22:36.440 --> 22:41.440
but the atoms attempted to interfere with the investigation of commoners

22:41.440 --> 22:43.440
in the location into the army.

22:43.440 --> 22:48.440
You say from that time in spores that he should be immediately there to interfere?

22:48.440 --> 22:50.440
He began, sir, the...

22:50.440 --> 22:53.440
I think it was the first week in October up in New York, he...

22:53.440 --> 22:56.440
Well, on the first week in October,

22:56.440 --> 22:59.440
would be the next week following this date, wouldn't it?

23:00.440 --> 23:02.440
Yes, it would be the next week.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.440
So, within a week, he began to interfere.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.440
About a week.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.440
About a week.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.440
And this, as the...

23:11.440 --> 23:14.440
began to interfere,

23:14.440 --> 23:18.440
repeated at repeated instances.

23:18.440 --> 23:23.440
More active, from the time he began in the first week and up over

23:23.440 --> 23:25.440
your testimony is,

23:25.440 --> 23:27.440
and your charge is here that he continuously

23:27.440 --> 23:32.440
over other repeated instances there after both personally and by telephone

23:32.440 --> 23:34.440
on the proof you had appeared,

23:34.440 --> 23:39.440
with the committee investigating commoners in filtration in the army.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.440
Get it.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.440
In your next sentence,

23:42.440 --> 23:45.440
Mr. Adams, early attempts to end the hearings.

23:45.440 --> 23:49.440
No, that's his early attempts, was I assume, when...

23:49.440 --> 23:52.440
Early off-sover that you're referring to, is that correct?

23:52.440 --> 23:53.440
You're correct, sir.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.440
Adams early attempts to end the hearings,

23:55.440 --> 23:59.440
were carried out by his using every effort

23:59.440 --> 24:02.440
to ingracing himself personally

24:02.440 --> 24:05.440
with the sub-committed personnel.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.440
I'd included you, did it?

24:06.440 --> 24:07.440
Yes, sir.

24:07.440 --> 24:11.440
And then, appealing to them as a personal favor to halt hearings,

24:11.440 --> 24:16.440
so that he would be secure in his new post.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.440
Yes, sir.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.440
Did he start out doing that with you immediately?

24:20.440 --> 24:22.440
Very close to the beginning, sir.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.440
The heart closed.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.440
It was the first week in October, I believe,

24:26.440 --> 24:29.440
when he was up in New York, first week in October.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.440
Does that not make you suspicious, Adam?

24:32.440 --> 24:33.440
Yes, sir.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.440
And from what two-beledgeers in on-set supply news,

24:36.440 --> 24:37.440
you say suspicious.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.440
I could go beyond suspicion.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.440
It was clear to me that he did not want us to continue the investigation.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.440
It's a continuing hearing.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.440
All right.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.440
You've all got it involved.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.440
And you've been able to take that out of you?

24:49.440 --> 24:51.440
I can't say, sir, that I thought that was improper.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.440
Or you did?

24:52.440 --> 24:55.440
Well, I thought this was a improper Sunday.

24:55.440 --> 24:59.440
Well, sir, he had just been appointed to this job amidst his even.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.440
And he did.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.440
All right.

25:01.440 --> 25:05.440
He takes a position and he wanted you to do that so that he would be secure in his new post.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.440
I do.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.440
Did you?

25:07.440 --> 25:08.440
Yes, he did.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.440
He told us that if some way could be worked,

25:10.440 --> 25:17.440
if he could be the one responsible for working out some way of getting us to let Mr. Seaman

25:17.440 --> 25:20.440
through the job himself and get the committee out of the picture.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.440
You know, he asked you about the impression that there's a principal purpose,

25:23.440 --> 25:24.440
which is important.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.440
And to work out something like that, the handle or influence of the committee to get that stuff.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.440
Yes, that's what you're referring to, you did not.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.440
That is right, sir.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.440
And you knew that would be improper, didn't you?

25:34.440 --> 25:36.440
Well, there are admitted to do it.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.440
He was trying to get us out of the thing.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.440
No, what is trying?

25:40.440 --> 25:43.440
You've been trying to continue and be improper for you to do it.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.440
I certainly knew that we were being proper for us to do it.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.440
It was not my decision, but I reason you refused.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.440
Well, the chair, I do add everything to do about that.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.440
The chairman is the one who refused.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.440
I...

25:54.440 --> 25:56.440
Well, all right, I'll put that I say you.

25:56.440 --> 26:00.440
I mean, yet the refusal was because it was improper.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.440
Because we did not feel it was wrong.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.440
And you didn't say it was improper.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.440
That's a hundred times.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.440
I understand.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.440
I understand.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.440
Mr. Colm,

26:09.440 --> 26:20.440
you stated on me the press on March 14th in an answer to Mr. Jack Bell.

26:20.440 --> 26:24.440
You have that before you.

26:24.440 --> 26:31.440
At no time, did you ever request or even suggest that Shine V released from K.P.

26:31.440 --> 26:36.440
or any other unpleasant duty is that the answer goes through.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.440
I don't want to ask you where that sentence is.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.440
I don't have to look it out.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.440
Do you want to ask me?

26:44.440 --> 26:46.440
I have to translate this one.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.440
Yeah.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.440
I don't have your best.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.440
Do I have an extra confidence?

26:50.440 --> 26:51.440
I have.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.440
I have one, I'll let's do it.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.440
Yes sir.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.440
I think it's very clear.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.440
I think it's very clear.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.440
That's very clear and I have...

26:57.440 --> 26:58.440
Let me repeat it now so we go back.

26:58.440 --> 26:59.440
You don't even have to send it.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.440
A lot of time.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.440
I don't want to ask you under oath, Mr. Colm.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.440
Did you or did you not?

27:04.440 --> 27:09.440
Not ever request of any artificial good Shine V released from K.P.

27:09.440 --> 27:14.440
Sir, I think the answer to that is contained on page 7 of my meet the first transcript.

27:14.440 --> 27:18.440
I did not answer the second part of your question about the Sunday K.P. incident.

27:18.440 --> 27:21.440
There's a number of them in our file we collect.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.440
That was the weekend before the deadline.

27:23.440 --> 27:27.440
I'm filing the overseas information program report with Shine V.

27:27.440 --> 27:33.440
That was the Sunday and there have been an agreement in advance that he could use that day to work on this report.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.440
So every night on that agreement, and that was the only purpose of the communication with the Army.

27:37.440 --> 27:44.440
Yes sir, the only discussion I ever had as far as I recall it was with anybody in the Army about Shine and K.P.

27:44.440 --> 27:53.440
was about that one day January 10th, I believe, a lot, in which I spoke with Lieutenant's Lounge and tried to get Mr. Adam

27:53.440 --> 27:57.440
made the statement that they put him on K.P. every night in a week we didn't care about it.

27:57.440 --> 28:05.440
But good answer is they live up to the arrangements they had made making him available to work on these reports on Sunday.

28:05.440 --> 28:12.440
But Lieutenant's Lounge is the page to the General General Lyon.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.440
Yes sir.

28:13.440 --> 28:19.440
It's very clear that he had been assigned for that Sunday, that weekend, to K.P.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.440
Yes sir.

28:20.440 --> 28:25.440
And Lieutenant's Lounge has testified under oath that you did make such a request.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.440
Now that's my understanding of the letter.

28:28.440 --> 28:37.440
That you made a request that it be released from K.P. now in fact, the statement of Lieutenant's Lounge made before this committee.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.440
Who or is it Paul?

28:39.440 --> 28:45.440
The discussion required if I was telling it to find it and such, and that's your answer, yes.

28:45.440 --> 28:49.440
This statement is true.

28:49.440 --> 29:05.440
Now let me refer to that in connection with the testimony of Lieutenant Blow

29:05.440 --> 29:09.440
during out of the so-called Colonel Winger incident.

29:09.440 --> 29:15.440
He will return to page forty-three, seventy-nine of your testimony.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.440
Yes sir.

29:16.440 --> 29:22.440
You'll find that you said as well, starting about the middle of page, Mr. Colm.

29:22.440 --> 29:27.440
This is a response for a question by Mr. Jenkins.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.440
The question by Mr. Jenkins is as well.

29:29.440 --> 29:36.440
Are you saying that Colonel Winger was talking peculiarly about the investigation of conningous Mr. Colm?

29:36.440 --> 29:42.440
Mr. Colm, I'm saying that Colonel Winger had made a statement concerning the work of this committee,

29:43.440 --> 29:51.440
which has been told to private shine by somebody who, and then Mr. Jenkins, well, what was that statement of Mr. Colm?

29:51.440 --> 30:01.440
Mr. Colm, the statement was said that we were indeed in a witch hunt, and that investigations like this were read here, things along those lines.

30:01.440 --> 30:06.440
Mr. Jenkins, and that statement was conveyed to you by Mr. David Schum.

30:06.440 --> 30:09.440
Mr. Colm, it was Mr. Jenkins.

30:09.440 --> 30:23.440
And do you say it was for that reason you said that the name of Colonel Winger would long, would long linger in your memory, the transcripts that I said would long linger in your memory.

30:23.440 --> 30:29.440
Mr. Colm, I might have said I was going to remember the name, yes sir.

30:29.440 --> 30:36.440
Now, turning to page three, five, always volume twenty.

30:37.440 --> 30:47.440
Lieutenant Blanc has stated in foreign testimony that on the afternoon of January 9, 1954, he talked to you by telephone.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.440
And then Mr. Tristan.
