WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I'm sure that I'm not.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
That I did say that there was one thing that I could give him from friendly life at the

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
military base.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
I pointed out to him that the National Interest required.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
It's shine.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
It treated just like every other show of soldier.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Well, what could be the criteria of the pattern?

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Well, if you think this was the wrong clause to use.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Because we explore the disaster.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
We explore the disaster.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
It's the National National Interest.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
It looks the thing we arranged for them is to give us a little bit.

00:32.000 --> 00:41.000
And we are trying how the whole series is going to find out through us how we're going to give us a little

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
maximum of just the best of the recipe.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
And this was a something.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Shine.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
This causes a generation of another lives very friendly relationships over the month.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
And no matter when the subject came up, no matter when I tried to use reasons.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Let's talk about this figure time.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
All right.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I've generalized it this time.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You recall where that conversation was.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I recollecting it.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It's a situation room 101 of us at all.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
You recall who it was.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I think Frank Sauer said.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm not sure.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
They were not with the phone.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
They came in.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
They were at that time when you spoke to the National Interest.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
Mr. Adams, did you understand that Mr. Cohn was talking to you at that time?

01:22.000 --> 01:31.000
As he was on October 20th and previous occasion, as Mr. Roy Cohn, the individual, as Mr. Roy Cohn,

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
the attorney and General Soundthrough for this investigating committee.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Well, well, we've certainly seen that.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
That's my question, Roger.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
What did you understand about it?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
On the occasion.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Was that just a man talking to you?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
That was not an official.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
What is that weight?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
It was an official of the United States.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Mr. Adams, when you remember Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn had a disability day.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
He was going to do a nice job of it.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
He said about this.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
He said he's not going to do a nice job of it.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
He said about this.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
But I don't know if you think it was a good compliment.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It doesn't.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
It's a good compliment.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
It doesn't.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
It's a good compliment.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
It's a good compliment.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
This conversation was around the person November.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
That's the one you just needed.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
And what you gave him this powerly advice that you have of us.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
That's right.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm not going to talk to anybody about it.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I do not exactly locate the date.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
All right.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Now, is there anything else there about medication?

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
By you, Mr. Cohn, or both of you, relating to the charge of you and Mr. Stevens,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
that we respect the security and preparation for treatment for shyness.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, you see, shyness is the purpose of November.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Shyness was not yet inducted.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
And the only conversation we were having.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, that's where he was going.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
As of this moment, the matter was not yet uncertain.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I mean, have you related that conversation in detail?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
That's what I estimate that.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So I related it in question.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I don't know.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I don't think of nothing else.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm very concerned about the respect of that particular conversation.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
When next to you contact the committee or the committee contact you,

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
after the incident you just be able to make the senator McCarthy statement to you about November 4th,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
that you have been able to respect the shyness.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
There was a mention in Secretary Stevens office on November 6th.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
No, November. On the 6th day of November?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yes, sir.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I've heard this was a mention given to Madam.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I didn't get very excited with his mind.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
More than anyone else.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
What was the purpose of that mention?

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
Well, I mean, I have a reminder that Secretary Stevens, on the fact that Senator McCarthy has dated us on the 14th and on the 13th,

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
that he has substantial equal cases investigation with about ready to turn it back to the Army.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
The Secretary also was aware of the news paper stories and some conversations that regularly forci had to meet.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
The pattern of the Fort Monmouth investigation.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
He was interested in talking about the word matter.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Additionally, Cohn had been expressing some discrepancy, some irritations,

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
over the types of news stories which from time to time were reaching new papers,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
with reference to the Fort Monmouth matters.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
And with the peer, the dammen do have been generated as a result of the leaks within the Pentagon.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And all of those things were causing, well, was this widely known,

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
I can't say it was a major investigation, but it was a huge issue to look at the stats in the bar,

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm sure.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And all of those matters, a few of the matters,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
which were worthy of exploration.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
And the Secretary does not himself initiate the mention,

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
I think I suggested, and for the purposes that you have just be honest with,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I'll ask you whether or not the...

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
...adventure, hadn't...

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
...whether or not David Cheyenne was invited to that.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
But it is not quite correct to say that David Cheyenne was invited when the mention was talked about.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
As I recall, when I had conversations with Cohn, Cohn may be aware of the fact that Cheyenne might be in town

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
and might be brought along, and that's of course a particularly old lesson.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
I did not tell the Secretary that Cheyenne was coming, and the Secretary did not invite Cheyenne.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
But, they just brought along high levels of people, that was been perfectly alright.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Well, that's been a huge issue in that, Cheyenne.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
I don't know that I said anything to the effects, be sure and get Cheyenne down to New York with his luncheon.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I think I was made aware of the fact that Cheyenne might be in town, and I better be in town bringing along.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
If you want to, I left it as a field of joy.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Give it your wish that he's present in a field, one of the staff who should come.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Great.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
Now, Miss Adams, will you please tell the incidents of November 6th in the second day's office at this luncheon?

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
Not not always, I'm certainly not, but states whether or not on medication.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Any discussion was, was had with respect to G. David Cheyenne.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
There was.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
My room.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, it was initiated by Cohn.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
What specifically dismissed the Cohn state on medication was respect to Cheyenne.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, he pointed out that the committee was losing Cheyenne, the draft.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
He was very important, he had a lot of work to do, he had to conclude.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And the committee needed his help, weekend.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
And the committee might need him, when he said he was interested, the committee needed his help weekend.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
This is even said something to the effects, well, that certainly can be a rain, weekend.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
And then he elaborated on it and said,

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm not sure it will pop you, but we understand this as we thought matters.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
The sex there was present, you were present, Senator McCarthy, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yes, I beggin' with.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
That's very well, I'm going to go ahead and really fuck Mr. Cohn's there.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm secretary indicated that Cohn's going to be the shine to be a bit made available again.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
And he told again that he had told the committee that he would not want to do anything.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Which, let me correct myself.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
I think that's a trust committee about something, I think, and I'll relate that when we get to it.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
But Mr. Cohn stated that Cohn, that they had many witnesses who would have to be interrogated,

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
whose background were known only to shine, and that they would have to have shine available to interrogate them.

07:05.000 --> 07:14.000
And Mr. Cohn said that, if there were isolated instances of that sort, Mr. Cohn indicated that the instances wouldn't be regular,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
but the times, some time, some time, it might have been.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
The time was running the army, we understand.

07:18.000 --> 07:27.000
Shine had then been inducted, but he was still not in uniform because he had some reports until the camp saw upon his temporary duty.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
So he was in the air, he was a soldier of the United States, but he was not yet served.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
He was still on temporary duty in New York.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
He said that Cohn's were to save his life.

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
There would be times when they would have to have shine for a air-day in first-use, or it helps them on matters which he has been working on.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And it stayed in place again.

07:50.000 --> 08:00.000
That situation did occur, that he was sure arranged in Sydney, so the soldiers should be available after training hours to consult with committees.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
So the ones who launched, I mentioned the points to the fact that they were doing that.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Out of the present, not of the present, but anybody.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Well, that's a good idea.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
The arrangement, to which the secretary then agreed to satisfy the secretary, apparently, was Mr. Cohn.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Yes, it seemed that it's after he was in the hospital, and that's just a matter of the time he was present.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Curtis can seem to carry on with the question.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Then out of the present, the committee was spoke to the secretary, and what was that that conversation?

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, I just inquired as to whether or not he anticipated it, whether any difficulty has resolved his death, and every once in a while he was something that it's back.

08:35.000 --> 08:44.000
I do not want to wait in the position where it can be intended, that I have done something to instruct the legitimate work of a congressional committee.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
And this committee can face the needs that that man is officially required.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
I am not going to cut him off until we're written down on how this is intended, that I have done it in any way to have or any of this congressional message.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
All right.

08:58.000 --> 09:06.000
Was there any further discussion on November's things with respect to Shine in addition to what he did say on this item?

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
And shortly after, some time after, it was about it.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
Concordia halfway through the luncheon. General Libra, General Muget, General Sudo joined the luncheon.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
There were no further conversations and no conversations in their press that I recall.

09:21.000 --> 09:30.000
When was the next contact between you and the McCarthy committee investigating committees with particular references to Shine?

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
On the 10th of November, Cohen called me to New York.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
And he pointed out to me that Shine had that day departed by luncheon, New York, for four six.

09:39.000 --> 09:48.000
He reminded me of the best areas, they think it was a luncheon on 6th of November, and he asked me to make general line, the manager of four six, aware of the arrangements that was in the night.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
I read the news, though. I told him, General, I had not previously met him. I interviewed him. I talked to him on the telephone.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
I told him that he was receiving or had received that day's letter of Shine. He didn't know it.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
And I told him that the letter of Shine was associated with the committee.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
And I asked Secretary Steven Pat, I read the committee's private shine to be made available for a weekend on committee business.

10:15.000 --> 10:29.000
And that's, he had also indicated that if the committee had a requirement form for a social business on weekdays, the secretary desires that he may be made available provided, it's just not in the sphere with his claim.

10:29.000 --> 10:43.000
General Ryan's response to me was to the effect that he's of course that arranged it. Instead of say, come down here and want to interrogate witnesses, or something like that, I will make a special room or a special private village available to them so that they can do anything they want here on the boat.

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
I made it quite clear to General Ryan that the soldiers were to be available for committee business, and that it was not for me to be available for training.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
General Ryan and the committee is on the fence, because the secretary is required.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
Now that is the event of November's fence, as it was shown to the telephone column that's going to New York City to view.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
Yes sir. And those are all the events that as of November's fence, relating to Shine, is that correct?

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
That's the question my conversation with General Ryan, I called him to come back on the telephone in New York and told him that I have a meeting.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
For a weekend and for a night hearing of the week, all the committee business is yesterday.

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
And so long I believe you said that this did not interfere with his military claims. That was a clear justification, so it did not interfere with the claim.

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
And you tell us when the next contact between you and any member of the committee was with reference to Jai.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
So it's a coincidence in November's fence.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
So with reference to Shine alone, I think it would be on 7th.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
No, then with reference to Shine and many other suspects in a conversation.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Well I had a theory that telephone column was Mr. Cohn over the weekend.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
I'll go over the time. I'll go over the time. I'll go over the time. I'll go over the 13th. As result of Mr. Cohn's success sentence.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I cannot say what are Shines? What is discussed in any of those conversations?

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
On November 13th, the second day, having Chris Conference, Miss Adams.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Yes, sir, he did. In substance, what was it?

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
The thyrocholids was boiled down to about one state to reference the espionage of Fort Monmouth.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Red Conference to the hour and five minutes.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
55, 56 minutes of interrogation of the press conference, we can turn this fort Monmouth.

12:29.000 --> 12:39.000
And the principle and most significant statement in the one which was related to the middle state was Mr. Cohn's statement to the effect that there was no evidence of current espionage.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
That is the tip to that press conference. Yes, sir.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Was that fitted in the paper? Yes, sir.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
As was all of that, did you receive it? They called from Mr. Cohn, you say?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Yes, sir, I did. What did he say?

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
Well, on that weekend, on the night of the night, the 13th, Miss Cohn called.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
He was very assertive about Mr. Cohn's statement.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
And so this is just very bad. This is just a very serious repercussion.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
It is very damaging to the macaw. That sort of thing.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
You know where Mr. Cohn's macaw was at the time.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't know where he was happy at that time.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
I don't know that he was in Mr. Cohn's place. They didn't have hearings in New York during that week.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I think the hearings were done in Albany, New York.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
And as I recollect, on that weekend, Senator Macaw's meeting had gone to Maine to make some speeches.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Very well. Mr. Cohn's message is very bad.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yes, Mr. Cohn.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
We were out of my habit to use the fact that I'm from Canada.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
That's right. And about the press release.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
That's right. And it might make people think that Senator Macaw's statements

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
through reference to Fort Monmouth weren't true.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
And I attempted to talk in their aviation and the analysis was done in the first conversation.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I said, well, he won't be so bad. Just wait for the papers tomorrow.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
I think Secretary of Justice clarified one situation in the cloud.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Matters to that effect. That's all from Cohn's call to my home in the evening of Saturday.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
But there's no way. No, that's you recall about what hour in the evening about 8.30 and evening.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
You recall how long it lasted? Well, I was thinking about 10 minutes.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Anything you said about China and that conversation? I don't recall.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That's November 13th. Yes, sir.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
When were you next contacted or when did you?

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
I was contacted again on the night of Saturday. No, then the 14th again is my home.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
But I don't know. Then by long distance call again by call.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
That was Saturday afternoon or evening.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Saturday night at 8.21 p.m.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Mr. Adams, where was with Cohn's back?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
He telephoned me from New York. I don't know where he was.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
What city say on that occasion?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Well, he pointed out that he'd read the morning papers.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
I think the New York health tribunal in Chicago was the one with two serves in the most.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
They didn't have a banner headline that they had a news story which was above the fold,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
which in Newfavorite violence, I understand means it was important.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I was in the stream right hand column as I remember.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And they had lined the tourist week on the line.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
And it has a weekday of death.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It has recounted Mr. Steven Davis's press.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And that was the one I think was the certain column.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
I recall what other newspaper stories there were.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
There was a story of some dozen from the New York Times also.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And he was much more dispensed at this time.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
At that time, I recall he pointed out to me that the president of the idea was going to leave

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
and making the case up there, but that he was very proud.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
And that this really caused a degeneration.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
And I don't recall the fact that he made me aware of the fact that this within the way

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
it caused an open break between the Army and the Senate of the Carthage.

15:25.000 --> 15:33.000
And that we might have to have open hearings to the purposes of proving the existence of

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
the best in all Asian business.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
That sort of thing was the substance of the conversation of Friday night,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
we stated on that.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And the column served me very much.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I can't really get a hold of Mr. Steven's press tonight as I recall.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I was not successful.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Why did it disturb you, Mr. President?

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
Well, because I was disturbed, that's the indication of the fact that this was going to cause great

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Senator McCarthy.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Senator McCarthy was now going to be off-diased over the Army,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
whereas the editorial is not what we would call friendly hearings.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
I had been a part participant in hearings in the dodges of the committee president.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
When I chose as a spectator and a representative of the Secretary of the Army,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
we had been being given transcripts of the executive session

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
so that we could turn the move to the signal car.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
And the intelligence agency, the school for an examination to see whether or not there were new

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
factings developed that we didn't then know.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
And of course, as the means of getting our intelligence people to leave,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
and running down, and turning over to the SBI or SBI run now,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I was back, which was a course.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
And I was disturbed over the possibility that this might result in no further permission

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
for me as the only representative to a lot of the hearings when I chose.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
And that it might also mean that we would no longer get a executive transcript

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
and be able to examine the transcript against our record and against the new papers to ascertain,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
OK.

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
And I was disturbed also against the possibility that the Senator might make critical remarks,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
obviously, and that I didn't know what to have.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I just was disturbed, and that's what we thought.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
As you were as well as the importance of Cohen's interview

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
in that telephone conversation of November 14th and the impact it had upon your mind,

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
what if anything, did you do with respect to arranging for a conference with Senator McKaylee on November 16th?

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
I think I said on the night of the 14th, when he had come into Washington,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
and we see, let's talk about this.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
When do we see the Senator?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
He said the Senator's is main.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I don't intend to come to Washington.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
This matter is a word for that event.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I try to get hold of Mr. Steven's bad evening and let's not suspect him.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
I telephone him the next morning, and he was a church.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
And he returned from church.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
I talk to him sometime around 1 or 1 30, I don't remember exactly, am I?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
We're talking to him.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Cohen said it in my reaction.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
And I added to it some Friday night reaction.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
And the indications that these reactions were the reactions of Senator McKaylee,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
which I clearly had in conversation.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Mr. Steven told me to do whatever I could.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
To get together with him, talk things over.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
To call him up in New York, and see how he could get hold of Senator McKaylee here.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
If we can come see him, do it at least.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
He could make a mess at him.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Call him up and report him.

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
So on the afternoon of Sunday, I called Cohen from my home in New York and told him that we'd like to see him.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Like to see if we can get together with him and the Senator would be available.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
I said, well, come to New York and see if you're not coming to Washington.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
He said, no, he will come to Washington next night, which is a safety.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Condipation was short, talk to him at night.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
And the indicator that he would be in Washington next morning, and that he'd come to Washington.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
And the inspector, the call, has come to headquarters in the Comeroy.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That's the purpose of my call.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
And the next morning, the Cohen gets come to Washington.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
He gets come to Washington.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Did he do anything to him?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
No, and Mr. Tide has not come with him.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
The inspector is doing the latest.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
What was said on the morning of the 16th of November at the Pentagon in the sector is awful.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Well, there was a substantial statement of Mr. Cohen's concern.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Uh, by Mr. Cohen, the statement to the inspector.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Now we're going to have help over the hearings, and now we're going to have to get the barriers

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
with Mr. Tide on the stand and prove that they could ask him.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
And that, uh, that was the gift that made me, I think it took a lot for you.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
I think Mr. Tide was there for the last one third or one half.

19:15.000 --> 19:23.000
Mr. Tide, I remember, in the snow, precise statements of Mr. Cohen or Mr. Tide,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
but Mr. Tide joined in the conversation about the hearings.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
While Mr. Shine's name mentioned no matter what.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I don't think so.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Where did you go on November 7th with that?

19:37.000 --> 19:44.000
As a result of the conversation we had with Mr. Cohen on the 16th of November,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
the state in Washington, New York on the 17th of November,

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
for the express purpose of seeing the democracy about the country that concerns Mr. Cohen had expressed in the old week-end.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Did you accompany him on that trip?

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
Yes, there I, somebody who went by aircraft, he flew from Washington to Newark,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
here to Newark, here to Eau, and drove in the 90's and the Newark, here to Eau,

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
to the emergency club that we didn't downtown New York.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
We came here to the courthouse.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
And we got there about noon or 1230.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Mr. Tide and Mr. Tide, today from a ferry, went into the emergency club,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
and I walked over to the courthouse for the purpose of seeing whether or not they were going to be on time

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
for the days that we had made, because I think that's the 1230.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
I walked into the courthouse in room 29, I think is the number of the room in the days in the courthouse

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
where they put an arrow held at hearing.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
And the semi-macafee was sitting in the chair at the head of the table,

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
through the square table, sitting in the center, I leaned over to the canister and spoke to the room

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
and he said, we have one more victim interrogated and then we'll be over.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
I walked back, I walked out of the hearing man, I walked back over to the courthouse,

20:49.000 --> 20:56.000
and sometimes shortly after 1 o'clock, Santa Macarty, party arrived in the including Santa Macarty,

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
Mr. Colme, Mr. Car, I think.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.000
We had lunch at the area of the Puffless Bay of the O'Medad Sea in our any other time that day,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
with respect to this press release of November 13th.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Well, I'm November 14th.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
We went through, we had lunch in a private dining room in Rayson's Club,

21:19.000 --> 21:30.000
a restructuring room, and very shortly after we had started the discussion of the press release again,

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
I think it's soon that the number of I took came in since we sat down on the less-percently

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
table, so it was a bit of a fail.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
And the discussion came up as soon as we got it,

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
and it seems that something to be expected since he didn't understand why Santa Macarty was up there

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
was it?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Santa Macarty's life, where he just was calling the lion,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
and the whole country was feeling something like that,

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
and that every marks which I had enjoyed was a violent mark from the end,

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
that we started from there attempting to...

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
In other words, one of the parties of this kind of race that was called a lion,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
or a lion, that was considered a minor appellation,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
is that what you mean?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
No, I mean my one-go-year, go ahead,

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
I mean that, I have to say to you that I did not think Santa Macarty walked into the lunch and

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
with his fist, double up ready to find and set a ready to go to his.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
The madam's was that press release changed in any way as on that occasion.

22:28.000 --> 22:35.000
As a result of a long conversation with two or three-hour-exposed luncheon and after lunch,

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Santa was a secretary, Steven, and that was the press who had it.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
Learned that this means, and who was busted around the racists club,

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
and finally, first in the once-aparole, and where we need him,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
and where the fire is at home, Santa Macarty,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
and I expected it to be the first time in a minute,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
but I was trying to do it all, and I think we're doing wonderful.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I didn't hear that I had the madam said,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
just walk you in the steps forward, it is not fun.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
We did not walk in the steps, we did not walk in the theme of the letter room.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
The madam said, the madam is ready to negotiate.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Very well, now, the secretary has said, and not to say today,

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
a man there ordered his press release of November 13th and 14th,

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
and he said in state of distress, one minute to press it on four bars.

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
Fast, one evening at state, that the madam had no evidence of trying to see an eye.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
He was taking the podium, that he had no knowledge of what fact

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
might be available to the committee, and that he had not intended

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
to indicate his best statement.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
The doctors who were the doctors of A2 are two and a half hours conference

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
between the secretary and the macartic committee.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
We understand.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
That's right.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Was anything said on that occasion by any members of the macartic committee

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
with respect to the latest kind of error?

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Very early in the afternoon, I would imagine that through the spot.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
I heard Mr. Cohen say, there was first, I heard an indicate

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
that they were going back in the morning to the secretary's next day.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm prevent, sometimes, written that.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
I heard Mr. Cohen say that they had to go first before taking the petition.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
And that I heard Mr. Stade on a couple of the days during the afternoon.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
And sometimes they may have an own, but you can't even find it.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Mr. Stade, the doctor probably has come to us to report this to Stade

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
and the wire bail was continued for six days.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
It would not be a draw all the way for us to go out there and report this.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
And on our way back to Washington, it's really intended to leave

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
with the comments that we've over in the back of Washington.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And the indication was extended and it was effective.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I knew we'd report this.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
We'd report this.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And my name is Amidriar Harris.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Yes, sir.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm an off-saving shy and admittedly.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
You have my grandfather.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Yes, sir.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
I understand.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
One of the request was the one in the patient was extended.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
That's for them to lie without support this secretary's evening.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
And Dr. Hive A.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Colonel Flare has a reasonably-delegated request from somebody on the city.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I don't know who.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
The telephone general Ryan and has Friday's kind available beneath the party when it arrives.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That's nice.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
The telephone call wasn't it?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
The telephone call, similarly.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I shouldn't say it.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I think the telephone call also was made in the choir field.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I'd like to know if we could come.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
That might have been done by four kids.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Do you mind the saying that you say that the secretary calls his aid

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
that calls on a Ryan and tells him how shine is there for it?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
That is my understanding.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
He's the whole second hand.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
And what is that ever said?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
I'm showing what's there.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
How else you would or not?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Thank you.
