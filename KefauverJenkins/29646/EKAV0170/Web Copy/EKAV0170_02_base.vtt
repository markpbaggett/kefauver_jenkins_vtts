00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Do you know who's in the first place?

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
No.

00:06.000 --> 00:14.000
Did you ever hear the secretary announce the state that he desired his photograph taken with the shines?

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
I ask you whether or not I ask you the photograph for a minute.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Your airplane or the secretary's airplane was put into the position of the senator for the purpose of flying him and his staff to Boston.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
And did you not use the secretary's return to Washington that afternoonardingly?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes, that he is.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
The arrangements that they made in the flight on the way for another aircraft we made available.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
When we arrived there was a small crash at the beach gas station in the west of Michigan.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
It was a smell to end the aircraft at about 60-40.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Anyway, it got you down here to Washington.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
That's just that.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
But we landed at Fort Dick and my recollection we were on the ground about eight minutes.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
And the speed was invented and the maintenance was a no-moved weight.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
We had interengagement for seven o'clock and it was about six thirty before we took off.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
And I hesitated for a moment to look some way and I turned around and saw if it turned very unmistakable.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
And Mr. Shaven, dividing almost the dog's body over their aircraft, and I had to stop to get on the aircraft.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
So were any of your requests made to view our Mr. Shaven's fear and knowledge that day with respect to Shaven?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I remember something.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Fort Dick?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I remember not. Not at Fort Dick.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
When were you next contacted or when did you next contact the McCarthy Committee?

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
In which there was a discussion with respect to Shaven or any late preferential treatment files?

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Well, on November 18th, General Ryan, many General Fort Dick, that's an exchange.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Telephone reinstated.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
He had a request from the Sunday staff for a long weekend pass.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
She didn't tell you from whom particularly on that staff he had that request.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm sorry.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
What was the request, Mr. Adams?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
For a long weekend pass.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
What did General Ryan say and then did he do about it?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
He said he intended to.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
He did?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
What sort?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
What did you say to General Ryan?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
What instruction did he do?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
About that long weekend pass.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
When he said that to me,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
my initial reaction is to let's buy him your boss.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And I think I said something like that to him.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
But as soon as I did it, I then picked up the interform,

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
which is a communication system directly to the Secretary of the Social and on the Good Board,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
on both of them or else I saw him in the dining room, this was a new time.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
And I pointed out to him,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I said to General Ryan, what I'm getting to do is

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
and they had made the request harshly based on the fact that Shaven had not yet entered his room.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
And he had not yet entered his training cycle.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
And he said, we say the training cycle, and he was now doing housekeeping duties and things of that sort.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
And Mr. Steven, Mr. Steven stated that,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
as long as the training has not started,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
as long as the request has come from the committee,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
and if you're the faculty, then only just one day previously,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
the senior has passed the press conference location.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
He felt that it would be better to make Shaan available for as long as we can pass.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And under those circumstances, in the deal of that instruction and the decision,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I telephone General Ryan back and told him that Steven's feeling on the matter,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
and so General Ryan said it would be all right against him.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
And I'm standing at his ramps back.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
That's November 18th.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
And as a result of your conversation with the Secretary, Shaan,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
was he November 18th with a wind station,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
although the long weekend pass is quite long.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Very well.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Now, what has occurred that weekend, Mr. Adams, if anything,

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
have any unusual interest with respect to that long weekend pass?

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
But the refresher recollections, they found it all on Friday

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
or Friday evening of that week are Saturday morning.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
The incident, which you were asking me about, occurred about a month later.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
About a month later?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Very well.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
When was your next contact with the committee with respect to Shaan, Mr. Adams?

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, about this time.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
So I remember 18th, now, it's that.

04:24.000 --> 04:35.000
And I am dividing from the German conjunction and trying to answer you precisely,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
because I cannot.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
But about this time, and for the period of about the next three weeks,

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
I had a series of telephone calls from Colme, with reference to Shaan.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
And what really about what specifically did you say today began to be primarily about

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
the New York assignment for Shaan, immediately as a conclusion of the first eight weeks of April.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
And as the month wore on November and as the transition in December went on

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
and during December, they got more and more difficult to handle.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
And told me more and more, especially, the incidents.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
How, under those calls, come to you, Mr. Adams.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Approximately.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
There was, there was, say, come to me.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
There were calls to me.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Very regularly, I can't say the calls to me for every day.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
There were some long distance calls from New York.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
There were occasions during this period.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
So, with a wear, the rest of many business or requests on the arms required me to say telephone calls to Mr. Colme.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
And during many of these calls that I might say to Mr. Colme, I was protected from alcohol,

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
during the course of the telephone call to the things that were taken.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Extreme pressures with reference to a dismissal for a New York assignment for Shaan.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Immediately, have the conclusion of the day weeks of April.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
And you say that was during the month of November, I say November 18th.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Well, after he was in supper, after he actually arrived to stay up and hill, December 9th.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Up until December 9th, when an incident occurred.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We only had his induction.

06:18.000 --> 06:26.000
And December 9th, of customately, how many telephone calls dismiss the call make to you with reference to Shaan.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
And our Shaan and the committee work as related to his investigation report, Mama.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I have a record of only eight incoming long distance calls in Colme.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
I am not able to isolate how many times during that scene.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And that is eight calls from Colme during that period of one month's sub-twenties November 10th.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Eight long distance calls dismissing, while he was in New York, 87.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Well, they are not you getting a local call during that period of time from his phone with him watching to.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
Yes, but as I say, I don't know the day he's been watching them, so I am not able to tell you how many times.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I have no recalls from him.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
He is a four-characterist call.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
In this investigation, there were long distance calls from Mr. Cohn's knees in Washington, when he was in New York.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
There were long distance calls that I might have faced in Mr. Cohn in New York.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
There were local calls with Mr. Cohn might have faced in me when he was in Washington.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
There were local calls that I might have faced in this cone.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
My guess is that it is only a guess that during a period, the period is due with re-referring.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
There was a least call a day.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Maybe it wasn't every day that I was expected to average out to every day.

07:34.000 --> 07:44.000
And I was expected to be at least half of those calls had rolling into them with such a shyness.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
And during this particular period, just a ticket a month, the pressure became extremely high to bear.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
I ask you whether or not some of those calls came to your home.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
They did.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
In the evening, yes sir.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
How late is night?

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Mr. Adams, would you say you were sometimes contacted by Mr. Cohn?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Either by local or long distance calls.

08:07.000 --> 08:18.000
Close my home, 13 November, 8.46 A.M., 14 November, 8.21 P.M., 20 November, direction.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
One December, 8.43 P.M., at all.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Around 8.30 a.m., calls usually things.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
How I have a recollection of one or two calls which does me out of six.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
I have no recollection of that call, however, to suspend the exact recollection.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And I will qualify it also by saying that I was better.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
You, you, you retire.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Yes sir, we have an incident against us at four o'clock in the morning.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
How long was some of those calls late, Mr. Adams?

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, the call, what I had the longest call you ever had, had you ever received.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
I couldn't get you well, Mr. Jenkins, I am high, yes.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
I have a recollection which is not borne out by the record.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I'll call, it's lasted about 45 minutes.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
45 minutes, yes sir, but I have no, I can find no recollection to support it.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
And you say that in a least high so-called, the subject of David Chien was discussed.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
That is my recollection.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
I let you whether or not in some of those calls which Chien's name was mentioned.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
There was likewise mention of the investigation of Fort Monmouth.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
It was.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
Mr. Adams, I will ask you whether or not in any of those calls, during the period of time you have mentioned,

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
Mr. Cornlates complaint with respect to any double cross on the part of the secretary with respect to his promises.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Relating to Chien, first title.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yes sir, that he did.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Well, out, specifically what do you say?

09:45.000 --> 09:53.000
Well, practically everything that went wrong in the fire Mr. Cornlates concerned having to do with Chienlates was an army double cross.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
In what the state did he say that there has been an army double cross?

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
Here, here, here, here, consider me a head of unit.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Well, all these things I'm telling you that he double cross, things occurred.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
They subsequent to December 90s, that's the right.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, in that period, there were incidents with Chienlates around December 9th.

10:19.000 --> 10:26.000
I was looking back to the period where this said that you say that you felt that there was terrific pressure in being brought to the fire for New Year's special design.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
I can say that the pressure I was receiving from Mr. Cornlates, exceeded all of the pressures that I have ever received from all of the others,

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
officials of the time that this is whom I have negotiated with Mr. Chienlates.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
I think that occasionally you just get a letter from perhaps the members of this committee.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
With respect to some M. D. D. D. D. is that correct?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I was told no letter from any member of this committee.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
But from senators and from congressmen and other people, it was very welcome.

10:54.000 --> 11:09.000
And the time I get letters during the past five years, my assignments have concluded a considerable amount of negotiations with congressional committees, with committee staff, and sometimes with members of Congress and members of the Senate.

11:09.000 --> 11:26.000
And the views that I took as reference to Chienlates during this period, if we were filed together, all of the views that I had from all of the other members of Congress and all of the other congressional committees over a period of my years, which was not some kind of a significant situation.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
The views are homies.

11:29.000 --> 11:41.000
So, 30 heading around and I hope you all enjoy your last long lunch hour. We need a few 30 today.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
The Dr. Chienlates' mother now, for the committee, will hold its next session as 2.30 is the afternoon.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
The testimony of the executive secretary, that was decided to assign it to the public.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
This is the testimony.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
I don't want to let you come to the door.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
We have to divide it up.

12:03.000 --> 12:13.000
We have to take some of all of the questions.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
We have to take it away again.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Let's have a bullet.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
We have to go to the red line.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
We have to take one turn and we have to find the police.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
And these are them for the legal committee.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Take me down there.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Here we go.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Here's the panel.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Backway, the superintendent of the Senate press gallery, finding miracles.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
The first one to warrant a conflict with the United States.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Marking date and a little strike favor.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And others, the reporters, must be around here, are back together.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
There are copies.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
The superintendent of the radio and television gallery.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
I think it's perhaps the death of the infection, Tony DeAndre.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
No, Bob, there's the radio and television superintendent of our gallery.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
Here are your copies.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
The first one, right there.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Give you one.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
John Adams will probably be the witness together this afternoon,etted.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
This will be the last day of the hearing.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
We will start at 2.30.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Tomorrow they will start at 2.30.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Tomorrow morning they will start at 10.00 a.m.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
A month passing after the first copy of the executive executive.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
The executive executive is back for Mr. Welch.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
You got one?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yes.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Mr. Byron, get one.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Yes, yes, yes.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Mr. Welch, Mr. Byron, please come to Mr. Welch.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
And you will see that these hearings are included then.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
And the superintendent records, he's about to be getting as he can do so

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
or as an exhibit somewhere in the long life.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
The other is the week.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Broke.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
You may have a round of applause.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
The director will be getting out.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
It's happy to have the visitors who have...

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
come to our committee room and if we have not done here before,

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
I should repeat that we have a firm understanding with these officers

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
and the playing clothes within the audience.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
That there ought to be no audible manifestations of approval or disapproval at any time.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
And if there are, the officers are asked to express politely from the room

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
without further worries from the chair.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Those who violate the understanding by which the executive committee room.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Which is to be trained from manifestations of approval or disapproval.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
If the attention can be perceived as a result.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
The Adam's I want to go back to November 28, 1953.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
Say whether or not there was a new state of strike in New York as of that state.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Now, Mr. Jenkins, before you proceed with your question,

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
I would like to make a minor correction in the statements that I made immediately before lunch.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
Council has called my attention to the facts immediately before lunch.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
And of course, in the interrogation, I stated that I had no recollection

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
or that I did not think that I had as much of you from Senators

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
as I had had in this particular interview.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
And that is incorrect because I recall no instances where I ever had that abuse from Senators.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And I wish to stay true.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Does that also even Senator McKite?

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
They used an average recall no instance with you.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Every entity of these from Senators is adamant that you're safe from the center.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Is that correct? Is that correct?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Is that correct?

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Excepting for one instance which will be related to latest justice.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
Now, I have to do about a new state of strike in New York as of a possible in November 28.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Was there not there one?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
There was.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
And the prosecution of the New York State was suspicious.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
What happened at that time that it was just fire of the New York State?

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
We're hearing being conducted to the McCarthy Committee in New York City.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Hearing you say, then conducted in New York,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
you're missing two November's as I remember.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
And I was present in New York on November 24th and November 25th when I returned to Washington.

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
I returned to Washington with the understanding that there were people hearing in New York.

16:00.000 --> 16:11.000
And during the following week, I'm quite sure that they could look more like the calendar.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Over that weekend, I think I was still aware of the weekend with the 28th Saturday.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
I was still of the opinions that hearings were scheduled for New York.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
When the newspaper site occurred, what happened to the hearings?

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
The were then being conducted in New York with respect to whether or not they were transferred.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Well, hearings began in Washington on December 7th.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
What happened?

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Can you tell the committee whether or not you know why the hearings were going on?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Why the hearings were transferred to Washington?

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Well, I don't know why, but I know what I was told.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Well, by whom were you told?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
I was told separately by Cohn and by Car.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Then you may say, oh, what's Mr. Cohn and Mr. Car told you?

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
That the hearings in New York were being transferred to Washington because in New York,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
newspapers died getting popular.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
I might say, you're up for a moment just making the news in November 26th,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
because I have not become a newspaper.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I have been to the county's mountains.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
I'm November 26th, that the conclusion of the hearings in New York I return to wine.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I plan to go by here.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I was going to be in County of Mrs. Car.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
We missed our airplane.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
That was there for you.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
And went to the New York, and put in the railroad space station and came to walking together on the train.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
On the train station.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
The train station takes about three hours.

17:35.000 --> 17:43.000
And as I saw at the time, fully one hour of our entire conversation was directed to Chant.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
And it was filled with cars.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Mr. Car's observations to me.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
To the effect that in the long.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
For so long as the sign was not that effected by a sign.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
That effected in the car.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Cohn was very, very, very, very troubled.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
It's 5.00 pm.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
He saw his irritations.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
He wasn't proposing it as an independent proposal to my team.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
But I felt that he was asking on to me,

18:13.000 --> 18:22.000
the feeling he had, that as long as the assignment of Chant was not that effected, we could expect trouble.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I bet there's no room for 25 for you, right?

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
The Pennsylvania Railroad is in this emergency watching between 3.45 and the National Unified Alliance.

18:30.000 --> 18:39.000
We were discussing the events that made of December 9th when we were stressed that the new hour is that correct Mr. Adam?

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
No, certainly we hadn't.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
We were on 16th November December 7th and November 7th.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
We hadn't yet discussed November 8th.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
December 8th?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yes.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
What occurred on December 8th, Mr. Adam?

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
Over hearings of this committee for held in this room,

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
a principal witness from Charagated, I believe was Karen Hoen.

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
I was sitting behind the committee's table approximately the right time when he came here now.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
At the time, he was sitting in the chair of the Senate Month on the office.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
I was sitting with my assistant, Charles Hatton,

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
and a number of the cases during the course of the interrogation.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Of the witness, when others were interrogating,

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
home, that of him came over and spoken to me about science,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
saying things to me like, what about things?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
What about things?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
What about things?

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
It continued in a middle age throughout the year morning.

19:40.000 --> 19:49.000
Nothing to tell us has a result of it other than the fact that I managed to turn the questions back morning.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm that afternoon.

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
While I was in my office, I received the wrong distance telephone calls and general rions demanding general support.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
He stated to me that, by the time, by the time,

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
weekday availability, the liquidity has duped out of hand,

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
and so far as he was concerned, he felt that his numerous assets were interfering

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
or were going to interfere with his training.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
He said that he feared that the soldier would be seen in the front of the business,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
not connected with the committee,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
and he said that on one of the recent passes in the last two or three days,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
the soldier had not returned to the post until 4.55 in the morning.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
He pointed out that the soldier's training units were scheduled to go on the range very shortly for firing.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
He felt that the boy might be safe on a safe and secure spot.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
And it kept up, so he said,

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
that he proposed to terminate the soldier's availability for passes on weekdays.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
And I stated to him that I was sure that that was available to the suspect service,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
so the suspect service had very few days to that day.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
So the availability was, what for weekdays is that it did not interfere with the committee,

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
which the training and also that it was to be with the conference of general rions.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
And whenever general rions did not concur, then that particular day would be coming.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
That was the end of my conversation with general rions.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I transmitted a question.

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
There was one further thing I stated in a rion that I was quite agreed to do the business degrees,

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
that he should terminate the weekday availability for a certain time,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
because it was of the previous 4.59.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
But that I felt that Mr. Stevens had made a rather clear confession as to availability for a week's end

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
after the soldier training was completed.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
And I felt that he would have to build a soldier available on weekends,

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
and he would want to hire Mr. Stevens to escape it at the lunch and at the number six.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
General rions agreed that that would not interfere with the soldier training,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
he would still be made available a week and the committee did not.

21:54.000 --> 22:03.000
I felt that it was necessary that the state and general rions and he would have four cohorts with it.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
That is that.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
That is my guess.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
As a result of that, the committee did hear any more.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I received an appropriate problem.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
He was a senator, Mr. Conor, Mr. Cosm,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
Quim following morning hearing his events again.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Conor was aware, because that December 19th,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
he can remember that his home was aware of the decision on weekdays,

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
and he would begin getting up regularly from the committee table,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Conor and Tickton, he was about times availability,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
and he was very self-petalist,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
a boss who was taken on week and week nights,

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
and he talked to me about the treatment,

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Mr. Stevens, that the double cross,

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
and I mean double cross, that the commitment already made,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
and I was a Stevens double cross.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Well, I was told there were a number of people who were allowed to ask me.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Yes, it was not in here.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
He considered it as a double cross, and he stated that he considered it as double cross,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
just Stevens double cross, to create a categorized.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
I was again sitting in the chair approximately directly behind where he was sitting.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
On the morning of the night,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Con came over to me again,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
and just to say that the morning he was so persistent,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
the rest of the time, what about time, thing?

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
That is just the depth of the point where I decided I would sit in the contractor's house.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
I turned to my assistant, the captain, to be high-fittered,

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
dated to him, and I was going during the night to sit in the contractor's house,

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
and to accept the pressure I was receiving from the client.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
As a conclusion of the hearings, about 12.30,

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
I followed him from the client's room, and up to his office.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
There was a newspaper man talking to him, and he dropped off one by one by the time,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
we got to him and sent him a copy of the office.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I went along with him.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I met his office with him and asked about his people,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
to him for a few moments, and he said, that, cool.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
I went and he was off, and I told him that I was, I told him that,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
I told him that, I had no sense of him,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
and that I had not told him,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
he had had a good relationship with John,

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
but it is great to find where I was,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
no longer able to take it,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
to introduce his confidence, pressure was difficult,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
and that I did not think that I had taken it,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
and I asked him if there was some of them,

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
and we talked about the safety cone.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
The safety cone in particular has not to hang your cone with me,

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
and at the same time, and that's the reason for the deterioration

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
of my relationship with me, that is why I was illicit, I had worked.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
And at the same time, I made the cone aware of that,

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
that this ought to be taken to different things.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
And I was happy, that he felt there was some proper,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
and that he was right-blooded, because he had no problem.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
And until there was no further insurance,

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
that is the stuff that went to that kind of situation.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I returned to my office,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
sometimes during the afternoon, I received a telephone call from time

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
from cone, and I answered the phone,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
he started outside saying something to the effectors.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
I'll take you what it means to go over my head.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
What was the sentence you referenced to being in a number

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
of English hearsay?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Well, he was there,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
from the literature,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
and you get it, the literature.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Well, it's a relate what the sentence is.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
He said that he would teach me what it meant to go over his head.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I said, no, Roy, is that a threat?

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
And he said, no, that's a problem.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
And I sent some little time on the telephone after that.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
I don't call exactly how long, five minutes,

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
ten minutes attempting to complete.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
And he made quite a point of the fact that I had no one help.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
To talk to any sentence, I could only talk to him.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I pointed out the empty,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
he asked me how I would feel that he went to the police.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I told him that he was a liberty-built,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
he didn't do it at any time, he chose.
