WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
And have that I have the I knew

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Why do you ask that?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Asked if they were working.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
No, I was the one who brought us a subject of overseas issues.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Why?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Why?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
What is next assignment was going to be?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
And the one to be here, he didn't go overseas,

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
and I did hear that the moment.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Well, if I say that, that is not correct.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
They asked me what is the next assignment was being.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
And they wanted to be sure it was New York.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
That seemed to be their consistent task.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
What is it that would you say?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
That they didn't want to go overseas?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Didn't you say that it was our confessional?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I say that it was a conversation and how they had reacted to my actions.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
They might go overseas.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Well, when you suggest that they might go overseas,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
you say that they asked you what was the next assignment?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Very unpleasant.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Very unpleasant.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
If I gave you the impression that they wanted to go overseas?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes, that's correct.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
That's all I knew.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
That is the same role they were in.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I felt that we knew proper.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I felt that we had an obligation to all of them in the service.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
And every child in my state of finance, however,

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
they assigned the decision to the law.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
When you did have the authority, you were the Secretary of the grant,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
the Secretary of the Interior Commission, did you not?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Secretary had an authority.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
You also had the authority to send him in New York to be the West want to be sent to.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yes, that's the Secretary of the Interior.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
You had the authority to assign him to the New York area, didn't you?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yes, sir.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
You go have the authority to keep him going overseas, don't you?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes, sir.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Are you going to exercise or not?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
My understanding is the Secretary of the Army.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
He can't do nothing.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
The government is planning to file a challenge.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Other than what the government has to resolve,

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
the normal path that the people are planning to do.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Why don't you?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Why can't you feel that you might grant this request

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
in order to get along with the two that is you say?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
The other responsibility is too many people, sir.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
There are 10 billion people who've been in the Army.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
The life can be used.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And everybody in the industry has been out in New York.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
They will all fall off and come in under the threat of services.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
One of the things comes, sir, that the people of this company begin to discuss.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
They take a living, let the service system, the Congress will take it off the book.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
The days conversation, let the service system off the book, sir.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
The things that the Army will think of the need for on the Air Force will be paid by about 60%.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, one minor, this is not an unusual request for the Department to receive.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
This is to keep some work and going overseas.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I don't think you received those request recently.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Request of that sort, sir.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
They don't come to me.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I don't ordinarily.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
You don't ordinarily, sir.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
No, sir.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
No, you're regarded.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
You're regarded as a request for rep.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Two people, one sentence request from it.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Under certain circumstances, they are preferential reasons.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Under some circumstances, they are what they call humanitarian or some kind of reason.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
There may be a situation where a young man, mother is violent, there may be a situation where he just brought arms here for food, fashion, and freedom.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Do you regard such requests just to keep some money from going overseas?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Do you regard it as a request for preferential reasons?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I just say it.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Did you regard this request as a preferential reason?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Very definition.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Did you regard the request for a direct commission in the army?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
A request for preferential reasons.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, I think that's where I wasn't present during the time of that request.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Many such requests come in, and the young men are evaluated.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, there's nothing wrong in making a request.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
I say there may be something wrong in making a request, and there is nothing wrong in finishing a man.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
It isn't qualified.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Many men are, and special requests are asked.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
So is there anything related to that just a request for a direct commission?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
That would be a miscommunication here.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
It was not the initial request.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
But for soon thought, after they knew I had been no way in it in 12 months, I was just a question that request after me.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
It says, my understanding that there was a specialist there that I was not a practitioner.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
That's the only one to be a direct commission.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Downline is I make a request.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Now I have a question again.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Then when that failure could not get a direct commission, they went to these next requests.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Making further requests.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yes.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
How many times have you been called to try to do some five and all the key meetings?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Thank you very much.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
One.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Five.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Oh, Mr. Cone.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Mr. Cone.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
A question, Mr. Cone.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I think that they want to go twice.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
One sentence is I am high-perjume.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Let's go all the time.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I cannot accept them.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
The last year's Anderson, you took a call and come in to the highland.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
If you are required and the secretary of the Army is requesting that, he might be speaking for the key.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
It's so unusual that there is nothing short of them.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
They never tell the board that you know of.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
You have any question or other, if they never tell the board.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
The only thing is they call for anyone in the area without that team.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
They call for anyone.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
That's for I, the second day of office of the Council of the Office, they keep a private vehicle KV.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I have no say to them.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I'll explain.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Do you have any information?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
That is my first.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I know.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
In the part.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
You can have them.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
On the ground.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
If it's private time and the city they hear.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Or if they ever see, they will find out in New York.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
That they hear, they thought Mama would have had this interview.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
But I don't know about the hearings.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Of course, Mama.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I don't think that they would have been able to hear.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, then you definitely know that your, just thought it was in the call.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
What have they?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Well, there's no doubt about that in my mind, sir.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
And that, uh, something that's been through the first few years.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
Uh, I was made continuously aware of the fact that the, uh, the so-called abuse of the Army was just coming from the committee.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
It was coming.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
It's showing the sign of New York's remain.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
On the ground, I'd like to have you refer to the, uh, that's the case.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Uh, presented by a send of the faculty and let the colon and Mr. Carp.

06:05.000 --> 06:14.000
On page three, the last paragraph of the point four.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Are we speaking?

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
These sentences we have, I'd like to ask for them on the list.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
There are in words, Communists and other security residents in the Army.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Which need and receive until the public is closed.

06:30.000 --> 06:38.000
Now, the question I'd like to ask you, Mr. Adams, are there now comments and other security residents in the Army?

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
Well, there are, I don't know how many communists there are.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
Uh, as with the students there, we must always assume that there is communist infiltration.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
And, uh, there is a continuing problem with reference to security.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
In all agencies of the government, just as there is in the Army, we have a continuous number of investigators always on the way.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
At all times, Army headquarters and we have time and security relations with the two in Washington,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
of individuals who are elected to the security risk.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
So it must be administered.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
It must be assumed.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
That's their icon in this.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
And, uh, there are some of the students who are elected to the security risk.

07:22.000 --> 07:31.000
Are you satisfied with the loyalty procedures that now exist in the Army to root out communists and other security risks?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
The presence of the investigators procedures.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
Well, whatever procedures you have, you're investigating procedures and I assume you're loyalty to the force structure, right?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
I'm not supermaneer, I'm just a watcher.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I'm a structure like this.

07:45.000 --> 07:54.000
But I want to let you know, uh, and I assume you would seek for a factor if the administration is satisfied with the presence of the case.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
There is a subsidy. That's because always something to review.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It always can be approved.

08:00.000 --> 08:12.000
And as recently as two months ago, we have made changes in regulation because of the fact that we discovered a defense in regulations which permitted a security risk to remain on.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And the service is longer than he should have after he was elected.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
And there is a constant continuing effort to improve our government.

08:20.000 --> 08:35.000
I believe that you've justified and the flexibility that has been justified, that has resolved all the investigation and hairy report mama that security risk were removed much faster than they normally will.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Now, get back, get back to the case.

08:39.000 --> 08:48.000
It was seen to me that there would be a tighten up or a faster process for removing security risks within the arms.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Now, I have this, uh, you, uh, a rate would recommend.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
Well, I, I'm not only a rate of that, you can consider, but I, uh, I remind you, I think this is even specified.

08:57.000 --> 09:16.000
And I think that I may have referenced yesterday to the fact that when, when Secretary Steven first became aware of the report mama investigation or the fact that I was reporting mama, he caused the re-examination demakes to be made of the procedures by which security risk, I suspended.

09:16.000 --> 09:28.000
And he caused that, I'm not sure I said this yesterday, but he caused a special new instruction to go out on October 29th, which was prepared, which he directed on 9 on October, or 8 on October.

09:28.000 --> 09:45.000
And the instruction was, hey, the instruction to commanders on the spot to exercise is already, we've already had some delegations to suspend, if they sell reason to, without waiting for recommendations to go through.

09:45.000 --> 10:08.000
The machinery to one firm, which might take a very long time, has a new procedure, result in an, an, an, an, an, an, an, an, an, an, an, an action with otherwise under the old practices.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
It might have taken my time.

10:11.000 --> 10:32.000
I was the Army, if the Army in charge of the security of all Army personnel, now, some places I was informed that the green boards or a lot of the boards are designated by the restful location,

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
and in other words, the Air Force has certainly probably the United States, the Army and other parts, and then the Navy and other parts.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
That's right. I just tried to, thank you, there's a little confusion.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
And then, if I may, I'll tell you what, I don't consider the future, there is very natural matter of confusion.

10:48.000 --> 10:59.000
But the Army has a responsibility for the security of all Army personnel, and handling the security matter of the Army personnel,

10:59.000 --> 11:08.000
they are processed through a hearing board, initially at the Army area, and then they are reviewed by the review board or the screening board, and what, the things through with you,

11:08.000 --> 11:27.000
which there is a geographical distribution with a responsibility belonging to one service in one area, is the industrial security program, which is the responsibility for the boards, which here, the cases of the Indian employees of the fence of plants, for instance, in New York,

11:27.000 --> 11:36.000
in New York, in New York, the Air Force might be coordinated with the Army, in New York area, as a responsibility.

11:36.000 --> 11:53.000
And if there is a different contract given to a private firm in the New York area, by the Air Force, and there are security matters involving employees of that private firm, they are heard by an industrial security board,

11:53.000 --> 12:05.000
and the military is the responsibility of the Army, and by the same token in another part of the country, the Navy may have the responsibility, and there may be an Army contract given to a private firm in Chicago,

12:05.000 --> 12:13.000
and the good deals �un and Connie were committing first mail, in that case, that are working in the fence conference, that's right, that is the deal.

12:13.000 --> 12:28.000
And I think the future is turned to page 6 of the Sunday morning specifications number 10, and I wish to read the letter part of that, that's that's the case.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
If they, without spending on necessary time on the charges of Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams, that's their treatment of Mr. Gine, and fluency investigations, there should be no reason.

12:36.000 --> 12:49.000
Mr. Gine is still a private in the Army, and news stories, boarding reliable sources have stated that the reason he was not given a consideration to which he would otherwise have been untriedled, was because of his connections with the committee.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
Now the first question I'd like to ask you, Mr. Adams, gets private Gine received, preferable prison.

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
The only reason we received was that out of the ordinary, wasn't making him available to the committee for a committee business.

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
But there is fantastic only, I've made by yourself and also about the secretary, that, that wasn't that serious, preferable reason.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
All this is evidence that he was making me, that he was taking a step with us to assist, to believe in the work.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
Now, the Mr. Gine himself, has for a special consideration from you.

13:23.000 --> 13:35.000
No, Mr. High, I, I, have no one to shine very likely. I saw him in New York, I sat next to him as much one day, I saw him in charity, during two days of hearing, I spoke to him half the two meetings for maybe as long as two or three meetings.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
I shook hands with him on my head, I'll clear a plan, and remember, it doesn't mean to stand big, and that is about the extent my claim to be.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Good.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I reject, I reject.

13:48.000 --> 13:59.000
Mr. Adam, were you convinced that Mr. Carr initiated any of the requests that he made to you from time to time?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm speaking on general.

14:02.000 --> 14:09.000
I never had a feeling that he had been instructed to talk to me. No, I felt that he, I felt that they were voluntary conversations on this part.

14:10.000 --> 14:18.000
I mean, did you really believe that, that in the overall setup, what you understood pretty well, Mr. Coleman, General Counsel, Senator McCarthy being the chairman of committee?

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
Mr. Carr is the executive director, did you really believe that Mr. Carr was as an individual putting any pressure on you?

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
Well, as I started the state, I started the state, I was just as a month, I felt that this had been changed that day, January 20th.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
Mr. Scott has called me into the role of the total. He has called me an amateur, and that's just a close audience for the floor.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
January 20th, and he has talked to me at some point, about the time I was being back on the train to New York.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
So, let me, did you insert the code call?

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
They initiated by Mr. Carr, or was he merely relaying a request from Mr. Cole?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Well, frankly, it's been the Jackson.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I mean, I want to be a candidate, and I'm trying to...

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I hope you're safe in mind at the time.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
Frankly, I hope I am. I often publish to myself, just to whether or not this was one technique while the film's tactic were another technique,

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
or whether or not these were the signs that they could call, or whether or not he felt that he was getting me friendly advice.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
So, the pattern situation...

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
Well, up until January, this state prior to the two calls, called.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
The Jews believe in your own mind, where you convinced in your own mind that he was initiating any of these calls himself,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
or in any of these conversations...

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
The conversation we've had on the train coming back from New York, which took quite a long time.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
And I'm sure he hasn't been instructed that he was the doctor when he got on the train.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
The subject came up naturally, but I remember thinking to myself,

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
a lot of times the train came through bold, and we had talked about practically nothing else.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
There had been some of the reasons that, if he was the new, he would do so.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
It's so much time with the Lord of the Cross. I had no feeling that he was to shun.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
I had no feeling that he had been instructed when he got on the train, that he didn't set that hand.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Did he ever use any of my super-div language, or when I needed him?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
It's a man thing.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Actually, don't you think maybe he was just carrying out the instructions or relaying a request?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I don't know, sir. I was puzzled by it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
It was a puzzling situation.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It really was.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Do you mean you were puzzling your own mind just what is the role of?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
What is the role of?

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
Well, he always said to me, I have no personal interest in this, but I really think you are going to understand.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
The trouble you are going to be in, and the continuum trouble you are going to be in, but he wasn't threatening you.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
No, he didn't.

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
What did you say that he was merely relaying a request from Mr. Colton?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
No, he wasn't relaying a request.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
He was relaying a request I think of sign he called me an average.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I had a feeling he didn't fire me when he called me a football coach.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
It was because he perhaps had been instructed to make a call.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I didn't know, however.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
But his conversation he persisted until the point in a very different way.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
You can't say for certain that his words were his own.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
I mean, it's reference to the certain conversations.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I think they were his own.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
I think he was telling me that he wasn't told.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Colton, I think he was telling me that your sign being trouble was his own.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
But do you really think he was doing it on his own?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Well, I think he was 20th of January.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
I really felt that he was an agent.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
And that he was more or less the French living request.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
And at the same time trying to find his identity is a trouble we think.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
But the situation changed that in January.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
After January.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
But I used to say it positively that prior to January 20th,

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
the goings on was pretty much of a relay nature between...

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Well, I did it for the first time and yourself.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I didn't find it personally, it not just.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And I think I chose status to send it to the flow.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
And when I talked about that time, I hadn't sailed up to them.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
They had misdiagnosed or had a true red reference to sign within any way in progress.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
But I think that that became a question.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
So when he talked to you about what he thought was good advice to you.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
You believe that he was trying to put pressure on you.

18:23.000 --> 18:30.000
Or do you think he was trying to convey to you what he thought was the right and the right for you to follow in there?

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
Not being his judgment, but a judgment based on what he knew, the position of the committee might be.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Well, I think that there was a little vote.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Some part of it used to be, what else can they use to lead his judgment?

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
I don't think that his phone call at Amherst had anything to do with judgment.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
I don't think his telephone call was coming in.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Dr. Coda had anything to do with judgment.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
And I think that the cumulative effect could be considered.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
And the final analysis of all we need to know by the person much,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
and how they form a question.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Was there a serious question here?

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Mine, whether Mr. Carr was doing any of these things on his own?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, the weather doubted my mind as I as I as stated.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
I felt that if there didn't no phone pressures, there would have been no vibrations.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Now, turn to court, Sixth of most.

19:22.000 --> 19:30.000
As I understood the testimony previously, General Ryan was a child-active from the beginning.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
So it was advised that private time should be made available from time and time for committee business.

19:37.000 --> 19:46.000
Did you make any attempts to find out whether private time was working on committee business?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Did I?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
We talked many great things.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Let me ask you this.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
You were aware of all of this along the Thanksgiving weekend.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
There are a lot of them that are 18 November.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
The one of them that went there, Thursday, yes, all the Monday or Thursday.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Oh, then, still Monday, yes.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Was there a Thanksgiving weekend?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
No, it's three days, thank you.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
You know what, that was on committee business.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I don't know, okay.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Well, then, where was it?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
It came to General Ryan, so I remember with many facts.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
That's all I know.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, a thing that I don't quite understand in connection with this operation that is for Dick.

20:23.000 --> 20:32.000
Who determined when he was believed with private time simply a request of his company commander that now I have committee business tonight, I take off?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I mean, what was the...

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
Well, it's my understanding that, first, telephone call ordinarily came from members of committee staff to General Ryan's aid, Lieutenant Splump.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
And were by him transmitted to the company commander.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
How many calls?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I have, I don't know, sir. I don't have those.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
Well, now, you said you testified there was a request to get off K.T.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Yes, that was on January 9th, telephone call.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
What day of the week was January 9th?

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
It was a Saturday. The time was in New York on Saturday and it had been in trouble.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
So he had to be back on Saturday night for K.T. to be on Sunday.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
And it was on Saturday afternoon, so I received a call.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
Well, were you requested to get him off K.T. to engage on the Senate committee business on Sunday?

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
I was told that he was in New York.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
And that, I don't remember the exact conversation with the inference.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
I think the suggestion was made that he was working with Mitch Cohn.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
And they had to go back to K.T. and they did one of those.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The inference was that...

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
If he was to work on committee business on Sunday and therefore he shouldn't be on C.T.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Yes, sir, I think so.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Or he shouldn't be on duty.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I'm not quite sure. That was the inference I got from him.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
Well, now, he was to be given a pass for Christmas or New Year's, but not both.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
That's my understanding.

21:46.000 --> 21:55.000
Well, when he got a pass on both occasions, did you attempt to fall off whether he was working on committee business on Christmas and New Year's?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
No, sir. I didn't know about those incidents.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
My recollection until subsequent to New Year.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
And I found out about it because it was Cohn Telephone.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
And told me that this was shine, it was under investigation.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
I telephone General Ryan to find out what it was about because Cohn was concerned about it.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I nearly wanted information like that.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
General Ryan told me in very short order that there had been an investigation started as this factor so confused.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
They had decided to stop the matter.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
So it was somehow as to where the fall went.

22:25.000 --> 22:34.000
Well, during all of these calls, you had a lot of them with General Ryan to range a pass with the do-this and the do-that.

22:34.000 --> 22:44.000
Why was it necessary to keep calling if this arrangement had been worked out for by the time General Ryan to work on committee business?

22:44.000 --> 22:54.000
Well, I didn't call General Ryan to arrange a pass other than on that date of November 18th as result of his call of need.

22:54.000 --> 23:01.000
I called him on about November 10th to advise him of the secretary of defense.

23:01.000 --> 23:12.000
And then my recollection is, as the next time I called General Ryan to be on December 28th for the purpose of inquiring as it was trying to future assignments with these.

23:12.000 --> 23:19.000
And then I called him on January 4th for the purpose of asking him about this investigation that Cohn was concerned about.

23:19.000 --> 23:29.000
But I didn't call the arrange passes. I didn't call to reinforce the process to inspire about 80 years, about trying to be denied.

23:29.000 --> 23:36.000
The fourth candidate for his practice questioning of the witness was returned to our studios to cost the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
This is ABC Television Network.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
Miami was national headquarters for the mob until the police drove out for these girls.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
And then he smashed the hot room.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
Clired back at the murder man and shot the big shots into the seat.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
See the Miami story now, the paramount sitter, time's waste.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
How did house mentality cause for light and freshness?

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
All the best about the cotton of hazeln, the drug industry, fresh without fillings.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
With reference to Sean.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
Senator Boyd's doctor that, if Mr Adam said the contact to other members of the committee is in McCartney.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
You conducted members of the staff prior to the introduction.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
There held many conferences with the Roy Cohn concerning the David China.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
Well, the fire was induction items. I don't think it's correct that I held many conferences with Mr. Cohn.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
The subject was discussed and concurrently without a matter.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
I don't recall if there was any meeting or conference initiated for that soul purpose.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
Well, you would have testified that you were greatly disturbed because of your failures, you mullified or it might say a thing.

24:41.000 --> 24:49.000
The Roy Cohn, because he was displayed anger over the lack of cooperation he received from the department at the arms of the group.

24:49.000 --> 25:03.000
Did you think throughout the interim, the courage that Mr. Cohn was representing the subcommittee in any contact he made with you?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Did you say this was the challenge?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Well, I was always expected.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
He represented the chairman.

25:09.000 --> 25:18.000
And the meetings which he heard during that period of the committee were almost invariably attended only by the chairman to my knowledge.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
And it was never out of my mind.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
At any time did you confer with other members of the subcommittee?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
That's very good.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
No, sir. Nothing my recollection at this moment.

25:28.000 --> 25:36.000
Well, if you encounter great difficulties in your efforts to maintain friendly relations with the committee staff, why didn't you confer with other members of the subcommittee?

25:36.000 --> 25:45.000
Or ask for a beneficial meeting so that you and the members of the subcommittee might submit some of these matters.
