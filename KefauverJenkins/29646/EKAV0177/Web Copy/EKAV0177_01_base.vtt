WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The committee will please come to order.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.120
The front of the direction is estimated to be as many as

00:08.120 --> 00:09.120
been detained.

00:09.120 --> 00:14.120
Basically this morning, we were just about 11 o'clock.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.320
Our other committee members being present,

00:16.320 --> 00:17.320
ready to proceed.

00:17.320 --> 00:20.360
The chair would like to begin as is

00:20.360 --> 00:22.800
accustomed by welcoming the guests to have come to

00:22.800 --> 00:25.840
the committee room and by advising them of the

00:25.840 --> 00:28.520
standing committee orders, but there

00:28.520 --> 00:30.520
would be no manifestations of approval or

00:30.520 --> 00:37.360
a disapproval audibly of any time by any of the people in the audience.

00:37.360 --> 00:40.160
And the officers in uniform and the trained

00:40.160 --> 00:44.000
clothesmen in the audience have been instructed by the

00:44.000 --> 00:46.920
committee without any further notice to politely

00:46.920 --> 00:51.200
escort from the room immediately any of our guests

00:51.200 --> 00:54.400
who might decide to violate the terms under which

00:54.400 --> 00:58.320
you were admitted here as guests for the committee.

00:58.320 --> 01:02.320
I again want to say that audiences have been remarkably fine.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.840
The officers have done a splendid job.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.000
We hope this favorable condition will continue

01:08.000 --> 01:11.200
throughout the year.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.880
Mr. Council, as the conclusion of the day yesterday,

01:14.880 --> 01:19.160
Mr. Pooett had said he is questioning.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.760
The chair would like to find out whether you have other

01:20.760 --> 01:22.640
questions you want to ask, but you're adding with the

01:22.640 --> 01:23.240
time.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.560
Chairman, we have no further questions at this time.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.600
There has been some of the under-tenment rule he

01:29.600 --> 01:33.080
chairs times ask questions for ten minutes.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.400
Is the time keeper in the division ready?

01:35.400 --> 01:37.200
You'll notify me when my time is expired.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.760
There will go around the wheel, then, under the ten minute rule

01:40.760 --> 01:44.240
until all questions have been asked.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.360
But you added viewers in the committee room, I believe,

01:47.360 --> 01:48.880
throughout the year he specifically

01:48.880 --> 01:50.360
started that right.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.440
So you are conversant with the line of

01:54.440 --> 01:57.040
questioning that I have to spectrically

01:57.040 --> 01:59.320
about Mr. Car what's the line.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.720
And I give you that simply as background for some

02:02.720 --> 02:05.440
questions I would like to add primarily for my own

02:05.440 --> 02:07.200
guidance, but I'm sure for the guidance of the

02:07.200 --> 02:08.680
whole committee.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.720
As you're whether it's specifically now, you

02:10.720 --> 02:16.200
have some charges to make against Mr. Car concerning

02:16.200 --> 02:19.840
the overall charge presented throughout

02:49.840 --> 02:52.760
the year, or if he did anything else.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.480
I was a representative of our committee, which the Army

02:55.480 --> 02:59.480
considered to be improper and inappropriate.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.480
But I would ask you first so that we can have it

03:02.480 --> 03:05.560
before we send to the American concept of fair play

03:05.560 --> 03:07.480
to make it clear.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.400
The charge is now available to make against Mr.

03:10.400 --> 03:16.520
Car as part of the overall charge.

03:16.520 --> 03:20.880
Well, gentlemen, I may the charge be clear.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.520
I'm not trying to do this clear with Mr. Car.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.080
But it can be clear that he's fairly

03:25.080 --> 03:26.720
familiar to me this time with Mr. Car,

03:26.720 --> 03:31.280
when he's here now, when we can particularize his evil

03:31.280 --> 03:33.520
doing sense, where were incidents

03:33.520 --> 03:35.120
that Mr. Car has been retiring, have already

03:35.120 --> 03:38.920
testified to the direct examination.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.360
So it's a characteristic.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.440
I was raised with the challenge of trial

03:42.440 --> 03:43.480
and such a coincidence that he's

03:43.480 --> 03:46.680
in January 20th, the reason for trial later is 20.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.680
For instance, Mr. Car has arrived January 20th.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.480
Now, you have five years of experience

03:51.480 --> 03:52.880
from the yesterday I will later explain

03:52.880 --> 03:55.160
the process of trial.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.960
During his trial, January 20th, when I had conversation,

03:58.960 --> 04:02.440
Mr. Car was there, and it's a challenge.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.320
One of the minor members of most particularly

04:04.320 --> 04:05.800
the person on the train ride, when

04:05.800 --> 04:07.800
they were doing some Newark, Newark's

04:07.800 --> 04:10.880
majority on the 25th of November,

04:10.880 --> 04:13.320
we had one talk about China.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.400
He was discussing a somewhere, which

04:15.400 --> 04:16.960
trouble the enemy before he began

04:16.960 --> 04:18.280
with reference to China.

04:18.280 --> 04:23.320
And he was thinking that the army would

04:23.320 --> 04:25.560
be continuing trouble, unless something

04:25.560 --> 04:27.400
was done with reference to China, which

04:27.400 --> 04:30.600
was that sign is combed.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.040
Mr. Car was more or less the passive participant

04:34.040 --> 04:36.000
in the luncheon house, which then

04:36.000 --> 04:38.160
was said to be found in the train ride

04:38.160 --> 04:40.560
where he hung a beer ride up town.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.680
Every time it was considered a few,

04:42.680 --> 04:46.160
he would not be participants in the interview.

04:46.160 --> 04:50.360
He himself said anything that I remember.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.520
I'm going to be answering whether or not

04:52.520 --> 04:55.280
a couple times here to be out of the hotel

04:55.280 --> 04:57.280
or the rest of you who do something.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.040
Again, I said he was not sick.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.400
I don't know if he's not a medic.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.720
He was a half of a train ride.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.880
On the train, no driver was doing something.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.680
He improper or worse people for a hundred

05:06.680 --> 05:07.840
of his driving and his interviewer

05:07.840 --> 05:09.560
is running out of steam to me by hand.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.240
He's so free.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.320
He's seen to me by hand.

05:11.320 --> 05:14.000
But he doesn't seem to be not only on that stage.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.480
And it seems to me on January 9th when he called me

05:16.480 --> 05:18.040
in the amateur class too.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.640
And it seems to me when he called me,

05:19.640 --> 05:22.400
that my home in football was not the hotel.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
He talked about China.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.200
I had the feeling that he was an agent.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
He was an agent of the principal, and that he

05:28.200 --> 05:29.200
showed up alive.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.920
But I didn't know that he was in directives

05:30.920 --> 05:33.800
and today, he's in fire, and I had a strong feeling

05:33.800 --> 05:39.160
that he was in the middle and had to take these actions.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.320
And to be told, he was trying to be a full knee,

05:41.320 --> 05:43.560
he's wanting off the difficulty of fixing up

05:43.560 --> 05:46.600
for because he saw an obligation to the man

05:46.600 --> 05:49.160
who seemed to me as he is serious.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.760
Although he may not have hit, it seems to me so he was.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.640
And that was the situation with the system.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.200
I think it was about January 20th.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.000
All right.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.640
I was just there as an understanding of the up until January 20th.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.720
There are no allegations from the father of the army

06:01.720 --> 06:03.040
that I didn't say that.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.040
I'm trying to understand.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
I'm trying to find a way.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.880
There's a lot of work before January 20th,

06:06.880 --> 06:08.960
where he gave the Jim Crow her a means to be.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.840
For him to be the pilot of the principal,

06:10.840 --> 06:13.840
he gave the pilot of the principal in the luncheon.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.480
I was taking November in the secretary's office.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.840
I recall all the fight was.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.960
That was the luncheon, which it was asked for.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.000
That time, the native heirloom, was weak, low.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.040
Yeah, he had a little bit of weather as if I just

06:27.040 --> 06:28.660
had a few hours as if I just had a bunch of lunch

06:28.660 --> 06:29.920
in the luncheon.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.080
On November 6th, at which time, you recall

06:32.080 --> 06:33.720
you had been fed nothing.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.920
Rather than that, as his capacity,

06:35.920 --> 06:38.640
you were more able than in his capacity

06:38.640 --> 06:41.400
as a passenger in the automobile.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.880
I think that he is.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.120
I think that we were different.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.200
In this respect, I think that he would be

06:48.200 --> 06:49.760
strictly uncomfortable in the automobile

06:49.760 --> 06:50.920
at that time.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.280
Just as I would be physically uncomfortable in the automobile,

06:53.280 --> 06:54.880
I think.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.200
I'm going to get my name, sir.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.960
I will like to know that I would like to know

06:58.960 --> 07:00.800
if you will finish me without interruptions.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.640
I'm trying to develop for you after you

07:02.640 --> 07:04.360
if you're trying to have me established.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.680
Because I want to specifically discharge.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.160
I am trying to very well so that we can put our seats

07:09.160 --> 07:10.480
into something specific.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.080
The idea is that I would like to find more January 20th

07:13.080 --> 07:14.320
so that you really want to come.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.640
But I will ask you if you would like to send in the luncheon.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.080
On November 6th, I remember no words.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.160
He did not think of the degrees.

07:21.160 --> 07:25.200
Let's see what the request was made.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.480
I do not isolate the instance, but I know

07:27.480 --> 07:29.880
that he wore that fort-take sometimes.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.720
Now, before we go, I'll get three points by one

07:31.720 --> 07:32.880
through the same time.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.560
We have taken any charge out of our yellow bluest.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.320
You can let it be.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.160
That's great.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.080
Now, as I must have heard, I was at the luncheon.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.920
Whether he was comfortable or uncomfortable,

07:40.920 --> 07:42.480
so long as he said nothing, how you tried

07:42.480 --> 07:44.840
to use the talking proper access to the messer.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.240
So we said the luncheon.

07:46.240 --> 07:46.760
That's right.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.720
He was in a home park.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.480
He was at home with a school park participant

07:50.480 --> 07:53.240
with Santa Demacati in the luncheon of December 10th.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.320
The crime and soul surface of which was

07:56.320 --> 07:57.760
the expression of York sign.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.120
Sean.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.840
I would encourage you another patient with the income.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.320
I say 30, but the co-parts of the town.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.120
I understand.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.080
So I want to know what he did while he was calling.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.080
As a participant.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.560
This, who loved them?

08:14.560 --> 08:15.720
I asked for excellent.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.400
You've been pretty specific about Colin.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.520
You've been relatively specific about the charges.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.360
And now let's just think about the cars.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.640
I tried to put it in a car before it was suspended.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.520
You know, again, I was not aware of it.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.440
Right, so I'm trying.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.400
What is trying to point out the difference between my

08:29.400 --> 08:32.120
total opinion of the charges that they had.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.080
They kind of had a good trial and substance

08:35.080 --> 08:36.520
when they got in grade 20.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.440
This is December 10th.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.440
That's probably January 20th.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.440
What is the rest?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.920
What did he do on January 10th?

08:40.920 --> 08:43.240
If you want to try to give it anybody, he needs to.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.440
Because December 10th.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.200
What did he do on December 10th?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.280
What he wanted to do was he impractical.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.160
He was at co-parts at the time in the luncheon.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.600
The senator was the one who was making this

08:52.600 --> 08:53.760
request with reference.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.360
New York sign.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.200
That's what the car is.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.520
What's in the car?

08:56.520 --> 08:57.360
What's in the car?

08:57.360 --> 08:59.200
What's in the car?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.200
You get 91.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.720
So, he had himself with the senators.

09:01.720 --> 09:02.000
All right.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.240
You tried him with nuts.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.520
You got an office with the president.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.600
And himself with the luncheon on November 6th.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.280
You tried out December 10th with us.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.440
I'm taking a postman of him.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.440
A postman with him with him.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.480
The president of December 10th.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.080
What did he do?

09:12.080 --> 09:12.840
I had some with him.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.960
Other than the fact that he did not say to his chairman.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.120
Don't say that.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.120
I would say that this is what he was present.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.200
He did not say to his office.

09:20.200 --> 09:20.720
All right.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.400
Out of the editors, what is his question?

09:22.400 --> 09:23.080
He was present.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.240
You tried him with him properly.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.000
You do need to intimidate the army.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.160
I think that he was present in the luncheon.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.080
And said nothing.

09:30.080 --> 09:30.840
He got a charge.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.320
I think there's a line that he was sorry about.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.160
Luncheon is concerned.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.720
There is no complaint on the part of the army.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.400
I think the fact that he was present,

09:36.400 --> 09:38.840
the fact that the position of the chairman

09:38.840 --> 09:40.240
was being in a state of truth.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.960
And that he was sitting there while the thing was

09:41.960 --> 09:46.040
finally listening to his news, making him a profile.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.760
Are you charging and then I want to find out.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.560
So when we get him here, we don't have to waste any time

09:49.560 --> 09:50.560
about the animal we provide.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.960
We don't have to waste any time about the luncheon

09:51.960 --> 09:53.160
in November 6th.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.880
Do we have to talk to him about December 10th

09:54.880 --> 09:56.120
and say why are you filing?

09:56.120 --> 09:57.840
Why won't you have to say it's done in my part?

09:57.840 --> 10:00.680
I think you can't say that in my part.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.440
I've seen that I've asking a tremendous amount.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.040
On behalf of an employee of the senator,

10:04.040 --> 10:05.520
but if you think that's Jim Roberts,

10:05.520 --> 10:07.380
we certainly will interrogate him as the right

10:07.380 --> 10:09.400
you gave him such a scheme for Christ.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.960
On the luncheon, it was a intimidation of the army.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.480
On the luncheon, it was November 10th.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.440
One of the McCoy's major representations.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.560
I spoke to our very often folks at the point of that.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.480
And he never said the 40th is himself

10:20.480 --> 10:21.680
what's the sentence in position.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.440
Now, I understand.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.720
And he's considered because he did not

10:23.720 --> 10:25.600
have to engage in his improv from him

10:25.600 --> 10:26.600
to his own business.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.280
I do think so.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.080
All right.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.680
December 10th, at that time, right up.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.920
Who called me and who called me after courted?

10:32.920 --> 10:35.320
I'm from who called me after courted.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.880
Ask me about shine.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.320
He called me an Amherst, and I said,

10:39.320 --> 10:40.160
okay, ask me about it.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.240
How did you call me after courted?

10:42.240 --> 10:43.480
I'm not a case in the field.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.520
He was calling you as Frank Carr,

10:46.520 --> 10:48.920
and saying the boy Frank Carr is a figure,

10:48.920 --> 10:50.840
or calling him an intimidation,

10:50.840 --> 10:53.000
but Roy Collins was under the front.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.560
I had no way of knowing.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.800
I was surprised to receive the call from Carr.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.960
My time was surprised.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.320
So it had to be.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.560
An intimidation was not returned.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
And I find an intimidation.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.600
If there aren't any house first, the number top.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.200
There can be.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
Frank, let's begin.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.160
That's that, and I want to get it in front

11:17.160 --> 11:20.880
of this controversy.

11:20.880 --> 11:25.080
I've listened to you last the moment.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.960
Your response to the false examination.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.440
Right, keen, and it's.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.400
Now I want you to take positive care of those.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.880
Now, ask.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.000
Whether you understand the true of these

11:40.000 --> 11:43.480
Pentatemon Crytry and the sitcoms

11:43.480 --> 11:48.640
or the actress, or causing the Pentatemon Crytry

11:48.640 --> 11:50.880
and the sitcom to call off the hearings,

11:50.880 --> 11:52.040
that's what my.

11:52.040 --> 11:52.560
I did not.

11:55.560 --> 11:59.720
Why did you spend so much time and so much energy

11:59.720 --> 12:03.480
you and the second day of the arms?

12:03.480 --> 12:06.960
Rang the respond to land, give some consolation.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.560
Or make concessions.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.760
The Senator McCarthy and the sitcom

12:14.760 --> 12:17.200
and respect the Mr. Shine, if you were not

12:17.200 --> 12:21.840
trying to avoid these, or then get to the call off those years.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.160
The representations with reference to Mr. Shine,

12:24.160 --> 12:27.840
whether he was needed to get committed to this.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.360
Mr. Casey made the confession and stated

12:30.360 --> 12:32.440
on the set of days after time that he did.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.560
And I'm from the point of view, that he did not want

12:35.560 --> 12:39.440
it to be possible for anyone who obeys him.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.920
That he by his action had interfered with the committee

12:42.920 --> 12:45.760
or he impeded the progress of their investigative work.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.400
He even though all of the other private in the army

12:48.400 --> 12:50.720
and your experience in government or sent you

12:50.720 --> 12:52.560
have been with the department of defense

12:52.560 --> 12:54.640
of the second day of the arms, that

12:54.640 --> 12:59.600
has received as much attention from higher sources.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.200
As has this private Mr. Shine.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.360
I do not say.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.440
Why did you give him so much attention?

13:05.440 --> 13:08.920
Why did you waste so much time on it?

13:08.920 --> 13:11.400
Because it may be, because it's a check.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.960
The committee requests.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.560
It may be requested and am I saying?

13:14.560 --> 13:17.840
The committee requests it or Mr. Coen requests.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.280
Mr. Coen requests it and we relatively

13:21.280 --> 13:23.740
used that the requests have been over 100,000

13:23.740 --> 13:25.480
practice once the request for making

13:25.480 --> 13:28.840
the questions is signed in the faculty of November 6th.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.040
So you took it out of the committee request?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
I did.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.000
Did you think it was a proper request?

13:34.000 --> 13:34.880
No, sir.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.840
Why?

13:35.840 --> 13:41.520
I felt that the position just then dropped by the meeting

13:41.520 --> 13:42.560
when he was got it.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.440
I felt that he should have been less alone

13:44.440 --> 13:48.880
than the exposure I often treated with tone and car.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.080
The less I thought you were alone.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.400
The less you were alone, the less you were alone.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.360
I was not given that there was no justification

13:53.360 --> 13:55.440
for the committee requesting the services

13:55.440 --> 13:56.640
at the end of the arms.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.800
I had no way of knowing, sir, just

13:58.800 --> 14:01.120
exactly what the committee is needing for him.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.640
I have a given total amount.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.640
Up for now, what is need, where, why

14:04.640 --> 14:07.360
is it so necessary to continue serving the committee?

14:07.360 --> 14:09.480
The other thing I have been told is the things

14:09.480 --> 14:12.520
Mr. Coen stated, which were, back to the effect

14:13.280 --> 14:14.440
that it must have been investigated,

14:14.440 --> 14:16.000
it must have been investigated, which had been begun

14:16.000 --> 14:17.680
by Mr. Shine and was shining,

14:17.680 --> 14:20.520
and he knew a lot of many facts in his case.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.720
And that it was going to be necessary from time to time

14:22.720 --> 14:25.520
to take witnesses from other places

14:25.520 --> 14:28.320
to trend and more of what takes to be interrogated by Shine.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.480
Was it in the issue that we're given to you?

14:30.480 --> 14:33.960
How long have we taken to do with these two words?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.600
Well, Mr. Coen had indicated that there was

14:36.600 --> 14:39.720
a continuing need, Mr. Steven's, and tried to.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.720
Why do we, Mr. Steven, need our own?

14:41.720 --> 14:43.880
We need to leave tomorrow.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.000
Well, part of the, when he had been first drafted,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.040
the indications were indefinite,

14:49.040 --> 14:52.280
but for a long period of time, Mr. Steven did that time

14:52.280 --> 14:54.680
in suggesting the 15 days of memory,

14:54.680 --> 14:57.960
that he got attempted by that to show off at that time.

14:57.960 --> 15:02.280
But our own true witness has made us the work we intend,

15:02.280 --> 15:04.680
and Mr. Coen had indicated to me that there was

15:04.680 --> 15:07.000
no need for business, or which the soldier would be required

15:07.000 --> 15:08.320
when he was a chance for this.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.720
I would start here with undertaking to a piece

15:11.720 --> 15:14.760
in order to get these hearings for all.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.520
If you were undertaking to a piece,

15:16.520 --> 15:18.680
I want to know why you didn't give Mr. Shine

15:18.680 --> 15:21.480
a direct commission when his request.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.000
I wasn't, I wasn't served in the Army

15:24.000 --> 15:28.360
as a crime director, making it a matter of administration.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.480
I have nothing to do with the presentation on the director

15:30.480 --> 15:31.000
mission.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.240
Is my understanding that, uh, all right, let's get that.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.160
You have none of those.

15:35.160 --> 15:35.840
No, sir.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.680
All right, why didn't you agree then,

15:37.680 --> 15:43.080
to a piece by sending him up the West Point to detect both?

15:43.080 --> 15:43.680
Well, sir.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.840
Why didn't you agree to that?

15:45.840 --> 15:49.280
Well, I guess it better be than he is to say.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.800
We have to.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.480
So we have 25,000 men killed in Korea.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.720
We didn't have the money we had.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.480
But we have some tells in the other side.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.280
You make it work.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.880
I'm making use of money and money.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.160
We're going to get us on our budget.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.480
I'm going to take the money.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.440
Take the money and go.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.360
So why do you inject money into it?

16:05.360 --> 16:06.760
There's no money, also, wasn't?

16:06.760 --> 16:07.280
No, sir.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.320
I have to wait.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.320
I'm going to do this.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.760
You'll very well be on the map.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.760
Well, why didn't you?

16:12.760 --> 16:14.560
The science is moving your near here.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.160
And a piece.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.200
We've been getting all over the world.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.440
I think that it is a disaster.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.320
Better I'd like to take it.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.080
I want to change.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.000
And I remember coming back from New York.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.400
After this specific event of the discussion,

16:25.400 --> 16:27.480
I think it was when I was writing on the chat

16:27.480 --> 16:30.520
after having come back from New York with Frank Cox.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.000
And I thought to myself that I just

16:32.000 --> 16:34.040
must be out of my hands.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.400
Because this trouble is dispatching.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.040
And all this stuff can be solved for simply if we

16:39.040 --> 16:42.080
were just going ahead and find a way to find a way to do that.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.320
I have that feeling of them.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.960
I have that feeling now.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.160
They're going to get more than this.
