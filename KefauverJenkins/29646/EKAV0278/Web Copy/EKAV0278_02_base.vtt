00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
As one of the most disgraceful episodes in the history of our government, something that

00:08.240 --> 00:15.600
says this is a series of events that about the previous events is regaligant, there's

00:15.600 --> 00:17.600
a very sudden mistake.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.600
There are the plural and unpardonable.

00:19.600 --> 00:27.440
There is no value that you suggest for occasion, for this situation having occurred.

00:27.440 --> 00:36.840
And it has now become our solemn duty, the duty of this committee to undertake the

00:36.840 --> 00:40.040
retirement and fix the responsibility.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.040
I think that is the part of our responsibility.

00:43.040 --> 00:50.240
We have tremendous amount of testimony here and much of the relevant, some other confidence,

00:50.240 --> 00:53.240
some other good director for the issues involved.

00:54.240 --> 00:59.560
And finally, through retirement, our come to its inclusion and the decision, I shall

00:59.560 --> 01:01.560
only take to be a judicial woman.

01:01.560 --> 01:08.560
As my capacity was for this, we as African-American, this part that we're trying to consider to be

01:08.560 --> 01:09.560
a relevant.

01:09.560 --> 01:15.560
My own confusion may I say, something is going to say about the operation of the democat.

01:15.560 --> 01:23.040
Mr. Chairman, you can always have this cooperation of this democat in your life.

01:23.040 --> 01:30.040
And anything that is right, and certainly you can have it, or hardly with the great

01:30.040 --> 01:35.400
state in the limit of my energy as a capacity, the atmosphere of purpose and the primary

01:35.400 --> 01:41.040
purpose of any action is to further out commoners, or to expose commoners to your own

01:41.040 --> 01:42.040
future.

01:42.040 --> 01:50.040
I say that, but I don't think that everything is huge enough being willing to face the

01:50.040 --> 01:51.040
test.

01:51.040 --> 01:58.040
Mr. Chairman, please do ask for cooperation, but the best way to get it is to reciprocate.

01:58.040 --> 02:03.520
I was told, and I think this democat is not the taken action, the democat with the

02:03.520 --> 02:04.520
members of our fund.

02:04.520 --> 02:05.520
I did it on principle, Mr. Chairman.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.520
I think you want the silence to go also, the democat members of this committee.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.520
I will also do silence.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.520
We'll let the committee.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.520
These things affect you in our absence.

02:12.520 --> 02:19.520
I left the public gift of this closing hour, whether an end democat was responsible in

02:19.520 --> 02:25.520
it, as has been animated here, or what happened that it associated with all about these

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
proceedings.

02:26.520 --> 02:31.520
I first got the American people, will not judge these proceedings, but they will not judge

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
the public.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.520
I think that the public is not the only person who has been able to do this.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.520
I think this is the case.

02:37.520 --> 02:46.520
I first got the American people, will not judge these proceedings, as the best or as

02:46.520 --> 02:51.520
the regular proceedings of the United States.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.520
I did not face the burden, because I was a bit against the trustee, because what I was

02:56.520 --> 03:01.520
on purpose in the showroom, I think we should have filmed up to the air, and it was a little

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
better.

03:02.520 --> 03:08.520
I think my share of it was part of the political style, to punish for that.

03:08.520 --> 03:13.520
But I hate to come to the thanks, to people of the nation, to think that such is a fast

03:13.520 --> 03:20.520
sample of the proceedings and the matter of conducting proceedings in the highest world-making

03:20.520 --> 03:21.520
bodies in the year.

03:21.520 --> 03:27.520
That's the tabernight, and I can only say to you that the other reasons we have to perform

03:27.520 --> 03:34.520
are, that the air is conscientious, and it's sincere, it's fair and impartial, as I possibly

03:34.520 --> 03:41.520
can, for I have had a justification and a proper action to be taken by all of them.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.520
Thank you.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.520
And, in the next one, I'd like to have a recommendation.

03:45.520 --> 03:52.520
Mr. Chairman, this is a little like June week on the college campus, and we'll have our

03:52.520 --> 03:54.520
evaluation say goodbye.

03:54.520 --> 04:00.520
To the lives and to all the amazing things that were upon this legislative adventure.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.520
First of all, do you, Mr. Chairman, I say you've done a magnificent job under most

04:05.520 --> 04:08.520
trying circumstances and a lot of confidence.

04:08.520 --> 04:13.520
To our very distinguished council, for when we come up to Tennessee, I'd as though it's

04:13.520 --> 04:17.520
a little bit more constructive, objective, and great job that you've done.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.520
I think you rendered the only service to this committee.

04:20.520 --> 04:26.520
And to my friend from Boston, who's the impinged chair, Charles, and with all

04:26.520 --> 04:28.520
of his designs, we somehow have it.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.520
May I say this to all of you, we have flowers along, first.

04:32.520 --> 04:36.520
I would have been to rather interesting things about all of this.

04:36.520 --> 04:42.520
But, it's a little like a page of all Henry, I would say, that simple charge,

04:42.520 --> 04:48.520
or the kind of charge you should assemble a medley of witnesses here for many, many weeks

04:48.520 --> 04:54.520
ranging from the Secretary Army to one of the humble fighters in that great institution.

04:54.520 --> 05:00.520
Here's has a vote to a great outpouring of me.

05:00.520 --> 05:07.520
I've been excoriated, I've been praised, I've been blamed, I've been vilified.

05:07.520 --> 05:12.520
And to all those who will not be seen in any way, there must be some 50,000 unanswered letters

05:12.520 --> 05:14.520
in my office now.

05:14.520 --> 05:20.520
I can only say that I get the testimony I think of the light teller there, the great and

05:20.520 --> 05:22.520
big company under those circumstances.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.520
It's a great privilege, I think, to welcome to millions of American homes with a year of

05:26.520 --> 05:31.520
this time, and if I can fire an additional responsibility I can fund the Congress and

05:31.520 --> 05:33.520
on other committee's assistance.

05:33.520 --> 05:38.520
I have only one serious note about it, this is no time to comment on what has happened,

05:38.520 --> 05:42.520
or the findings of the judgment that is still the event, but I think most impressive to

05:42.520 --> 05:47.520
me about it all is the unending stream of people who have on of those five or

05:47.520 --> 05:50.520
three days today and week after week.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.520
Now I suppose the psychologists and the experts who have learned it in the field of

05:54.520 --> 05:59.520
mass behavior have got all the answers, but I come up with an answer of my home as I

05:59.520 --> 06:04.520
watch the attention of people here there yesterday and have a phrase, so a great

06:04.520 --> 06:07.520
volume of mail that has come to my attention.

06:07.520 --> 06:14.520
It just seems to me that probably the greatest in telling him both in life is that of self-preservation.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.520
Normally we extend it only through that part of the nature of self-preservation about

06:18.520 --> 06:23.520
life and carries us to any length of she who claims and pacts.

06:23.520 --> 06:28.520
But I do believe that that family seems of self-preservation extends to the best

06:28.520 --> 06:29.520
preservation of the country.

06:29.520 --> 06:34.520
It's rather unconscious as a matter of fact, from five people, but it gives the reason

06:34.520 --> 06:38.520
why there is such a tremendous interest in the true self against communism,

06:38.520 --> 06:43.520
this loyalty and all the variance of those in the physical process.

06:43.520 --> 06:47.520
I presume that this was to say that the first thing to tell a person is to

06:47.520 --> 06:51.520
have a vested self only to cover intellect into a better civil servant, give it a

06:51.520 --> 06:53.520
tougher than say a long word.

06:53.520 --> 06:58.520
But if a person is self-preservation of a very decent state in the people, then all of

06:58.520 --> 07:03.520
it all comes with this one conclusion that will say it again, the sinister

07:03.520 --> 07:08.520
forces which we've been intending for a long time must go on with redo

07:08.520 --> 07:12.520
of the interest of the perpetuity of a free comfort.

07:12.520 --> 07:16.520
And may I say to the daily worker and to which we thought her who's been in

07:16.520 --> 07:19.520
attendance, I fancy every day since this began.

07:19.520 --> 07:23.520
There may have been a moment of comfort and there may have been some

07:23.520 --> 07:28.520
trench of greed as they may have had lines about the hearings, but that comfort

07:28.520 --> 07:33.520
and greed will be short-lived indeed as it will stay again, coming with a

07:33.520 --> 07:37.520
mental version of this love and go with poem with greater figures available.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
That's all I've been saying.

07:38.520 --> 07:45.520
I think one of my poems is going to make me express the thousandest

07:45.520 --> 07:47.520
number, let's just have them.

07:47.520 --> 07:53.520
I intend to express the chair, I think he's told me words, to call an executive

07:53.520 --> 07:54.520
session and his journey has been seen.

07:54.520 --> 08:05.520
I want to do second that request, Mr. Chairman, because a number of important

08:05.520 --> 08:11.520
questions that are yet on resolve by the hearings and I think that the executive

08:11.520 --> 08:17.520
session is a positive place to understand that will be held short.

08:17.520 --> 08:26.520
Mr. Chairman, I want to be very free and I will be really want to say this,

08:26.520 --> 08:33.520
that we cannot help these dismay at hearing the revelation of

08:33.520 --> 08:37.520
smallest impetuous of the circumstances which have been described here during

08:37.520 --> 08:43.520
the past many days, 35, 36, whatever days, so we've been here.

08:43.520 --> 08:49.520
But we cannot minimize the grave and serious importance of the charges and

08:49.520 --> 08:53.520
countercharges which gave birth to these hearings.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.520
Certainly our responsibility does not end here.

08:57.520 --> 09:02.520
Certainly the American people have the right to expect that we take whatever

09:02.520 --> 09:07.520
action is necessary to correct the abuses which have been shown here.

09:07.520 --> 09:12.520
I certainly shall do all in my power for this end.

09:13.520 --> 09:18.520
And I think we have the grave responsibility to demonstrate that as a

09:18.520 --> 09:26.520
resolve of these hearings we can improve on that which has been law.

09:26.520 --> 09:32.520
And if we do nothing more than that, we will have made a

09:32.520 --> 09:35.520
contribution to better trouble.

09:35.520 --> 09:42.520
Mr. Potter, here was that here, Mr. Chairman, as the curfew goes down on the

09:42.520 --> 09:46.520
final act, 36 days of carefulness.

09:46.520 --> 09:52.520
I think there are two things that it will for the American people to recognize.

09:52.520 --> 09:56.520
Of course, this is not a typical congressional hearing.

09:56.520 --> 10:02.520
Even the structure of the format of the hearing is not typical.

10:02.520 --> 10:08.520
We've had outside attorneys got in to act as Trump,

10:08.520 --> 10:14.520
called the principal, one of the principal's owners, called the committee.

10:14.520 --> 10:20.520
The procedures are rules that they stop for this particular hearing.

10:20.520 --> 10:27.520
One, I doubt that they've ever been used and any other types of congressional hearing.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.520
So when will this withdrawing on your fellow?

10:31.520 --> 10:32.520
No, no, two.

10:32.520 --> 10:37.520
That all hearings of the Congress are conducted with my command.

10:37.520 --> 10:43.520
I haven't, along with the third, do not the hearing is defined that first

10:43.520 --> 10:45.520
normal might have been done.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.520
There is a result.

10:48.520 --> 10:53.520
It doesn't live up to the dignity of the Senate.

10:53.520 --> 10:57.520
I wish we would draw the American people with a vote.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.520
But that is not normal.

10:59.520 --> 11:03.520
I think it will all pull the point out that despite all the testimony,

11:03.520 --> 11:07.520
and I think it was necessary testimony by hearing of this call.

11:07.520 --> 11:12.520
Many people may believe that the government is overwhelmed by the thorough people.

11:12.520 --> 11:16.520
I say that's not so.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.520
I believe that our government has few good-quality.

11:21.520 --> 11:29.520
And I can assure you that the administration down town and the committees of the Congress are all working.

11:29.520 --> 11:35.520
With the singleness of the purpose to rule out any person that is just law.

11:35.520 --> 11:41.520
I agree that there's no one committee, there's no one in the village.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.520
So I'm carrying this by the law.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.520
That's a president.

11:46.520 --> 11:52.520
And the members of the executive branch are equally concerned about this problem.

11:52.520 --> 11:57.520
There is a meeting ground for both the legislative branch of our government

11:57.520 --> 11:59.520
and executive branch to look together.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.520
If that is something we can improve upon.

12:02.520 --> 12:06.520
I sincerely hope that as a result of these hearings,

12:06.520 --> 12:12.520
there will be a greater degree of population between the executive branch

12:12.520 --> 12:15.520
and the legislative branch of our government.

12:15.520 --> 12:24.520
And working on this serious problem of endeavoring to further up.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.520
I say that this is not a technical hearing.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.520
And we get back to our regular functions of our committee.

12:31.520 --> 12:36.520
I'm sure that we will can work together and have a personal understanding

12:36.520 --> 12:42.520
of the ways that have developed and possible periods of these issues.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.520
And the way we have been working on these issues.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.520
Mr. Chaillan, the issue presented to this committee

12:48.520 --> 12:54.520
and this controversy have produced directly conflicting evidence.

12:54.520 --> 13:01.520
The record will have to be studied closely before final determination can be reached.

13:01.520 --> 13:06.520
And I pledge that I will do my best to that end.

13:06.520 --> 13:12.520
I regret this subcommittee has decided by a four to three votes to limit the witnesses who are called.

13:12.520 --> 13:16.520
I believe the other witnesses who have important testimony varying on this type of verse E.

13:16.520 --> 13:20.520
should have been heard by this subcommittee.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.520
Because that letter was read at the end of the hearings,

13:23.520 --> 13:29.520
I won't express my appreciation to Mr. Welch in having the letter read.

13:29.520 --> 13:35.520
I have not been in touch with Mr. Stevens since the 8th of March directly or indirectly,

13:35.520 --> 13:43.520
as one slight error in it, but it gives the facts without exception as I know them.

13:43.520 --> 13:48.520
In my opinion, however, these hearings have brought up a subject

13:48.520 --> 13:55.520
which the American people will have to give very serious considerations to.

13:56.520 --> 14:01.520
And that is a contentious by a member of the legislative branch

14:01.520 --> 14:06.520
that he has the right to solicit and that he will continue to solicit.

14:06.520 --> 14:15.520
Employees and the executive branch of the government to secretly bring to him and his family's confidential documents.

14:15.520 --> 14:20.520
I believe with this committee and the state of the United States

14:20.520 --> 14:25.520
must consider this contentious, most careful,

14:25.520 --> 14:31.520
because it goes to the very heart of the fundamental theories of the separation of powers

14:31.520 --> 14:35.520
in the government of the United States.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.520
And although I entirely agree with my distinguished colleague, Senator McClellan,

14:39.520 --> 14:43.520
that these have been most distressing days,

14:43.520 --> 14:47.520
nevertheless a decision on that important matter

14:47.520 --> 14:52.520
if it comes soon may have justified these hearings.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.520
I want to thank all the people,

14:55.520 --> 15:03.520
of the staff who have been so courteous and gracious to me and my colleagues

15:03.520 --> 15:08.520
while these hearings have been going on.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.520
Thank you.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.520
And, as always, I'm sorry for each Mr. Chairman.

15:13.520 --> 15:18.520
I merely want to emphasize that the committee has had some pleasant tax.

15:18.520 --> 15:24.520
I think now we should have no unnecessary delays in reaching our final conclusions and a decision.

15:24.520 --> 15:32.520
But more important than that, I want to appeal to the American people to be tolerant and understanding.

15:32.520 --> 15:37.520
And while it is easy to be critical of the executive branch, the president and the Congress,

15:37.520 --> 15:41.520
who are the failure to do things that possibly should be done,

15:41.520 --> 15:49.520
I think that a helpful attitude and the support of the American people of their government,

15:49.520 --> 15:56.520
the executive legislative branches, will accomplish a great deal in reaching the goals of national defense

15:56.520 --> 16:00.520
as we live in these highly critical days.

16:00.520 --> 16:05.520
Mr. Wells, the chair would like to extend the year the courtesy of saying anything you might like to say

16:05.520 --> 16:06.520
as time as the final work.

16:06.520 --> 16:10.520
Well, that is the courtesy indeed since I raised so little consideration.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.520
I would like to say one or two things.

16:13.520 --> 16:18.520
First, I'd like to say a word about the man who sits on my immediate right, James Sainte-Claire.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.520
He doesn't know I'm going to say this.

16:20.520 --> 16:25.520
I simply couldn't have touched the job that has been done here without his assistance.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.520
And my death to him is very large indeed.

16:28.520 --> 16:35.520
Once I had his youth, but I did not, I think, have his equipment or his high promise.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.520
I must thank my staff at the Pentagon.

16:38.520 --> 16:42.520
There are some of them, I think, probably are still there listening.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.520
I can't pass Colonel Murray on my left.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.520
I was in a social tool.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.520
To the press and the radio and the television I can only say,

16:51.520 --> 16:56.520
you were kind to me, a stranger.

16:56.520 --> 17:02.520
I came into the case proud of my retainer and I leave proud of my retainer.

17:02.520 --> 17:09.520
I came into the high confidence in the army and in a secondary and in its department council.

17:09.520 --> 17:16.520
Far from diminishing, that confidence has been doubled in trebles as I have stuck here.

17:16.520 --> 17:20.520
One of his chairman, Vera Purschnell knows,

17:20.520 --> 17:26.520
I alone came into this room from deep obscurity.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.520
I alone will retire to obscurity.

17:30.520 --> 17:35.520
As it falls about these off-leaders, I hope it does quickly.

17:35.520 --> 17:41.520
The lady who listens and is called you, this Lyndon Welsh, will hear from me.

17:41.520 --> 17:45.520
A long sigh of relief.

17:45.520 --> 17:50.520
I am sorry that this play had to take place.

17:50.520 --> 17:55.520
There were threats from white things in the ominous, strong noises.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.520
And in the China and around the world.

17:58.520 --> 18:04.520
If that is the thing that my life has been lived so much, the even wars are turmoil.

18:04.520 --> 18:11.520
Then I can say as I have already indicated that I could deal with a little serenity.

18:11.520 --> 18:22.520
And I allow myself to hold the soon-to-beil comedy when there will in this lovely land of ours be more simple laughter.

18:28.520 --> 18:33.520
And Sherrod only like to add Mr. Wilson, if you think you are returning to obscurity in Boston,

18:33.520 --> 18:38.520
you have overlooked an anthropogenic American institution known as the lecture bureau.

18:38.520 --> 18:42.520
I am sure of speaking your service.

18:42.520 --> 18:50.520
As we began these hearings, listening to the voice of the man from Tennessee opening them,

18:50.520 --> 18:57.520
we shall conclude them with that same voice now with the exception that after that chair has recognized our committee council,

18:57.520 --> 19:02.520
Ray Jenkins who has done such a terrific job in an unparalleled capacity,

19:02.520 --> 19:05.520
is worrying two-hats in the same shot.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.520
The chair would like to state that after Mr. Jackson's session,

19:08.520 --> 19:12.520
he has reenownment of some importance to make and then he will adjourn.

19:12.520 --> 19:17.520
Ray Jenkins is the pleasure to recognize you as the rest of us and we go.

19:17.520 --> 19:25.520
Mr. Chairman, that is my last official act, a special council for the subcommittee.

19:25.520 --> 19:38.520
I desire that at this time and I am sure that I now have the unanimous consent of the chairman and all members of this subcommittee to complete me and forever diverse myself.

19:38.520 --> 19:44.520
Of this consummation communication business we have real so long.

19:44.520 --> 19:54.520
And which I confess Mr. Chairman has given me a sense of guilt, very immersed, perhaps the atomic information that it contains.

19:54.520 --> 20:03.520
The chair will now accept this document from you with the understanding you will take it to the executive committee meeting tomorrow morning and the chairman for it goes from there.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.520
I will assume it's not the time for the next 24 hours.

20:06.520 --> 20:16.520
Namaste, chairman, I would like to have this opportunity to say a few words before eating this microphone.

20:16.520 --> 20:31.520
Together with those with whom I have worked so long, I have looked forward with much anticipation to the arrival of this magic and heavy moment, the ending of these hearings.

20:32.520 --> 20:53.520
And now that it has arrived, I must not say to say that the happiness of the moment is somewhat things by feeling as sadness because it is not only the moment of the ending of this controversy in these hearings.

20:54.520 --> 21:03.520
It is the moment of the past and the farewells and the party in this place and going our respective ways.

21:03.520 --> 21:21.520
It would be excellent to watch Mr. Chairman and members of the committee of an inspirational faith, things and hope that the past of all of us will sometimes cross again.

21:22.520 --> 21:38.520
But if it is easy and it will be heartwarming to meet from day to day and month to month and year to year, it will create the sins of this drama and of the cacters of its cast.

21:38.520 --> 21:59.520
I want to publicly acknowledge the people in the loyal services rendered to me, that members of my staff, Mr. Collier, Mr. Harwitz, Mr. Maynard and Mr. Clay, as others have done at this closing moment.

21:59.520 --> 22:25.520
I want to say, I want to affirm my high estimate of the person of the radio association, in bringing to the people of my country what I consider to be its finest lesson in government and in the operations and functions of at least two of the great branches of that government.

22:26.520 --> 22:45.520
Mr. Chairman, now far as those of you whom we have served so long, the members of this staff committee, as the faith is facing the view before my mind and I am time to come.

22:46.520 --> 22:54.520
I do not look upon the amount of regard to the amount of members of Mr. Clay parties of this country.

22:56.520 --> 23:01.520
I regard them always as truly great Americans.

23:02.520 --> 23:14.520
I want to say here in all citizens, and from the depths of my heart, that they are my mind and I am talking now to the American people.

23:15.520 --> 23:34.520
And in a moment of sentiment may I name them, Senator Jackson, and the State of Washington, Senator Cymings and from Missouri, Senator McCellan, from way down south wall, in the way of the South American people.

23:35.520 --> 23:44.520
And it is seen that Cymings from the great state of South America, Senator Dersen, Senator Illinois, and Senator Potter of Michigan and Senator Gwartack of Idaho.

23:45.520 --> 23:51.520
Later my mind and I am talking to the American people are seven rocks of granite.

23:51.520 --> 24:20.520
Soon, people in this country may anchor all of their hopes, their aspirations, their ambitions, their tricks and their faith because I know that these seven limbs are truly representative of the 96 men who composed the greatest long making by them in this world.

24:21.520 --> 24:29.520
And as long as the American electorate exercises, it's right of right now.

24:30.520 --> 24:42.520
Part of such a terrific choice, which will be its interest, its right in the future only but exercise of eternal dignity.

24:43.520 --> 24:58.520
And send to the halls of the Congress of this nation and to the executive departments of this nation, men of the caliber, of the seven men sitting in my right and my left.

24:59.520 --> 25:10.520
The foundations of this government are strong in our state and the perpetuity of this nation is insured.

25:11.520 --> 25:16.520
Finally Mr. Chairman and I apologize for taking so much.

25:17.520 --> 25:40.520
May I say that here for some time, down in the mountains by some areas, raising our wishful thinking, I can figure out my end in the conviction that perhaps this country stands out in a service to my country.

25:41.520 --> 25:45.520
And not the participation of the committee and the committee's carries.

25:46.520 --> 26:05.520
Then, the limited views and the nights, the labor and the work, the doubts, the scared and the vain desire, I shall feel how things favor and repay the thousand goals. Thank you.

26:10.520 --> 26:20.520
Thank you.
