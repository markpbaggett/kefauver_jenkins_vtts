WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Thank you.

00:02.000 --> 00:08.000
It is the dress, Mr. Chairman, to you.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
On this dated June 17, 1954, and I now read it, here is the chairman.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Much has been said during recent days of the hearings about certain incidents

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
which occurred during the days immediately before and after warings and spread things.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
In response to his suggestion by Mr. Wells, the committee has agreed to accept

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
from the short 90th statement of the fact that I appreciate this opportunity.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
Abort mid-afternoon on February 8, 1954, General Matthew D. Ritzway, Army Keeper staff,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
and I call upon Senator Simonton.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
The senator has suggested to me a few days previously that he would like to talk to the chief of staff and to me.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Having known Senator Simon for many years and been well aware of his waiting in the military,

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
I have invited the opportunity to do with him a number of the armed services committee,

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
some of the problems that I have faced in the Army.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
I met a phone, Mr. Clifford, and so advised him.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
I had no contact with Mr. Clifford thereafter.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
My statement covering this liquor matter was released in the fest on the afternoon of February 21,

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
and I transmitted a copy of the statement by cable at my personal expense to Senator Simonton in Paris.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
On February 22, Washington's birthday, Senator Mondin, and I attended the Freedom Foundation exercise at Valley for its Pennsylvania.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
We discussed this record matter as considerable length.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
It never occurred to me to mention that I had met Senator Simonton's lawyer, Mr. Clifford,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
and the senator's office on the previous Friday afternoon.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Little did I think the 20-minute conversation would be blown out as it has been.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
On February 23, with members of my staff, I worked in preparing my statement on this record case,

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
which I expected to deliver to the subcommittee of the meeting which had been scheduled by Senator McCarthy for the following Thursday, February 25.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Late in the afternoon of that day, I was called at home by Senator Mondin,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
who invited me to a lunch and the next day with the Republican members of this committee.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
He said that I should not bring anyone with me and should not discuss the matter with anyone.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
I now restate my previous testimony before this committee as to my attitude toward the lunch in February 24.

02:22.000 --> 02:30.000
I stated on page 1457 of the transcripts that I was told unhappy, period, about the results of the lunch.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Senator Dirkson will also remember that I talked with him privately after we left the meeting.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
I want to give to know of my feeling that a great mistake is in May.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
This is this discussion to place on the steps of the Capitol, and his weekend is referred to in the first sentence of my phone call of February 25,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
with the senator which is already in the record.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
With respect to the memorandum of understanding of February 24, with Senator Mondin before this morning,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
I now state the point number four leads with follows.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
In view of the four-gling memorandum of understanding, the hearings for them all have been canceled.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
The cancellation of the hearings was fully covered in the first conference at the end of the lunch and the meeting.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
12 days later when Senator Simon didn't call me on March 8 about the shine matter, I wish to be an interesting person that's not as difficult as possible.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
It seemed to me there were many other more important problems.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
I am stated the seriousness of the situation and the hope that it would not be necessary to send the details to the Congress.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Rapidly mounting pressure, however, was such that his rate flag making a statement of respect to the Congress shortly thereafter.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
I thank you for this opportunity to make this statement a part of the record, some dearly yours Robert T. Stephen Secretary of the Army.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
Mr. Chairman, I would like to offer, but not read, if I may, a communication in the form of a cable from General Weber,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
who, as you know, left his room to think his European command.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
It is not foreign evidence, but it is a statement by cable.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
I would appreciate if it would be received by the committee and given that way as they seem, is entitled to.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
In there, just a little bit of a statement, Mr. Love, as you may receive it, I'm going to have other statements to figure it out in our second session tomorrow.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Mr. Chairman, I just have other statements there.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I suppose we have heard Mr. Stephen's statement. I think there is some very interesting factors for us.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
There are some contradictions of statements he made in the amount of the telephone call, further indications of what would be contradictory testimony.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I think it says this under oath.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I think it points up very well.

04:23.000 --> 04:32.000
The rule of the wife rule was that the committee had followed of only having testimony taken under oath, and I personally feel so that from this point on,

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
certainly we should have nothing more in the like of it, from witnesses, vice-president, committed under oath.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
Mr. Chair, I would like to mention a certain measure of respond for the point that I say, if you do not plan to make it a rule, certainly, to accept any testimony,

04:45.000 --> 04:55.000
but you're not taking under oath, to chair make the rule, which is responsibility of the second committee to rule, that the motion by Senator Potter to suspend the rule for this purpose of this one subject alone,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
and so that statement I'm sure is not going to be followed by a statement.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Second statement, this is the second statement, it will be a subject for the committee.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
I think suggestion of Mr. Will, for our consideration, as the second statement, we can't accept.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm going to call him and we'll have a right to meet.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Senator Panagin?

05:11.000 --> 05:20.000
I just want to present to the Chair in a distraction of the second wife, when he was not on the rule of some time earlier today,

05:21.000 --> 05:30.000
he brought up and served as the last secretary of the Secretary of the Mission Park Service, and therefore I think that he set a precedent with theäº‹ and what he said,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
and I think Mr. Will, after you read about it, would also suffer in the name of the letter.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
The letter, in many ways, is a time that I think a time in time, and time has come a time in this in too many.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
Then, I think a time in, there always comes a time in any law to it, no matter how long it is, when some lawyers there,

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
rather than for it in a courtroom, I will, and those lawyers, by now, may.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
At a time, I can remember to the committee have any questions asked, so there wasn't before we dismissed it.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
We will start round the table, bottom is like that, you go ahead.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I do any further questions to ask to the...

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Well, I will come to you, if you don't have any.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm a thank you to everybody who asked to look at this for the first time.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
I would care to say that, developing problems and suggestions that they might like to say, a word is true, that includes the majority.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
Not that we have agreed that there are any no more questions, so it's a moment of the...

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Committee have a...

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
So, the choice word is true to say is, we conclude this business.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
I suggest they withhold them now, and they will find out whether there are any other questions to be asked.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
After that, they shall recognize any member of the committee, or any state that you might want to make.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Are there any questions that you would like to ask to the written committee?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
No, very question, Mr. Chair.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Chair, there is no question that asked, but this time has been a long time.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Senator...

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
No question.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Senator...

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
No question.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Senator...

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
No question.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Senator Simon.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
No question.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Yes, I'd like to ask.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Sorry.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
We've got a few questions, but this time has been a long time.

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
Senator, as we complete these hearings, last evening, 36 days, we realize the repercussions have reached into every section of the country,

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
and that there are very results concerning the charges and the countercharges.

07:18.000 --> 07:29.000
I think that the people who may be aroused emotionally over this hearing, but I'm sure they are more concerned about the future activities to eliminate all subversives from the federal government.

07:29.000 --> 07:38.000
And so, at that point, I ask you what your plans are for continuing your true state on behalf of the subcommittee,

07:38.000 --> 07:49.000
and to what extent do you expect to go operate with the Department of the Army and the various agencies and heroes in the executive branch of the government?

07:49.000 --> 07:58.000
I think that it's very vital to know at this time, in behalf of the millions of Americans who have listened to these hearings and observed the post-statings,

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
over to these who have an expression from you as to your future planning.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Senator, what's that?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I think so.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, there's certainly, and I can't post them now, as they call the hearings.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
I will play them for as much as I can. We have a number of hearings of humblings.

08:19.000 --> 08:34.000
May I say that I have promised Mr. McCrathy back here that I'll take off about three days and do nothing.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I kept relaxed after this.

08:40.000 --> 08:49.000
I think perhaps one of the hearings that could first be held, I hope we can start by the immediate late,

08:49.000 --> 09:03.000
but the hearings of which, under a potter is a chairman, hearing having to do with American citizens still being held in communist prison camps.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
Some of them, some World War I, as I said, are they the chairman?

09:09.000 --> 09:21.000
Number two, I think one of the extremely important hearings that we should do with them is the exposure of communist and defense plan.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
The defense plan, you know, a handle, a handle, a secret topic of material.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Number three, I hope that I can get this committee.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I don't want to start an argument on that now.

09:36.000 --> 09:45.000
I hope I can get this, and let's get into many to agree with me, that we should call the members of an old-worldly boy,

09:45.000 --> 09:54.000
they're no longer acting in the world, they have been dispanded by Bob Stevens, very wise acting as part of things.

09:54.000 --> 10:04.000
And find out what they are doing, how they handling secret topics, secret other material.

10:04.000 --> 10:13.000
And I think the American people should know why over the past five, six, eight, ten years,

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
they were sending people with courthouse communist records into our secret plan.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
Another matter, I think, is the express case.

10:27.000 --> 10:36.000
I would like to know the names of the American people, see why they say I, I'd like to put them in the record.

10:37.000 --> 10:48.000
The names of those who gave the special consideration to a man who was a graduate of a come to leadership school,

10:48.000 --> 11:05.000
we have one of the hearing centers which I believe is being now handled by the shape art committee that had to do with the alleged blast corruption fraud and some last-composite records.

11:06.000 --> 11:25.000
There will be a very important question of whether or not we can join to the alleged communist infiltration of CIA,

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
or what authority, what we have there.

11:30.000 --> 11:42.000
Also the question of what of anything we should do and we go into alleged communist infiltration of the atomic and hydrogen bomb plan.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
And we have to say that's an action of our own for signing from now, different and many things.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
I thought he made a microphone suggestion and that matter came up.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
He suggested that I take that matter up with the White House.

11:57.000 --> 12:11.000
The chairman of other nut they would give a full cooperation whether or not they felt this would endanger national security because of the many subjects which could not be stressed publicly.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
The life of Dom I was convinced of that time.

12:16.000 --> 12:25.000
I was convinced of that time that if a not really national interest to go into the matter of the communist can hydrogen bomb plants.

12:25.000 --> 12:36.000
Many other subjects that we have pending but I think that the high points of the subject are addressed yet.

12:36.000 --> 12:51.000
The people who have followed these hearings for several weeks are wondering whether the occurrences of the bill will which have been engendered between the Department of the Army and probably the staff of this optimist will be reflected in future activities.

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
Or what extent will that be complete cooperation in trying to expose and root out SBNRs within the federal government.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
Can you tell us very briefly I don't want to prolong this hearing but I think that we have had disagreements.

13:03.000 --> 13:21.000
We have had some misunderstandings but I think that the people will feel there has been an obvious waste of time in holding these hearings unless there will be forthcoming some assurances that we will move forward in these important and vital efforts to move out SBNRs within the federal government.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
And that to accomplish this we must have the push to operate.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
As long as I say I will just try and take 30 seconds.

13:30.000 --> 13:43.000
My last thing number one that I have no ill will. I will even remove place against anyone in the Department of the Army.

13:43.000 --> 13:55.000
I hope that we can work out with cooperation number one number two.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
I say some here that our difficulty has not been with the uniform that except with the Q-Rex.

14:01.000 --> 14:11.000
Our difficulty is hang with the old 100 grams of civilian power between from think that they should be running here.

14:11.000 --> 14:26.000
As far as the military men I can stand in the men uniform. I think we can safely assume that much more than 99% of good loyal Americans willing to fight from dire to their country.

14:26.000 --> 14:40.000
I don't know I just hope we can work out some formula for my men and people can know what's going on without any way in danger and national security.

14:40.000 --> 14:54.000
I think that you have taken less time. You have wasted less time than any man including myself.

14:54.000 --> 15:11.000
And then of this committee I think that you have these efforts that I normally would expect you to be interrupting and if all of us come here and use the constraints that you have used.

15:11.000 --> 15:22.000
We have another year many days before the day and that's investigating coming. Well I can say to you Senator McCharge that the reason I haven't taken very much time is not because of a lack of interest on my tonight and I need both cities.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
I have been vitally interested for our things that we have far more important business for instance for safton who now the Florida Senate.

15:29.000 --> 15:40.000
We had a twenty nine billion dollar defense appropriation bill and here we have immobilized eight senators who were not permitted to participate in the discussion and even in the marking up of that important bill.

15:40.000 --> 15:57.000
And so I want merely to stress that I think the major consideration at that time is to close the ranks and eliminate misunderstanding and the disagreements which have developed on this important question so that we can give assurances to the American people.

15:57.000 --> 16:16.000
That in spending these billions of dollars on national defense we must not be unaware of the importance of having an afraid of core and having the congressional committees and the officials in the executive department fully cooperating to ensure and adequate national defense in these crucial times.

16:17.000 --> 16:30.000
Senator May I again take thirty seconds and I think I can agree for further with what you said I think one of the well we have an immobilized that's not time of that simply from the committee.

16:30.000 --> 16:38.000
In that getting far down charges I think that one of the very very good things that comes in the comments.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
One of the most important things has been the result of television.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
I've been receiving seven or eight thousand letters a day.

16:49.000 --> 17:07.000
I think and now it's some of the how many twenty twenty two million people having the Senate committee in a section in their living room watching the Senate committee they realize how badly and how dishonestly distorted.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
Here's the news by a few an emphasize a few because they've asked the mother of working class years.

17:15.000 --> 17:31.000
I think I like competent oil people but how a few of the comments have succeeded in deceiving the American people and I think that's one of the good things that comes in the sense that carrying some good work that I don't think the time is all been wasted.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
That's all Mr. Justice.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
One point for the hearing's concordant I guess that's that now.

17:40.000 --> 17:50.000
Now that you can understand the foundation of the way of the unity you've been in family and project family I think it might be appropriate there to it in concordance.

17:51.000 --> 18:12.000
For us the best person in COS contains on the last part of the end of the room which I have prepared there inside of the official communist party line on the coffee and they can say articles from the daily work or another communist party publications which indicates that the number one

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
of the communist movement the communist conspiracy is looking to destroy this nation.

18:19.000 --> 18:30.000
I've been high-techity participated in by you and the warning to see what can give them to the American people for a period of years.

18:30.000 --> 18:41.000
And in following the sanctions of those and to various other items in communist publications I want to close on that note.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
But I think it's tribute so somebody goes for a long and period of time very little money.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
It's that kind of severe and takes a very much time.

18:56.000 --> 19:03.000
Mr. Chairman, one thing I would like to introduce to you is the record that I don't want to explain to you.

19:03.000 --> 19:20.000
The constitution of the communist party, the peaceful party, the communist party, the top writing, giving me objective of the party of the two-page document.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I'd like to give you a document after the time I ate.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I got it in the middle.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
That's my name.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
My name is Lecci.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
You have a newspaper to mark your party.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
You have a newspaper to mark your party.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I have nothing for it.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
I've been probably dismissed from it.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
You probably call on the numbers and the committee has any statements to make.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
I can check out that in a cascading with the other statement to make before you dismiss.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
Mr. Chairman, the only statement to the other question.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
The only statement I have to make, Mr. Cameron, was a very brave.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Well, here, there was an unfinished investigation.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
There has been a demonstration.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I think it's considerable.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
The investigation is going to take a long time.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
Unless we can get the four Republicans on the big gun or pass.

20:10.000 --> 20:18.000
We're together doing this task that I think is important to me on the earth.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
There's much we can do.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
It'll be completely impossible for me as a chairman.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
They're doing an effective job of digging out the communism's corruption,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
treason, our staff has been working on.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
Unless we do have, finally, at this late date, some type of full-hearted cooperation

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
with my men and my friends, my Republican friends, I have them.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
I'm not afraid of them, I assure you.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
I have been very, very happy.

20:53.000 --> 21:01.000
A thick and sweet full-hearted cooperation of the Republican members on the committee.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.000
I have asked them over the past year, more than last, to take on very just a reasonable job.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
In fact, I've asked them to take on the most just a reasonable job.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
It's one that everyone's doing myself.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And they have a way to do that.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
They've done those jobs well.

21:18.000 --> 21:25.000
Some fairly folks, but now, my Democrat friends and I can forget about the,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
oh, I don't like your word business.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
But I think of course as that, that's a thousand Democrats here.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
And if we can all get down to doing this job, say, for example,

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
some of them are calling the righty Democrat members.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
And I have worked very closely for a number of years,

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
while he was chairman, and then while I was chairman,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
we think of lost balance.

21:55.000 --> 22:06.000
I think the fact that we lost that cooperation has been a great damage to some place.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
I just hope that we can regain it.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
And all I can say is that the five times is fine.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Well, we know the backwards.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
We're everything humanly possible.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
It works with our done-up-out friends so we can have a good,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
going working committee, which I think we must have Mr. Chairman,

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
which I think we must have.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
If this Congress is to do the job that we're supposed to do,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
then we act as a workdog,

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
nothing happens if people know about his happening.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I think they must be Americans, people know what is going on.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Then a republic does not have long to live.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Great.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
The work we saw yesterday, I'm trying to get this over here.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I've got the essence of this work.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
That's those for the market.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Yes, I have thought those were in the country.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
I really can't because the end is, say, what do you do under when including?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
You may step down and do it.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And thank you.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
The chair will say that you will recognize these two best colleagues

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
and councilors, councilors,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
if they can't say something now in conclusion,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
I will say that we have no witness before it,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
and the witness has made his decision first.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
Chair, I'll be very first, say, don't think I'm ready, statement, in which.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
My line is to appear that I would like to reiterate now.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
I said these hearings are best combined with an unfulfilled of those.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Nothing has occurred since that service along the road

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
which has changed my evaluation of the kind of business we are in debt.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
I said the members of the Subcommittee are, however, resolved

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
to accept our individual and collective responsibilities that do our best.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
To adjudicate and resolve this unfulfilled affair.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I face this, the members of the committee,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
each according to his own life,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
above his own self, as in Debra,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
and the anti-antifference of this.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
The chair will say that his authority is concerned.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
He believes we have reduced the potential for that.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
So he's sent you unnecessary in the writing of a report.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
The chair believes that his authority is concerned

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
the American audience.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
From twenty-name we are told I'm radio and television.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
No money, no harmony, more millions, I'm the press.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
I follow these hearings more carefully and more generally.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
In any hearing there was before I was on Capitol Hill.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
I can assure our friends in the audience that they know what we know.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
And that I request to be based on facts which have met the eye or 50 years

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
of everybody's intelligence following the language.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
And to guard the chair's concern he once was himself.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
To turn the time back to the teeth together along Christmas and change the government.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
When those change in everything comes in here for the Anomars,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
you believe that you'll be able to do his part in writing a report.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Was it happening?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
We can agree to have a one-packing report.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Or whether it's more real or if it's a two-packed report.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
We will find ourselves writing two reports or perhaps different viewpoints

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
from different individuals.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
So I'd like to say one thing about a thing is that hearing which has been discussed

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
is a great piece.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
And that is the fact that we have frequently diverged.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
And what we're always knowing the basic issues.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
That there have been bureaucracies and evictions nobody would find.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Most of those have evolved around a significant dispute.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Very honest men have a perfect right to do.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
And very honest men have been different in the business, the self-governance,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
and the very same stuff.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
Those are differences involved in the functions and the rights and the belonging

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
and the functional connection and the functions and the relatives exactly.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
And while it may appear to some that arguments we catch, annotations and heated.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And sometimes unhappily personal.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Our reflection on our American system of government

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
is that share of all these fighting reverts to be the truth.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
We suffer in America.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Our arguments are an exchange of viewpoints.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Sometimes heated.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Sometimes unhappily questions.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
But we don't suffer them as you do.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
We don't suffer them at several points.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
We don't suffer them with group violence.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
We suffer them by an appeal to the mind.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
I think too that we should recognize that we are fortunate in this country

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
that we can adjudicate a difference of this time openly, publicly,

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
even though it takes a tremendous amount of time.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
And the chair is opinion that's a demonstration that Americanism and freedom

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
and self-government in this country are made the pretty sturdy stuff.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
I just said from those two people that this is a disgraceful spectacle

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
because people disagree.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
And I joined those two people that just is a much further way to settle this view.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
And there's a fine flow of doors in our star chain recession.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
One other thing.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
I think these hearings have helped make clear to millions of Americans

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
who haven't thought about the subject as they went to high school.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
That the first political power in America

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
are not one stream flowing as a mighty river.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
Instead we find them breaking open little rivers,

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
a little stream with intertwined and twisted and turned.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
Sometimes joining, going down some narrow roads through all of these,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
the lines are clearly defined.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
And sometimes spreading in the broad valley where it's difficult to know

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
just where the lines of authority are, or where the power should be channeled.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
And I think to those who help,

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
to the hearings to discuss those issues for a while,

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
because as we bring to bear the collective mind of America

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
and those problems, we'll have to solidify the forces of freedom.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
So perhaps when history is written, it will be the irrelevance.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
And it's a great, that's currently to be the most constructive basis

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
of this country ready rather than the arguments devoted to some specific points.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
It takes time, it takes tradition,

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
it takes the force of circumstance to define the flow of political power

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
down definitely established camp.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I think we can all rejoice.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
That we don't have it to find as clear as they have it as a reference.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Whether it's never any dispute, whether executive is a pain,

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
and the legislative is a crime.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I think we can rejoice in the fact.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
We don't have a hearing that has it from happily in fact.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Whether executive is a profit or a facility,

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
and whether the legislative part has become aæ•·tion since strong,

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
and once the veto is executive for free to hold out of power,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
I think it's really helped us to grasp this privilege

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
with ultimately resolved and the consolidation of the free.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
A chair would like to express his appreciation to the members

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
of the Council of all of us.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
For the very straight years, that helped the way of the staff

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
and the conduct of their heavy responsibilities.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
He would like to express his appreciation to his colleagues.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
We are born with the chairmen through many, many long texts.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
Over 70, I think 72 degrees back.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I appreciate their cooperation.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I appreciate their assistance.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I expect, in a five-partisan government,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
people are going to disagree on prestigious ones in a while.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
I don't decry that. I applaud.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
We have gone along together here over a long, hard-full

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
and I want to express my appreciation to those who have been joined

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
with me in this event.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
I would like to express my appreciation to the members of the Council of all of us.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
The radio and television people.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
But for the two national networks that have carried these hearings

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
and their entire, to the people,

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I think that's going to demonstrate for the future.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
A course of action with other committees, ultimately, are going to follow.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
I said, and we began, all of us in this committee room

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
and this end of the table were on the spot.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I said the chair was on the spot.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
He said, I'm not too out there.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
I said, these committee colleagues were on the spot.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
I joined him in that unambiable debate.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
I said to our friends in the press court, that they're on the spot.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
It's difficult, I know, to report back to the people who meet the faces

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
the things that they've been all of it.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
And hearing all the, I'm sure this is the other report of you all here.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
And the chair has no arguments and no formal complaints

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
by the fine manner in this decree as reported these hearings.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
I think it is clear to us all that television kids

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
are saying, good chef-prone for the press, that's not.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
There's a press, and sometimes, perhaps, can be a chef-prone for television.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
And so I thank you very much for your diligence.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I thank you for your cooperation.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
I join you in a tie of relief that we have come to the end of this unprecedented,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
now, Senator McIlon, I recognize you.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Right, Mr. Chairman.

30:50.000 --> 30:57.000
In much of what you have said, I fully agree that's through my appreciation to you.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
I'm forward to having, unfortunately, the very first time I've participated in the proceedings

31:04.000 --> 31:13.000
and to, as far as I'm back, you didn't start attending majoring women's meetings.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
Most of the time, I am from Charles Sayagher.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
That person is one of the most special people.

31:22.000 --> 31:29.000
One of the most beautiful, special purposes that has been gathered by my duty as a proponent.

31:29.000 --> 31:40.000
I have no animosity towards anyone, or any individual we need during the game.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
I think I can say without any resolution whatsoever,

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
but I hold an animosity now to anyone involved in the proceedings.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
I would say in the beginning that Mr. Chairman and that we've spoken by a movement in the open lead game,

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
drop the charges and the countercharges that gave rise to this controversial,

32:01.000 --> 32:08.000
of where I'll such a great nature as to make these proceedings mandatory.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
I think that statement was true.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
I also said that the charges and the accusations were some biometrics in the conversation,

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
but as I saw them, they could not possibly be weaponized.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
I do not believe the testimony of it has been given there will be only 20,

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
under the any possible, highly-themed weaponized.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
I thought the state of it is beginning in the air in Mr. Chairman,

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
but we, the Democrats, would hold it hard at least,

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
undertake to cooperate with an assist in the drive in making these hearings impartial.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Fire and fire.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
To the end of that vicious truth, focus true might be revealed.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
That focus, that's the stone, that's the rock of the person that I will put my hand down.

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
No, the Chairman, ask for us.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
I hope so.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
That's right.
