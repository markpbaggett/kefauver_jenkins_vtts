WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
And to tell you about it.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
And the carman has called the committee to attention.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
And now I'm making his normal little feet

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
with the oath to open-duffing session

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
with warning the audience to be careful,

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
not to show any approval or decision.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Any audible manifestations of approval or just approval

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
on the front of the audience in any form or at any time.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
And the committee has given the uniformed officers

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
that you see before you and these plain closements

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
gathered in the audience.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
A standing order to remove from the room politely,

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
but firmly and immediately, any of my guests,

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
who for reasons both known to themselves violate the terms

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
of which you entered the room.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Those terms included completely to refrain

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
from any manifestations of approval or just approval.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
We've had wonderful cooperation from our friends in the audience

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
and we expect that cooperation to continue.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
As we concluded, last Friday,

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
consultations was in the process of cross-examining Mr. Roy Co.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
On that cross-examination, we'll continue with this time

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
with Mr. Jenkins, our council continuing the cross-examination.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Mr. Jackson.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Mr. Jackson.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Mr. Jackson.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Mr. Collins.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I can't remind you that it's still my thing

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
for you to continue the cross-examination

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
of your service.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
You recall a meeting with Secretary Steven's

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
with Collins on November 16th?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Hi, Mr. Jackson.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
When you tell the members of the committee what occurred

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
on that occasion, yes, sir.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
That meeting came about as a result of a call to me

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
from Mr. John Adams on the afternoon of the 15th.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
It relates back to the press conference

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
which Mr. Steven said held on November 13th,

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
and I don't know just how much detail you want me to give, Mr. Jenkins,

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
on all those incidents.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm particularly glad to see Mr. Collins as well.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
As the press is for that question, yes.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
They were not sent to the press.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
They were quite afraid over the press release

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
given out by Mr. Steven.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I don't know if I say a set, sir.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
He thought of the statements that made one true statement

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
in the course of the press conference, and that's a statement.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
The statement being to the effect, yes, there was no current

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
exchange in the Army.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Is that correct?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Or is it more than that, sir?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
There are other statements with which Senator McCarthy, wow.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
The method of the part of it to which the senator

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
particularly objected to.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Sir, as I recall, there were three parts.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
One was just as you mentioned, a report that Mr. Steven said

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
that there had been no S.B. in eyes at Fort Marnemith.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I believe that's the way the newspaper story,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
which caused the most current red, the one-in-the-hell

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
tribune by Homer Figard.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
Number two, as I recall it now, Mr. Steven was reported to have said

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
that none of this suspension had fought Marnemith related in any way

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
to the theft or removal or disappearance of documents,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
which we knew to be untrue.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
And number three, I recall that Mr. Steven cad in his press conference

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
was given to the press a breakdown,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
and so the number of suspensions which have taken place,

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
which breakdown he had previously refused to give to this committee,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
on the ground that it was security information covered by the

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
presidential directive.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And the chairman of the committee couldn't quite understand why

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Mr. Steven's give all the press conference and give out information,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
which he had told the committee he couldn't give to the committee

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
because it was security information.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
But it might have been other things, but I remember those three very

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
particularly.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I will ask you, brother and not on that occasion,

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
you stated to the Secretary of the Army that he had double-crossed

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Senator McCarthy.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
No, so I don't recall using those words at all.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, I want you now to reflect your recollection, Mr. Cohn,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
and the search of memories, and the state does nearly as you can

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
to this committee, just what she said to the Secretary of the Army

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
of City thing was referenced to the double-crossed.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yes, sir.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
As I recall, Mr. Adams called me the day before,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
and asked me to come down to see Mr. Steven.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
He told me that the matter was such importance to Mr. Steven,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Mr. Jenkins, that if I could not come down to Washington the next morning,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Mr. Steven would fly up to New York to see me that night,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
which was the Sunday night.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
I had to be in New York Monday back in New York Monday afternoon,

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
but I certainly was going to put the Secretary of the Army

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
to the trouble of flying up to New York just to see me,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
so I went down on Monday morning at his request.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Mr. Steven was very much upset at the way the press had reported.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
His press conference, he said they had distorted what he had said,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
that they had vajored him at the conference,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
but one or two reporters got hold of him and kept blowing unfear

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
questions at him.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Mr. Adams kept saying he knew the whole thing was a mistake,

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
and for that reason, he had purposely left the room before the press conference took place.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Mr. Steven said he could fully understand that Senator McCarthy

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
would take issue with the press stories and their accuracy,

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
and that he would like to recudiate everything he had said at the press conference.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
That's, I told Mr. Bomyport,

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
that I told Mr. Steven I had talked with Senator McCarthy,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
who was speaking up in New England.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
I told Mr. Steven that Senator McCarthy felt

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
and that I felt, frankly, all of us,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
all of us, who knew the facts about the things that had been unfortunate

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
because the facts had been misrepresented in the newspapers,

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
and that certainly he had given in accuracy for a trail

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
of the situation that it had existed.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
My specific question is whether or not you told the Secretary

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
that he had never called Senator McCarthy?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
All right, do not recall using that word,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
and I'm quite sure that I didn't use the word.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
This conversation was not here.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Do we understand that, now that's a piece of certificate,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
and I have no clue.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Mr. Jenkins, my best memory is I did not use that word.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I want to read you what the Secretary says.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Page 372 of the transcripts of the records.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Mr. Cohen said that Senator McCarthy was mad.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Did you say that?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
If I said he was mad, I certainly conveyed the impression

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
that Senator McCarthy felt the story was inaccurate

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
and that Mr. Steven, if he said what he's supposed to have said,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
shouldn't have said it because it wasn't true.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
And that I had double-crossed him.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Did you say that, sir?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I don't recall that.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm not using the word.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Who can say he don't recall?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Now do you deny that his name is Mr. McHolter?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Say that your memory says you all that stuff.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
I said, well, Mr. Jenkins, you're asking me to give you words for words.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
What was said on that day of November 16th, I can't do that.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I can't give you the substance of the conversation because I remember it.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
I cannot swear to you what exact words I use and what exact words I did not use.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
I can't give you the substance of it, sir, and I would be very happy to do that.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
And as I understand it now, you neither have firm, nor deny that statement.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
I would say the best I can give you on that, if you press me on it,

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
and I guess what they that I did not use, that I don't recall ever using the words,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
double-crossed from Mr. Stevens.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
And I can't say the appropriateness of it.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
The incomection was just a discussion about his press time.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
It was a very, very, very pleasant discussion, and there was no...

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
You said, well, the prisoners' discussions extremely close, they're on both sides.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, the secretary changed his press statement, did he not?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
He did the next day, sir, yes.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
On November 17th, the emergence of the New York City.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yes, sir.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Now you say you don't recall using the word double-crossed to the secretary.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I do, sir.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
And I believe you say you don't recall ever having used that word to the secretary.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Double-crossed?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I don't ever recall having used it.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
You recall ever having used the word double-crossed to Mr. Adams, the secretary's counselor.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
No, sir.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
You do not.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
Anyway, the statements that Christel East was altered on the 17th of November, wasn't it?

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
I would say it was corrected to bring it in conformance with the true fact.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
There was a new paper strike in New York City in November, was it not?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
It's cold.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
It's a very well-might've in Mr. Jackson.

08:58.000 --> 09:08.000
Well, now, Mr. Colme, though you remember well that on November 28th, there was a new paper strike in New York City?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
No, sir.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
I don't remember that well.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
I do remember, if the hearing Mr. Adams said some only, that there was a...

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Yes, I do remember that there was a new paper strike.

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
And these chains that were being conducted in New York City were as a result of that strike transferred to Washington.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Where's it not?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
They were not, sir.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
They were not, no, sir.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
But it's only transferred to Washington, where it's not, sir.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
They were not transferred to Washington.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
We had previously held hearings in Washington.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
We held some in New York.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Whenever possible, we were told from in Washington.

09:42.000 --> 09:50.000
There will now perhaps my choice of the word transfer was a man happy one and convey the erroneous meaning to your mind.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
What I mean to ask you is this, a form of the occasion of the New Paper Strike in New York City,

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
the hearings were held in Washington, leering the penancey of that strike Wednesday.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Sir, I can't agree with you on that.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
I don't believe that to be the strike, and I was very much appreciated.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
If I could get the date of the New Paper Strike and see whether it was on on the days that we held hearings and watched,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I believe with December 8th and December 9th.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And I could give you a better answer if I had that.

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
Will there was a strike nearing the period as a matter of part of November, 1953?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
But school was the night, all the night, all definitely, that there was a strike.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
If I could get the exact date then, until I would see in a much better position to help you on this.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Why were there no hearings held in New York City during that New Paper Strike?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yes, sir, we're not.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't know if there were none.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
It probably turned out to be a work.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I just don't know, sir.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
I'm just a coned-do you know it's the word in the hearing.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
You are doing that.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I can't say a thing until I know the date to the New Paper Strike.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Then by a checklist of record, I can tell you very quickly.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Whether there were any in New York and whether the ones that were held in Washington,

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
were held in Washington during the time of the New Paper Strike in New York.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I want to ask you, Mr. Cohn, if it didn't have that.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
That there was a new paper strike in New York City in the latter part of November.

11:16.000 --> 11:23.000
That these hearings were then held in the city of Washington because they could not

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
and were not publicized in New York City.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
No, sir.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
You heard me, madam, this sound, I said to you, did you not?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I said, sir.

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
Did you hear me, madam, just a guy under his oath that Mr. Cohn, the director of your

11:41.000 --> 11:49.000
staff told him that the reasons the gangs were transferred to Washington was because of the

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
strike in New York City.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
And as a consequence, the gangs could not be properly publicized,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
whereas they could be in the city of Washington.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
You heard me, madam, say, five, that's a good idea.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Yes, sir.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
What if Mr. Cohn makes such a statement to your nose?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I'm sure he never made such a statement seriously, sir.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
And I'm sure Mr. Adams knew that he never did.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Well, he wouldn't have made it just to you, he might have, sir.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I didn't say that, sir.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I didn't say that, sir.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Mr. Cohn, this makes such a statement.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Did you hear the talk from Mr. Cohn about that?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
No, sir.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I have no recollection ever having talked to Mr. Cohn about the nose-famous strike.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
Can you assign any reason, whatever, while these hearings were held in Washington,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
bringing dependency of the newspaper strike in New York City?

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Sir, first of all, I can't say that they were held in Washington during the dependency of the strike

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
because I don't have the date to strike with underway.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
I know they're hearing through Health December 8th and 9th, and if you tell me, sir,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
that the strike was armed on December 8th and 9th.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Thank you, sir.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Sir, sir.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Chairman.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Sir, sir.

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
I didn't say there was anything you'd proper about holding hearings in Washington during the time you were coming to the office in the presentation.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I am a fall.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
I was the man who ordered the hearing held in New York,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Shelton Barton, Shelton Barton, Washington, Shelton, and other fighters.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
I don't understand what this has to do with the issues.

13:21.000 --> 13:30.000
However, Mr. Jenkins' length of his, I'll be glad to answer in full while we held hearings in various parts of the country.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
So, sir, I want to ask you about it.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
The committee may think that it's important, and that's why I'm asking you to be careful.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
I've been right to interrogate.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
I don't know if I don't know if the strike might be, but if the strike comes out, the council meeting can do that also.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And, maybe, Chair, I'm presently just that there's been an interim this week,

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
unless there are points to order, a point to personal service, and, of course, the statement about a Sunday point constant was needed.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Mr. Jenkins.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Chairman.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Mr. Chairman.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Are you fine, Margaret?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
New, you may call, but I don't know.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Allow me to finalize what you call it, but I need to go to the state, because we're going to have to proceed now.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
I don't know if I want to make a clear, but, Chairman, if there was anything improper,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I'm going to be holding hearings from Washington.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
During the war held here, I order the men out here.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I will answer any questions, when I get the stand on this.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Chair, are you, the previous time, it's the Jenkins and I will ask you questions about it.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Chair, will you reiterate the statement, unless there be no interruptions, please?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
This week.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
Unless there are points to order, a point to personal service, we believe around the home secretary's hearing,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
and if we're going to get home, we have to proceed in order.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Mr. Jenkins.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
The moment of order is on the phone, you may take your final order.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
As I point of order, I would like to ask the chair to, personally read them in the slide,

14:52.000 --> 15:01.000
brother, and he wants to send a letter to the record, a wire from a individual who was mentioned last week as an informant.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm not asking the district of the record this time, I'm asking the chair, read it.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
I hope that he gives all members of the committee a copy of this wire, as well as the extent to which.

15:11.000 --> 15:20.000
The Justice Department is going to prevent the testimony of certain witnesses being received here.

15:20.000 --> 15:29.000
We are saying Mr. Chairman that I find on the back of the wire a certain note, the letter is now which, for sure, was just used as a firing cell.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Chairman, have we just received the lunch hour?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
The statement is taken.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
The call is during the period from November 18th to December 18th.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
You know how many times you call Mr. John Adams.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Nothing.

15:43.000 --> 15:50.000
The ordinance that in 65 is respect to numerous telephone calls to meeting at paid of time, if you not.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I thought he said that we had numerous conversations, sir.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
I believe he made just as many calls to me as I did to him.

15:55.000 --> 16:02.000
I think you're entirely correct, but you and he called each other from time to time a number of times hearing at paid.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Is that correct, so?

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
And in those telephone calls, the subject of day shine was discussed from time to time.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Was it not, I would say, in frequently, sir?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
In frequently?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yes, sir.

16:19.000 --> 16:26.000
I want to read you up with Adam, said about that, Mr. Cohn on page 2564.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
And as you will, you're not, you're correct in his testimony.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
The recalls to me fairly regularly.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I can't say that the calls to me were every day.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
The recalls to me was not long before the New York.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
The recalls to me was a case of a committee business or a request from the Army,

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
required me to place telephone calls to Mr. Cohn.

16:52.000 --> 17:01.000
And, doing many of these calls which I placed to Mr. Cohn, I was subject to the telephone calls to the state.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
The same sort of treatment.

17:04.000 --> 17:10.000
The same pressures were referenced to a commitment for a New York assignment for shine,

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
immediately as a conclusion of his eight weeks of basic training.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Is that true or false, Mr. Cohn?

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Sir, it's very difficult for me to put a legal characterization on it.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
I would say that Mr. Adams is quite mistaken and if he were pressured or abused,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
he certainly never indicated that to me.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
I believe you'll find the circumstances of Michael for him with him

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
and his kind of abs of him to be such that no reasonable person can believe that he was abused or felt that he hadn't.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
When you hit Bob with the shine, the shine of the New York area,

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
did you not? There's never a question of any permanent assignment of Mr. Shine to the New York area.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Now, it's no less than an answer to my question.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
My question specifically, you hit Bob's shine with shine to the New York area.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Did you not answer? The question was the finishing up of this committee's witness

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
which I'd have been done in the New York or Washington area. Mr. Adams knew the problem

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
and that's what the discussion is worth out there.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
They do have a mindset of the question directly.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
Anything is specifically used to hit Bob's shine as time to the New York area.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Is that right or is it wrong? No, sir. I can't give you a categorical.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yes, I know answer to that.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
Why, why can't you not? Because the thing just doesn't admit it.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
A question of having him finish off the subcommittee,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Mr. Adams, know all about that situation.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
He knew that it was the a convenient if Shine could be in the New York or Washington area

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
so he got through with that.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
But if you ask me, did we ask for a commitment on it?

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
And it's what sounds like a permanent assignment to the New York area.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
I can't fail it if you were, yes, I know answer to that.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Mr. Kuhn, I didn't say anything about it.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
The permanent assignment. The question was simple.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Did you want Shine assigned to the New York area?

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Well, I think you might grab your phone and then make such explanation as you see this.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
Sure, Lisa. I would say no. We did not request an assignment for Shine.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Ask you about the quick. I'm asking you about a little state now.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
What would you mind if you wanted the Shine to the New York area?

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
No, sir. I would say if I had it going through a mental state,

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
what we wanted is to get the subcommittee work done and to report that.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
And we want to shine tell as much as we could get that without interference with this regular Army training.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
I would say that was our mental state if that's period of time.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
And wanting that, you wanted him assigned to a convenient post.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
And the New York area would have been the most convenient area to which he could have been assigned.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Now, that's correct. It's not quite, sir. It never quite got down to that.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Because he was at 4.6 and they were making him available during the weekend.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
And a week of send staff members out to talk to him.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
We'll talk to him on the phone when problems arose.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And there was no great. There was no great difficulty.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Well, did you ever ask the Secretary of the Army?

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
I have found for the Don Hatton to assign the New York region to a man, Shine.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Who's the New York area?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
No, sir. I don't believe anything that once ever came up.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
It was a question of the finish of the problem of finishing the subcommittee work.

20:11.000 --> 20:19.000
And working out some way of his filling that without interfering with his Army training.

20:28.000 --> 20:36.000
You heard all this testimony to the Secretary of the Army and the Miss Adams about these numerous columns

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
to claim some, your part, the part of the Senators.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
To get this boy assigned to the New York area so that he could assist in the committee work.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
And you say that didn't happen, is that right, isn't it?

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
No, sir. I'm trying to give you the picture as it did happen.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
There was just never a request assigned him to the New York area.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
As serious. They know this problem had been discussed by us with them over a period of time.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
They know what the problem was. And it was always a question of letting him finish up the subcommittee work.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
What happened to the hearing with his Army training?

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
That was a problem on both sides. And we posted a set of sets of works to think out.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
And it was worked out, sir, in a perfectly satisfactory manner.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Miss Cohen, do you remember meeting with Miss Adams on December 8th?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
I remember hearing here on December 8th.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
I think that was the day Aaron Coleman testified in public session down in Washington.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Did you talk to Mr. Adams on that occasion about days, James?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
During the course of the year.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
I can't say that I did, sir. I certainly don't deny that I talked with Mr. Adams on that occasion.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Now that hearing was held right here in this room, wasn't it?

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Yes, sir. And Mr. John Adams was sitting...

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
Uh, approximately where Mr. Mayner is sitting to my rear.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Excuse me, Mr. Jenkins.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
I got in the note here, I don't know how authentic it is, but the newspaper strike was not on.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
On the days when our hearings were held in Washington,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
namely, December 8th or December 9th.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
And I assume the information is authentic.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
So, well, I'm asking you now, Mr. Mona.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
You had a public strike to put that in the record?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
And I don't know when the newspaper strike was on.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Yes, sir.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
I'm at school and this evening, you recall this hearing here on December 8th, do you not?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Yes, sir.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
You say you do not remember talking to John Adams about China while the hearing was in Poggy?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
No, sir.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
We used to know I talking to Adams about China while those hearings were in Poggy?

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
No, sir. I say it was unlikely, sir, for this reason if I might explain my no answer.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
Uh, I looked at Mr. Adams' original charges, south on March 11th.

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
And in those, I believe, sir, he said that he talked to me about China before the hearing started.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
Uh, then in his testimony here, this hearing, he changed that and said that he talked to him,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
that I talked to him during the hearing.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
And if Mr. Adams isn't straight on it, sir, I don't think I can be expected to be.

23:08.000 --> 23:17.000
It's very possible that there was conversation between him and me about China on the subject of staff members seeing him at night while he was doing his training.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
And whether that's a place before the hearing or during the hearing or on the next day or whether it didn't take place at that time,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I'm in no position to affirm more than I.

23:27.000 --> 23:35.000
Well, China being given the additional work to do along about that time, or IC, was inducted in the Army in the Colton?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Uh, additional, sir.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Yes, we were signed.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
No, sir. We worked together.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
No, sir. He was in this hearing.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
He was not, sir.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
He was not.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
No, sir. He was finishing up.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yes, sir.

23:46.000 --> 23:55.000
You were going around just about to chiseled him that his work was increasing.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Did you not miss call?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I think that was the true statement, sir.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
A true statement?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Yes, sir.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
In other words, he was retrofishing instead of progressing in getting up a lease report.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
No, sir. What's the effect of it?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Well, sir, it wasn't quite that.

24:10.000 --> 24:17.000
I think that's about the period of time that he got hit with the full impact of finishing these reports with a time limit on it.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
Uh, during these reports turned out to be quite a formidable job.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
And, uh, there was a lot of hard work that he did on those.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
And a lot of hard work, I think, just about every other member of the staff did on those reports.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
The cuts of the point, Mr. Jenkins, where I think we stopped holding all hearing for a period of a month,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
just so we could get those reports out.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
It was quite clear.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
We can get back to that later now.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
I'm asking you now about December 8th, and about the suddenly gains in our...

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
...water region, what we saw them, swore under OK.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And I want to ask you whether or not it is true or false.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
And I'll read now from page 2574 of the record.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
From the testimony of Smith Adams.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
All the number of occasions being the course of the entire nation of the Whitney.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
When others were interrogating them,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
comb, cut up,

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
and team over and spoke to the about shines.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Things to the effect.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
What about these things?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
What about these things?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
What about these things?

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
It continues intermittently throughout the morning.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Do you see about that in school?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Well, I say that, Mr. Jenkins.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
First of all, I'm just looking here at Mr. Adams' original charges of March 11th,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
in which he set forth a detailed account of these events.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
If you're talking about December 8th, there's not one word about my having said anything to him about date,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
shine on December 8th.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
And I assume that Mr. Adams' memory was better when he drew this document on March 11th,

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
and it was too much later when he testified before this committee.

26:00.000 --> 26:10.000
So now, Mr. Fulm, that document of March 11th was the general statement of I'm talking to you now about the specific testimony in support of those statements.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
And he says that on December 8th, during a public hearing in this room,

26:17.000 --> 26:23.000
few continuously asking what about their things.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
Now, do you deny there is a suspicion you have no recollection about?

26:27.000 --> 26:35.000
Well, I have no recollection of thoughts on Sir, and I would say that since he makes no reference to it in his own original charges here,

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
in all probability, it did not happen.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
You won't say definitely that it did not happen. You don't definitely deny it?

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
Nothing. Well, if it's true then, what did you mean by these things?

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
Well, I think what we were discussing then is the change in situation,

26:53.000 --> 27:01.000
a change in by the order that staff members could not talk to shine at the training on weeknight, found at 4.6.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
There is some discussion about Mr. Adams.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
Between Mr. Adams and myself on the change in the weekend and weeknight arrangement,

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
and that discussion continued until we worked out a formula of that,

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
helped us in our work and did not interfere with shine, army training.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
And there certainly might have been discussion about that during this period of time, sir.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Whether it was on December 8th or not, I just don't know.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
All in about the ninth of December, you learned that a weekend has.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
So our shine has been canceled, did you not miss gold?

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
I don't think so, sir. I think that was some period of time before that.

27:38.000 --> 27:44.000
Well, did you learn of the cancellation of a weeknight's case on about December 9th?

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
I don't know, sir. Once again, I thought that was before I might be wrong.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Well, excuse me, sir.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
Now, if you learned sometime about December 9th,

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
what it takes, whether we gain the weeknight,

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
a price for shine and the canceled,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
and that you went to Adams, talked to Adams,

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
and told him that it was just another army or Steven's double-cross.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
No, sir, I don't recall using those words.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
You don't recall using that word double-cross?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
No, sir.

28:17.000 --> 28:23.000
You don't believe you can't swallow that word, you don't even remember the word double-cross.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I do not recall ever having used that word, sir.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Well, what did you say to Miss Adams?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Well, the first time.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Not the cancellation of that price, sir. They were shocked.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
The discussion I had with Mr. Adams was about working at Summer Rangemen,

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
whereby shine could be available to staff members after his training hours

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
and get this work done.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
We worked out in arrangement on November 6th,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
and before that, not arrangement was just fine with us and worked out well.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
When the arrangement was changed and reexamined,

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
it was a question of working out some kind of a new arrangement that was not in the field with this training,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
but which of us an opportunity to get the information and get the work done.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
And I did talk to Mr. Adams, I would say, infrequently, about that, sir.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
And that might have been on December 8th or 9th, or around that period of time.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I certainly don't suspect that.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
But, as it's gone, I again read you from Adam's testimony.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
They 2577 of the records.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
With Adam's December 9th, yes, there,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
the home was aware of this decision on weekdays.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
And he was again getting up regularly from the committee tables,

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
coming over to speak to me about shine's availability.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And he was there, without,

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
to get you in about the decision on week 9.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
He talked to me about Mr. Stevens

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
and considered this a double-cross.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
An army double-cross.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
I've a commitment already made.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
It was a Stevens double-cross.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Now, when you say about that, Mr. Kuhn?

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
I say about that, that's the right, don't recall it.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
And I'm inclined to ask that, but it happened that way,

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
because, again, sir, I'm looking at the specific statements

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Mr. Adams made two months ago,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
and his charges filed March 11th,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
where he gives a completely different version

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
of that conversation.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Well, now you say that you're not too...

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
...mechanism sure about it.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
You get to die?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
No, sir, I will affirm.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Don't be nice.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
No, I will affirm to you, sir, that I did discuss with Mr. Adams.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
And he, rather he discussed with me for it,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
this change in a range.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Mainly that, the weekend, we're going to be shorten,

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
and that week's night passes

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
for a consultation with staff members

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
and work would not be allowed.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
And that there was a question of a readjustment,

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
which would make it possible for us to get our work done,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
and make it possible for shines to continue his training

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
like every other soldier.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
And I word discussions with Mr. Adams about that, sir.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And Mr. Kuhn,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
you recall, Miss Adams,

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
justifying that she was so persistent.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
And Christmas is just an exchange.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Ready?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
This time it's the go-and

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
and talk directly with Senator McCarthy about it.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
You recall that, do you not?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I recall that, that's the money, sir.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
And you recall the fact that he just goes

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
with Senator McCarthy?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I recall the fact that he went to Senator McCarthy,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
not about that, sir.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
I will ask him, Mr. Kuhn, if he didn't attack.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Then when you learn...

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Thank you.
