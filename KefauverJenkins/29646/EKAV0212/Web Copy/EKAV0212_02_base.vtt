00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I don't even think you can say it happened approximately that way.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
What happened, sir, as I recall it is this.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Mr. Adams had a discussion with us after these hearings in Washington on the 8th and the 9th on both days.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
I believe Mr. Adams had the customary discussion with us about when the hearings could be ended.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
And Mr. Kronai told him that he could be done about that.

00:30.000 --> 00:42.000
Mr. Adams on the 9th, sir, went up to seat Senator McCartney and asked Senator McCartney directly whether or not he was not saying about an end of these fort-line miscarried.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
After I heard about that, I remember talking to Mr. Adams about whether it was that day or not.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Now you're asking Mr. Kronai.

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
I left you Senator McCartney didn't tell you that Mr. Adams lifeless talked to him about your interstations for days now.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
He did not, sir. He did not.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
No, sir. They were going to go ahead about it.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
So, Andy, go ahead about it.

01:08.000 --> 01:20.000
After John went up to seat Senator about getting these hearings stopped and talked to him about that, the Senator told somebody who told us about the conversation.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
I remember that Frank Cahren I talked with John Adams about it, sir.

01:26.000 --> 01:42.000
For nothing along the line, I could choose to get. As I recall it, I talked to John first and I told him I asked him about his conversation with Senator McCartney and whether he had had any luck in getting the hearing stopped.

01:42.000 --> 01:51.000
He said that he had not, and as I recall, he said he hoped that I did not mind just having spoken with Senator McCartney about the matter directly.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
Because of course John Adams and I were on one lower level and Senator McCartney and Mr. Stevens were on a higher level.

01:59.000 --> 02:15.000
I think, sir, after Mr. Adams was in the picture if I had wanted to talk to Mr. Stevens about some cooperation or we weren't getting from the Army, I would have gone to Mr. Adams who was on my level and asked him to set up the date and then going along with him to see Mr. Stevens.

02:15.000 --> 02:24.000
Mr. Adams didn't do that with that, but he went right up to see Senator McCartney. As I recall it, Mr. Adams wanted to know if I was annoyed at that.

02:24.000 --> 02:40.000
I was, well, I told him, sir, that as I recall it, that if the table was returned and I had wanted to see Mr. Stevens about something like that, I probably would have called Mr. Adams first and asked him to make the date and going along with Mr. Adams who was on my level.

02:40.000 --> 02:48.000
Because if I didn't do that, sir, I probably would have looked like something of a reflection on Mr. Adams.

02:48.000 --> 02:58.000
Then Mr. Adams told me as I recall it, well, he said as I recall it, I think you're right, but Frank Clark suggested to me that I go up and talk to Senator McCartney.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Frank Clark told me, why don't you go up and talk to the chairman about it? We can't stop the hearings, he can't.

03:03.000 --> 03:14.000
And the matter was dropped right then and there because of he had talked to Mr. Carb at it and Mr. Carb told him to go up and talk to the senator, well, that was certainly fine.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
Mr. Cohen as a matter of fact, he worked without because Mr. Adams had gone over your head and talked to the director of the senator about it.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I think he's just not that much of a question about it, sir.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
You weren't angry about it?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
No, sir, I was not.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
He's not waiting about it now, I didn't think.

03:30.000 --> 03:44.000
And when he swore on these old hairs, both I said to him, like that, he said he would teach me what it meant to go away from it.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
I said to him, Roy, is that a trade and he said no, that is a promise.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
He said I didn't have Mr. Gold, is that really a statement of the imagination of God Adams and his father?

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
Yes, sir, I would say that's probably quite an exaggerated account of something that was not much of an incident at all.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Well, is there any cases that have ever presented?

04:07.000 --> 04:17.000
Yes, sir, I would say that the fact is that Mr. Adams did go to see Senator McCarthy on her passing December 9th about these hearings, I was not alone.

04:17.000 --> 04:30.000
And I think discussed with Mr. Adams some time after that the fact he had to want to see Senator McCarthy and had told him that if tables were turned, I probably would have called him to make the date with Mr. Stevens and he hadn't done that.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
He told me, as I recall, that he had spoken of Frank Carby when I was presented at McCarthy and that Frank Carp's suggestion, he should go up.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
And that was that as far as I was concerned.

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
Did you have an argument with Mr. John Adams about when the week end, a week end starts Mr. Gold?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
No, sir, I did have a suggestion.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
He had a suggestion.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yes, sir. Now what was it?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Sorry, sir, I think that's a place on the Fourth of December.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
I can fix that date pretty well because the friend of mine was in my office and it turns out when I was talking to Mr. Adam.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Did you find revealing the name of that frame that this time?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Sir, I'd rather check with him first and then tell you about it later.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
So I'm sure he would have no objection.

05:11.000 --> 05:21.000
That conversation I think was Friday, afternoon, December 4th, and I did have a discussion with Mr. Adams about when a week end started.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yes, sir.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Well, did you mean the last that there was a disagreement about Tuesday's forums, about when a week end started?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
That was a discussion, sir. I don't think there was so much of it.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
What was this discussion with Gold?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Well, there's a lot of thought that afternoon.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Let's convey it to him now.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Are you sure? Can we please?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm just telling you what that discussion was.

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
The discussion was about changing the time sign would have available to work on the committee report.

05:49.000 --> 05:58.000
He ordinarily had been available after training on Friday and was able to put in a full day Saturday and a full day Sunday.

05:58.000 --> 06:08.000
That arrangement was changed around the beginning of December, so that he was not available until sometimes during the day Saturday, which was a day.

06:08.000 --> 06:18.000
I discussed that with Mr. Adams, sir, and suggested that this was not an accordance with the original arrangement we had made.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Mr. Adams said, well, you're right. We did say weekend.

06:22.000 --> 06:31.000
We have previously interpreted weekend to mean from the end of the day Friday, so the end of the day Sunday or the Monday morning.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
That is whose interpretation was made?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, that was everybody's at the beginning, sir.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Mr. Adams and Aaron.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Did you admit to Adams when you agreed on weekend passes, placing interpretation on what weekend means?

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
No, sir. Actually, we did say I thought and I guess he thought that we assumed that weekend meant from the end of Friday until Monday morning.

06:50.000 --> 07:01.000
So that's what you say weekend means from the end of Friday, our Friday afternoon or the beginning of Friday evenings until Monday morning.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
You let your interviewees know that Monday morning, yes, sir.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I would say that.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I would say that.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
In other words, I might put it in a different way, sir. Saturday and Sunday with these two weekend days.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
And you did have a discussion with Adams about it. He stated in the amounts to an argument by this, sir.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
He put a different interpretation on it, didn't he?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yes, sir.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
He stated, started Saturday noon.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Well, wasn't the question of putting a different interpretation on it, sir.

07:26.000 --> 07:35.000
There was a lot of thought back and forth, and we both agreed that up to that time, both he and I had interpreted to me and had interpreted.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
It, to me, Friday afternoon until Sunday night.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And then there was a change.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And the whole thing got back to, well, what was meant by a weekend?

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
A night that I thought it was meant to be the end of the day Friday until Monday morning, Sunday night.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
And Mr. Adams said that a weekend meant anything, anyone wanted a weekend to me.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And so what's the discussion about that?

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I take it you were wanting to sign after this committee work.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Sure.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
No other purpose.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
No, for no other purpose.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
Mr. Cohn, do you know how many long distance telephone calls you put into?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
How, from yourself?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Two, three, four.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
You got it.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
I did my case.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Do you know how many long distance telephone calls you put into John Adams?

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
On this one day you say, and I, you say this discussion happened on December 4th.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Yes, that's the best I can say.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, oh, as we will accept that as a date.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
How many times did you call John Adams on December 4th long distance about anything?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
About anything?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Well, Mr. Adams said two or three times I think that's about right.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I know that there were two or three topics of conversation, sir.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
And I know that at least two of those topics of conversation required additional phone calls to be made.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
But from me, to Mr. Adams, I would say two or three is probably right.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Well, I want to show you a telephone record.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
You don't have to, Mr. Jenkins.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
He just told me what it is.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I'll tell you what it is.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
I'll show you the record, Mr. Cohn, and he's here for all the fees.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
The record being that on the 4th day of the funders, there were four long distance telephone calls from Mr. Cohn from New York City to John Adams.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Could they say?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, I just examine it and when it was done, it had to be done.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
All right, Mr. Jenkins.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
All right.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Well, is that correct?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I'm not done.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
It's the record.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
And Alex, he missed the call and his great work with reference to what a long, what a, what a, a week-end meeting.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
They were not, sir.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
They were not.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
No, sir.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So why did you call him four times in that row?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Let me tell you what happened that afternoon, sir.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And I'll tell you why there were four phone calls.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I didn't know that I had played more.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
My recollection is that on one of the two of the occasions he had called me back and then I had called him again.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
The record shows that we're all from humans.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Very well, New York City is now.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
I recall that one thing which was necessitated before the phone call was it.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Mr. Adams on that afternoon, sir.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
And I tried this by saying I alleged nothing whatsoever improper on this.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
I'd taken up with me the question of getting fear to take it for his aunt, whose name I recall.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
But don't want to mention here unless you want me to.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I lived in Brooklyn.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
But in Iran, they, in fact, there were two aunts.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
And they lived in Brooklyn and Mr. Adams was going to be New York the next week or the week after.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
And he asked me, he gave me a list of two or three shows.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
And he asked me if I could line up some tickets for one of those shows, number one.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
And if number two, I could call his aunt to some number he gave me out in Brooklyn.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
And agree on an evening with them when they would be available to go with them.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
And agree on the name of the show and get the tickets and let them know.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
And he was planned to be in New York on that particular evening.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
So I recall it, sir.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
And I'm sure of it.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
I play, say, call to his aunt in Brooklyn.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And I play for call.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
I know so fear to take its broker to see whether I could get the particular show.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I think he wanted to see how it's to the Yorkers moon.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I don't think we could get tickets to that.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
I called Mr. Adams back and I brought him up to date on that situation.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
And we discussed some length, further arrangements on that date.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
And I say that little theater party finally came off on December the 6th.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Mr. Cohn did you discuss that?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yes, sir. I thought about that.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
How did you go to school?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
No, sir. I thought that you would discuss any of those school calls at all.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
You said you got it?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Yes, sir.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
Mr. Cohn, you remember Mr. Adams' sister, the only sister to you.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I'm not finished telling you what we got.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm sorry.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
There was one other topic of conversation.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
And that topic of conversation was General Law.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
Mr. Adams talked to me on that occasion about some new allegations against General Law,

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
which Mr. Adams thought might result in his being released of his command

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
in which Mr. Adams thought might have a particular appeal to me in getting me

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
to help Mr. Adams send him a party,

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
agreeing not to make a public issue of General Law and where he leads to this command.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
As a result of certain statements that Mr. Adams made to me,

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
I agreed to check those statements for certain people I knew in New York

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
who might have knowledge of and guess the sort.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
I telephone on that afternoon, sir, to two people I knew in New York

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
who would have knowledge of those statements about General Law.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
And I recall reporting back to Mr. Adams on what those people had to say about General Law.

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
And I also recall making a tentative arrangement to have Mr. Adams see one of those people during the next week.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
And I do recall, sir, that I should spend a substantial period of time talking to Mr. Adams

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
on that particular afternoon about the various subjects.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
I think this guy spent probably an hour and a half or two hours on the phone with Mr. Adams about these subjects.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Mr. Collins said Mr. Pahead, the family member, and the correctness,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
and he may refer to page 25, he says,

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
that on those occasions on December 2, on the 4th of December,

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
millions of same-minded by language-related issues,

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
the peacekeeping presence of the spectators, the radio, or television.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Uncertainable language.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yes, sir.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
That's you, Grady Mike.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yes, sir.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
What about it?

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Well, sir, I am not going to deny that there might be certain things I say,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
and I believe all of us say that we would not say on television.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
As far as using by so-called obscene languages, you can say,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
I talk to faculty all of my friends about that.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
And the consensus of opinion is that if anything I use a good deal rest of the culture,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
it's in most people's clothes.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Who did you?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Did you talk to yourself about it?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Yes, sir.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
You talked to Mr. Wright Holden?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yes, sir.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Mr. Wright Holden's version, I was not one of your friends,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
but he has a language.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
If I had a fan, he'd say,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm out of the fore of it to you, maverick.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yes, sir.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I don't know what he calls a bad word and what he meant, sir.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
I will very freely tell you that on occasion, I might use the word,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
which I would not use here on television.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Who said when you're angry?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
I might say when I'm angry.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I talked to him for 20, so I have a report, Mama.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Wouldn't have to be the only one I'm angry, sir,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
to be when I'm talking to another man.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
And we're talking about something.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
We're talking about somebody we don't like or anything like that.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
It could be on a lot of occasions, sir.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I do want to say this.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
Well, I will very freely admit that I have used words that I would not be prone to receive.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
You have the usual repertoire of bad words that take me to school.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
Well, I would say I would say I have about the usual.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I don't think I have any unique ones in my vocabulary.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I, uh, well, you've never plowed a meal in you, now.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I mean, I don't think I have.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I don't think so, sir.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
And, uh, there are words that I certainly would not repeat on television.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
If, was there anything like superitive or obscene or anything that,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
out of the ordinary or out of normal, I would say definitely not, sir.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
And, Mr. Adams certainly never indicated to me or to anybody else,

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
but he objected to anything which I said to him.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I told him no.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And so when he said,

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
the chooses got shine with him on four occasions on the fourth day of December.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
And, uh, arguably, he went over a prestigious A.V.K.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
And, he used the same vagubrated language.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
He used to say that John Adams for a loosely or falsely.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I would say that, sir.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
And, again, I'm well-staffed to characterize what somebody else says is false.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
That involves a lot of elements of...

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
What did you do?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
We did it. We put it that way.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Yes, yes, sir.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Let's throw it this way if I may, Mr. Jenkins.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
But, rather you do it that way,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
and certainly you're not making it that way.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Sure.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
You know what I said? I think yes, sir.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Yes, sir. We did discuss what's, sir, the weekend, sir.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't believe, and certainly in my opinion,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
I did not then or on any other occasion use Mr. Adams.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
What, I think...

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Well, I don't want to throw anybody else in here.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
But, I think a normal person would regard as by trooperative,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
or obscene, or unusual,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
language-free,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
so guys talking about something.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
I do say, sir, that Mr. Adams has omitted to state a good number of important other things,

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
which was discussed on that afternoon and on other occasions,

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
and has tried to create the impression that just about every time we talked,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
there was all about shine and shine finishing committee work

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
and getting preferential treatment when that just isn't true.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
So, I would say, sir, Mr. Adams, that given an inaccurate picture of what happened

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
on that afternoon.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
What did you talk about the investigation of subversives in the Army?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
So, what I remember thought to note, sir, what I remember, we might very well.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
What I remember, that was the frequent topic of conversation.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
What I remember is what you say, what he says,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I remember the general law of discussion,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
because I had it thought to other people about that and call Mr. Adams back.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
And I checked with those other people and I know that I did talk to them on that afternoon.

17:21.000 --> 17:28.000
And sir, I do know that there was a discussion about his aunt and the state of affairs on that afternoon.

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
So, the fact that I can tell you, sir, is there is a little bit of truth thrown in with an awful lot of permission?

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
The discussion, Mr. Cohn,

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
is that the investigation of the Democratic Committee, the state of Tickets, sometimes I must be treated.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Well, I remember the week-end, sir.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
I remember the general law thing and I remember the state of Tickets for the two ladies from Brooklyn.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
Do you remember this photo will be arrived in New York City on December 17th, he missed home?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yes, sir.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Do you remember what John Adams thought about that?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Yes, sir.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Do you remember that he testified that you were so angry?

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
That he feared for a Senator McCarthy's life and leans?

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
He said that you would commit me, amon him, if you left him alone.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Do you remember that?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Ah, I do.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Where you angry on that occasion?

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
Sir, we had an animated discussion about General Law and animated discussion, sir.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
I don't think Senator McCarthy on that occasion or on any other occasion

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
was the need of bodily protection from Mr. Adams against me or against anybody else.

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
Well, regardless of that, the discussion was quite animated, you say?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yes, there was.

18:48.000 --> 18:58.000
And I suppose Mr. Cohn, does that mean that your temper rose and fell as Mr. Adams says, like the size of the sea is that right?

18:58.000 --> 19:07.000
Sir, I have never made up an emotional shot and I just can't give it vivid a characterization as Mr. Adams.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
And I can tell you, sir, though, the other purpose is here, that there was this lengthy discussion about General Lawton,

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
that I was very much the sir about what they were trying to do to General Lawton, that I was sufficiently disturbed,

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
so that that night I communicated personally with General Lawton, textbook, as to tell him,

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
that they were trying to do it all, and that the next day I took my time to have lunch with General Lawton,

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
aid Lieutenant Corps, to tell him just what Mr. Adams was up to, so I certainly was disturbed about it, sir.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
This Cohn you talked to him about day's shine on medication, didn't you, sir?

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
As I re-evalidate that now positively and in fact, I guess, sir, I'm very...

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
I can certainly deny to you, sir, that that animated discussion was about day's shine.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Well, shine, as I mentioned, as I've Mr. Adams said, as a hearing seeer, that he said,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
let's talk, he kept trying to say, let's talk about shine.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
No, you're not. I think he must very well might have said, let's talk about...

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
What did you talk about, say, no, sir? I don't recall that we did and neither did the senator and neither did Mr. Car.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
I was intent on talking about General Lawton and what they were trying to do to him.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
That's what we did talk about that, sir, and I think about the best proof of that, that that night,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
and you have the phone's list, Mr. Jenkins, I call General Lawton Techward.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
To send words to the general, it's to just what had happened to lunch that day.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
And the next day, sir, December 18th, I had lunch with Lieutenant Corps General Lawton's aide,

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
and I told him what Mr. Adams was trying to do to General Lawton.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
To discuss in that day, sir, it was about General Lawton.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
Mr. Cole and Mr. Adams said to the bad that you cursed me on that day.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Remember that?

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
I heard it said to him, sir. I think he said that I used the use of him.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
I read you, it's like, what he said.

20:49.000 --> 20:56.000
82587 of the records. Mr. Cole became extremely agitated.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
He became extremely abusive.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
He cursed me and then sent a number of times.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
You cursed both me and the senator.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I think he told that wrong about that, sir.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Well, now, a little bit.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yes, sir.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Well, how much?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, I'll try to study how much.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Well, how little?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Try to say that, sir.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
We had an animated discussion about the General Lawton situation.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I don't think he can say that I was disturbed as Senator McCarthy.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
I think it's more accurate to say, sir, that Senator McCarthy agrees with me.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
And that it was Mr. Adams against Senator McCarthy, Mr. Car and myself.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And that's the other way around.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
As far as using, in temperate language or anything like that, I can't once again.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Well, he doesn't say in temperate language.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
He says in plain language.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
So I don't know what Mr. Adams calls plain language.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
He says you Christy.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I don't know what he means by that, sir.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Well, now, Mr. Cole, you know what Christy is.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Well, sir, once again, I suppose we've got to go word by word here.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
I've told you, sir, that I certainly have on occasion, as I assume,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
everybody else here has used some words which he was not.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Want to repeat on television.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
When you're talking to another man, when you're discussing a situation,

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
or when you're discussing someone, you might say something which you don't want to say on television.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
And so you said it's a clear of animation.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm sorry, well, I might have, sir.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Sure.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
And it's going your perfectly capable of becoming quite animated at times.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Who are you?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm sure that I am.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
Nobody sees you being the flagmatic type of person.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
And you're not clear of animation.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Sure.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
You say that you might have used some words that you would not want to repeat it there.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Or tell an agent.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Certainly.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
No, that about you.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
No, that about you.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
No, sir.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Where did you all medication with John Adam Smith?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I had my very well-assured.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Certainly, what have been an appropriate occasion to use some of those words?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
No, but we did.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Yes, sir.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
So I'll take it to that man, Mr. Cohen, you admit that on medication in the period of animation,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
you use some profanity to the counselor for the secretary.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't want to argue with you about what's profanity.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I don't want to argue with you.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm not asking you a question.

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
I will certainly say that I, that that would have been a very appropriate occasion, and I might very well have used words,

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
which I would not repeat here and would not want to hear anyone else repeat here on television, sir.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
And you say it was all centered around general law.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
I do, sir.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
With the signs that you have nothing, whatever to do with it.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
It's his not, sir.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
And that John Adam justifies that it's erroneously me putting it.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
I say he was mistaken, sir.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
I'll eat you further from John Adam, 2588.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
The subject was shan.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
The subject was the fact.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
The thing that Cohen was angry about.

23:41.000 --> 23:49.000
The thing that he was concerned about was the fact that, more, the army was not agreeing to an assignment for shan.

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
And soon, the senator McCrathy was not supporting his staff and his effort to get shan assigned to New York.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
So his abuse was directed partly to me and partly to Senator McCrathy.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Is that true or false, sir?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Sir, I would say Mr. Adam is mistaken.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
About that, the only thing I'm thinking, you say that, sir.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
That's all I want Mr. Jenkins, when you say something is false, you're going into a man's state of mind, into an element of willfulness.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
I would rather say this, or that Mr. Adam's account is not accurate.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
And leave it to the committee, Judge, whether it was willfully inaccurate or whether he's mistaken.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Or you say it didn't happen.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I say it didn't happen.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Committee draw some conclusions.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Now, that's what you think, sir.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Yes, sir.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
There were.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
So, do you remember when Mr. Adam was in false office, over?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Did his mother?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I don't doubt that he did. I don't remember.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And I didn't talk to him when he was there, sir.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Did you inspire anyone to talk to him while he was there?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I did not.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Did you discuss with Mr. Frank Cards?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
A nice ability.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
I was at Mr. Carr calling you, I'm Mr. Carr.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Did you talk to Carr about college?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Not that I recall, sir. No.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Not that you recall.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
No, sir.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Are you in position to deny Mr. Cards?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I'm in position to say, sir. I have no recollection.

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
I've ever suggested to Mr. Carr that he call Mr. Adams and he's in South Dakota.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Did Mr. Carr ever say that he called Mr. John Adam?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I don't recall anything, I'm going to give a few days, right?

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
I don't recall anything.

25:20.000 --> 25:26.000
Did you know or did you ever learn that why John Adams was in South Dakota?

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
I just part of the Christmas holidays.

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
Mr. Frank Cards calling on two different occasions about an assignment for Dave Shines.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
I don't believe that Mr. Carr did call him on those occasions.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
About an assignment for Dave Shines, I believe sir.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Mr. Carr will tell you why he did call him.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
I don't have certain knowledge on the subject.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Since these hearings have come up, I've talked with Mr. Carr about it.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
And I do know why he called him.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Well, did he call Mr. John Adams of Amherst?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
What's that?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Who was that?

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I believe that date has been fixed as January the 19th.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
January 9th?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Yes, sir.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I mean Mr. Carr calling you, Mr. Carr were together were you on that occasion?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
No, sir.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
You were in New York?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Yes, sir.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Mr. Carr and Washington, yes sir.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Did you know that Frank Carr was calling Mr. Adams while he was in New York?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Yes, sir.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
I had him as well he was in Amherst for the purpose of making an act, right?

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I know that Mr. Carr has been trying to find Mr. Adams, yes sir.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I didn't know that Mr. Adams was in Amherst.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
And you were likewise trying to get in location?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Yes, sir.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
What was the purpose of your call that was that of some Medicaid school?

26:36.000 --> 26:43.000
As I think I testified to the last time Mr. Jenkins, that was an occasion when, as I recall,

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
a Chinese commons in New York, this was about a week before the final date on the filing

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
of these reports.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And we were hard to say that China's commons in New York to do his work on them.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
And he had been ordered back to force six to do some kind of duty.

26:57.000 --> 27:04.000
The purpose of my interest in a censor was to see that the facility could be done during the weeknight

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
when he was not available to work on these reports.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
And so that answer, I tried to talk with Mr. Adams.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
I believe I first talked with Carlos and his wife and then I tried to reach him through

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
at him.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
You say you first talked to each other's wife?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Yes, sir.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
On that same day?

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Yes, sir.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
I think so.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Mr. Cohns?

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
You had no intention, whatever, mentioning the name of Dave Chien, Mr. Adams, when you called him in Amherst.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
I had every intention.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I was the only reason I was calling him, sir.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And for what purpose did you say?

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
I say that the purpose of that service to see the Chien under the arrangement we had previously made

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
was available to do the work on the reports over the weekend and that the duty he had he could do

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
stay up next to hours or whatever it was during the weeknight.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
That was the purpose of my course, Mr. Adams and the medications.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
And you called immediately after you had talked to me, sir, and blound?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
No, sir.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
I don't think so.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I don't think I know.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
You called Mr. Cohns, sir.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, I'm your conversation, sir.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
I first talked to Lieutenant Blound, and he told me that they had instructions that Mr. Adams must personally approve

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
any of those things, and I didn't try to get in touch with Mr. Adams.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
Is that conversation with Lieutenant Blound that you had on that day?

28:16.000 --> 28:28.000
A conversation in which you told him that you had a long memory, and was not to get the names of Colonel Ringler and Lieutenant Miller?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
That is that conversation, sir.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
Did you make such a statement as that, Mr. Cohns, and Lieutenant Blound, in that conversation?

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
No, sir. It was not made that way, and I was the glad to explain what did happen.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
You were Lieutenant Blound's testimony?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
I did, sir.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Well, what was that on that occasion, sir?

28:43.000 --> 28:52.000
I called Lieutenant Blound, I believe, on medication about the same problem, whether or not Shine could do this work during the week,

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
and whether they would live up to the arrangements, which Mr. Steven said may,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
making Shine available for finishes subcommittee work over weekends.

29:02.000 --> 29:09.000
I think I explained to Lieutenant Blound that we had just about a week or so left before the deadline filing the committee report,

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
that we were very hard, so that the arrangements had been made for Shine to work on them,

29:14.000 --> 29:21.000
and I wondered whether he couldn't have Shine still his work over on weeknight to stay up extra,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
and if Lieutenant Blound testified here very correctly, so I believe I told him,

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
I didn't care how many times they put him on KP or any other duty or anything else,

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
during weeknight, as long as we had him during the period Mr. Steven said,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
outline to work on these reports.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
That was what I talked to Lieutenant Blound about.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
It was quite a long talk. I had talked to Lieutenant Blound on a number of other occasions,

29:43.000 --> 29:52.000
sir, and we had become somewhat friendly, a writer, and he told me then that the company commander,

29:52.000 --> 30:02.000
who a Colonel, was keen to have a low opinion of Dave Shine, and that there seems to be a great deal of friction about him.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
I then told Lieutenant Blound, sir, as I recall it, an incident which had been related to me about a thing which the,

30:09.000 --> 30:17.000
this Colonel had made about Shine, not about Shine, actually, but about the type of work which this committee was doing,

30:17.000 --> 30:25.000
which would lead one to the conclusion that this gentleman was very much out of sympathy with what we were doing,

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
regarded it as a witch hunt, which is the term that he used, I believe,

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
and I told Lieutenant Blound about that, and it is very possible, sir, that I did say I had a long memory,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
and that I was remembered that Colonel's name, and I know that I did it,

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
passed the name along to remember the staff and asked if it was, but a check he made on this particular Colonel,

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
because he was talking in a pretty peculiar way about the Communist investigation.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
So, he was reading your phone?

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
Well, sir, I'm sorry that his name has been injected into this because it's very possible that there was a misunderstanding about it,

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
and he's entitled to his opinion, but that's still a wise and that is what his name is.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
Well, are you saying that Colonel Ringwear was talking peculiarly about the investigation of Communist,

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
and I'm saying, sir, that Colonel Ringwear had made a statement concerning the work of this committee,

31:15.000 --> 31:21.000
which had been told to private shine by somebody who...

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
What was that statement?

31:23.000 --> 31:28.000
The statement was, sir, that we were engaged in a witch hunt,

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
and that investigation practice were red herringing a long thing along those lines.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
And that statement was conveyed to you by Mr. Dave Cheyenne?

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
And if you say it was for that reason that you said that the name of Colonel Ringwear,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
Ringwear was long linger in your memory?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I might have said I was going to remember the name, yes sir.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Well, now Mr. Colman, you are a Christian man, Jimmy Chinnett.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Is that right?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
I did, sir.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
And you say that you need to be on screen, sir?

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Yes, sir, we have it.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
And still, I...

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Well, I haven't had any disagreement with you.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
As far as you know, it's a high-pact young man of integrity.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Yes, sir.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
How did you, what he say?

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
I think 30509, this is Mr. Brown.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
For sure, it's a bad...

32:13.000 --> 32:20.000
He said that some people have put fiction in very cooperatives.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
But that Colonel Ringwear and Mr. N. Miller had late feelings.
