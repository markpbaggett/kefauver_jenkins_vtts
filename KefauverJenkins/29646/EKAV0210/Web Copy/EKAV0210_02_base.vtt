WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.620
Either by Shine or by anyone who talked to Shine, I think, in November 30th, is that right?

00:05.620 --> 00:10.620
No, I can't quite say that because I know there are certain things, certain written things in the file.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.620
And if you want, I'll have to go ahead and tell you about that.

00:12.620 --> 00:18.620
Because we're either prepared by Mr. Shine or prepared by members of the stock as a result of the conversation with Shine.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.620
Under that category.

00:19.620 --> 00:29.860
Now, Mr. Miss, how long would it take you to go to your files with other members of your stock and a take from the files?

00:29.860 --> 00:32.500
Those number I know that you just told us about.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.300
Oh, I don't know how long would it take, sir, wouldn't take too long, I'm sure.

00:35.300 --> 00:39.460
Where would it be possible, if we had an adjournment?

00:39.460 --> 00:43.140
Why you to go down there now with members of my staff?

00:43.140 --> 00:45.140
And look to your files.

00:45.140 --> 00:52.980
And find out just what has been dictated by Shine's consequential rim of the letter, what have been dictated by him?

00:52.980 --> 00:53.980
No, sir.

00:53.980 --> 00:58.980
I would say it would not be possible in the matter of a few minutes to give you a complete answer to what you want.

00:58.980 --> 01:02.420
I can't give you right now a certain amount of information.

01:02.420 --> 01:03.620
This is a discussion.

01:03.620 --> 01:04.620
Yes, sir.

01:04.620 --> 01:05.620
Yes, sir.

01:05.620 --> 01:08.420
I have what appears to be some emergency call.

01:08.420 --> 01:11.900
I have not had this a few minutes I brought up on Jan.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.620
Would you hold it up for five minutes?

01:13.620 --> 01:14.860
The production of the files.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.860
Sir, would you do that?

01:16.860 --> 01:21.940
By continuing, Mr. Jenkins, I think I can give you a good deal of the information that you want right now.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.940
The main report.

01:23.940 --> 01:24.940
What's going on here?

01:24.940 --> 01:26.540
I'm not going to hold it out of that.

01:26.540 --> 01:27.740
What happened, sir, yes, sir?

01:27.740 --> 01:30.340
I thought the Senate had just made a tactical discussion on this appeal.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.780
I don't think he objected to you interrogating me on this one.

01:32.780 --> 01:40.140
What I have always been known, Mr. Cohen, is whether or not you can produce those documents, papers, writing,

01:40.140 --> 01:44.940
that we're either prepared to date Shine or any of you to resolve any conferences with the U.S.

01:44.940 --> 01:46.460
I would have to switch to November 30th.

01:46.460 --> 01:47.460
Yes, sir.

01:47.460 --> 01:53.820
I would say the outstanding example of all of the three interim reports of the subcommittee, namely,

01:53.820 --> 01:59.500
engineering projects, information centers, and voice of America proper,

01:59.500 --> 02:02.300
was those sections of the annual report.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.500
They have been printed.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.660
They are available.

02:04.660 --> 02:09.220
I have them, and I can produce them for the committee, along with my sworn statement,

02:09.220 --> 02:13.180
that substantial portions of them were written by Mr. Shine.

02:13.180 --> 02:17.900
Well, as we understand it, schools, they were prepared by another person,

02:17.900 --> 02:19.900
I ask you, Shine, in the special meeting, the Army.

02:19.900 --> 02:20.900
No, sir.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.020
And the rise of the Shine, and will that, will that, that?

02:23.020 --> 02:24.020
Yes, sir.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.180
Did he prepare the original Zulu's or what?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.420
Sir, here's what happened.

02:27.420 --> 02:32.820
Before he went in the Army, in anticipation of his going in the Army, Senator McCoy,

02:32.820 --> 02:38.620
he asked the research director of the subcommittee to write these reports.

02:38.620 --> 02:43.420
The research director of the subcommittee prepared those reports.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.420
Now, here's the one sir, have your record.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.420
Mr. Carl Boschweig.

02:46.420 --> 02:47.420
Very well.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.420
Now.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.420
I don't mean to bother you, sir.

02:51.420 --> 02:56.420
These three interim reports, I assume, are in print and could be furnished to counsel,

02:56.420 --> 02:57.420
because they know.

02:57.420 --> 02:58.420
Of course, I'll do that right away.

02:58.420 --> 03:00.420
Would you say I've been ongoing, sir?

03:00.420 --> 03:02.420
Those who have missed the words, who have missed the words?

03:02.420 --> 03:05.420
Julie Ann, I could see, is looking over his shoulder, and his affair is going to go.

03:05.420 --> 03:09.420
These are how those here, Mr. Kohnar, can you be made available very, very, very,

03:09.420 --> 03:11.420
if they're not, we can get them for that.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.420
Yes, sir.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.420
You have to see, you have to get those and bring them to us now.

03:14.420 --> 03:15.420
They didn't need the request.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.420
They weren't allowed to leave the room already.

03:17.420 --> 03:20.420
And now you read enough, you go out and get me your seat.

03:20.420 --> 03:27.420
The Research Director of the Subcommittee was asked by Senator McCarthy to prepare drafts

03:27.420 --> 03:28.420
of all these reports.

03:28.420 --> 03:34.420
The Senator thought that, if I could remove that much of what they had left to do.

03:34.420 --> 03:43.420
He got out a draft of one report, which I believe was all right.

03:43.420 --> 03:47.420
That was on the State Department filing system, if I recall it correctly.

03:47.420 --> 03:52.420
When it came to the report on the information program investigation,

03:52.420 --> 03:56.420
which had been, sir, you must bear in mind, the principal investigation.

03:56.420 --> 04:00.420
When I say principal, I mean in length of time and number of hearings held,

04:00.420 --> 04:04.420
of the Subcommittee during the last year.

04:04.420 --> 04:07.420
It occupied a matter of months public hearings, where hell day in and day out,

04:07.420 --> 04:12.420
the executive session from the day of interviews, from the time of the committee's formation.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.420
Well, they're not even over now.

04:14.420 --> 04:20.420
And on those reports, the Research Director submitted something to Senator McCarthy,

04:20.420 --> 04:24.420
which Senator McCarthy believed was not satisfactory.

04:24.420 --> 04:28.420
The research, we talked to the Research Director and asked if he couldn't redo them.

04:28.420 --> 04:32.420
He said that since he had not been with the Subcommittee,

04:32.420 --> 04:35.420
while all things were going on, he could not do the job.

04:35.420 --> 04:39.420
He said in connection with the State Department filing system, I believe,

04:39.420 --> 04:43.420
that he had worked with the boys on the staff who had handled that investigation.

04:43.420 --> 04:47.420
And that he thought these reports on the information program

04:47.420 --> 04:53.420
should be prepared by Dave Shine, who had done the work on that investigation.

04:53.420 --> 04:57.420
Senator McCarthy read the draft, the Research Director had prepared,

04:57.420 --> 05:02.420
and agreed that they had to be just scrapped and re-done completely.

05:02.420 --> 05:07.420
From that point on, Dave Shine took over that job,

05:07.420 --> 05:10.420
and he did it in substantial pot.

05:10.420 --> 05:12.420
I worked on it with him.

05:12.420 --> 05:15.420
It came down here to Washington, Frank Hall worked over it.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.420
And went back to the Research Director.

05:17.420 --> 05:22.420
It was submitted to the various members of the Subcommittee for comments.

05:22.420 --> 05:25.420
They made changes in it, and the final product evolved.

05:25.420 --> 05:33.420
But that was, I might say, the bulk of work done by Dave Shine during that period of time.

05:33.420 --> 05:39.420
And those reports will be filed with this committee's exception.

05:39.420 --> 05:44.420
I'm sure that, sir. We can do that, sir.

05:44.420 --> 05:46.420
Mr. Clerk.

05:46.420 --> 05:49.420
Mr. Jenkins, there are also the sections of the annual report,

05:49.420 --> 05:53.420
which pertains to these three reports.

05:53.420 --> 05:58.420
In other words, in the annual report, we can have sort of a summary of each interim report,

05:58.420 --> 06:02.420
sort of a summary of each investigation which the Subcommittee had conducted

06:02.420 --> 06:04.420
during the year.

06:04.420 --> 06:09.420
And both particular sections with which Mr. Shine was familiar and which he had handled the investigation

06:09.420 --> 06:12.420
were prepared and caught by him.

06:12.420 --> 06:15.420
And we would have those took for you, too.

06:15.420 --> 06:20.420
And you say you would not be able to submit to the Committee this afternoon any documents

06:20.420 --> 06:27.420
or memorandum prepared by Mr. Shine, subsequent to his induction into the Army,

06:28.420 --> 06:30.420
on the exception of these three reports.

06:30.420 --> 06:36.420
No, sir. I don't say that. I say that in order to do the job you want me to and give you what we can.

06:36.420 --> 06:40.420
I would like to work on it over the weekend or whenever else you want and talk to the staff members

06:40.420 --> 06:45.420
and go through the files and say that we give you what there is there.

06:45.420 --> 06:50.420
I don't think I can do that for you in five or ten minutes and do any kind of an accurate job.

06:50.420 --> 06:54.420
Could you assign one of the members of your staff to his now Mr. Coon?

06:54.420 --> 06:56.420
I don't have to. I'll work on that myself.

06:56.420 --> 06:58.420
I have to.

06:58.420 --> 07:01.420
I missed my last three minutes. I had to.

07:01.420 --> 07:05.420
For a phone call, I have some importance.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.420
You're talking now about the subpoenas.

07:07.420 --> 07:11.420
May I say that from the subpoenas, sir, on...

07:11.420 --> 07:15.420
Well, you're talking about the production of records from our own.

07:15.420 --> 07:16.420
I'm not so much record.

07:16.420 --> 07:21.420
So, suddenly get down to this question, the subpoenas, I've got to leave.

07:21.420 --> 07:22.420
I'll be glad to ask you about it.

07:22.420 --> 07:25.420
I'll be here leaving. I'll be glad to ask you about it.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.420
Mr. Coon, the assembly secretary of the reason I asked this,

07:28.420 --> 07:31.420
is that I'm a friend I'm going to have to leave fairly soon.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.420
I don't really leave before we dispose of this.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.420
The last few accommodates, then, have been discussed.

07:35.420 --> 07:38.420
Mr. Coon, being a new narrator, is the community with you?

07:38.420 --> 07:40.420
On you, is that correct?

07:40.420 --> 07:44.420
The address to the committee, or to myself, I was eating lunch with Senator McCarthy

07:44.420 --> 07:48.420
and your process services arrived on the scene.

07:48.420 --> 07:52.420
I respectfully refer them to the chairman of the committee

07:52.420 --> 07:54.420
and the executive service of the subpoenas.

07:54.420 --> 08:00.420
And it was the subpoenas for these files, or was the subpoenas of the army?

08:00.420 --> 08:04.420
And other files upon which they, Cheyenne, had worked,

08:04.420 --> 08:12.420
and particularly for all documents, data, memory, and the most made by they, Cheyenne,

08:12.420 --> 08:17.420
both before his induction into the army on November 3rd and by I.

08:17.420 --> 08:18.420
Sir.

08:18.420 --> 08:19.420
In substance, exact authority.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.420
The virus is much broader than that.

08:21.420 --> 08:25.420
The Jenkins right there, with core threats to turn over, probably three quarters of all of our files,

08:25.420 --> 08:29.420
take them out of our offices and turn them over to the committee.

08:29.420 --> 08:33.420
It's that all files pertaining to the investigation of the voice of America,

08:33.420 --> 08:37.420
the investigation of, I'm sorry, the overseas information service,

08:37.420 --> 08:42.420
the government printing office, the investigation of communists and subversives

08:42.420 --> 08:48.420
in the army and at fort-mindment, and all other files on which G. David Cheyenne did any work.

08:48.420 --> 08:52.420
In the process, they've very large parts, I suppose, of our file.

08:52.420 --> 08:56.420
I've read the wording of the subpoena and I suppose it speaks for itself.

08:56.420 --> 09:01.420
Now in Mr. Corn's hand you, in association with members of your staff,

09:01.420 --> 09:04.420
examine those various files mentioned in the next opinions.

09:04.420 --> 09:05.420
Sure.

09:05.420 --> 09:14.420
And take their form, everything that constitutes the work of they shine the document.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.420
Yes, sir.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.420
Where you do that?

09:16.420 --> 09:17.420
I'd be very happy to do that.

09:17.420 --> 09:22.420
When, when, when, may the committee expect that information to be forthcoming?

09:22.420 --> 09:26.420
The committee may expect that information to be forthcoming unless something unforeseen happens,

09:26.420 --> 09:30.420
and I'm sure it won't at the beginning of its next session,

09:30.420 --> 09:33.420
which means I'll have to stay down here over the weekend, I'll be glad to do it, though.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.420
There's a press on the satellite.

09:36.420 --> 09:41.420
I want to make it clear that smithricfulness and insurge of the file of the chairman is.

09:41.420 --> 09:45.420
That's why I am supposed to be subpoena, be served upon the chairman.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.420
I'll be glad to work on the job over the weekend for you, Mr. Jenkins,

09:49.420 --> 09:54.420
and try to have this for you the first thing on Monday morning.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.420
And Tuesday morning.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.420
He's tomorrow.

09:57.420 --> 09:58.420
Probably don't sit on Monday.

09:58.420 --> 10:02.420
You say it could not be done higher than that time.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.420
Well, if you'd like us to try, sir, we could stay down tonight,

10:05.420 --> 10:08.420
I suppose, and work as fast as we can, but...

10:08.420 --> 10:10.420
Well, now if it's a matter of that urge, please.

10:10.420 --> 10:13.420
No disposition on my part to working on these hard-keep-of-phone-off.

10:13.420 --> 10:14.420
No, I'll be right back.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.420
I'll be right back.

10:15.420 --> 10:16.420
So, whatever you want.

10:16.420 --> 10:19.420
But what we're trying to find out is the factor in time,

10:19.420 --> 10:23.420
and the extent of the work done by Mr. Shine particularly,

10:23.420 --> 10:26.420
I see, when in the Army on November 3rd.

10:26.420 --> 10:29.420
Well, I will, those styles,

10:29.420 --> 10:32.420
our certain parts of them reflect the work done by the day,

10:32.420 --> 10:34.420
Shine, Hyatton, November 3rd.

10:34.420 --> 10:37.420
I would say the bulk of the matter would be in these reports,

10:37.420 --> 10:39.420
which we can give you to say it to note.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.420
I would say anything else.

10:42.420 --> 10:45.420
In the file, sir, there might be some memorandum.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.420
I know myself of one or two.

10:47.420 --> 10:51.420
One thing just comes to my mind right now concerning a report,

10:51.420 --> 10:55.420
which he has drawn up on the voice of America situation

10:55.420 --> 10:57.420
as of the last few months,

10:57.420 --> 11:01.420
and you will get the bulk of it in the form of these three reports

11:01.420 --> 11:03.420
and the sections of the annual report.

11:03.420 --> 11:07.420
That is the main job he did on the limited amount of time he spent

11:07.420 --> 11:11.420
for us while down at Fort Dix, Mr. Jenkins.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.420
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:14.420 --> 11:20.420
And I make it to the purpose of speaking a decision on this matter.

11:20.420 --> 11:26.420
It is my understanding that it has not expected that all these files,

11:26.420 --> 11:30.420
as such, be turned over upon only that part of the file,

11:30.420 --> 11:36.420
in which Chief David Shine has done some work as evidenced by memorandum,

11:36.420 --> 11:37.420
and I'm very sorry.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.420
I'm sorry, that's all I had to say.

11:39.420 --> 11:44.420
Well, I might say the senator that the convener was very hastily drawn.

11:44.420 --> 11:47.420
I think it was all in the control, and I spoke to him at the time,

11:47.420 --> 11:51.420
and I thought if it's signed with the understanding that he involved,

11:51.420 --> 11:54.420
just thought the council had talked to me about,

11:54.420 --> 12:00.420
and that is the parts of the file which have been prepared by Chief David Shine,

12:00.420 --> 12:04.420
and the main gains of the committee rule against disclosing informants.

12:04.420 --> 12:08.420
It was a possible alright, so I think the wording is broader than the intention.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.420
The argument is very clear to all parties.

12:10.420 --> 12:13.420
Mr. Chairman, do we, may I consider that the convener to demand that

12:13.420 --> 12:16.420
the committee counsel, Mr. Cook, tell us what he is preparing now,

12:16.420 --> 12:17.420
in modified system.

12:17.420 --> 12:18.420
Oh, sure.

12:18.420 --> 12:21.420
We spelled out precisely what all hands actually went through.

12:21.420 --> 12:24.420
That was simply by the job considerate.

12:24.420 --> 12:25.420
There's some in the direction.

12:25.420 --> 12:26.420
Mr. Chairman.

12:26.420 --> 12:27.420
Yes, sir.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.420
Well, it was my first...

12:29.420 --> 12:32.420
We're dealing with the matters here,

12:32.420 --> 12:38.420
which go far beyond the investigation in so far as establishing precedents our concerns.

12:38.420 --> 12:45.420
I do believe that the members of the committee should know what position the chairman of the comment

12:45.420 --> 12:49.420
investigating committee will take in so far as the opinions are concerned.

12:49.420 --> 12:52.420
Why do I like to have that subpoena?

12:52.420 --> 12:56.420
Yes, sir, Senator, I know which we just give to him.

12:56.420 --> 12:59.420
I also have the reports, Mr. Welchman.

13:00.420 --> 13:03.420
Let me say that the subpoena was served on me during the...

13:03.420 --> 13:05.420
Mr. Welch, the reports we should have available.

13:05.420 --> 13:06.420
Yes, sir.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.420
Let me say that the chairman of the subpoena...

13:09.420 --> 13:12.420
Mr. Welch, can you please proceed?

13:12.420 --> 13:13.420
Yes, sir.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.420
Go ahead, Mr. Chairman.

13:15.420 --> 13:19.420
Well, I have the chairman of the bill of the fact that I have...

13:19.420 --> 13:26.420
Well, I don't have the bill to his request that I not take the time that the committee

13:26.420 --> 13:32.420
has interrupted him, and I have done this about here for a day, and then we give the chairman.

13:32.420 --> 13:37.420
I wish you could let us know that the committee may make it mind the hand.

13:37.420 --> 13:40.420
So, though the matter here may be just a matter of...

13:40.420 --> 13:44.420
Well, at first, I will see, just enough, enough to go over this for now, please.

13:44.420 --> 13:47.420
We'll have to go through all the other details.

13:47.420 --> 13:51.420
Well, this afternoon, they were served upon me as subpoena,

13:51.420 --> 14:00.420
which ordered the production of all files, on which shine did any work.

14:00.420 --> 14:03.420
I was confused by that.

14:03.420 --> 14:04.420
I knew that the...

14:04.420 --> 14:08.420
I hate to be drawn for a minute or so.

14:08.420 --> 14:15.420
I knew that the chair of this committee, the science subpoena, as I do,

14:15.420 --> 14:19.420
from the request of his council,

14:20.420 --> 14:22.420
so this is more reflective of the chairman of this committee,

14:22.420 --> 14:27.420
but this subpoena would indicate that we were supposed to bring up to this room

14:27.420 --> 14:30.420
all of the files we had in the committee room.

14:30.420 --> 14:36.420
I was confused by that, because the chair has access to those at any time he wants to have access.

14:36.420 --> 14:45.420
However, Mr. Chairman, we do have a new element introduced into this as of yesterday.

14:45.420 --> 14:48.420
Yesterday, as the chair will recall,

14:48.420 --> 14:54.420
some of the columns were the ranking Democrat member of this committee,

14:54.420 --> 14:57.420
and the unqualified statement.

14:57.420 --> 15:10.420
Now, they thought it was a crime for individuals to give me information about communist and so-pricing this government,

15:11.420 --> 15:18.420
with that they have busy stands for the secret confidential restriction.

15:18.420 --> 15:26.420
It was very clear that we, that my two Democrat friends were here at the table today,

15:26.420 --> 15:29.420
was making on that.

15:29.420 --> 15:38.420
That can mean only one thing, namely that my Democrat friends feel that we should send a jail,

15:38.420 --> 15:44.420
those people who give us the information about draft corruption communism,

15:44.420 --> 15:47.420
rather than those who are guilty of the crime.

15:47.420 --> 15:52.420
In fact, I believe it was suggested by one of my none of the colleagues

15:52.420 --> 15:57.420
that I was guilty of a crime for bringing the attention of people,

15:57.420 --> 16:04.420
which were information about communist infiltration of course in one listening.

16:04.420 --> 16:09.420
Mr. Chairman, that's close to the very serious question of why I'm concerned.

16:09.420 --> 16:14.420
I have a duty to the people who furnished me information,

16:14.420 --> 16:19.420
not to have their names known.

16:19.420 --> 16:22.420
I know that many of them would move their jobs,

16:22.420 --> 16:24.420
to say their names were made public.

16:24.420 --> 16:27.420
I file a complaint some of those names,

16:27.420 --> 16:31.420
and use some of the columns statement,

16:31.420 --> 16:40.420
and he is high on the hierarchy of the Democrat party.

16:40.420 --> 16:44.420
I assume that's my policy decision that means the difference.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.420
I'm not going to say that.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.420
Can I finish this term?

16:49.420 --> 16:51.420
I might have to find a way.

16:51.420 --> 16:55.420
I don't think you are the stock government sending the file, both saying or a dozen things.

16:55.420 --> 16:57.420
The one day that the court of the first business,

16:57.420 --> 17:00.420
it was necessary for him to leave this committee.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.420
The senator from the West Concent,

17:03.420 --> 17:05.420
wants to ask the individual,

17:05.420 --> 17:07.420
what he thinks about his presence,

17:07.420 --> 17:08.420
speaking for myself,

17:08.420 --> 17:11.420
and I'm sure my distinguished colleague from the state of Washington,

17:11.420 --> 17:13.420
who would be very glad to tell him.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.420
This is complicated subject.

17:15.420 --> 17:17.420
The president spoke on it again this morning,

17:17.420 --> 17:19.420
and I would appreciate that.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.420
It's not be taken as a general Democratic policy matter at this time.

17:22.420 --> 17:25.420
Any absence of our senior colleague is sent at the market.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.420
So, my thank the Senate was concerned,

17:27.420 --> 17:29.420
so let me make it out of it.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.420
I just say this,

17:31.420 --> 17:34.420
the chairman, without...

17:34.420 --> 17:40.420
I see no point in order to get some simple information,

17:40.420 --> 17:44.420
which is very relevant to this inquiry,

17:44.420 --> 17:45.420
the charges made it,

17:45.420 --> 17:47.420
we need to go into all these other matters.

17:47.420 --> 17:48.420
But I want to say this,

17:48.420 --> 17:51.420
and Senator McCollum's absence,

17:51.420 --> 17:55.420
that I do not recall that Senator McCollum ever said,

17:55.420 --> 17:58.420
that the giving of information has such,

17:58.420 --> 18:01.420
that it would aid in rooting out communism, corruption,

18:01.420 --> 18:03.420
or what have you or treason,

18:03.420 --> 18:05.420
is wrong.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.420
The whole issue is,

18:07.420 --> 18:11.420
can we prevent individuals who work for the government

18:11.420 --> 18:16.420
who have an open obligation to carry out their orders

18:16.420 --> 18:19.420
to turn over documents

18:19.420 --> 18:24.420
to anyone not authorized to receive this thing?

18:24.420 --> 18:25.420
Now, that's that simple.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.420
Mr. Hoover,

18:27.420 --> 18:30.420
told an individual who had a copy of one of these documents,

18:30.420 --> 18:32.420
according to press account,

18:32.420 --> 18:35.420
that if they were given out, he'd be arrested.

18:35.420 --> 18:39.420
Now, the attorney general is spoken out.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.420
I think the issue is very clear.

18:41.420 --> 18:45.420
I don't see that we need to go into this full question.

18:45.420 --> 18:48.420
Senator McCollum is not here today,

18:48.420 --> 18:51.420
and I think that we ought to try to confine ourselves,

18:51.420 --> 18:57.420
Mr. Chairman, to the specific request for relevant material,

18:57.420 --> 19:00.420
that relates to this input,

19:00.420 --> 19:02.420
in response to the two points of writing,

19:02.420 --> 19:04.420
and then a chair again say this,

19:04.420 --> 19:07.420
that a subpoena was hastily drawn,

19:07.420 --> 19:09.420
as a result of a telephone conversation

19:09.420 --> 19:11.420
which I had with council.

19:11.420 --> 19:13.420
It was brought to my room at a time in the office

19:13.420 --> 19:16.420
and which I will people in the office have pleased,

19:16.420 --> 19:18.420
such continued lunch,

19:18.420 --> 19:19.420
and I signed it,

19:19.420 --> 19:21.420
and I said it seems to me that this,

19:21.420 --> 19:23.420
so he is brought to the office,

19:23.420 --> 19:26.420
and the understanding I had with the council over the telephone.

19:26.420 --> 19:29.420
And I said, if you will interpret it on that basis,

19:29.420 --> 19:30.420
and make it clear,

19:30.420 --> 19:34.420
what we want is what the council had asked for from the witness,

19:34.420 --> 19:36.420
and what I had understood from council,

19:36.420 --> 19:39.420
and then requested by some of the members of this committee,

19:39.420 --> 19:41.420
the member and the documents,

19:41.420 --> 19:43.420
and the data, and the reports,

19:43.420 --> 19:45.420
which are worked on by David Shines.

19:45.420 --> 19:47.420
And if it is done with the understanding,

19:47.420 --> 19:49.420
and I want you to get this point from the mic,

19:49.420 --> 19:51.420
because this clear is what you're talking about,

19:51.420 --> 19:55.420
with the understanding that we are not going to make the names

19:55.420 --> 19:57.420
of any informants public,

19:57.420 --> 20:00.420
and that's going to go beyond the matter of our committee council.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.420
As far as the names of informants are concerned,

20:02.420 --> 20:05.420
I will sign this to Peony, and it will be delivered.

20:05.420 --> 20:08.420
Okay, I just need to speak very quickly, Bob.

20:08.420 --> 20:09.420
Okay, I'll stop. I'm sorry.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.420
You heard me from the police.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.420
I've been waiting for a long month to send her up,

20:13.420 --> 20:15.420
so I'm going to start on my statement.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.420
I'm going to read the phrase in Sherry talking on the point of order.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.420
Mr. Chairman.

20:19.420 --> 20:22.420
The point of order is you know

20:22.420 --> 20:24.420
with an old file in the current interrupts.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.420
Anybody's speech, and you were interrupted by the point of order

20:26.420 --> 20:28.420
made by Senator Simonton. I'm talking about it.

20:28.420 --> 20:32.420
So we are now in the process.

20:32.420 --> 20:34.420
I'll read on the point of order.

20:34.420 --> 20:37.420
We are now in the process of modifying the satini

20:37.420 --> 20:40.420
so it's said in printed form exactly the understanding

20:40.420 --> 20:43.420
that was reached by all the members of the committee,

20:43.420 --> 20:47.420
and by council, which we recognize is not now said

20:47.420 --> 20:49.420
in the form of a satini, so it will keep that in mind.

20:49.420 --> 20:51.420
Maybe we can shorten it colloquially.

20:51.420 --> 20:53.420
I recognize the Senator was conscious.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.420
Can I ask the following, please?

20:55.420 --> 20:56.420
You may.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.420
Why was the satina issued by the council?

20:58.420 --> 21:02.420
And what was the satina supposed to say if it is wrong?

21:02.420 --> 21:05.420
And how soon will it take to make it right?

21:05.420 --> 21:06.420
Which is through every of its law?

21:06.420 --> 21:07.420
One, two, and three.

21:07.420 --> 21:10.420
So, sir, can I finish this, please?

21:11.420 --> 21:13.420
I think I have an answer.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.420
And you go ahead.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.420
I have an Insta-Pini here which I can read.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.420
You should like to have me to finish.

21:19.420 --> 21:20.420
And the McCarthy was being...

21:20.420 --> 21:22.420
I have only got a date number one.

21:22.420 --> 21:25.420
The Senator Simonton raises a question, which is

21:25.420 --> 21:26.420
the Medal of Acer.

21:26.420 --> 21:28.420
The reason the satina was issued,

21:28.420 --> 21:33.420
I believe, was because I received a call in my office

21:33.420 --> 21:37.420
saying that the Democrat members, one of their councils,

21:38.420 --> 21:40.420
took them in our file.

21:40.420 --> 21:43.420
I called Mr. Jenkins the best time,

21:43.420 --> 21:46.420
and if I'm wrong in this way, tell me.

21:46.420 --> 21:48.420
I told him that I would add him all that,

21:48.420 --> 21:52.420
and you, Senator McCorme, statements that the names of informants

21:52.420 --> 21:55.420
were made public.

21:55.420 --> 21:57.420
And if the president might,

21:57.420 --> 22:00.420
I'd have asked him if the operation would be prosecuted,

22:00.420 --> 22:03.420
forgiving the information to some first,

22:03.420 --> 22:05.420
some place in government stands the thought

22:05.420 --> 22:08.420
of a six-foot confidential restrictor.

22:08.420 --> 22:11.420
I told Mr. Jenkins that they would not have access

22:11.420 --> 22:14.420
to the file, but if they would issue a subpoena,

22:14.420 --> 22:17.420
starting for what was needed,

22:17.420 --> 22:19.420
if they could have that,

22:19.420 --> 22:22.420
so the file is the chairman who's concerned,

22:22.420 --> 22:26.420
who's certainly an access to the files Mr. Jenkins did.

22:26.420 --> 22:30.420
I had this subpoena served on me when I was having lunch this noon,

22:30.420 --> 22:32.420
that only young man has served it,

22:32.420 --> 22:33.420
but I...

22:33.420 --> 22:35.420
I had to serve him, Mr. Cohn first,

22:35.420 --> 22:37.420
so I would take the subpoena.

22:37.420 --> 22:40.420
I told him I would not honor the subpoena.

22:40.420 --> 22:44.420
If it was to include the names of informants,

22:44.420 --> 22:48.420
they would go beyond the scope of this investigation.

22:48.420 --> 22:52.420
I then went to the office of Senator McCorme,

22:52.420 --> 22:54.420
and talked to the center above this,

22:54.420 --> 22:57.420
and he and I both agreed.

22:57.420 --> 23:02.420
I believe that the file is subpoenaed to all the files.

23:03.420 --> 23:07.420
That actually all of us properly admissible

23:07.420 --> 23:10.420
where the parts of the files were produced,

23:10.420 --> 23:12.420
but they have signed.

23:12.420 --> 23:15.420
That's all the chairman we would produce, though.

23:15.420 --> 23:21.420
However, Mr. Chairman, I think that today we do have a very important question.

23:21.420 --> 23:23.420
I think the record should be clear,

23:23.420 --> 23:26.420
so that we do not establish a precedent

23:26.420 --> 23:28.420
which will be cited later.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.420
I hope and when some of the files

23:31.420 --> 23:33.420
have subpoenaed the confidential files

23:33.420 --> 23:35.420
of investigating Smith,

23:35.420 --> 23:37.420
because if you could subpoena all of their files,

23:37.420 --> 23:43.420
that will, you would destroy every investigating commit.

23:43.420 --> 23:47.420
So in that connection, Mr. Chairman,

23:47.420 --> 23:51.420
I note the statement issued today by the Attorney General.

23:51.420 --> 23:55.420
I may not say I have no argument with Mr. Bob Brown-Mail.

23:56.420 --> 24:01.420
The last time I met him with a very pleasant meeting,

24:01.420 --> 24:04.420
I had a little bit of respect for him.

24:04.420 --> 24:07.420
I am confused, however, by some of the statements I issued.

24:07.420 --> 24:13.420
For example, if I may quote some of the first stories,

24:13.420 --> 24:18.420
let's see, the trouble of these symbols of it,

24:18.420 --> 24:21.420
so you please do it.

24:22.420 --> 24:33.420
The effect of the executive branch of the government

24:33.420 --> 24:36.420
has a sole and fundamental responsibility

24:36.420 --> 24:39.420
for enforcement of laws

24:39.420 --> 24:44.420
and presidential orders drafted to protect the security of our nation.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.420
Last time, Mr. Chairman, I agree with that

24:46.420 --> 24:49.420
that the executive branch has the responsibility

24:49.420 --> 24:51.420
to enforce the laws.

24:51.420 --> 24:54.420
Over under the reorganization act,

24:54.420 --> 24:59.420
the potential of very little time in the reorganization act,

24:59.420 --> 25:03.420
we tried to clear up this context

25:03.420 --> 25:07.420
as what information the American people could get

25:07.420 --> 25:11.420
on a matter of setup of the government operations committee.

25:11.420 --> 25:15.420
The job of that committee was sold out in detail,

25:15.420 --> 25:19.420
so it was to investigate, draft, corruption, dishonesty,

25:19.420 --> 25:21.420
and efficient in government,

25:21.420 --> 25:24.420
as in the executive branch.

25:24.420 --> 25:26.420
I am disturbed to find that my friends

25:26.420 --> 25:29.420
are the executive field.

25:29.420 --> 25:34.420
This duty we have to expose what they are doing,

25:34.420 --> 25:36.420
that this duty is interpreted by them

25:36.420 --> 25:40.420
to mean that we are trying to tell them what to do.

25:40.420 --> 25:44.420
That is strictly not true.

25:44.420 --> 25:46.420
We are trying to make another benefit

25:46.420 --> 25:50.420
in the outer hiss case.

25:50.420 --> 25:53.420
Mr. Chairman,

25:53.420 --> 25:55.420
with the right front,

25:55.420 --> 26:00.420
it's simply possible for saying that a traitor was sent to jail.

26:00.420 --> 26:06.420
We have people in the executive who have followed

26:06.420 --> 26:11.420
the admonition that was laid out this morning

26:11.420 --> 26:14.420
and the same man from the State Department

26:14.420 --> 26:17.420
or some part of the executive had not wrapped on the door

26:17.420 --> 26:20.420
of the chairman at around 2.30 in the morning

26:20.420 --> 26:23.420
and given him information.

26:23.420 --> 26:30.420
Mr. Kiss might well now be an assistant secretary of state.

26:30.420 --> 26:33.420
So I want to make a clear with the chairman

26:33.420 --> 26:37.420
to provide some cleaners that concern.

26:37.420 --> 26:40.420
The mayor is ordered not to produce any materials

26:40.420 --> 26:44.420
from the file under any circumstances

26:44.420 --> 26:47.420
until I have been consulted.

26:47.420 --> 26:53.420
So any subpoena served upon them and served upon me.

26:53.420 --> 26:56.420
Now I may say that the chairman of any information

26:56.420 --> 26:59.420
in the file having to do with this counterverfactor

26:59.420 --> 27:02.420
will be available to the chairman,

27:02.420 --> 27:04.420
will be available to all the members

27:04.420 --> 27:08.420
of the committee.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.420
However, Mr. Chairman,

27:11.420 --> 27:13.420
I do have a very serious problem

27:13.420 --> 27:15.420
and I'd like to take it up.

27:15.420 --> 27:19.420
At the earliest possible moment next week,

27:19.420 --> 27:22.420
we'll start investigating tonight.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.420
The very serious problem.

27:24.420 --> 27:26.420
So just what I can do now,

27:26.420 --> 27:33.420
in view of the position my democrat friends have taken,

27:33.420 --> 27:38.420
that is that they think the prime of the criminals

27:38.420 --> 27:43.420
are those to give us information about time

27:43.420 --> 27:47.420
rather than the guilty parking.

27:47.420 --> 27:50.420
Up at this point I've taken a position that all of my files

27:50.420 --> 27:54.420
were widowed to all members of the committee.

27:54.420 --> 27:57.420
However, I have a heavy duty to the people

27:57.420 --> 28:00.420
who give us information.

28:00.420 --> 28:04.420
Yes, we didn't get information from all of our government employees.

28:04.420 --> 28:08.420
We respect their oath for the prime of the meat one son of Trumman.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.420
We offer our federal employees,

28:10.420 --> 28:12.420
if they were to fund the United States

28:12.420 --> 28:16.420
to give us all an amuse for and the message.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.420
And let the take this obligation fully

28:18.420 --> 28:21.420
without any mental reservation.

28:21.420 --> 28:23.420
And I say, Mr. Chairman,

28:23.420 --> 28:27.420
that I have instructed in that number of those employees

28:28.420 --> 28:32.420
that they were in duty bones to give me information,

28:32.420 --> 28:34.420
given also a little bureaucrat

28:34.420 --> 28:39.420
have sent a secret to protect himself.

28:39.420 --> 28:41.420
If I am wrong,

28:41.420 --> 28:45.420
I would like to get the committee advice from that.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.420
I still advise all of those employees

28:48.420 --> 28:50.420
that anything they've given me in confidence

28:50.420 --> 28:54.420
will be treated in confidence.

28:55.420 --> 28:58.420
Of course, I just, what I can do now,

28:58.420 --> 29:01.420
and I'm very mis-confused with it,

29:01.420 --> 29:06.420
what I can do now by way of giving my democrat colleague

29:06.420 --> 29:11.420
to all the information they should get at the same time.

29:11.420 --> 29:14.420
Not giving my democrat friends any information

29:14.420 --> 29:17.420
which will allow them to do,

29:17.420 --> 29:20.420
but some of them are told them to just be done the other day,

29:20.420 --> 29:23.420
namely sent to jail,

29:23.420 --> 29:26.420
or they give them information.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.420
And as one final word,

29:28.420 --> 29:31.420
I know you're getting an un-easiness on rejection,

29:31.420 --> 29:33.420
I know you'll give one minute to get.

29:33.420 --> 29:36.420
As one final word, Mr. Chairman,

29:36.420 --> 29:38.420
I want to take it all up to you,

29:38.420 --> 29:40.420
be with the time of the response and do that again,

29:40.420 --> 29:41.420
another early to the chance,

29:41.420 --> 29:43.420
and then we can't ask you if you're not going to have time

29:43.420 --> 29:45.420
to examine the weapon.

29:45.420 --> 29:47.420
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Farm,

29:47.420 --> 29:49.420
one important thing for examining any weapon,

29:49.420 --> 29:50.420
Mr. Columbus,

29:50.420 --> 29:52.420
setting it available here,

29:52.420 --> 29:56.420
this is the first and the first thing we'll do with the files,

29:56.420 --> 29:58.420
I know there will be an attempt,

29:58.420 --> 30:01.420
as I read this new unknown to the chair,

30:01.420 --> 30:05.420
to get files which are given in to the performance,

30:05.420 --> 30:08.420
and I merely want to serve notice now, Mr. Chairman,

30:08.420 --> 30:11.420
because while I will give my democrat colleague

30:11.420 --> 30:15.420
every piece of information which I possibly can,

30:15.420 --> 30:17.420
that their position,

30:17.420 --> 30:20.420
taken official in yesterday,

30:21.420 --> 30:23.420
that they want to send the jail,

30:23.420 --> 30:25.420
a chairman of the committee,

30:25.420 --> 30:28.420
I'm not worried about that.

30:28.420 --> 30:30.420
A chairman of the committee,

30:30.420 --> 30:33.420
has their students for full use of,

30:33.420 --> 30:38.420
and the good-wild people in government give me information.

30:40.420 --> 30:45.420
First thing, a position of having to refuse my democrat friend,

30:45.420 --> 30:48.420
there's any information from the floor

30:48.420 --> 30:52.420
that allows the names of the performance period.

30:52.420 --> 30:56.420
Mr. Chairman, I request you all in response to the parliamentary inquiry

30:56.420 --> 31:00.420
raised by a Sunday time and in response to the statement made by

31:00.420 --> 31:02.420
Dr. Montgomery.

31:02.420 --> 31:07.420
As of, there was no collusion on the part of any of the members

31:07.420 --> 31:09.420
of this committee democrat or otherwise,

31:09.420 --> 31:11.420
in connection with Mr. Teeny,

31:11.420 --> 31:14.420
from the standpoint of the information

31:14.420 --> 31:17.420
and the informants being given out publicly.

31:17.420 --> 31:21.420
Mr. Chair has stated that he was advised on the telephone

31:21.420 --> 31:23.420
by councilors, about what was wanted.

31:23.420 --> 31:26.420
He was Mr. Teeny, which I say was brought in

31:26.420 --> 31:28.420
and was intended to be,

31:28.420 --> 31:30.420
he said it should be issued without understanding.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.420
Unfortunately, the probability of a man who issued this service

31:33.420 --> 31:35.420
didn't have those information in mind.

31:35.420 --> 31:38.420
We now have a committee which does exactly what,

31:38.420 --> 31:40.420
was desired by the members of the committee.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.420
I think it does everything that any member of the committee wants

31:43.420 --> 31:45.420
and the chair proposes to read.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.420
This particular situation.

31:47.420 --> 31:50.420
The Senate is investigating to the Senate investigation subcommittee

31:50.420 --> 31:52.420
of the committee on government operations

31:52.420 --> 31:55.420
and Mr. Roy M. Conn.

31:55.420 --> 31:56.420
The suitor, Laugh Polatory,

31:56.420 --> 31:59.420
you are hereby commanded to appear before the Senate

31:59.420 --> 32:02.420
come the subcommittee on investigations of the committee.
