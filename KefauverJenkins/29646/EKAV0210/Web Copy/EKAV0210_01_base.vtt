00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
I would like to start here by welcoming the guest who has come here to the committee

00:09.360 --> 00:15.120
room that has been on and to solve your attention to a standing rule of the committee.

00:15.120 --> 00:21.520
To the effect that there ought to be no manifestations of a proof of end of the matter.

00:21.520 --> 00:27.280
May I say that the uniformed officers that you see before you and the trained persons

00:27.280 --> 00:30.800
in the audience have standing instructions on the committee.

00:30.800 --> 00:36.480
To escort some of the room politely but immediately and without arguments.

00:36.480 --> 00:43.440
Any of our guests who desire to violate the terms of which you entered the room

00:43.440 --> 00:48.800
to disrupting the hearings by all of them making manifestations of a proof of end of the proof.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.560
They share their not-anticipated, they're going to have any difficulty with this.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.040
Overflow arguments is that known because all previous audiences have been magnificent.

00:57.360 --> 01:02.080
But he thinks that you should tell our guests now of that firm rule out the committee.

01:03.440 --> 01:07.360
Share that one present piece of information during the lunch hour he'd like to read to make his

01:07.360 --> 01:12.880
comments and all members of the participants feel a little better. Mr. Fulton Lewis Jr.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.960
called me on the phone and said that mutual drug trafficking company had been conducting a

01:16.960 --> 01:21.680
poll as to whether the hearings were in fact worthwhile or not.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.640
Said they received 149,895 pieces of mail.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.040
Do you believe that the hearings have been a good thing for the country?

01:31.040 --> 01:35.120
Yes, 15,930. No,

01:35.120 --> 01:41.280
33,965. Do you believe that the hearings should continue until all the facts are on the record?

01:42.160 --> 01:47.200
Yes, 1474. No, 42,000.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.400
I thought I was really proud he had to know my colleagues might like to know

01:50.480 --> 01:55.760
and our participants said there are people at least who believe perhaps useful and valuable

01:55.760 --> 01:58.720
information is flowing out to the country as a result of the hearings.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.000
Council Jackson, you are inculcating Mr. Scott.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.440
He's combed my way of a brief recapitulation.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.600
You say that Mr. Cheyenne came to the committee in early February 1953?

02:10.960 --> 02:14.560
What about the news that I think so, sir? The racket which all the exact right we can get

02:14.560 --> 02:19.040
that for you. And that it was known by the staff that you would be and inductee or adeptee

02:19.040 --> 02:22.560
in early July. He was eligible to July on.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.040
And at that time he had passed his physical.

02:25.040 --> 02:32.720
Yes, not Mr. Kong. From the time he came to the staff in, we would say,

02:32.720 --> 02:35.120
30th in the air, approximately the first half of the way.

02:36.400 --> 02:40.800
At that time he was inducted in the Army on November 3rd.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.080
He worked on certain specific styles as we understand from your system under this one.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.760
No, sir. He didn't. There was also a thing in them working on file.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.440
The suggestions the way it would go is that he would work on investigation and

02:54.160 --> 02:58.720
we have hundreds and I told over a thousand files the only more stories and investigations

02:58.720 --> 03:03.040
about the subcommittee. He did as far as I know, no specific work on a file.

03:03.040 --> 03:07.600
They were. I thought he worked on investigations with respect to certain

03:08.320 --> 03:12.960
individuals or certain areas of inquiry. We'll put it that way.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.200
This is the voice of America. No doubt about that. No doubt about that.

03:17.200 --> 03:23.920
No, not specifically. What other areas of investigation were worked upon by Mr. Chang?

03:23.920 --> 03:27.440
I couldn't give you completely accurate answer Mr. Chang, because I can't tell you.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.920
Today tremendous amount of work on the voice of America and the information agency.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.800
Can point as we go.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.400
Yes, most of America is number one.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.040
Sure. Number two, you would list the file.

03:39.360 --> 03:44.480
Well, when I say voice of America, I got to clarify it this way.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.680
I mean the United States information agency and its activity.

03:47.680 --> 03:53.760
The voice of America is the one of five subdivisions of the information agency.

03:53.760 --> 03:58.480
We investigated not only the voice of America, but the other four subdivisions as well.

03:58.480 --> 04:06.240
I am sure there are large number of files referring upon the other four beside the voice of America.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.400
So we might call it information program.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.640
The information program, right?

04:10.640 --> 04:14.240
Having basis five different areas of investigation.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.400
Yes sir, the voice of America, the board kept in close the international press service,

04:18.400 --> 04:24.560
international motion picture service, the exchange program and the information center program,

04:24.560 --> 04:25.680
I believe, of the five.

04:25.680 --> 04:30.960
Do you have a time Mr. Croomon to choose the five subdivisions?

04:31.040 --> 04:35.360
I am sure we don't, and again I am just really asking about this.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.160
I am sure we don't have five files that are not on each of these things.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.520
We do have one problem.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.800
No, we probably have one.

04:40.800 --> 04:49.360
That is maybe 50, 75, 155 files relating to the investigation of the information program

04:49.360 --> 04:50.480
and its five subdivisions.

04:50.480 --> 04:57.920
I think there might be files on witnesses, files on projects, things along those lines.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.480
And that is a great number of files on these maps.

05:00.480 --> 05:05.120
But now the general topic is the information program.

05:05.120 --> 05:05.920
Yes sir.

05:05.920 --> 05:11.360
And that in basis at least five different areas of investigation.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.160
It does sir.

05:12.160 --> 05:19.760
And Mr. Croomon, that's, that's, that's, you're not having one general file covering the information program.

05:19.760 --> 05:20.880
I don't believe so sir.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.960
I don't, I don't think I'll have to be possible.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.960
Who says you're filing down there?

05:24.960 --> 05:25.760
I don't know sir.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.520
I assume that the girl who went under the supervision of thank God.

05:32.160 --> 05:38.560
Will you want some information pertaining to the information investigation?

05:38.560 --> 05:43.040
You asked someone to blame the him a file on that subject you did not ask.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.080
Well, when I went information sir, I was usually asked Mr. Cah,

05:46.080 --> 05:51.680
Jim Juliano, one of the investigators, and say I assume we'll go to the file or whatever

05:51.680 --> 05:55.040
else it might be, and give it to me.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.480
I am members of the staff.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.440
Yeah, members of the staff.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.280
And if you want a certain definite specific piece of information,

06:02.080 --> 06:06.400
with respect to that particular subject, you usually ask Mr. Cah,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.880
or Mr. Juliano, are other members of your staff?

06:08.880 --> 06:10.000
I think that's true.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.400
I might ask Francis men, or one of the girls in the office that

06:14.400 --> 06:16.320
spend to us around what I want.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.200
Then either Francis, Mrs. Francis me.

06:19.280 --> 06:25.840
I'm Mr. Juliano, I'm Mr. Cah, with no interest in the particular data

06:25.840 --> 06:27.040
that you asked for.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.240
That's correct, isn't it?

06:28.240 --> 06:30.880
Well, I, somebody would be able to find it there.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.240
Let me get.

06:36.480 --> 06:41.280
Both of the persons that I sent were done in that bin on the bridge.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.680
Now I think it's going to be very funny to find out if anyone

06:46.240 --> 06:47.200
chose the morning.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.840
And therefore I have a subpoena here,

06:49.840 --> 06:51.280
and I like that search today.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.720
So both involved can give it to the management and thought of a weekend.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.040
It's a subpoena, so I'm submitting the chair for the request of the finance.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.440
It's directed to the department of the Army,

07:04.160 --> 07:06.400
the Robert Key Street, and the secretary of the Army,

07:06.400 --> 07:07.760
signing on Washington DC.

07:09.040 --> 07:13.200
It's made in order to produce all files containing material relating to the Army

07:13.200 --> 07:15.840
charges like the one in court of London,

07:15.840 --> 07:17.040
the very first case.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.840
And to the proposed removal of J.D.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.080
of London from the Command of Court of London in Jersey.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.240
And otherwise, it's pertaining to unsavable actions in general.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.920
I want to hand this to the chairman, and the request of this

07:31.920 --> 07:35.600
being signed so that we may have this material for me come back here to the wine.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.760
So, please receive this, Mr. Mayor.

07:47.760 --> 07:54.240
Then, this call, please, if we should not ask for certain data

07:54.800 --> 07:58.560
pertaining to this one general subject of investigation,

07:59.600 --> 08:05.600
you could call it out of the file, either yourself or to me, Mr. Ujana or Mr. Kaur.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.640
So, if there are any documents you want,

08:09.360 --> 08:10.640
and direct me to propose them,

08:11.280 --> 08:14.560
I will go downstairs, go to the files,

08:14.560 --> 08:17.840
and rather, if there are any papers or anything else you might want,

08:17.840 --> 08:21.520
it might be, and we will be glad to give you whatever we have,

08:21.520 --> 08:23.600
so we will update the direction of the committee.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.440
Now, I want you now, Mr. Kohn to throw the members of the committee

08:27.920 --> 08:30.640
about other areas of investigation, Mr. Shind,

08:30.640 --> 08:34.640
directed his activities to some of the time he was with the committee

08:34.640 --> 08:36.800
and from the time of his induction in the Army.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.800
Yes, sir.

08:38.800 --> 08:42.800
He worked on a white spot one way or another,

08:42.800 --> 08:46.800
a food number of the committee's investigations, Mr. Janken.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.800
He worked on various preliminary investigations of the committee,

08:50.800 --> 08:54.800
and in particular, he was Mr. Shind.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.800
Well, the news is in his account,

08:56.800 --> 08:58.800
and the attention of the black dress,

08:58.800 --> 09:02.800
they subpoenaed his directives to the material concerning the Jain,

09:02.800 --> 09:06.800
and you want him, I know he's been referred to as Mr. Kohn.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.800
Can you come over to the office to be here?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.800
Yes, may the general, may the general,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.800
please, what?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.800
Mr. Kohn, Mr. Kohn, Mr. Kohn.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.800
Great, thank you very much.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.800
So, I'm going to explain, I'm asking you to name all of the general subjects

09:20.800 --> 09:24.800
about which Mr. Shind worked on the time he was in induction.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.800
From the time he went with the staff until the statement was in the...

09:26.800 --> 09:30.800
Yes, sir, I would say that he worked on a good number of the committee's

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
preliminary investigations.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.800
Mr. Janken, he worked on a number of informants for the committee.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.800
In other words, he would be the contact man between the committee

09:39.800 --> 09:43.800
and a number of witnesses or informants who are furnishing information

09:43.800 --> 09:47.800
through the committee on various matters which might or might not

09:47.800 --> 09:51.800
resolve in investigation into preliminary investigations.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.800
To give you a better picture of this, Mr. Janken,

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
we get down at the committee,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.800
and Senator McCawsey, particularly, gets up in his office.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.800
A tremendous amount of mail, a tremendous amount of material,

10:03.800 --> 10:05.800
furnishing information, furnishing leads,

10:05.800 --> 10:08.800
suggesting that certain witnesses be contacted,

10:08.800 --> 10:11.800
people are coming in every day in the week with information.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.800
And that is referred to various staff members,

10:14.800 --> 10:17.800
and sometimes it will result in something more,

10:17.800 --> 10:20.800
sometimes it's a result in nothing.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
And it's a very busy office,

10:22.800 --> 10:25.800
and there is just a tremendous volume.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.800
So, for instance, I'm sure that at the present time there must be

10:29.800 --> 10:34.800
a hundred or so, and I'm guessing it's the exact figure,

10:34.800 --> 10:37.800
preliminary investigation underway,

10:37.800 --> 10:39.800
which various people are working on,

10:39.800 --> 10:41.800
I have furnished information about.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.800
It's a very broad area,

10:42.800 --> 10:46.800
and it is very difficult for me to just go down a list.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.800
I can name some for you if you can get out me to that.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.800
But among other things, Mr. Shange,

10:51.800 --> 10:53.800
it was to discuss,

10:53.800 --> 10:55.800
fact thought interview,

10:55.800 --> 10:57.800
or in therapy, a number of witnesses,

10:57.800 --> 10:59.800
which I believe you said this morning,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.800
numbered into the hundreds.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.800
It's very, very well done.

11:03.800 --> 11:04.800
Yes.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.800
And so Peter was served upon me this noon.

11:07.800 --> 11:12.800
I have an ask my 4,000-year's,

11:12.800 --> 11:14.800
man, if we couldn't qualify,

11:14.800 --> 11:17.800
just thoughts as in that so,

11:17.800 --> 11:19.800
Peter, but it will be honored by me,

11:19.800 --> 11:23.800
what will happen to the guide of the material that is the penance.

11:23.800 --> 11:28.800
And the deal of fact that we are trying this before I am

11:28.800 --> 11:31.800
other large jury at jury of 30 Minions,

11:31.800 --> 11:34.800
I think maybe that we should qualify that Mr. Daisy,

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800
that we said,

11:35.800 --> 11:37.800
there are certain restrictions

11:37.800 --> 11:40.800
upon what a fellow Mr. Cohn can produce,

11:40.800 --> 11:44.800
the files, like that.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.800
I think we should clarify.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.800
Yes, very well.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.800
I am just going to have a message about the production of any files yet.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.800
I am trying to find out the fact or worth the Mr. Shange,

11:55.800 --> 11:57.800
and we now understand,

11:57.800 --> 11:58.800
and we understand,

11:58.800 --> 11:59.800
we're just in the morning.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.800
But among other things, it was a bit of a meeting

12:02.800 --> 12:04.800
and a very good meeting with Mr. Cohn.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.800
Yes, sir.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.800
One ring into the hundreds, I believe you say.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.800
I believe that's safe, and it's an accurate one, sir.

12:09.800 --> 12:10.800
Yes, accurate?

12:10.800 --> 12:11.800
Yes, sir.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.800
And our informants,

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
do you think they exist?

12:13.800 --> 12:14.800
No, I'm not.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.800
In respect to the interview of those witnesses.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.800
Well, I would say it's in a couple of stages,

12:20.800 --> 12:21.800
and I'm not mistaken,

12:21.800 --> 12:23.800
there are undoubtedly some memorandum.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.800
There are other things which are known for I call,

12:26.800 --> 12:29.800
and you might have a definition for it, file free.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.800
It was thought, John Jones,

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
not only would you interview a witness,

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
and then after a while,

12:34.800 --> 12:36.800
sometime later, before you call the witness,

12:36.800 --> 12:38.800
an executive session or public session,

12:38.800 --> 12:39.800
you get up a list,

12:39.800 --> 12:40.800
sheet of paper,

12:40.800 --> 12:41.800
which would say,

12:41.800 --> 12:43.800
we'll testify as follows.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.800
I am an engineer at the Voice of America.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.800
I went with the Voice of America,

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
such and such here,

12:49.800 --> 12:51.800
and such and such day to came to my attention

12:51.800 --> 12:53.800
that they were building a transmitting station

12:53.800 --> 12:55.800
in an area where it wouldn't work,

12:55.800 --> 12:57.800
and I complained about it,

12:57.800 --> 12:58.800
and they wouldn't do anything about it,

12:58.800 --> 13:00.800
or so and so as the communists

13:00.800 --> 13:01.800
and things along those lines.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.800
And Charles Wries were drawn up,

13:05.800 --> 13:06.800
and I believe on a number of occasions,

13:06.800 --> 13:08.800
such Charles Wries were punished.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.800
The number is handed out,

13:09.800 --> 13:11.800
the members of the Trump Committee,

13:11.800 --> 13:13.800
prior to the appearance of the witness before the Committee.

13:13.800 --> 13:14.800
In other words,

13:14.800 --> 13:17.800
before the witness was come before the Committee,

13:17.800 --> 13:18.800
it meant the shine,

13:18.800 --> 13:19.800
or somebody else would pass out

13:19.800 --> 13:21.800
for the end of the Trump Committee,

13:21.800 --> 13:22.800
the trial rate,

13:22.800 --> 13:25.800
or it's enough that's another case of the general area

13:25.800 --> 13:27.800
that the witness might cut.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.800
And I'm sure that our file,

13:29.800 --> 13:30.800
for sure, is done in the office,

13:30.800 --> 13:33.800
which contains a number of those trial rates,

13:33.800 --> 13:34.800
memorandum, or other notes,

13:34.800 --> 13:35.800
and things of those times.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.800
In short, when you interview a witness,

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
usually he is.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.800
Remember, I'm the archived dean,

13:39.800 --> 13:40.800
part of the office,

13:40.800 --> 13:42.800
which is whatever he wants to call it.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.800
Which contains the name of the address of the witness with him.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
On occasion, definitely sir.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.800
And the ace of the office,

13:48.800 --> 13:50.800
I don't know if the information,

13:50.800 --> 13:52.800
imparted to him by that witness.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
Yes, it is.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.800
A lot of the occasions,

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
for that was done.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.800
Now those are memorandum,

13:56.800 --> 13:58.800
usually prepared by Mr. Shine,

13:58.800 --> 14:00.800
while he was with the trial.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.800
All prepared by others on the start

14:02.800 --> 14:05.800
as result of their concerns with Mr. Shine.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.800
That's right, he knows.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.800
As a general proposition, Mr. Jenkins,

14:09.800 --> 14:11.800
I...

14:11.800 --> 14:13.800
It's awfully long for me and a couple of answers

14:13.800 --> 14:15.800
to try to get a picture of the way the whole office runs

14:15.800 --> 14:17.800
and the fighting of work that's done there

14:17.800 --> 14:19.800
and the way in which things are done.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
The old position of purpose is here,

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
I think that's the case.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
I think that's the case.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
I think that's the case.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.800
And I believe you stated this morning that in some instances,

14:26.800 --> 14:28.800
there was no big situation or no memorandum,

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
prepared by Mr. Shine.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
That's true, sir.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.800
He said that information in his case.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.800
That's true.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.800
Including the name of the witness.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.800
That is, he's a informer.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.800
There are some instances in which he carried in his head.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.800
There are others in which a file might contain

14:41.800 --> 14:45.800
a list of 12 witnesses without any reference

14:45.800 --> 14:48.800
to what those witnesses know or what they are able to say.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
And there is just no such answer.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.800
And I'm Mr. Cohen,

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
both memorandum, that's prepared by Mr. Shine.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.800
And I'm talking about the ones that he stated

14:55.800 --> 14:57.800
that prepared or supervised

14:57.800 --> 14:58.800
from the tiny red with the committee

14:58.800 --> 15:00.800
and from the induction into the army.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.800
I am the files with this committee,

15:03.800 --> 15:05.800
in this room, but not in this room, sir.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.800
I believe in this room.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.800
Yes, I believe that's the best.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.800
I know, but they all went right down there.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.800
Now, when Mr. Cohen answered he was inducted in the army,

15:14.800 --> 15:19.800
he had certain minutes and nights, certain weeks and nights all.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.800
Yes, sir.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.800
And certain weekends all.

15:22.800 --> 15:23.800
Yes, sir.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.800
And that was for the purpose of the evening,

15:25.800 --> 15:26.800
him to do committee work.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.800
Was it not?

15:27.800 --> 15:28.800
It was, and he did.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.800
And he did do that.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
He did, sir.

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
Mr. Cohen.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.800
During that period of time in Spain,

15:34.800 --> 15:37.800
you were getting information from him

15:37.800 --> 15:41.800
that he had acquired prior to his induction in the army.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.800
That's right, sir.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.800
And I think it's the memorandum of such information

15:46.800 --> 15:47.800
was prepared.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.800
Let me introduce you this way, Mr. Jenkins.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.800
Yes, this is the way it was all.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.800
There are, again, a number of categories.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
I know that I, on occasion,

15:55.800 --> 15:56.800
let me give you one example if I made it.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.800
That's the question, which might be helpful.

15:58.800 --> 16:02.800
There was a man, or was it one of Mr. Shine's contacts in New York,

16:02.800 --> 16:07.800
who had information on radar and on the giving of radar

16:07.800 --> 16:09.800
secrets to the Russians and to the communists.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.800
And very important information.

16:11.800 --> 16:16.800
That man had been referred to Mr. Shine by an assistant secretary

16:16.800 --> 16:19.800
in one of the presidents' executive departments.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.800
Mr. Shine talked with that man.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.800
I don't know how many times he talked with him,

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
but he got a certain amount of information.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.800
At the time he had seen the information,

16:29.800 --> 16:32.800
we decided not to use it in that particular time.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.800
There came a friend, Mr. Shine, within the army.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.800
There came a time when we wanted to use that information.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.800
I tried to contact that man.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.800
He would not talk to me at that point.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.800
Certain things were developing.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.800
I remember that senator Murray reported back to Senator McCarthy,

16:48.800 --> 16:53.800
and he told me to go down and talk with Mr. Shine and get what

16:54.800 --> 16:56.800
Mr. Shine knew about this man testimony.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.800
I did go down and I did have a discussion with Mr. Shine.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
I think a staff member was with me.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.800
And we got a number of facts from him,

17:03.800 --> 17:05.800
so what this man has said.

17:05.800 --> 17:06.800
Did you make a member?

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
I don't think I did make a member.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.800
I know I spoke with Senator McCarthy and some other staff members

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
about that.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.800
The reason I know I don't think I made a member and a staff member.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.800
That man, subsequently, committed suicide.

17:17.800 --> 17:22.800
He asked about a men hopper.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.800
I was contacted by a pilot state of government intelligence agency,

17:27.800 --> 17:30.800
which knew that Mr. Shine had been in touch with this man.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.800
I explained what I knew about the situation.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.800
And by this time, Mr. Shine was down and came for it.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.800
And I remember telephoning down there and talking with Mr. Shine.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.800
I developed that he had not been a member and he had never made a member and

17:42.800 --> 17:46.800
I had not made a member and I'm after talking with Mr. Shine about it.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.800
So I just then was verbally supplied to this intelligence agency,

17:50.800 --> 17:54.800
the FBI, the information which we had.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.800
And I believe I contacted Mr. Shine and confirmed that information.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.800
I don't know what they actually interviewed at that point.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.800
That's one thing, specific thing, which occurred to me right now.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.800
Another thing, sir, which covers a great area of what you're interested in right here,

18:08.800 --> 18:13.800
involves a preparation of the interim reports on this information program investigation

18:13.800 --> 18:15.800
we were just discussing.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.800
When we learned that Mr. Shine, what they instructed,

18:18.800 --> 18:22.800
it had been expected, by the way, that he was right to prepare a draft of those reports.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.800
He knew more about that, those investigations than anyone else did.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.800
It was expected that he was prepared to draft those reports.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.800
He was working on a lot of other things, day-to-day matters.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.800
And it would have been difficult for him to do that in the fall month.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.800
We therefore have to research director of the committee if he could take over that part

18:39.800 --> 18:45.800
of Mr. Shine's work and finish it so that Mr. Shine could work on these other matters.

18:45.800 --> 18:50.800
He agreed to do so, and on some of the reports, he did a highly confident job.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.800
With respect to three, the Voice of America, the Information Program report,

18:54.800 --> 18:59.800
the Voice of America Engineering Project report, known as Baker West, subtitled,

18:59.800 --> 19:03.800
and to report on the United States Information Centers,

19:03.800 --> 19:07.800
the research director stated that he had not been with the committee,

19:07.800 --> 19:13.800
while the investigation was conducted, and that it was not possible for him to do the right kind of a job.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.800
Nevertheless, he drafted out some copies of the reports.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.800
We're now in Wellington, all I think this is about October or November,

19:20.800 --> 19:22.800
late October, beginning of November.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.800
And he sent the draft out to the Senate and McCarthy of the first one.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.800
Senate and McCarthy read it over and made some notes on it.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.800
An injury, a big extra, the top page and the last page,

19:32.800 --> 19:36.800
and indicated that the whole report should be done from top, must be redone from top to bottom

19:36.800 --> 19:38.800
and that he wanted Dave Shine to do it.

19:38.800 --> 19:47.800
Dave Shine re-rolls that report, the Information Center report, the Baker West report,

19:47.800 --> 19:53.800
and the Voice of America proper or information program proper report.

19:53.800 --> 19:59.800
And as well as all of the three reports, he helped prepare the three sections dealing with those reports,

19:59.800 --> 20:01.800
which appear in the annual report of this subcommittee.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.800
That was a long and arduous job.

20:04.800 --> 20:09.800
He did the rewriting job, but after he did it, but he did with checkover,

20:09.800 --> 20:12.800
I typed a good deal of it myself at home, I might say.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.800
There's no automatically submitted directly down here to the committee.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
I don't like the front desk.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.800
Yeah, there's a couple of different situations.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.800
It's too important.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.800
Not for the first time for a week with the chairman, I'd like to make sure that there's a point of order

20:25.800 --> 20:30.800
and that is whether when going this way with the chairman, I don't want you to look.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.800
But it's always right on me.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.800
I want to give a record of that place until that's the guy.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.800
You got him a lot of things to say, and look for him.

20:40.800 --> 20:45.800
Well, I was sharing things to get him to that point of order,

20:45.800 --> 20:47.800
but that's actually the last thing.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.800
I think it was in ten years.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.800
I think it's a thing, though, that's the honor.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.800
The late three non-smokers on the left will sign up to the chairman.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.800
And then he said, the chairman will tell the lay,

20:57.800 --> 21:00.800
I'll allow him to do more.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.800
Bring some for the guy's leader to that.

21:03.800 --> 21:08.800
The guy who lives in the county will do him more position.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.800
Now Mr. Cohn has you finished your answer.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.800
That's quite said, but I'll move.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.800
You mean going?

21:13.800 --> 21:16.800
Mr. Shine prepared substantial sections of this C3 plot.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.800
He did a lot of free writing.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.800
As a matter of fact, he reorganized the whole way of doing it.

21:21.800 --> 21:25.800
He thought that instead of one comprehensive report,

21:25.800 --> 21:28.800
which is what we first thought of,

21:28.800 --> 21:31.800
that it should be broken down into three parts,

21:31.800 --> 21:33.800
and that there should be three separate interim reports

21:33.800 --> 21:35.800
to be filed before the annual report.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.800
He went ahead and he did, oh, I would say,

21:37.800 --> 21:39.800
the greatest part of that job.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.800
Hey, what are you talking about?

21:42.800 --> 21:45.800
Where he did now, F.D. was inducted into the Army.

21:45.800 --> 21:49.800
This is where he did after he was inducted into the Army.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.800
So you're hearing the eight weeks stay at Fort Biggs?

21:52.800 --> 21:53.800
Yes, sir.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.800
Mr. Cohn, the next few discussions.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
Yes, sir.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.800
Were you with Mr. Shine on all or practically all

22:01.800 --> 22:04.800
the stations of his leave of absences from Fort Biggs?

22:04.800 --> 22:06.800
I can't say that, sir.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
I was with him.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.800
I worked with him on a good many of those occasions.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.800
And other staff members worked with him on other occasions.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.800
Were you with him on his leave of absences on weeknights?

22:17.800 --> 22:21.800
On a few occasions, I watched her and on a few occasions.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.800
I don't think there were too many.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.800
I don't think there were too many weeknights at all.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.800
But on a few occasions, I watched with him and a few occasions.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.800
Other members of the staff members were with him at Cohn.

22:32.800 --> 22:36.800
I can recall, thank God, I can recall, Jim Giuliano.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.800
There might have been others there.

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
It's not they work.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
I would say things were to lie to somebody had a talk

22:41.800 --> 22:44.800
from about something, sending the McCarthy with sending down a call from him.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.800
Were you with him on weekends?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.800
I was a number of times and when I wasn't,

22:49.800 --> 22:53.800
I was also on the phone or he would deliver usually to my house

22:53.800 --> 22:55.800
the written flutter.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.800
So far, these reports were consent.

22:58.800 --> 23:03.800
Mr. Cohn, the state weather, not on any weekend,

23:03.800 --> 23:07.800
that Mr. Shine was off from Fort Deicks.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.800
He went to my house as a state of flutter.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.800
Whether he went to Miami, Florida, or the state of flutter.

23:13.800 --> 23:14.800
The state of flutter.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.800
While the sign to flutter, Richard.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.800
The answer to that, I am sure, is no.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.800
In the state of flutter, during the Christmas holiday.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.800
During the Christmas holiday.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.800
He was not.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
He was working during the Christmas holiday.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.800
Was he in the state of flutter during the New Year's holiday?

23:29.800 --> 23:30.800
He was not, sir.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.800
Now you think he worked during the Christmas holiday?

23:32.800 --> 23:33.800
Hi, toaster.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
On committee work?

23:34.800 --> 23:35.800
Hi, toaster.

23:35.800 --> 23:36.800
Will you?

23:36.800 --> 23:37.800
Yes, sir.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.800
Where?

23:38.800 --> 23:40.800
As far as now, if we want to talk about day by day,

23:40.800 --> 23:41.800
I think I can help you on that.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.800
We...

23:42.800 --> 23:43.800
Oh, that's right.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.800
Let's start back then with the first day.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.800
The first night.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.800
When he was away from Fort Beach.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.800
Were you with him that night?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.800
The first night he was away from Fort Dix.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.800
Right on the leave of absence on committee work.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.800
Uh, now let me see.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.800
That he went down there on the 10th day of November.

24:00.800 --> 24:01.800
On November.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.800
That night, I suppose he was down there, I didn't see him.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.800
On November 11th, Frank Carr and I.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.800
It was honest to stay, and there was no training.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.800
By the way, and I know Frank Carr and I went down to see him.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.800
We, Frank Carr took with him a large bundle of papers.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.800
I think those were concerning.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.800
Frank will be able to tell you about that.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.800
I think those concerns.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.800
The fort-monets investigations and the interviews.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.800
Which, uh, China conducted on NO.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.800
Uh, we sat at a...

24:29.800 --> 24:32.800
Three of us sat at a picnic table out of the...

24:32.800 --> 24:37.800
Near the reception center at Fort Dix outside for two or three hours

24:37.800 --> 24:39.800
and went through those papers.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.800
When we were through with them.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.800
And talking about the monets investigation, we left.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.800
That I believe, sir, is the first time we saw our, uh,

24:47.800 --> 24:49.800
shine after he went down.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.800
That was in him, remember, and the member made a bet

24:51.800 --> 24:54.800
to meeting our conference with Baby Shack.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.800
A member and the member of the meeting gave.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
No, sir, I don't believe it.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
Well, our information meeting party to you is that...

24:59.800 --> 25:01.800
Now, that I can't be sure of.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.800
It's very possible, in fact, probable.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
It's a Mr. Carmide, if noted, on some of those files,

25:05.800 --> 25:07.800
or whatever he had papers he had down with them.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.800
Certain facts, which Mr. Shacken had given to him.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.800
I don't know.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.800
I just think that the member and the mobs made...

25:13.800 --> 25:16.800
It could easily be found in the file as we understand.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
Yes, sir.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.800
I don't think Mr. Carmide went back and dictated a memorandum.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.800
I saw Dave shine today in such and such and such.

25:21.800 --> 25:25.800
He went down and going through some papers and find out certain information

25:25.800 --> 25:28.800
and talk about certain matters with which Mr. Shacken had familiarity.

25:28.800 --> 25:29.800
It worked.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.800
I'd be going in, Mr. Carmide.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.800
I only got the information and acted upon it.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.800
Did Mr. Shacken leave the post on November 11th?

25:38.800 --> 25:39.800
I don't believe so, sir.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.800
And that was a mistake.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.800
Yes.

25:42.800 --> 25:46.800
The one with the next time, I turn November 11th,

25:46.800 --> 25:50.800
that Mr. Shacken was given the leave of absence to work with the committee.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.800
Uh, 1st and 1st November 11, sir.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.800
Um...

26:00.800 --> 26:02.800
I just can't give you that date, sir.

26:02.800 --> 26:03.800
For any reason.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800
I remember this.

26:04.800 --> 26:08.800
I don't know whether it was probably after training on that weekend

26:08.800 --> 26:11.800
or on the next weekend.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
I, uh...

26:13.800 --> 26:15.800
I recall this, Mr. Jenkins.

26:15.800 --> 26:22.800
I recall one of the early things he worked on was the preparation of the David Greenblast deposition,

26:22.800 --> 26:27.800
which we introduced in evidence that our first public hearing has fought one of.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.800
Mr. Shacken had been down on the interview of David Greenblast

26:31.800 --> 26:34.800
and had gotten information from Mr. Greenblast.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.800
I think Mr. Shacken had taken some notes on that day.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.800
And, in fact, I think he took a lot of notes on that day,

26:40.800 --> 26:42.800
is to what Greenblast had said.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
Um...

26:43.800 --> 26:45.800
Now, where are those notes, Mr. Kohn?

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
There's something I suppose, sir.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.800
Well, they can certainly be found in there now.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.800
Yes, it's a fair and existence.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.800
I know that we now have the notes reduced to the Greenblast deposition,

26:53.800 --> 26:56.800
and that is in the record of this committee.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.800
And they were prepared, those notes were taken made by David Shacken,

27:00.800 --> 27:02.800
I fear he was inducted in the army.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.800
No, sir.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.800
Those notes, I think he took the notes seats up,

27:06.800 --> 27:10.800
were taken up at Lewisburg, Sanitentiary,

27:10.800 --> 27:14.800
when we were interviewing David Greenblast.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.800
The matter then dropped Mr. Chang-Kun,

27:16.800 --> 27:18.800
so what I was telling you, sir, was,

27:18.800 --> 27:21.800
they came with time after Mr. Shacken was found at 4'6",

27:21.800 --> 27:22.800
but...

27:22.800 --> 27:24.800
Well, I've got to go back one step further.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.800
After the Greenblast interview, we anticipated falling.

27:28.800 --> 27:32.800
Mr. Greenblast, as a witness before the subcommittee,

27:32.800 --> 27:35.800
we had every reason to believe that would be done.

27:35.800 --> 27:36.800
We were...

27:36.800 --> 27:38.800
That does not work out.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.800
The Department of Justice, Mr. Rogers,

27:41.800 --> 27:43.800
we told that idea,

27:43.800 --> 27:48.800
and we were not allowed to have David Greenblast appear before the subcommittee.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.800
Therefore, we had to get what Mr. Greenblast had to say before the subcommittee

27:52.800 --> 27:56.800
in written form had somewhat of the last minute.

27:56.800 --> 28:01.800
I recall that Mr. Shacken drew up in question and answer form

28:01.800 --> 28:07.800
what he thought was an accurate estimate of what David Greenblast had said

28:07.800 --> 28:11.800
when he had been interviewed by us in October.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.800
I recall I was away.

28:13.800 --> 28:14.800
I was out of town.

28:14.800 --> 28:18.800
And Mr. Shacken spent another committee investigator

28:18.800 --> 28:22.800
over that weekend up to Lewisburg to talk to Greenblast.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.800
That the site recalls the committee investigator

28:25.800 --> 28:28.800
went over what Shacken had written up with Mr. Greenblast.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.800
Mr. Greenblast made a number of changes.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.800
And I think on a Sunday, Mr. Shacken talked with Mr. Greenblast,

28:36.800 --> 28:40.800
a lippy investigator who was standing in the side of Mr. Greenblast

28:40.800 --> 28:44.800
and worked out the final copy of this definition.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.800
And a few days later,

28:46.800 --> 28:48.800
it was an evidence before the committee.

28:48.800 --> 28:53.800
And that's the definition which I read from in the record here yesterday.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.800
That's another incident which comes to my mind right now.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.800
I'm going without going in the eaves of specific instances.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.800
Are they leaving absence?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.800
I want to ask you this. Show it.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.800
Mr. Shacken was a footbaits bar a period of eight weeks.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.800
That's correct, isn't it?

29:09.800 --> 29:10.800
Yes, sir.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.800
And being that period of time,

29:12.800 --> 29:16.800
he had the days and sundry consultations

29:16.800 --> 29:18.800
with the members of your staff.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.800
He did, sir.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.800
And you say that being those consultations,

29:24.800 --> 29:28.800
you had the human parts to use knowledge that he had acquired

29:28.800 --> 29:30.800
prior to his entrance in the army.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.800
That covers one category, sir.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.800
Perhaps they can call categories.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
Yes, sir.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.800
And certain memorandum were made out of those interviews

29:39.800 --> 29:43.800
and of the fact that you've been the result of your comprehensive judgment.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.800
I can't say that certain memorandum were made.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.800
After each visit, we would not come back and make a memorandum.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.800
We would go down to find out about something.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.800
I remember the night of November 17th,

29:52.800 --> 29:54.800
when Senator McCarthy was born,

29:54.800 --> 29:56.800
there was a specific investigation

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
which he wanted to discuss with Mr. Shacken.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.800
It was something on which Mr. Shacken had been working.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.800
It was a matter of getting Mr. Shacken's evaluations.

30:04.800 --> 30:08.800
A certain fact, and the testimony of certain witnesses,

30:08.800 --> 30:11.800
with whom Mr. Shacken had been working.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.800
I don't remember that.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.800
We, as I was there for that plane ride with Mr. Stevens,

30:16.800 --> 30:19.800
we went all the way to the Air Force plates and McGuire Airfield.

30:20.800 --> 30:21.800
They gave us a room.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.800
A couple of Colonel LaFell was there, and Colonel Bradley.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.800
And when we sent him across,

30:26.800 --> 30:29.800
he started talking with Mr. Shacken about this investigation.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.800
The two Colonel's excused him, Bell,

30:31.800 --> 30:34.800
and the discussion continued for some period of time.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.800
Now, I did not make a memorandum about that.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.800
I assume Senator McCarthy did not.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.800
I know that after talking with Mr. Shacken,

30:40.800 --> 30:43.800
and then with other members of the staff there answered,

30:43.800 --> 30:45.800
we decided to do something,

30:45.800 --> 30:47.800
rather not to do something.

30:47.800 --> 30:53.800
And there, we started with a strategy that today,

30:53.800 --> 30:55.800
which we would have to let him show him the long weekend

30:55.800 --> 30:57.800
to get together,

30:57.800 --> 31:00.800
spend the five or a hundred typical shine memorandums

31:00.800 --> 31:02.800
so they can be examined, and he will learn yet

31:02.800 --> 31:04.800
as I get Mr. Welch in.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.800
Which is a big issue just in case,

31:06.800 --> 31:09.800
Mr. Gomes and me ask you this question.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.800
Make sure you share any memorandum

31:12.800 --> 31:16.800
or whatever, I assume, or when the third on any subject,

31:16.800 --> 31:19.800
I think the answer to that, I can only give you guess,

31:19.800 --> 31:21.800
it's probably yesterday.

31:21.800 --> 31:26.800
I would have to check the files and talk with him before giving you a definite answer on that.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.800
I assume now you're referring to, he dictates,

31:28.800 --> 31:33.800
that he himself dictates or prepares specific memorandums,

31:33.800 --> 31:36.800
distinguishing that from talking to members of the subcommittee staff.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.800
That's the question of them.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.800
I would say, I would say in all probability that there are some.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.800
I don't know.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.800
You do not, you prefer any memorandum,

31:45.800 --> 31:48.800
I assume, or the third is the result of your conference with shine.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.800
Specific memorandum?

31:50.800 --> 31:51.800
Uh...

31:51.800 --> 31:53.800
You don't need to.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.800
I don't recall that I prepared specific memorandum.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.800
Did any memorandum you say?

31:58.800 --> 32:01.800
I don't know that, so I would have to talk to each one who talks with Mr. Shine

32:01.800 --> 32:04.800
and find out whether after talking with him,

32:04.800 --> 32:07.800
they went back and prepared some kind of memorandum

32:07.800 --> 32:09.800
or whether they merely found out what they wanted to know

32:09.800 --> 32:11.800
and acted on the page.
