WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.200
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, one of the ablest and most important, and

00:08.200 --> 00:14.760
I think one of our most capable Tennesseans who has in public life in Washington today,

00:14.760 --> 00:20.560
and has been here for a number of years is Adrian Fisher from Memphis.

00:20.560 --> 00:28.040
Adrian goes home and sees all of his kin folks every year and his wife comes from Nashville.

00:28.040 --> 00:34.320
His father was a very distinguished congressman from Shelby County District for many years

00:34.320 --> 00:36.680
and the House of Representatives.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.680
Adrian, we certainly are glad to have you here with us.

00:39.680 --> 00:43.840
I'm off to our honor to say hello to all your kin folks done in Tennessee.

00:43.840 --> 00:48.080
Well, I'd like to very much, as you know, a board of Memphis, you said, and my wife's from

00:48.080 --> 00:51.080
Nashville and my mother's family, come from Nashville.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.600
And when I first met you, it was the junior or chamber of commerce, folks, and they made

00:54.600 --> 00:56.160
me an honor of racism of Chaden Davis.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.560
I feel very much at home when I go home.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.560
That takes you to all parts of the state, all right?

01:01.560 --> 01:05.240
Now folks, let me tell you a little bit about Adrian Fisher.

01:05.240 --> 01:12.640
He was a large lurker for Justice Brandeis and Frank Furter when he first got out of Harvard.

01:12.640 --> 01:18.560
He was a legal advisor for the UN delegation, a technical advisor at the Neuronburg Trials.

01:18.560 --> 01:22.920
He was the General Counsel for the Atomic Energy Commission.

01:22.920 --> 01:28.700
And he has now indefinitely to John J. McCloy, who is President Kennedy's advisor on this

01:28.700 --> 01:34.700
armament, so that Mr. Fisher has had a great deal of experience in government and is one

01:34.700 --> 01:39.000
of the most knowledgeable and influential men in Washington.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.320
Adrian, we are talking about the Berlin crisis and we are getting our defense establishment

01:47.320 --> 01:56.400
in better order so that we will be able to take care of ourselves and any emergency.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.760
Why are we doing all this at the same time talking about this armament?

02:00.760 --> 02:03.320
What is the disarmament program anyway?

02:03.320 --> 02:08.200
Well, as I see it, there are really two sides to the same coin.

02:08.200 --> 02:13.000
I think the President was, of course, right in his speech last week in terms of increasing

02:13.000 --> 02:14.800
our arm strength.

02:14.800 --> 02:22.040
But if at the same time you don't have a willingness to negotiate a workable arms reduction

02:22.040 --> 02:26.800
agreement, workable disarmament arrangements, we are headed down the road of an unlimited

02:26.800 --> 02:31.600
arms race and the end of that is one that is not terribly a pleasant to contemplate.

02:31.600 --> 02:37.820
My feeling is that at the same time that we remain firm and remain strong, we indicate

02:37.820 --> 02:41.800
a continuing willingness to conduct workable disarmament negotiations.

02:41.800 --> 02:46.800
I don't really see the long run any workable alternative.

02:46.800 --> 02:53.200
Well, what was it, Weston Churchill said one time about working for disarmament?

02:53.200 --> 02:57.160
Well, he said we are armed to parlay and it seems to me you have to have a little bit

02:57.160 --> 02:58.160
of both.

02:58.160 --> 03:02.200
You can't negotiate from weakness and the other hand you can't just arm for the sake of

03:02.200 --> 03:03.200
farming.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.200
We have armed for workable arrangements.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.800
Where is Mr. McFlaulay as the chief and you the deputy?

03:09.520 --> 03:14.160
Where have these disarmament conversations been taking place and what is the situation?

03:14.160 --> 03:19.200
Well, of course you have the test band talks in Geneva that Mr. Arthur Dean is conducting.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.200
The general disarmament talks were disrupted last June.

03:22.200 --> 03:26.640
This was under the previous administration when the Russians walked out of the Ten Nation

03:26.640 --> 03:28.720
conference in Geneva.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.440
We have been holding some bilateral discussions.

03:31.440 --> 03:35.960
We had two weeks in Washington in June and two weeks in Moscow in July.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.080
Mr. McFlaulay and his group of which I was privileged to be won just got back Sunday.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.960
It does seem to be strange that I was in Moscow Sunday morning and here Sunday night that

03:43.960 --> 03:47.880
that's the source of gives you some indication how small the world is now.

03:47.880 --> 03:54.560
I want to ask you about Moscow and many but let me ask, I think all of us are hoping.

03:54.560 --> 04:01.880
I think the plain people everywhere in the world would like to see us try to do something

04:01.880 --> 04:08.000
better than just prepare for wars and spend all of our assessments and money and manpower

04:08.000 --> 04:11.400
preparing for wars but of course we have to be prepared.

04:11.400 --> 04:18.100
We have to have our defenses up but it's important as you say at the same time that we leave

04:18.100 --> 04:23.360
no stone unturned and an effort to try to find some peaceful solution to the problems

04:23.360 --> 04:25.200
of the world and that's what you're doing.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.000
Well that's what we're trying to do.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
That's what you're trying to do.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.840
Well we must anyway always be willing to talk if anybody wants to talk reasonably about

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
this problem.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.080
You said that you were in Russia just last week?

04:41.080 --> 04:46.440
Yes, but left Sunday morning and left Moscow Sunday morning about 8 o'clock.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.360
Mr. McFlaulay was there and so Mr. Krushchev I believe.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.920
Mr. McFlaulay went to Moscow.

04:50.920 --> 04:56.960
We left two weeks ago Friday and flew over there and we spent about a week or so in Moscow

04:56.960 --> 05:02.240
and Mr. McFlaulay about this time last week flew down to the Black Sea to Sucy and was

05:02.240 --> 05:05.800
Mr. Krushchev's visitor for about think two nights in a day.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.960
Well I don't suppose as much you can tell us about Mr. McFlaulay's conversation with Mr.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.320
Krushchev or is there anything you can do?

05:12.320 --> 05:13.840
Well not a great deal, Senator.

05:13.840 --> 05:17.280
They covered the waterfront to a degree although Mr. McFlaulay was there.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.600
He's only official capacity.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.400
He's not dealing with disarmament negotiations.

05:20.400 --> 05:29.280
I think it's fair to say that this is more or less the premium Krushchev puts on quite

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
a show.

05:30.280 --> 05:35.520
Yeah, I had a chance about four years ago talking with him while I myself and he's the

05:35.520 --> 05:39.760
old man I ever saw that would bang the table and get up and walk around talking through

05:39.760 --> 05:43.720
an interpreter, get all excited and that he puts on quite a show as you.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.720
Well he's all excited.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.680
He's one minute and then quite friendly the next time so I understand but I really can't

05:47.680 --> 05:49.680
go into any end of detail on it.

05:49.680 --> 05:54.160
What did you have an opportunity to go into in Russia when you were there?

05:54.160 --> 05:55.760
Well I stuck pretty close to Moscow.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.200
I stayed at the hotel you crain and walked over to the embassy and then walked to the

05:59.200 --> 06:02.160
conference room and I didn't get around very much.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.600
I was sort of tending the story during the period of the Suci conferences.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.440
We had some work going on to disarmament delegation and as the second man that was what

06:10.440 --> 06:13.000
I was doing when Mr. McCoy was out of the city so to speak.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.800
As you visited the country.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.800
Not a great deal, sir.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.120
It was impressed.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.600
Moscow is not as a grab to city I'm told now as it used to be.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.240
It's still has sort of a grab look to it but the people are still our fundamentally very

06:24.240 --> 06:25.240
friendly.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.400
You're being invited all over the here to America campaign.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.360
They get propaganda to it must be coming out of the ears saying what awful people we

06:31.360 --> 06:33.880
are and yet they'd recognize you as an American street.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.960
You didn't detect any on the average Russian.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.360
I'm not talking now about the indoctrinated official but the average Russian seemed just

06:40.360 --> 06:44.640
as courteous and as pleasant as you'd find someone walking down the streets of Memphis

06:44.640 --> 06:46.880
Knoxville, Nashville, Chattanooga.

06:46.880 --> 06:51.520
The average Russian doesn't want to have an all-out atomic war and more than we do.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.000
I'm sure they don't.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.240
These people didn't look like war like to me.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.400
They look friendly.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.760
Well, Adrian, where do we go to from now?

06:58.760 --> 07:02.680
What are the plans for the disarmament talks?

07:02.680 --> 07:11.640
Well, these talks were attempt to establish a framework for resumed by multilateral negotiations.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.360
We wanted to agree where they would be conducted under what set of ground rules and we didn't

07:15.360 --> 07:17.240
come to any conclusion on it.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.720
As a result, the bilateral discussions will resume in New York.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.520
I would suspect sometime after the Labor Day.

07:23.520 --> 07:27.640
One of the things that we are extremely important though and it's important that it be done

07:27.640 --> 07:32.560
fairly quickly is to get the disarmament activity set up on a statutory basis.

07:32.560 --> 07:37.720
That's the Bill that President Kennedy set up to the Congress because it's really important

07:37.720 --> 07:43.800
to have your disarmament negotiations as well prepared and as well organized and as

07:43.800 --> 07:48.520
factually well-readed to argue as it's humanly possible to be.

07:48.520 --> 07:53.160
And while we've been working pretty hard on it, we're still not satisfied with the organization.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.560
And we feel that there ought to be a statutory based organization to conduct this sort of research

07:57.560 --> 08:01.160
and to give you the sort of backup papers that you really feel that you need.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.880
The stakes on this are just too high to be satisfied with anything less than the best

08:04.880 --> 08:06.280
as far as preparation is concerned.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.240
In other words, if some of the trouble points in the world are going to have to be settled

08:10.240 --> 08:17.880
if we are ready to have disarmament or any step toward it, it has to be a great deal

08:17.880 --> 08:21.880
with background work done and we have to know what we're talking about.

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
That is correct, sir.

08:22.880 --> 08:27.480
And I think when you consider that we're spending roughly $45 billion a year on the arms

08:27.480 --> 08:32.840
side of it and a countless number of people, when you consider private industry education,

08:32.840 --> 08:36.240
the services themselves, it's pretty important that you have

08:36.240 --> 08:43.960
not a big, but a authoritative and select organization dealing with the disarmament area.

08:43.960 --> 08:47.840
And I know a lot of people say, well, the Berlin and the Aries is no time to be talking

08:47.840 --> 08:50.560
about passing a bill dealing with disarmament agency.

08:50.560 --> 08:55.120
On the other hand, I can't think of a better time myself unless we're prepared to say,

08:55.120 --> 09:00.560
well, we're going to keep on arming, keep going on the arms race and let come what may.

09:00.560 --> 09:07.400
So when you start thinking now about the horrendous quality of modern weapons and what could

09:07.400 --> 09:13.200
happen in the event of a thermonuclear war, it really makes you decide that perhaps considering

09:13.200 --> 09:19.840
disarmament on a workable basis is worth spending a good deal more time on and a good deal

09:19.840 --> 09:24.120
more man hours on than even we're doing now and it's been stepped up quite substantially

09:24.120 --> 09:25.920
over the past six months.

09:25.920 --> 09:31.560
But of course in time is past, we've made a mistake, I think, in disarmament ourselves

09:31.560 --> 09:34.520
but the other side's not doing much about it.

09:34.520 --> 09:40.040
This time we're going to be sure that if we take a step so the communists will take

09:40.040 --> 09:41.040
a step, is that?

09:41.040 --> 09:42.040
That is certainly true.

09:42.040 --> 09:47.040
Now, I remember being quite interested in reducing the armed forces, the United States

09:47.040 --> 09:54.640
by at least one back in 1945 and 1946, but we went down from around 13 million to about

09:54.640 --> 09:59.840
a million and a half with absolutely no motion of a similar character and nowhere near

09:59.840 --> 10:01.600
that much and I'm part of the Russians.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.320
Now that was just a mistake and this mistake I don't think we should ever make again.

10:05.320 --> 10:09.400
I think the unilateral disarming is wrong.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.960
I think the whole purpose of this organization, the whole purpose of the disarmament effort

10:12.960 --> 10:21.640
is to work out some arrangement under which the two opposing forces can put down the amount

10:21.640 --> 10:27.880
of time, money, and sweat that they're putting into arms on a mutually safe basis.

10:27.880 --> 10:32.760
As far as the unilateral disarming of 1945 and 1946 is concerned, I don't think we should

10:32.760 --> 10:34.440
ever repeat that mistake again.

10:34.440 --> 10:40.800
Well, a minute ago you mentioned the Berlin crisis and I think that certainly I and I

10:40.800 --> 10:47.640
think most Americans plotted the firm definite stand that President Kennedy took in his

10:47.640 --> 10:50.880
recent speech in connection with Berlin.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.720
How does the situation look to yours, anything?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.400
You can tell us about the problem.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.400
Well, I was really not much you can add to what the President said.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.720
It may seem strange.

11:00.720 --> 11:06.240
I certainly applauded that speech myself and far from seeing any inconsistency with it

11:06.240 --> 11:08.960
and with a willingness to work out a workable assignment arrangement.

11:08.960 --> 11:16.760
I think it was an essential step for an ovenly sound disarmament arrangement to come into

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
being.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.000
I don't think with Kruciep having announced that he increased his own arm forces roughly

11:21.000 --> 11:25.640
35 percent, his military budget 35 percent, we can say, all right, no matter what you

11:25.640 --> 11:27.200
do, we're going to stay in the same level.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.200
I think that's wrong.

11:28.200 --> 11:33.080
I think what the President did was right, but I think he indicated he's opened to negotiation

11:33.080 --> 11:39.920
and if we can work out a sound and effective, controlled disarmament, it seems to me would

11:39.920 --> 11:40.920
be that much better off.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.160
I thought the President's speech was a step in that direction.

11:43.160 --> 11:48.480
We have to negotiate if we negotiate from a position of strength to be successful.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
That is correct, then.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.680
Well, I can't you, we have about one minute left.

11:52.680 --> 11:57.800
We have the foreign aid bill that's coming up in the Congress this next week and there

11:57.800 --> 12:00.440
will be a great deal of debate about it.

12:00.440 --> 12:06.280
What is your general feeling about the aid developing nations and do our friendly nations

12:06.280 --> 12:07.520
and these systems?

12:07.520 --> 12:14.080
Well, Senator, I, of course, strongly behind that, I was in on the beginning of this and

12:14.080 --> 12:18.040
48 worked with the Harman Committee on foreign aid and although I haven't been on it

12:18.040 --> 12:22.720
recently because I've had enough trouble staying ahead of my own work, all I can say

12:22.720 --> 12:27.200
though is I know the way that the Congress likes to have an annual check on things and

12:27.200 --> 12:31.440
the big bites you're going to have about authority on a non-annual basis.

12:31.440 --> 12:35.160
But when you're dealing with remaking the economy, particularly the underdeveloped country

12:35.160 --> 12:37.480
and that's terribly important to us, it's awfully hard.

12:37.480 --> 12:40.080
It's hard for them to plan on a year by year basis.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.360
You don't make economic plans in a year by year basis.

12:42.360 --> 12:49.320
No private business does and it's pretty hard to expect a newly emerging country to do

12:49.320 --> 12:50.320
it.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.840
Otherwise, the President ought to be able to make some commitment over a period of two or

12:53.840 --> 12:55.760
three or four years and back it up.

12:55.760 --> 12:56.760
Yes, there I'm finished.

12:56.760 --> 13:01.240
You know, sir, I've been counseled on many private firms and you're, for you, entered

13:01.240 --> 13:06.880
political life, very few private firms make their own plans on a year by year basis.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.960
They make them on somewhat larger basis and I think the government should be able to

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
do the same thing.

13:10.960 --> 13:14.360
Well, I think it's a great deal to do that argument.

13:14.360 --> 13:19.200
Well, Adrian, it's sure it's good to have you with us on this program and we appreciate

13:19.200 --> 13:20.200
very much.

13:20.200 --> 13:25.920
You're telling us about the disarmament program and I know that your friends in Tennessee

13:25.920 --> 13:28.800
are glad to see you looking so well and rugged.
