WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm going to go to the other side.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Okay, I'm going to go to the other side.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Okay, I'm going to go to the other side.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
As did most of the things that you said earlier,

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
the end of your center is a large set of short night winds

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
that's very convenient in our state.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Get in step with the headwind of daylight speed.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
It might be well for our friends to use the energy

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
which is only the same time.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Remember that your next schedule is now one hour

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
if I get a few times.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Other time, your center results is a few hours later

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
and in the main part of the city.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Our Junior Center for the Kennedy Headquarters

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
is currently also in the pages of the congressional records

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
in the 1930s.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Our 40th of the time is during the base

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
and in the round is so far,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
the depot is already released.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
This resolution steps up especially at the beginning.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
We investigate the use of every base of the county

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
and the latest crime,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
which is our violation of law of the most possible crime.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
It is finally adopted as only one

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
which means only a few weeks.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
We have to keep on it.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Along last year, the city's United States

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
is setting free the parliament in the rest days.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
The city is being approval for the rest days

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
of the nationwide crime operation.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
do you understand?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, thank you very much, Charlie,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
and how do you do ladies and gentlemen?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Naturally, I'm highly gratified

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
to report the passage of our crime resolution

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
after so long awaited.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
We have been anxious to get underway

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
for a long, long time.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
And from our part,

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
the crime investigation will be underway before long.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
The senator from the mail received the commissioner's office.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
He said he seemed to have the well-wishings of the great number

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
of people in Tennessee.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
It's really going to need a lot of help.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
And a lot of people can get in this tremendous undertaking.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
The senator approval of our residents' proposals

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
indicates the sacrifice on the part of the people of Tennessee

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
to part of my own personal services to them,

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
our concern.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
And naturally, I'm pleased that my people

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
are willing to have me give a great portion of my time

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
to this effort.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Of course, Charlie, I'm expecting you

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
and the other capable members of our staff to continue.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
The very best service possible to our constituents

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
have been able to give them my personal attention

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
as I've tried to in the past.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
It would be a pleasure, Senator Steve Fawver,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
and I know all your friends and constituents will understand

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
that you cannot choose as possibly be a dreadfully available

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
to them until this matter is completed,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
as you've always experienced in human history.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
But I know everyone will be disappointed

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
if you will not expect to make good news.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
You will expect to make good news.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
You will expect to make good news.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You will expect to make good news.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Well, that's what I've been thinking.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
What's the most important thing about the bulls' situation, Charlie?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I think it's a vital thing.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I know that the Black people are important.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And the elected representatives of the people

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
stay in close touch with the folks back home.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
We try to do that without weekly reports

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
which are made available by radio to all parts of Tennessee

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
and in condensed form to every newspaper in Tennessee.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Of course, the mail we received from our people in Tennessee

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
and the goodly number of our friends from home

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
who come up here every now and then

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
stop us day and conduct.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
But we recognize the limitations of these contacts.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
And I like to go around in the every Tennessee county

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
just as often as possible to report directly

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
to all who are interested.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And it's not answered questions about any matters

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
not covered in the reports.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I think it's obvious that everyone's interested in moving

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
on eight years of improving picture.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
That I mean that we have made preliminary arrangements

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
to prepare a often movie, giving my report,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
and to have you and some of the others of our staff

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
show it in all parts of Tennessee where they're interested.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
That's the first substitute for the type of thing I would like to do.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
But if you will be on hand to ask your questions

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
and stop out of our friends,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
anyway you can.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
And I know that the latest would be glad to see you

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
if you have any silver spoon.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm thinking of life hunting and news, life seeking endeavor.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm pretty well convinced in my own mind that there are

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
one or more organized crime rings

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
and firing the filth to people of America.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And at the end of the day, they are the only ones

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
who are in the world who are the most vulnerable

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
and the most vulnerable in the world.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And that's the first thing that I would like to do

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
is to build the people of America.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And at the end of the day, they operate across states lines.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
There is testimony from high authority, of course,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
that no national crime.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
The medium, through which it can be determined

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
whether such a sentence is our sentence,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
or actuality,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
or merely a figment of the imagination.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
If we do find conspiracies of an interstate character

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
we can determine the nature and extent of the other them,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
and the other fact that the spotlight of public opinion

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
will be focused on these illegal operations

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
will do no harm to the cause of low, outer, and morality.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
But none of these are the principal purposes

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
of the investigation.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Our task is to find out the interstate crime situation.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
To take a look at the adequacy of our existing federal criminal laws

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
and to recommend to the Congress what new or amended laws

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
and it should be passed to direct the situation.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
And I know that word is on the standards of these laws.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
This is actually a serious study of our presence

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
of federal criminal laws.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
To see if they're at a good duty job that may need to be done.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And you're holding into the activities of big-shot gamblers

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
and direct heroes.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
It's actually not for the purpose of trying to put them

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
jail or out of business,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
but to see the extent, nature, and effect of their operation

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
will be a lot to be passed to deal with.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, that's a very good digest of it,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
so far as I'm concerned, Charles.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Of course, if, as an incidental matter,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
things got so hot for any of these citizens

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
that they are put in jail or out of business,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I wouldn't be unhappy about it.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
So Senator Winsley, the Senate finance

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
would you make it to the court on the proposed suspension of law?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh, you're absolutely right.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Committee, I'll put it up by Senator George of Georgia.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Recommended sweeping changes in our old age

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
and survivors' insurance setup.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Under the committee's recommendation,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
the program would be placed on a pay-as-wee goal basis.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Benefits under the law would be increased from an average

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
of about $26 a month, as it now is,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
to an average of about $49 a month.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
But the tax would not go up as it is scheduled

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
to do next year.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Rather employers and corporations,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
one in one half percent,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
one in the fee release, I mean, 1956, that's right.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Then in 1960, the rate would be raised

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
to an average of $2.9 a month,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
and finally, at three and a half percent,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
it's being increased now.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Now, it's half percent of the fee.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Hardly, Charles, that's a present time of trust,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
out of which to build up the respectuation point

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
for the payment of the credit, then will be needed.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
In this situation, the benefit share is

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
that it can receive more compensation for six years

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
before any additional tax money will be needed.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
You know how many persons are being decreased

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
and you will need some average.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Well, about three million right now,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
a little less than three million as a matter of fact.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
But the finance committee recommends that

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
eight and a half million additional persons,

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
now, as they are being covered under the law,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
and doesn't permit a detailed explanation

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
of the occupations covered right now.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And that, my manager, is going to be president.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
It's questioning the inclusion of some 20 million

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
additional six years.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Yes, and they have to represent its lordness

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
to about 11 million.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Those differences will have to be worked out.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I might add, right here, Charlie,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
that it should be emphasized that we have been talking

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
about a committee recommendation,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and that the law has not yet been passed.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We have had several cases, then,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
where our elders and people are in just a little month,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
yet, are unable to receive only incentives.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You know it's that part of the law of these things.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I don't know if it will be changed, Charlie,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
but the Senate's finance committee has

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
eased up the qualifications of the extent

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
that about 500,000 elderness persons who are now ineligible,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
will become eligible.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
I have a little retirement age is 65,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
and it's unlikely to be lowered into time.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Now, the old age benefits were just that.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
You cannot be completely only the existing

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
problem of changing another six years.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
No, I will follow by trends

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
where differentiates between the two.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Old age and the fabric done a bit

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
comes at the matter of right to a person

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
who has worked sufficiently and covered in points.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Old age assistance, the state program is based on needs,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
and I'm glad you've pointed out to this thing.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
I guess it seems to be a lot of excuse.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I mean, we should have provided some fireworks on the Senate floor.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
The E.L. make them up.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yes, Charlie.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
The FEP bill is going to follow the ECA authorization bill.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
And of course, the FEPC always provides a strategy.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I attended a meeting of several my colleagues from the South

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Thursday at which time plans were made to launch a

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
filibuster or very long speeches when the measure does come up.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
So he will oppose the filibuster strategy.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
I am Charlie, and I am also opposed to an FEPC law.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
As you know, I tried to help get the Senate rules changed to bring

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
an end to the strategies that unlimited debate

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
or filibuster in last year.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Support some national emergency or TBA matters

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
have to be up on the Senate floor.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
But we were defeated in our effort and the rules changed.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Senate rules are still to met the use of filibuster

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
or very long speeches.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
So Senator, how do you recognize the use of your strategic

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
initiative?

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, filibuster law, outlaw, outlaw, did I have to say?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
That is I voted to sustain that Senate Department is ruling

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
at the two thirds of the state after reasonable time.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I feel that I am justified in using it as a weapon against

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
some legislation I don't approve.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
The law measures the Senate rules to make its use.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
In other words, you are going to use filibuster

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
to solve the other things, filibuster.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
You rules.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, that's about it.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Charlie, it's loud.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
It's loud to be used against the South in the nation someday.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
So why shouldn't we use it for the South in this situation?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I think you're point, kind of.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So you sound like Bradley, even if the racial measure

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
as a matter of principle, as I did every time it came up in the House,

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
and I might add, I was one of the first to testify against this bill

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
before the British years and the last year.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
The betterness and the value of the region over the FACC question

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
is doing much harm to nations.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
It is diverting the false intention of many legislatoris

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
and more important issues.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I think with the great things of the nation,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
if this is supposedly FACC, it should be voted down once and for all.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
But along this there is an explanation as to the outcome of a voting

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
fund group sent to rules to make unlimited debate.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
I expect it to be quite a good strategy using any weapon on that pan.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
FACC is in a sense trying to make it.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
There's one other question I should ask you.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
So this time in that case and on the way,

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
do you expect you continue making the decision to make the decision?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Well, I certainly do, Charlie.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Maybe time is when I cannot be able to appear myself,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
and if the level goes a times as few and far between.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
But I intend to take whatever time it requires and I'm here

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
to continue to support every week's Congressry nation's session.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
And let me say we are very, very grateful to these 30 radio stations

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
and those newspapers and senators with broadcasts and public news reports.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And it certainly applies public service there, really.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
And if some of our friends are a bit far to these stations and newspapers,

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
expecting a free gig in public service, I would have free-getted by much.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Thank you, Mr. F. D. D. Paul.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Ladies and gentlemen, once again, you have heard the news reports

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
of Mr. F. D. Paul from your secretary's office in the United States office.

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
Until next week, it's a thank you to the party and you can use your left hand out.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Okay.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Thank you.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
You're welcome.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Thank you.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You're welcome.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Thank you.
