00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Well, visit Charlie Neitz, fresh out of a non-successful battle with a flu here.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Bringing you to the left of the district you read and interviews,

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
the Senate's directorate to keep all from that activity in the United States Senate.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
The weekly devoted to a continuation of debate on the current national gas bill,

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
and Senator Kees Paulver again, for his participating in the new discussion.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Senator, what about the curve bill?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
What's totally a difficult to predict the outcome right now?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
I do think the Senator Paul Douglas is ill and I, and others of us,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
who have a cold this measure, have made some general.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
At any rate, the bill is not in time.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
The easest letting was not executed for it in the beginning.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Let me hear a guess in the next one.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Well, in the first place, I think it is a chance for those who have a cold,

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
and support the bill to refer to it as benefiting independent natural gas distribution.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
None of these, as so-called independence, are meant in overall.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
As a matter of fact, they are large companies,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
like the standard order of New Jersey, of New York, or Indiana,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
the Phillips-Deficit Union Company.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
And these so-called independent, large independent,

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
produce about 70% nearly free force of all the natural gas sold in the state public.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
For the forces, they're only type of natural gas,

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
commerce, with which countries make the service.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Some of these companies have been earning up to 40% dividends on their common stock.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
This bill would take away the power of the federal power commission

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
to regulate sales of natural gas and interstate commerce,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
and thereby would commit a large increase in the individual consumers' gas bill.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
The whole question is whether there is sufficient compensation at the producing end

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
to keep prices in line.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
If there is sufficient compensation and there's no use for regulation,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
but if there is not sufficient compensation as a producing land

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
so that they can run prices up and up and up,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
but then of course it's necessary to have the power of regulations.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
The whole hearings before the interstate commerce committee,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
and all of the argument in the Senate,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
are shown that there is rather very nature of things,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
not sufficient production at the producing end,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
but surely there's going to be a fair price for a reasonably stable low price

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
in the cost of natural gas.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
And that's the reason I'm against the bill.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
There isn't a fraction of the steamfaller,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
that the natural gas company is now enjoying something of a legal loophole

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
in the income tax laws, which the misdemeanor earned in the use of products.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Well that's true, Charlie, although legislation may be passed

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
at this session to plug up that loophole,

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
but the experience of that loophole with regard to credit for suspicion

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
is all the more reason my natural gas consumers should be protected

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
from further increases in rate,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
but it is also a professional profit distribution.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I believe you have some facts and figures regarding specific facts

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
on Tennessee natural gas and services.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Well that's right, and I put those facts and figures

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
in the congressional records the other day.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Tennessee is not my job as gas producing state,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
produced from in the upper fumbling part of the state,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
but not a great amount.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
But we are becoming an increasingly important gas consuming state.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
The extension of natural gas service,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
now proposed in Tennessee,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
will require more storage.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Very good.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I think it has been mentioned in the two facts.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I think the 1900s,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
the next one, not the six figures,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
the two that are making some of it in will be purchasing 90 million thousand

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
cubic feet of gas annually,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
all of which will come to us in the state commerce.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
For this bill should be passed on reliably informed that we in Tennessee,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
would stand to pay about 17 million dollars more for our gas

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
than we do under fresh rates.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And even if it increases, the amount is to only one cent

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
of thousand cubic feet on the surface of consumption,

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
would stand to pay about 900 thousand dollars more each five years.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Based on what is already taken place with respect to field prices

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
and increases in experience by the time that we have been in.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
What is the problem of the ring space?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's a poor, not-hastic annual.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
Can you mean that Tennessee consumers will pay more regardless of the passenger's requirements?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
No, not at all.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
These increases should come about,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
unless some of the particular prices here in the state land

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
will be paid by the federal fire commissioners.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I can certainly see why you are putting that set of spite against these complex

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
curable, with thousands, millions, millions, thousands of future bulls.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Now passing on to another topic,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I understand your resolution for an investigation

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
and nationwide crime operation has cleared the rules for this.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
If you request the funds, you will receive $50,000 from 100 thousand dollars.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
That was the action of the rules the many of the cities on the first.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Actually, the committee may have done us a favor.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
We are giving us an increase of about $12,500 dollars a month

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
as recommended by the judiciary committee.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
The only official difference is the time element.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
We are now required to make a report by July 31st,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
instead of by the end of this time within the assembly.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I've had a nine-all-along-a-class moving investigation,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
and this notion will now become an exception.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Of course, if we are unable to do the job in the time of the lot,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
we can always go back and ask for more time.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I know there is a lot of things that we can do in the past.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
I know there is a dispute between the judiciary committee

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
and the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
as the judiciary had jurisdiction with the rules committee.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Does that allow your jurisdiction to dispute?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
No, the rules committee didn't settle it,

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
but the committee seemed to think that this was a proper matter

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
for the entire Senate to take up and do the size.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
As a matter of fact, the President of the Senate,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Vice President Foster, the First Resolution,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
is going to be referred to the judiciary committee,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
and it is going to be referred to some other committee

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
which would be the Vice President and the Senate,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
and not some particular committee of the Senate.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I do anticipate that there may be a father-epper

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
on the part of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
to remove the investigations on the judiciary committee on the Senate floor.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
The rules committee took no stand in the objection and opposed

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
the question by Senator Ed Johnson,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
the chairman of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And the Senate continues to lower the McCarthy charges,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
as communism and the state department is continuing to face.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
What do you think of his efforts at this point?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, we talked about this matter several times, Charlie.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I know all of us could speak a little better

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
if the matter were brought to a head one way or the other.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
The fact is, the only thing I have seen

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
from the party has been able to do, and six weeks.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
This is scarce to death in headlines and radio flexions.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And as far as I know, after this minute,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
the Ministry of the McCarthy has not produced one coming in

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
or once read of new evidence in that regard.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
All he has done is to pass and rehearse old charges,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
some of which have been just proven a long, long time ago.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
There was, for example, the case of Judge Dorothy Centers.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
She had been sharpened her disapproval of Russian,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
of the Russian delegation to the United Nations

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
by Judge Cenium was a delegate.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Even Senator McCarty's colleague, Senator Tickin-Lukus,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
that I was not really least evident

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
that Judge Cenium had been reporting in any way

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
to the First World War that's loyal.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Then there is a case of Philip Joseph,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
who had charged with having Senator McCarty

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
and had an unusual affinity to the communism.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
He came and completely disproved his charge

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
and General Marshall and General Eisenhower's

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
folk art in his being a great and fine American.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Then it's McCarty didn't get anything on him whatsoever.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I think the common within the public

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
are beginning to doubt Cenium's democracy

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
responsibility in the next.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
The himself will be the one to suffer a bad name

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
unless he does more in the future than he has in the past.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
He's a substantial agent.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Which brings me to another item, Charlie.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I think I'm just a just as an ex-communist

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
as the next man, but I will find some much more

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
of a believer and the governor of democracy

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
than some others.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Because I've done it in the last broadcast,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
if there are communist, the fellow travelers

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
and federal governments, sooner we can find them out

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
and fix them out to better.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
At the same time, I think the best way

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
to strengthen out the democracy

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
is to make it work better.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And now you have some significant interest in my interest.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
I do. I refer to the National Science Foundation Bill

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
which has the House of Representatives last week.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
It's still written down with any communist amendments

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
that the FBI complained about it

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
and said it would be very bad for the public

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and it's important to be passed.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
The Human Amendment should make the FBI responsible

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
not only for investigating the employees

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
and scholarship holders in the National Science Foundation.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So also the FBI would be required

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
to pass judgment on its own ruling

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
so that is of course, which Mr. J.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
and the governor of Jekts through very strongly.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And one of the House amendments would automatically

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
ban anyone who would ever belong

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
to a so-called communist or organization.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Even though they may have known,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
they're not knowing that it is one or it may have turned out

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
to have been one later off through the organization.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I'd like to quote from an editorial experience

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
in New York Times on that subject

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
which seems to be rather sensible.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Putting as every federal appointees

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
of any important office is fine like this,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
it's such a terminal before you take such as work.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
And as I ask,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
they're likely at any moment to be a sale

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
and a match and a match like an estate fund bill.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
What sort of person may we expect

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
to have in public employment?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Certainly they will not be the courageous,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
plain spoken and intelligent men and women

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
in the urgency of our time to man.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
They are more likely to be weak

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
because neither office is too concerned

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
like that of the matter of functionaries

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
in far off Russia,

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
as the examination is to make no mistake in the full faith.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I think Charlie will make some mistakes.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Now I'm very hopeful that we will not

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
become too intent on,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
but we will call into the undemocratic

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
fact that she's our sell.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
The very thing we seek to avoid.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Well, I think you're right, Senator.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You can hardly expect others to be the term

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
on the much less we ourselves

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
practice to demonstrate its vision

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
by our own example.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Now, certainly we don't want to advertise

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
in Maggie's engine,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
but I'm a subscriber and a heavy-peer of time

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
magazines.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
30-8 pieces of your Atlantic Union

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
resolution.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Congratulations.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Well, Charlie, I'm not a dovetye of time magazine,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
but this big issue certainly does

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
way of time greatly in my estimation.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
My back, I think.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I might buy several times.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Charlie, our national hour is very pleased

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
that the thorough coverage of this magazine

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
gave to Senate's final resolution,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
57.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
But the hero of the piece is my friend,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Karen Strice, who's picture is on

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
the cover and is like story of the basis for the audience.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
He has certain deserving, having devoted his energy

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
and activities, its very life to the cause of an effective use.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Mr. Stride is certainly one of the most

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
unselvable men of this age,

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
far as I know.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
He's very very word-as-say,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
he's making a speech.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
He has a final word, Senator.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
What happened to the middle-income housing

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
program in the past?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Well, I regret it,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
feeding this state of the real estate lobby

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
has lost everything the administration has

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
to do and remove this provision

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
for middle-income housing over-and-house too.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
But we've seen that we have no chance

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
of getting badly needed housing legislation

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
for the average American as this company.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But let me say an extra-next-unit,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Charlie, that I suppose this company has done better

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
overall on housing than on any of the most

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
of the problems that we have had.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
The parking bill, which is passed in the beginning,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
has provision for extension of FHA

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and for lower interest rates and better

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
amortization to address the current

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
more people to build housing.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
And of course, that part of the spoken

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
is going on not as good.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
And the parking bill also had a provision

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
and certain instances where it was recommended

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
by City Commission for us to have a limited

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
number of low-income housing projects

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
and some of those are going to be built.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
And another provision was parking bill

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
was for Plum Terrace to assist the cities

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
in getting a Plum section cleaned up

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
and back into merciless, valuable properties.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
So a great deal has been done in the housing matter

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
during this session.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Well, I have certainly hoped that we found a town

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
in the footballs like the United States

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
and the buildings that have.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I see the now-monitorial clock is calling

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
an automatic policy session.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
The Ohio Liches will be listening

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
if it stays here next week.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
If the FSU bubble will bring you the series

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
and most weeks of regular reports

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
from your center to ten,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
probably should be zip-by.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Thank you.
