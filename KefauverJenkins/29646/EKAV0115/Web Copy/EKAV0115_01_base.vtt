WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
Ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank this station for carrying this program as a

00:08.240 --> 00:10.160
public service.

00:10.160 --> 00:16.840
We will bring you news from Washington from time to time and interview outstanding personalities

00:16.840 --> 00:18.880
in our nation's capital.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.680
We will appreciate any suggestions that you make from time to time about the subject matters

00:23.680 --> 00:25.840
to be discussed on these programs.

00:26.840 --> 00:31.320
I'm very happy on this the first program of the year to have with us in the studio is

00:31.320 --> 00:38.720
our guest, one of the most brilliant soldier statesmen of this country and indeed of the

00:38.720 --> 00:40.440
world.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.280
With a possible exception of the late President Eisenhower, I do not think in recent years

00:45.280 --> 00:52.460
we have any person who has had such a brilliant military and civilian life as General Larus

00:52.460 --> 00:53.460
Northstay.

00:54.180 --> 01:00.120
General Northstay, it's wonderful to have you on this program with us and to talk with

01:00.120 --> 01:01.120
you.

01:01.120 --> 01:08.460
General Northstay, as you know, was the Supreme Commander Allied Command Europe from 1952

01:08.460 --> 01:14.300
until he retired the first of December this year and he was also commander of the United

01:14.300 --> 01:16.780
States forces in Europe.

01:16.780 --> 01:22.100
I can say of my own knowledge because I have been very interested in him and of course

01:22.100 --> 01:28.820
in our strength and building of NATO throughout the years that he has done a remarkable job

01:28.820 --> 01:35.060
in bringing together the might and strength of the 15 NATO countries.

01:35.060 --> 01:40.060
I think General Larus said that Nancy and I first got to know you early in the 1940s

01:40.060 --> 01:44.020
when you were probably a major and I guess two years ago.

01:44.020 --> 01:52.060
I think that perhaps 42 or 43 something about that time I would like to say.

01:52.060 --> 01:59.060
How much this pleases me, this opportunity to appear on this program with you, not only

01:59.060 --> 02:04.780
because it gives me an opportunity with you to speak to an important segment of the American

02:04.780 --> 02:13.620
people, but it also gives me the chance to express to them the great sense of gratitude

02:13.620 --> 02:20.940
that I feel toward you for the very active part that you have played over these last

02:20.940 --> 02:28.860
many years now in furthering the cause of the Atlantic Alliance and in supporting NATO.

02:28.860 --> 02:37.140
I remember seeing you and hearing your very forceful presentations at the NATO Parliamentarian

02:37.140 --> 02:42.740
conferences for instance, in particular this year when under your leadership a strong

02:42.740 --> 02:48.860
resolution supporting the Atlantic community, the Atlantic Alliance and NATO was adopted

02:48.860 --> 02:50.500
by the NATO Parliamentarians.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.500
So I'm delighted to have you.

02:51.500 --> 02:56.140
Well, thank you, because thank you Larus.

02:56.140 --> 03:02.300
Listeners, those seeing this program, well of course the NATO Parliamentarians have a

03:02.300 --> 03:04.980
meeting every year in Paris in November.

03:04.980 --> 03:10.980
Part of that meeting we have an opportunity of hearing a general North-State visiting

03:10.980 --> 03:17.380
him at shape and he always receives this and has been over the years very, very highly

03:17.380 --> 03:23.740
respected by the military and the civilian leaders, the political leaders of all of the

03:23.740 --> 03:26.980
nations of Europe and of North America.

03:26.980 --> 03:33.500
As General North-State we were talking about your original career, you were a lieutenant

03:33.500 --> 03:39.900
or a major back in the forties and you got to be a Brigadier General and the war is a

03:39.900 --> 03:44.460
major general and you went from there to obviously a full four-year-old.

03:44.460 --> 03:49.500
That's an unfortunate expression.

03:49.500 --> 03:55.020
When you took over a Supreme Commander in 1952 many of us had a feeling that our Allied

03:55.020 --> 04:00.940
strength was not sufficient to protect Europe that we were precariously weak.

04:00.940 --> 04:04.540
How have things progressed since during the ten years that you were Supreme Commander?

04:04.540 --> 04:11.940
Well I think that the progress has been very considerable not because of anything that

04:11.940 --> 04:17.940
I have done because of the support that has been given to the problem by all of the countries

04:17.940 --> 04:24.860
of the alliance and I must say the particularly by this country, the United States.

04:24.860 --> 04:28.700
We must remember that other countries, all of the other countries of the alliance have

04:28.700 --> 04:30.700
made very major contributions.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.900
It was set at the time of my predecessor.

04:33.900 --> 04:38.460
I think he met up at the East Edit when he can reply to a question of what the Russians

04:38.460 --> 04:40.100
need to move to the channel.

04:40.100 --> 04:43.260
The answer was shoes.

04:43.260 --> 04:50.580
I must say that in the end of 1962, beginning in 1963 the forces have grown and have been

04:50.580 --> 04:56.740
organized and are so equipped and deployed that they must be regarded as a very significant,

04:56.740 --> 05:03.780
very significant factor both in the deterrent that is the prevention of war but also a significant

05:03.780 --> 05:09.140
force or factor for the defense and the vital part of the free world should this become

05:09.140 --> 05:10.140
necessary.

05:10.140 --> 05:15.380
General Norse, as you spoke of your predecessor, your immediate predecessor was General Grunt

05:15.380 --> 05:21.060
where I believe and for him was Ridgeway and the first Supreme Allied commander was General

05:21.060 --> 05:22.060
Eisenhower.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.060
That's correct.

05:23.060 --> 05:24.060
That's correct.

05:24.060 --> 05:31.540
This is very hard to contemplate the great, to realize the tremendous job of bringing together

05:31.540 --> 05:38.140
the armed forces of 15 nations, speaking different languages.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.740
That's been your job and you've done it remarkably.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.740
Thank you very much.

05:41.740 --> 05:48.740
How do you feel that the NATO forces are in a position to defend ourselves or to defend

05:48.740 --> 05:53.180
Western Europe against the Soviet Union and just the war?

05:53.180 --> 06:00.100
I think Senator that, well, I'm really acknowledged.

06:00.100 --> 06:04.220
The shortages, certain deficiencies within the alliance.

06:04.220 --> 06:11.580
The same time we must recognize that very real strength has been built up, real strength

06:11.580 --> 06:19.140
in the sense of divisions, of squadrons, of ships, real strength in terms of weapons,

06:19.140 --> 06:22.140
conventional and nuclear.

06:22.140 --> 06:27.620
In addition to that, we've organized so that we can direct these forces.

06:27.620 --> 06:36.980
And sometimes, impressed, perhaps almost depressed, by our constant criticism of ourselves,

06:36.980 --> 06:40.140
we are always talking about our weakness.

06:40.140 --> 06:44.820
And I think it's well as necessary for us to be aware of our weakness.

06:44.820 --> 06:49.620
At the same time, we must also realize our strength.

06:49.620 --> 06:51.420
We not have not only military strength.

06:51.420 --> 06:57.020
We must remember that because of the action that we've taken the determination that our

06:57.020 --> 07:04.020
countries, including this great country, have shown facing up to the threat that we've

07:04.020 --> 07:06.820
achieved great strength in many forms.

07:06.820 --> 07:13.020
For instance, the one thing that you were very familiar with, from your work with NATO

07:13.020 --> 07:18.660
and with the following Ontarians, which you have contributed, is the unity of the alliance,

07:18.660 --> 07:22.660
which I feel at this time is very, very important.

07:22.660 --> 07:32.220
If I may go on for just one more minute or another, you have the news of disagreements,

07:32.220 --> 07:36.900
of divisions, of different views, particularly now, because we've had some notable statements

07:36.900 --> 07:42.980
by Donald the GO, by Chancellor Adnan, and by Prime Minister McMillan in recent two weeks.

07:42.980 --> 07:47.740
But we shouldn't let these differences of opinion, which I think are natural between

07:47.740 --> 07:49.140
three countries.

07:49.140 --> 07:55.300
We should let them, these differences obscure the fact that that time of crisis, such as

07:55.300 --> 08:03.500
the crisis of Cuba, all of these countries supported and supported promptly the position

08:03.500 --> 08:10.740
of the United States without equivocation and in the positive, most positive possible

08:10.740 --> 08:12.060
terms.

08:12.060 --> 08:18.660
This was really a proof of unity, when unity really counted.

08:18.660 --> 08:23.340
And this is the record of the alliance, when unity really counts, it has always been there,

08:23.340 --> 08:25.140
and I'm confident this was a critique.

08:25.140 --> 08:28.780
And as always been there in the case of Berlin, it's always been there in case of Berlin.

08:28.780 --> 08:34.540
Well, I was a highly pleased that the last NATO parliamentarians conference on this issue

08:34.540 --> 08:40.540
of Berlin and Cuba, we've had strong resolutions without a dissenting voice, as you have said.

08:40.540 --> 08:46.140
And I think undoubtedly that had a great deal to do with Mr. KruÅ¡a pulling back in

08:46.140 --> 08:47.140
connection with Cuba.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.940
There's no question about it.

08:48.940 --> 08:51.220
Is this demonstration of unity?

08:51.220 --> 08:57.780
I've been working on the European side, and you have been working with the Atlantic Alliance,

08:57.780 --> 09:03.340
so on particularly where that alliance, the NATO countries, the unity of the NATO countries,

09:03.340 --> 09:08.940
but you add to that the quite remarkable unity at that particular time of the American

09:08.940 --> 09:09.940
states.

09:09.940 --> 09:15.740
And the America, the countries of North and South America together, this must have been a

09:15.740 --> 09:23.500
formidable force in support of the United States in this particular instance.

09:23.500 --> 09:29.780
General Marcel, of course the largest contribution to the NATO armed forces has been made by the

09:29.780 --> 09:36.900
United States, but other nations do make substantial contributions, a very substantial,

09:36.900 --> 09:41.620
and I would point out that it's hopefully hard to measure precisely the contributions.

09:41.620 --> 09:46.060
But the Germans, for instance, the Federal Republic of Germany is coming up and making

09:46.060 --> 09:49.500
a very great contribution for instance.

09:49.500 --> 09:56.380
They will be committed to us, I think, 11 divisions at the moment, and remember that

09:56.380 --> 10:00.300
they're all deployed in the front line because Germany happens to be in the front line.

10:00.300 --> 10:08.260
They also have given us very substantial air forces and very substantial naval forces.

10:08.260 --> 10:11.780
So their contribution is very substantial.

10:11.780 --> 10:18.580
All of the countries, all of the countries are making very considerable contributions.

10:18.580 --> 10:24.980
I might, when I was in command, have hoped that some of them might have gone a little

10:24.980 --> 10:28.860
more, a little faster, in fact, before 50 years, I did.

10:28.860 --> 10:33.420
I still, at the same time, I was recognized that they all, every one of them, is making

10:33.420 --> 10:38.020
a very substantial contribution, and these contributions added to that of the United States,

10:38.020 --> 10:43.700
has created a force, a factor of major significance in our time.

10:43.700 --> 10:52.460
Yes, well, General Norstead, how about the DeGau, I had an impact and the disagreement

10:52.460 --> 10:55.940
between DeGau and, like, milling over the common market?

10:55.940 --> 11:01.780
I think you see, I think, many of you think these things are going to work out eventually.

11:01.780 --> 11:08.140
I think they have one case here of, they're talking about Paris and Bonn at Naur and DeGau,

11:08.140 --> 11:14.980
we have an example, I think, of Cohesion, of a bigger cohesion, and perhaps in the case

11:14.980 --> 11:20.980
of the UK, or the different relationship between Gau and the milling, it's particularly

11:20.980 --> 11:22.820
a point on the question of the common market.

11:22.820 --> 11:28.620
It appears, and I emphasize the fact it appears, to be evidence of some division.

11:28.620 --> 11:33.940
From the standpoint of the first, that is the German-French relationship, I think this

11:33.940 --> 11:39.500
is something that we all should applaud and should approve, because there has been, as

11:39.500 --> 11:47.620
we all know, this historical enmity between these two countries, which are now for hundreds

11:47.620 --> 11:53.980
of years, has caused wars, has caused wars, the purpose of these two men, and I know from

11:53.980 --> 11:59.500
talking to the two men, has been to bury this particular hatchet for all time.

11:59.500 --> 12:04.220
And this clearly is a contribution to this, and for that reason, I think it is the greatest

12:04.220 --> 12:06.260
possible significance.

12:06.260 --> 12:09.260
What springs from this, no one knows.

12:09.260 --> 12:15.740
But I would hope that there would be a very close relationship, a relationship of growing

12:15.740 --> 12:17.980
up, and a friendliness is very fondly at the present time.

12:17.980 --> 12:23.220
And if this in turn will contribute to understanding and to unity within Europe and thus within

12:23.220 --> 12:30.660
the West, I am not willing, at this time, to be too pessimistic about the relationship

12:30.660 --> 12:36.740
between France and England, for instance, or the United Kingdom on a question of the

12:36.740 --> 12:37.740
common market.

12:37.740 --> 12:45.500
I personally feel that the larger format of the seven countries that is including the

12:45.500 --> 12:53.060
UK is a sound or more viable arrangement than six, and I would certainly hope that conditions

12:53.060 --> 12:58.660
would permit the introduction of the United Kingdom into that body.

12:58.660 --> 13:04.340
Finally, pursue this as just one second longer, Senator, something that, and say something

13:04.340 --> 13:11.540
that I know is important to you, it is important that we have these smaller groupings for specific

13:11.540 --> 13:15.940
purposes such as this economic purpose in this economic community.

13:15.940 --> 13:21.660
But the real pattern of the future is something that you and I have both supported, and that

13:21.660 --> 13:25.180
is the full pattern of the Atlantic community.

13:25.180 --> 13:31.800
This must remain our objective, because this is the way of peace, and this is the way of

13:31.800 --> 13:33.800
prosperity for all people.

13:33.800 --> 13:37.960
Well, I certainly wish we could go on longer because this is very interesting talking

13:37.960 --> 13:38.960
with you.

13:38.960 --> 13:45.000
General Norse deert is a leaving government, he is going to be vice president of Orange

13:45.000 --> 13:50.120
Corning Fabbid-Lass Corporation and president of their International Division.

13:50.120 --> 13:55.800
We hope you well in your student private life, and we want you to come to Tennessee to visit

13:55.800 --> 13:56.800
us sometime.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.800
Thank you very much.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.800
Thank you very much, Senator.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.800
Thank you.
