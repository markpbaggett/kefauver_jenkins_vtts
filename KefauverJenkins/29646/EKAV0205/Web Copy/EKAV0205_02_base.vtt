WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
That's basically what made it.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
It was meant we were finished.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
The Army was taking hold.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Now you've touched aside about these events of October 19th.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Yes.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Did you, as a matter of fact, in company with Senator MacKity,

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
as the Secretary, Miss Allen, perhaps on the Board of Foreign

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Members on the twenty-stay of October?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
I did.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Mr. Colme, what occurred that day with respect to this proposed

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
proposed release, if anything, with respect to the press release.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
I have a good idea.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm there to think about it.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
All right.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Going up in the plane, in Mr. Steven's plane, by the way,

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
the chairman was there, Iowa's with him,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Mr. Laneville was there, Bob Jones was there,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Colonel Polo, General Back, Mr. Adam, Mr. Steven,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
and a couple of Mr. Steven's, the Waterloo.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Then, I was sitting next to Mr. Steven.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
He was sitting at a window seat.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I was sitting next to him, and Senator MacKity was across the aisle.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Iowa's playing was taking off, Mr. Adam was sitting in the back of the plane.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
After we were up in the air, Mr. Adam came forward,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
and welcomed the aisle in between Mr. Steven and myself on the one hand,

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
and Senator MacKity on the other side of the aisle.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Mr. Adam had with him, I think, a month and a half,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
and the draft for the blaster, the interview with the record, Mr. Colme,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I'll ask you to identify with it at number eight.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I can tell you the number eight.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I can hear what he had.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
He was kneeling in the aisle, and he pulled it out,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
and he started showing it to Senator MacKity.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
And then, Senator MacKity, whether or not,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
wasn't a senator, given my break, wasn't a senator,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
or an issue that wasn't a senator, say these things.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
The senator read it and said he was not.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Then, Mr. Adam said, well, what's wrong with that?

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I mean, what language would you like, up, and all that?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
The senator said, well, this is a diary call,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
this is what the senator said was.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, in this, you have me saying that we're going to stop the hearing.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
We are not.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
The last paragraph is accurate.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Well, you say we're going to continue them,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
and have both executive and public sessions.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
But the other business, and the air about a stopping investigation,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
and turning it over to the army, isn't true, and I will not say it.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
The senator made a plural point.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
He said the diary call is fact he was not in the practice of the law,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
and he was not in the practice of having other people, particularly people

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
who he was investigating prepare statements for him to make.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
That it was not characteristic of him, the fact he knew it was not,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
and that if he went in there, started reading off the statement like this,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
everybody would know that it was not him,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
and the whole idea just did not appeal to him.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
And he made the specific statement that he would not say anything,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
which could be construed in the statement

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
to the investigation where it would be called off.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
The senator definitely declined the set time,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
and while he ran midair and tried to lending a court mama

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
to issue such a personal issue.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
The senator's specific explanation was to say anything.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
That would indicate in any way that he was stopping the investigation

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
because at the explain he was not.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
He was fine to hold hearing.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
As far as specifically saying, I will not say anything, or I will not make any relief.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I think he made it very clear.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I don't recall a thing in so many words.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Later that day Mr. Cohn did even Mr. Adams or the secretary

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
making his father his hand to get this relief to the place.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Next time I heard anything about the relief,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
as far as I remember, the investigation was during launching

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
at the administration government, and what did he hear later?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, some of them thought he got up from his seat

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
and he was sitting up at the head of the table with Mr. Steven.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And he heard a full identify of the case where he went.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
No, definitely.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
He may have been there, maybe, in the first place.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
But he left the room, and as he was leaving the room, as I recall it,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
he walked down the room, and between the chair where we were sitting

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
and lunch in the wall, there was a table.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
And on the table, as I remember, there was a six-hyle of mini-aggress

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
state, Senator McCawkey-Fawke, when he reached the table.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
As I remember, it can take one of them up.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Now, what was he?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Well, there was another press release, which Mr. Adams

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
evidently wanted Senator McCawkey to issue.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, did you have anything, however, or did you have anything,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
whatever to do with the preparation of those mini-aggress first releases?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
No, he didn't.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
The only thing he might have had to do with the words,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
he had said there was certain things which he definitely would not say.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And the third offense, Mr. Adams, was an offense, I think,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
working at the release to strike out those things with Senator McCawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey-Fawkey- Kerry.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
He was not interested.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Did you have a copy of that mini-aggress proposal?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It really?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I don't have one right now.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I know that there are some available.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I will ask you to.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I know a senate.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I read it over a couple of nights ago.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I was very just recollection of what was going on.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
If we had gone, it was not the minute or if you would have put your interpretation

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
upon it, you don't get it precisely.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
And if we were not in your opinion, it was a pretty significant risk that Senator Inefect said

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
that he was through with Fort Monmouth or about to be through with Fort Monmouth and would

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
trigger over to the Army.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
No, I don't think the third one was.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I think the third one said a lot of nothing.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
So a lot of nothing, yes sir.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Anyway, Senator McCawkey, I think I've nothing to do with the preparation of it and these

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
if you stop.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Now, when you get it, it's going to last you to apologize.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It's going to be too much to your testimony.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
So you say that was the third offense that they can procure the senator to make a press for me.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Does that right?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yes sir.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
He said the way it happened was.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Thank you.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
This is the one I mean.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
There are not many exhibits number.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
E.S.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
This one.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
This one here.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Just about eliminate what Mr. Adam wanted said and what Senator McCawkey wanted said it

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
makes no less than to one of the investigations by off-committee laws or what's not trying to continue.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Does the senator get released into the press?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
No, what happened with this?

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Senator picked it up from the six pilots in the address and he looked at it.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Do you remember he then came over to me on his way out of the room and the motion was made and walked along with him.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
I did and he showed this to me and I think that the senator was not angry or disturbing with some autumn news

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
that they were still trying to get him to issue this press release.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
Mr. Adam followed us out of the room and asked the senator if he was not made just briefly.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
The third release.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
The menu of action.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
The menu of grab one.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
The third one.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yes, the menu of grab one.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
It just followed up on the table.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
And the one you know.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
And Mr. Adam wanted to send it into which you got it.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, this one is great.

06:39.000 --> 06:47.000
The senator said again that I think he made some comments about his content, the substance of which was, didn't say much of anything.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
And the point he made then was that he just couldn't recall when before any agency which he wasn't investigating.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
For bad air release and thought of things for words and this not.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
And that he was not going to go to the press and read or hand out something with somebody else.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
That's great.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
For anything he had to say or any questions he wanted to ask him, he could handle that very well himself.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
And he just was not going to give the staff that he would respond any questions the press might ask but he was not going to make press release.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
The coldest that time.

07:18.000 --> 07:28.000
Did you undertake to exert any influence over the senator to prevent his making such a result?

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Is it completely unimportant that it's he was doing anything else?

07:32.000 --> 07:42.000
The coldest Mr. Cohn was respect to the attempt of the army to get you to express what was wrong with the security of the press release.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Not just the process, but a lot of right decision things have happened on that day.

07:46.000 --> 07:57.000
I don't know if you want me to go into them now or of course examination now is the day when we were kept out of the laboratory and I've read a lot of testimony that I was angry which I was and I could say for all those people to come out here.

07:57.000 --> 08:13.000
The coldest, frankly, those matters are relevant to the counter charge of choice and it is anticipating that you would be down on their coughing at Ellen with respect to the ventilator time and we hope not too much later.

08:13.000 --> 08:22.000
So that is all that occurred as we understand it on the 20th of October at Fourth Monmouth with respect to the allegations against Mr. Cohn and the Fadda.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
That's all that occurred with reference to the press release.

08:24.000 --> 08:32.000
I wish this weather enough to saw either of those generals and Mr. Stevens or Mr. Adams on the following days and he's up to the 21st.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
I did. Who is that Mr. Cohn?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Mr. Cohn.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Where?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Uh, okay.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
First on an airplane on the way to New York and then in my home and then the story of the other plane.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
What did it occur on the 21st of this Cohn in New York?

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
Well, Mr. Cohn is a suggestion before that he would like to go to see a parking match that was to take place at the medical place.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
On the night of the 21st, he asked me if I could get tickets and there's some details on that.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Where is it going?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
The parking ship's called for us.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Where is it going?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yes sir.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
They will.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
It's called $20 we understand.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
They did.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
All right.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Now you saw what it occurred.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
It was like two.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
You call it Buckton Night.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yes sir.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Well, I'm fine.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm fine.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I just wanted to go in if I could get the ticket.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I could and I did.

09:19.000 --> 09:33.000
I was down in lunch and I had come down I think to see if I could help the staff at the store and connect with the hearings of the communists giving these money to the government for the government to give these money to the Russians for being free.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
The reason I was in the country is because the government started to code it in the last month.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
The chairman is the subcommittee at that time and we're calling hearings because I think day in and day out on that matter.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
And I came down frankly to see if I was needed.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I was not particularly needed.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Senator Martin has things to say satisfactory.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
She told me that I had a senator Martin.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
She told me that I need not stay down here and work on those particular hearings.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
Mr. Carl was coming up to New York to try on the work in the month investigation.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
I might say that he caused the incident which I'll be waiting on first examination about being stepped out of the laboratory and other things.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
We had to go back to fourth month and find another day to do what we wanted to do.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
And Mr. Carl came back to New York with us and was trying to go on and did go on that second trip.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
We walked to New York with Mr. Ratt on the same plane.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Our office made the registration.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
We met on the plane.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
From the plane from New York we went over to my home.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Women's Ratton had dinner.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
That's on October 21st.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, that's a day after the four-month.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I'm listening.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
And Mr. Adam had dinner with my family and with me at my house on that night.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
At the dinner we went down to the five fights and after the five fights we went out.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And you procured the tickets for the prize.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I had to.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
You would give me understand because $20 a piece, I did.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
How long that subject Mr. Carl?

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
When did Mr. Adam reimburse you for the prize of your ticket on February 18th?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm a slater.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I guess I'll throw my flag.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Four months later.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
In the interim had you seen him and been with him a number of times I had.

11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
I think you have some time near the time we were talking about likewise by some theater tickets from the seventh of the theater tickets.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
And I want to emphasize this with the thank you to my mate.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
I in no way want to criticize Mr. Adam for.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm going to get five tickets but the other tickets are anything else.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
It was a social courtesy which I was very happy to extend to him and would extend to anybody else on the similar circumstance.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
How many theaters do there was something wrong?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I think you all get far any of the doors.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I was glad to do it.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I'm a new theater ticket to you get far.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I think the theater tickets were great.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
You recall the price of those theaters?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
They told them for the $3.25.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
Well now I'm not in the meeting with this anything wrong about the purchase of the kind of side ticketers or theater tickets.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
The committee might think so.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Or the committee might think that the time when you were willing to pay.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
I think that has been from the great theater watching them.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
The request me to find out the date of the theater tickets.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
December 6th.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
There was some discussion about some prior to that date.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
But tonight the theater party finally came work wise.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Tonight is the number 6.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
New York Hall, how much more theaters tickets were in dollars and things.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
The aggregate was further.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
The free theater tickets plus I think a $90.01.00.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I got to get some by calling up.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I checked the $45.00.00.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I checked the $45.00.00.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
That's $45.00.00.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
How would you please visit here?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't count the $20.00.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Mr. Adam, I was glad to have it.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I guess I'm an indication that there was no inspection.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I'm a fan of the theater.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I was in the 64 month later in the university.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I was in the higher five theaters tickets.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I think it's correct.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
Of course it was not four months after the purchase of the theater tickets.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
He needs not ever have to reimburse me for the five five tickets.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
He was like that for dinner.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
My only wish I had been in the out of his not being by his theater.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
You are Mr. Adam.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
The committee might think there's some significant damage.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
So in view of the events that occurred to the fire, to the payment and fire and subsequent to the payment.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Yes.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
The fact that you did it, you did a $45.00 for the five five theaters tickets.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
He did.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Now Mr. Cohn.

13:40.000 --> 13:48.000
You say that you had two of him in numbers times between October 21st and February 24th.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
February 18th.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
February 18th.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
During those, would you say numerous times you had been with Mr. Adam?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Is that right?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Yes.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
There were no more times.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
I would ask you whether or not of any time during those numerous meetings with you and Mr. Adam,

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
the committee offered a reimbursement for either the price back in the theater tickets.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
The five five tickets, most according to my recollections, the theater tickets, I believe these days.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Sir, that he was re-birth me for them.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
And I told him that when the bill came to my office, I would send it on to him to be paid.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
On the call in November of October 29th, sir, the whole each time, the FOIA leave I saw the 21st.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
There was something, something that on that night, which you might regard to the significant.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I do not know the committee what those things are.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yes, sir.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I'll be very brief on that.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
We spent a lot of time together that night at dinner at the fight in afterwards.

14:42.000 --> 14:50.000
And Mr. Adam was very much disappointed that the president of the coffee had declined to make the announcement that he was stopping the investigation the day before.

14:50.000 --> 14:59.000
But the Adam's wanted to know what could be done to work out some arrangements whereby we would stop the investigation.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
He was very anxious to have us do that.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
He asked us about that, and there was quite a bit of discussion about it.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
We told him we did not see that anything particular could be done.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
He mentioned our medication as he had to another stand number one before, and if he did the hard-time toxic medication.

15:18.000 --> 15:27.000
Made the suggestion that if we could sort of spread around the investigation to include other parts of the military, such as the Navy, and the Air Force,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
it would not look so bad for us the people in the arms.

15:30.000 --> 15:44.000
Mr. Cole's team, perhaps that we've been regarded as the most serious power to make by you and Senator McKinsey against the Army and Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adam.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
And I asked you whether or not that is the first time that any toxic jist was ever made to you.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
The meat was, yes, and then it's about to have no.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
And for waiting for the toxic jist to be made, it was sometimes very nutty, so I don't know anything.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Waited at your house dinner, waiting at my house.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Waited at your house to the price, right?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I think we went to a couple places.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Couple of places.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Wait, they were left to our service.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
No one.

16:13.000 --> 16:20.000
No one, people who were interested, would be gone as far as I'm concerned with the going and on the same year as a single man.

16:21.000 --> 16:28.000
And Mr. Adam is a good worker and he's hardly able to resolve any of the needs of lefty difficulties.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
It's nice on that night that nothing he has to talk about very well.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Now it's very cold.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
Do you say that some time that evening, that evening, about to the 21st,

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
it's a jist who was made to you from Mr. Adam that's a McCarthy investigative committee,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
who I suppose is maybe as a handful.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Mr. Jenkins, it wasn't quite that far from the fight.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I was told the House is a committee.

16:49.000 --> 16:57.000
I've been using it regarding its extremely important as many as you can in this society.

16:57.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, I'm sent to them to which anything was said, then as many as you can, were they the most possible?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Just talk to the stadiums, says that night.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I can't possibly, sir, give you for a say to them.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Uh, what Mr. Adam said that night.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
The fact that I can still give you the talk of what he said.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
And I want to emphasize, as far as the Navy Air Force suggestions,

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
there was no great dramatic thing about saying the top of the investigation about us

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
and go ahead and blow up the Navy in the Air Force.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
And if the idea was Mr. Adam for trying to project was,

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
that if we were to investigate communist infiltration in the Navy in the Air Force,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
at the same time, that's not.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
That was sort of paid some of the Honourable of the Army.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
And if we could leave the Army alone and give some attention to the communist infiltration in the Navy in the Air Force,

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
it would not put the Army in a bad light or not put the Army in the Army all along.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
And I'd bad light.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I wanted to specify that Mr. Adam, who was Putin?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Mr. Adam.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I was there at my office.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
There we are.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
And now I'm going to go to him and Mr. Adam.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
No, sir.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
Uh, I want to specify that Mr. Adam and Mr. Stevens need a one.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
That was suggested that we could throw any false information or anything of that time about the Navy in the Air Force.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
That idea was that there was undoubtedly a problem of communist infiltration in the Navy and the Air Force.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Then, looked at that in the Army.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
They were just hoping that we could give that some attention for a while.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
So now that's picture-view current is the 21st day of our program?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Yes.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
And, uh, have you now, you think, you haven't been to the committee?

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
However, now that you've presented respect to what was put on the radio?

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
No, there was one other comment, which might not be important, but I know that was.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I see the three-pointed view.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
That was Mr. Adam's fault.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I was bad-nice.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
I saw a three-point view.

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
I think over handling the arrangements for Dave Shines for a theory in the Army.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
He's that previous device.

18:52.000 --> 19:01.000
These arrangements, I've been handled by personnel in the Army, but that was going to become his personal business from then on.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
But I think about some of what I recall present in this case.

19:05.000 --> 19:17.000
Okay, there was, uh, considerable amount of discussion about Mr. Adam's trying to find out where we were getting some of our information from, and so there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of joking going on back and forth.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
Mr. Cole, the remark that you have attempted to move the audience with respect to the evening of the premier Sir Locktower.

19:24.000 --> 19:33.000
And especially though, it was in a good case that yesterday was made that they were making other branches of the service that Mr. David has managed to visit this time.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
So, the remarks made by Mr. Adam, Dr. Lily, the official three.

19:39.000 --> 19:50.000
How did you get the impression that he was, and Dave says about that, it is very difficult for me to try to frame Mr. Adam's mind or charge his emotional position in that particular moment.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
You say he was, was expecting Mr. Steven's experience of one month.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I do think it's an investigation amount.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
Yes, he was particularly talking about the fact that Senator McCarthy has not made the press release.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm not fed today before that he would stop the investigation.

20:07.000 --> 20:17.000
At that time, having you are the Senators from Wisconsin considered diverting New York with some monolith and going into the area of the Air Force as a Navy.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
No. Did you have any information of just the idea of so-doing?

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Sir, there is an awful lot of information. Now, if we have a lot, I don't know what people have written in and what we have.

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
I know of no specific information which would have wanted, certainly the holding of hearings on the Navy for air force at that time.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
Well, now, I think there is one small situation in the Navy which I, which occurred on me, but we had a good one.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
Mr. Coleman, do you think that we very explored the events about 20%?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Yes.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
What is read on October 29th?

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
I think it was referenced to a trip to two-one David Moongranks.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Oh, yes sir.

20:58.000 --> 21:07.000
I told the 29th, we went up to see the Lord's Ark tenementary to see David Greenblast.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
David Greenblast was the brother-in-law of Julian's Rosenberg.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
And I participated with Julian's Rosenberg in the Soviet fire.

21:17.000 --> 21:26.000
Greenblast, unlike Rosenberg, entered a plea of guilty and admitted to the FBI and to the country, just what is hard to feeling adam-stead for touch-in.

21:26.000 --> 21:33.000
He testified of a witness at the Rosenberg classifications that the matter of fact I examined Mr. Greenblast on the witness's hands.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And I therefore knew him.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
Greenblast, indoling over the Rosenberg testimony, was referenced by the Coleman case.

21:41.000 --> 21:49.000
I came across some statements by Mr. Greenblast, which indicated that he might have knowledge that there has an actual act in the Army's signal corps.

21:49.000 --> 22:03.000
My poor mum, I thought one specifically and at other places, sir, within the jurisdiction of the Army's signal corps, including companies, which were doing self-contracting work for a thought-mind that began the Army's signal corps.

22:03.000 --> 22:19.000
We therefore decided, sometime in October, in preparation for public hearings, that we would go up to talk with David Greenblast and see just what information he could give to us, whether or not there had been us in the signal corps, whether there might be some people who had been caught yet.

22:19.000 --> 22:28.000
And whether there are any leads he could give us that was the first in the investigation of how the incident portrayed in the secret-grade Al Apertorius at London.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
We have been talking about this since the summer, for three weeks.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
We were thinking we should be in this kind of a fair committee and it was not all for Commissioner Adam and to General Walter.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
There they are.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
There they are.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
But did you go to see Greenblast on October 29th?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
We did.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Did you start him?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Who did you?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
No.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I did General Walter the week he is.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I believe he wanted to serve, he was not committed.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
All right, now, however, General Walter, not committed to go with who did go with him?

22:56.000 --> 23:04.000
I know Dave Shine went, Frank Carr I believe went and Mr. O'John Rocking was counsel from Mr. Greenblast,

23:04.000 --> 23:11.000
who had represented Mr. Greenblast, the Rosenberg trial, and I know from that, went along at counsel from Mr. Greenblast.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Completely general law firm.

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
We understand it is the commanding General Ford Mottless from going to use August trip of October 29th to 2 David Greenblast.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
But I know about it as this sir.

23:23.000 --> 23:33.000
When the trip was, we had this October 14th incident which I described when General Lawton said that it wasn't until this committee came along that any effective action had been obtained at Mott,

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
and that he wouldn't go into the details because he worked with Mr. Stevens.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
As I say from that time on, Mr. Adams was distinctly unhappy with General Walter.

23:42.000 --> 23:52.000
Mr. Adams told me, and I don't follow the senator, that he was not happy about the idea that General Lawton was sitting in on hearings of our committee.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
General Lawton would come in. They are today, so they are listening to witnesses.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
Take notes. I want the witnesses to said, and I have recently believed that some of the facts which he green,

24:02.000 --> 24:09.000
are aided him in arriving at the decision to suspend various people working in the secret radar laboratory.

24:09.000 --> 24:16.000
General Lawton also said that he would like to come or at least send a representative up to this Greenblast interview.

24:16.000 --> 24:34.000
He said that he would come or send his aide along with the representative.

24:34.000 --> 24:45.000
I don't remember the details of the conversation with the Jenkins, but I do remember that Mr. Adams told me that he was going to have General Lawton told not to go and to stop keeping his nose out of things

24:45.000 --> 24:54.000
and out of the investigation. General Lawton told me that we had welcomed him on the trip. We were very happy to have him with us.

24:54.000 --> 25:05.000
Although he originally planned to go or have a representative affair, the fact is that he communicated with us a couple days before the trip and said that he could not go and he could not send a representative.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
Did he tell you why? I don't recall whether he did or not.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Mr. Adams, this case, Mr. Adams made a very clear.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
General Lawton, you did not know what he was going to do. How do you set the facts?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yes, sir.

25:16.000 --> 25:23.000
Just go now and ask you more about General Lawton, a little later in your direct examination, but file over to set the General Lawton.

25:23.000 --> 25:35.000
And I ask you whether or not at all times General Lawton was most cooperating with the McCarthy Committee in the investigation of the interrogation of Mr. First Chief Woodman.

25:35.000 --> 25:44.000
He was, sir, the only time since any time we ever had a General Lawton file as I recall it was, that there was a question of the General's mind at one point.

25:44.000 --> 25:51.000
As the Lemme even get in trouble, if he allowed us to continue interviewing, conducting staff interviewing of people who worked at Fort Lama.

25:51.000 --> 26:00.000
I took that matter up with Mr. Stevens personally, and Mr. Stevens called General Lawton and said that the both interviews could be conducted and they were.

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
I know of no incident with General Lawton without any proper cooperation from the McCarthy Committee.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
I may ask you whether or not the interview to which you appear with the interview of November speaks.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
That was our public section.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Well, I'll come.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Here, I'm backing off to it.

26:17.000 --> 26:25.000
I might say that General Lawton, we knew when we were in the investigation, all while we had not met General Lawton personally.

26:25.000 --> 26:36.000
We knew by reputation that General Lawton had no use for communists, and we knew that General Lawton was very unhappy about the fact that he had.
