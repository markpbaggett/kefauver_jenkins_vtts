00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
The temporary confusion of the table was entroning over the monogamy transcripts to Mr.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.480
Saul Horowitz of the committee staff, who accepted them to have the check.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.880
Many will come to our ear.

00:14.880 --> 00:21.760
The chair would like to begin as is accustomed by welcoming our guest to the committee room.

00:21.760 --> 00:28.960
He seemed to be here and even unusually large numbers today and consequently this admonition,

00:29.360 --> 00:32.560
perhaps should be voiced and even stern or tone.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.120
To question you that we have a standing rule of the committee that there are to be no

00:37.120 --> 00:42.960
manifestations of approval or disapproval of any time and any time during the courses of the

00:42.960 --> 00:49.920
here. The uniformed officers and the trained clothesmen in the audience have instructions from

00:49.920 --> 00:54.960
the committee to remove immediately from the room without any further notice from the chair.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.720
Any of our guests to violate the terms by which you enter the room namely to refrain from

01:00.720 --> 01:08.160
multiple manifestations of approval or disapproval. They will remove you politely but it will be done

01:08.160 --> 01:11.680
immediately and we hope it will not be necessary and I'm sure it will not.

01:12.720 --> 01:19.120
As we concluded the morning session, Council Jenkins was engaged in the direct examination

01:20.080 --> 01:25.360
of Roy Colm and Council Jenkins will continue now with his direct examination.

01:26.080 --> 01:32.080
When that is concluded be it this afternoon or tomorrow evening he will then take off his hat

01:32.080 --> 01:37.360
and begin the direct examination and he is due over all the Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde.

01:42.960 --> 01:48.720
Mr. Colm and we recessed to them and now I was examining you with respect to the

01:48.720 --> 01:55.600
events of October 14th. At which time you together with certain members of your staff

01:56.560 --> 01:59.360
were we the second day of the Army and Mr. Hyde.

02:00.720 --> 02:06.000
As I will call on you have recounted in some detail and I'm not sure whether you have concluded

02:06.000 --> 02:13.680
or not. Certain events leaving up to the meeting of October 14th which you said were insignificant

02:13.760 --> 02:19.680
to the events of October 14th. Have you not concluded with recounting those events?

02:19.680 --> 02:23.920
That's right though I think I was about to conclude the file serving

02:23.920 --> 02:30.080
incident by my continued file. I have concluded to call on them now and conclude that the

02:30.080 --> 02:34.000
statements you were making have the time with this committee respect.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.560
Yes. Anyway it became very apparent that the call and file had been stripped and stripped

02:42.560 --> 02:48.240
of the very information which we wanted. Between the time we had seen it out at Fort Monmouth

02:48.240 --> 02:54.240
and the time Mr. Adams or members of the staff my think it was Mr. Adams himself had delivered it

02:54.240 --> 03:02.080
to our staff for use in the course of the executive session. We took the matter up with the Army right

03:02.880 --> 03:07.680
then and there after it became clear that the material had been stripped from the file.

03:08.640 --> 03:14.880
Senator McCarty. How was positive it was that I went over and talked to Mr. Adams.

03:14.880 --> 03:23.600
Checked. There we go. Senator McCarty Mr. Adams I don't know how much he said I told him that

03:23.600 --> 03:29.200
the material was just missing from the file. Period. We had a copy of it. We knew what happened

03:29.200 --> 03:35.760
in there and it wasn't there now. Senator I went back and reported to Senator McCarty.

03:35.840 --> 03:42.800
The senator was considerably disturbed about it and he asked me to make a statement for the record

03:42.800 --> 03:51.600
in the presence of Secretary Steven and Mr. Adams indicating that the committee had been

03:51.600 --> 03:57.920
imposed upon to the extent that vital information in the Coleman case which happened in the file

03:57.920 --> 04:04.800
has been stripped by somebody in the Army before the photos of a copy was delivered to us.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.920
I made that statement at Senator McCarty's direction there. It sure and it has followed.

04:13.120 --> 04:20.080
I'm reading from page 642 of the minutes of that date. Mr. Coleman and by the way Aaron Coleman

04:20.080 --> 04:25.440
was on the stand. Mr. Coleman and I was addressing myself as the senator's direction to Secretary Steven.

04:26.160 --> 04:32.720
Mr. Secretary we want to call your attention to the fact that at this time we were down in

04:32.720 --> 04:39.760
the moment and the Army made available as it has and has gotten and has had all government agencies

04:39.760 --> 04:46.640
to personnel files not the loyalty and security files but the personnel files of various people

04:46.640 --> 04:54.000
under investigation. We assumed the file of Mr. Coleman and took Coltonet's note from us and as

04:54.000 --> 05:00.880
a matter of fact some documents were of very great interest and we made verbatim copies of them

05:01.680 --> 05:06.000
and that is taking the files with us and bringing them back here. They asked us over at

05:06.000 --> 05:11.040
moments if we would let them make photos that and they would have their records complete. We agreed

05:11.040 --> 05:17.280
to that and when the photos got to life we found the files had been stripped of some of the most

05:17.280 --> 05:23.920
relevant documents. It so happened that some of the documents of which we had made verbatim copies

05:23.920 --> 05:29.680
were missing. We wanted to call out the irritants. In the case of the Coleman file

05:29.760 --> 05:36.080
there had been removed from all the documents indicated the search of his home by the security

05:36.080 --> 05:40.720
and intelligence division and the fact that he had been suspended and the fact that these

05:40.720 --> 05:46.480
classified documents had been removed by him from the evidence-fignal laboratory and found

05:46.480 --> 05:51.440
in his house. I might say with reference to the word suspended after these documents,

05:51.440 --> 05:56.240
Coleman with Coltonet's documents they suspended him for ten days and then put him right back

05:56.240 --> 06:01.040
very wide in the secret radar laboratory. So I made that statement to Jenkins. Thomas

06:01.040 --> 06:08.320
achievement and Mr. Adam on October 4th at the Direction of Federal Department. Before

06:08.320 --> 06:13.040
getting away from Coleman you stated that he was suspended for ten days and then reinstated.

06:13.040 --> 06:18.320
What did he later suspended? He was suspended after investigation after that.

06:19.600 --> 06:25.200
The statement that I might say Mr. Jenkins there is also a lot of detail on that case.

06:25.920 --> 06:31.520
There have been an attempt, a recommendation as I understand it by the security officer at

06:31.520 --> 06:37.040
moment on more than one occasion to have Coleman suspended which has been rejected. Until

06:37.040 --> 06:41.520
General Watten came along and removed the security clearance until he was finally suspended.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.160
Mr. Coleman did you release the statements that you have just released from my memoranda?

06:46.720 --> 06:52.400
Are you a child? We did not on that occasion. But the business is just a six-year-old army.

06:52.480 --> 06:57.440
Oh yes, I'm just to have him. Yes, Mr. Lieutenant McArthur wanted it to be right on the

06:57.440 --> 07:03.920
record and wanted them to know that we were making a record of the fact that this file which

07:03.920 --> 07:08.800
has been represented as a complete file has been stripped and stripped of just what we wanted from.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.920
The insured was the signature of the position of the time that he hadn't been handed a phone

07:13.920 --> 07:20.000
about to me. I get that about it or what we wanted was out of the file. But the explanation

07:20.000 --> 07:23.600
is that all of them is Mr. Steven Drainy. What else can make you do the army?

07:23.600 --> 07:30.560
Think you would expect to be a late shipping event file on Coleman. I already called up that time.

07:30.560 --> 07:34.480
Mr. Steven said nothing. I don't think the other said anything about it. Mr. Hatton

07:36.560 --> 07:44.560
forced us after him. I think it bailed for a later. Instead, that the file had been stripped

07:44.640 --> 07:50.800
and his office by some of his withdrawal had supported him. By some of his Indians.

07:50.800 --> 07:57.120
And his office, I didn't get that information, Mr. Adam Greenford, the people who worked for him as his

07:57.120 --> 08:03.600
Indian. Indian, Indian. And he said that the file had been stripped by some of his Indians.

08:06.880 --> 08:12.000
No, he had to be fired by whom and he said that he was driving us out by whom.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.720
Did he indicate whether or not it was fixed? Did this consent or not? His direction?

08:16.720 --> 08:20.960
No, sir. He did not indicate that. That's awesome. By key implied it had not been done,

08:20.960 --> 08:26.880
which is consent and added direction. Did he hear me? The explanation is the way he was in the

08:26.880 --> 08:32.080
instance of that file. Yes, he told us the explanation of what the given was because of

08:32.080 --> 08:37.600
Coleman information. The part we were interested in, could he have considered either personal

08:37.600 --> 08:45.200
information or as loyalty security information. And if the loyalty and security information,

08:45.200 --> 08:49.360
a case could be made after the fact that it has been put in the wrong file. It didn't belong in

08:49.360 --> 08:56.240
the first NL file, but belonged in another file. So that it was stripped out of the personnel file

08:56.240 --> 09:00.400
before the personnel file was given with by the theory that it should not have been in there

09:00.400 --> 09:05.600
in the first place. I pointed out to Mr. Adam that the case has been treated back at that time

09:05.600 --> 09:10.960
as a personnel matter. And not as a loyalty security matter, but the information was properly

09:10.960 --> 09:18.080
in the file that it had been there for some years. And I made it pretty clear that it was quite

09:18.080 --> 09:24.720
obvious to us the reason it had been stripped out was to stop us from finding out that Coleman

09:24.720 --> 09:28.960
had been caught with these documents and that no action has been taken to remove and

09:28.960 --> 09:33.840
caught by him as a part of it. We got a letter from Mr. Adam, a couple of days later.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.800
I think two or three days later, not letters in the record here stating that,

09:40.080 --> 09:43.360
essentially as I said here, that the information should not have been in the file.

09:43.920 --> 09:48.320
It was admitting that it had been stripped from the file, but saying that it would be

09:48.320 --> 09:53.680
construed as loyalty information, that's why it was stripped from the file. But since we found out

09:53.680 --> 09:59.200
that it was stripped from the file and we knew what was in it anyway, they would give us what

09:59.200 --> 10:04.960
they had taken from the file. And they did give it to us, which of course we had had copies of it

10:04.960 --> 10:09.200
already. Has that letter been here before you knew? Yes, that was in just a week,

10:09.200 --> 10:15.760
across the family, Mr. Steven Dormister. I think it was in just seasons about it and that letter was

10:15.760 --> 10:21.200
for those that are in the record. Now, Mr. Coleman, you stated prior to the move to the state,

10:22.080 --> 10:28.080
that there were two significant events of obstacle-booking. You have related to only one of them?

10:28.080 --> 10:32.160
Yes, sir. Mr. Johnson, you can take into another country to share this through the lecture now,

10:32.160 --> 10:34.960
trying to sign in and send them a call and let the hands,

10:35.680 --> 10:40.000
the few minutes in connection with the Senator William Memorial Services on the throw at

10:40.000 --> 10:47.360
a tennis table. Well, seven minutes to now. Mr. Coleman, I will now excuse to tell the members

10:47.360 --> 10:56.080
of this committee what the second event of obstacle-booking was. The second event is the

10:56.080 --> 11:04.560
association was the appearance of Major General, first the commanding general at fourth

11:04.560 --> 11:08.480
month before the subcommittee. That was in the night session.

11:10.160 --> 11:15.120
Did he not go in the wrong position? Just about that time. Yes, there he gave probably the most

11:15.120 --> 11:21.600
important testimony of the whole investigation. As he was told, as the testimony given the

11:21.600 --> 11:26.400
general on the medical issue, Mr. Coleman was there any unfortunate events of courage?

11:26.400 --> 11:31.840
Yes, sir. Now, what was that? The way it happened was that General Martin was called in

11:31.840 --> 11:36.400
before the committee as the commanding general at fourth-mindment, so it's no more about all this

11:36.400 --> 11:45.120
than anyone else. He testified and, if the Jenkins E, were there about the whole situation of

11:45.120 --> 11:49.040
security risks and people of timing and affiliation up his mind, that's why Senator McCartney.

11:49.360 --> 11:56.640
Then Senator McCartney and Mr. Anderson, Mr. Kennedy were put in no turn. The secretary has left

11:56.640 --> 12:02.400
during the morning session. I don't know where he went. Mr. Anderson was there.

12:02.400 --> 12:07.040
At an evening session, that was an evening session. Mr. Anderson was there,

12:07.040 --> 12:10.640
especially in the tail of that day. I believe it to be the very session.

12:10.640 --> 12:17.280
General Martin was questioned by Senator McCartney about the fact that the security risk

12:17.280 --> 12:21.280
through the assault of suspending very recently, people with timing and affiliation,

12:21.280 --> 12:26.240
people with connections with Rosenberg, people with patient secret documents out of the radar

12:26.240 --> 12:33.200
laboratory, General McCartney wanted to know why. It has taken so long to get them out of

12:33.200 --> 12:38.480
these secret radar laboratories. I think he said to General Martin, General I can see it's only

12:38.480 --> 12:43.360
been in the last few months. He's been able to do anything about it. General Martin has no turn.

12:43.360 --> 12:49.120
It is not in the last few months. I have been trying for a year, but it is only in the last two

12:49.120 --> 12:54.480
or three weeks that I have been able to do something about it. General Martin went on to make

12:54.480 --> 13:00.240
clear and respond to questions that it was close to the action of the truck committee

13:00.240 --> 13:06.080
and conducting its investigation that these security risks were finally gotten out of the secret radar

13:06.080 --> 13:12.800
laboratory. General Martin had received cooperation from his superior only when

13:13.360 --> 13:18.800
Senator McCartney and the FUF committee entered the field and began looking into the matter.

13:18.800 --> 13:23.600
So, did that general Martin just as matter that he did sir and Senator McCartney maybe

13:23.600 --> 13:25.920
have a record of that testimony? I do sir.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.520
They will.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.720
Well, it will be.

13:28.720 --> 13:35.200
The last thing in the Laws and FFM that was very significant was Senator McCartney truck

13:35.200 --> 13:41.040
General Martin has the why of law that only in the last two or three weeks that the

13:41.040 --> 13:46.640
act of action has been taken. Why it's possible? Action by the FUF committee. Why is it

13:46.640 --> 13:51.440
an investigation by the FUF committee to do something which it's not sure if it's done a long time before?

13:53.040 --> 13:58.320
General Martin, I might say, did not think particularly anxious to go into the action. He finally

13:58.320 --> 14:04.000
let it stand just about this way. He said something to the effect. I know that very well,

14:04.000 --> 14:09.120
Senator and I could tell you, but please bear in mind I worked for Mr. Stevens and I had better

14:09.120 --> 14:12.880
tonight. I have that testimony right?

14:12.880 --> 14:12.880


14:12.880 --> 14:15.520
Why would he put Senator McCartney?

14:15.520 --> 14:20.080
I don't believe he was. It was obvious that he did not want to be in the position of the

14:21.520 --> 14:28.160
critical office of Stevens and the administration then in the Army and I don't believe he was

14:28.160 --> 14:29.200
pressed further on that point.

14:29.200 --> 14:35.120
I told you whether or not Mr. Adams can read just that information to the Secretary of the Army.

14:35.120 --> 14:35.760
I'm sure he did.

14:35.760 --> 14:43.360
Are any other significant events of a civil force-teach-shitting life on which charges made by

14:43.360 --> 14:46.560
you and Senator McCartney against Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams?

14:46.560 --> 14:50.480
Yes, I might say this Mr. Jenkins, I have the particular excerpt from General Martin's

14:50.480 --> 14:54.240
testimony right here. I might suppose it speaks very well for itself.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.800
It is your, it is your, it is your, yes sir.

14:56.800 --> 15:01.840
You noted that there may be no misunderstanding, whatever with respect to the testimony of General

15:01.840 --> 15:03.840
Martin on that occasion. I would like to do that.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.640
We need Mr. Collins.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.440
Thank you sir.

15:05.440 --> 15:11.840
The Chairman, meeting Senator McCartney.

15:11.840 --> 15:17.600
Let me see if we can ask some questions that will not put you on the spot as far as violating

15:17.600 --> 15:21.360
the regulations concerned. Can we phrase the question this way?

15:22.160 --> 15:27.920
Would you say that since you have taken over and especially over the past six months,

15:27.920 --> 15:34.080
you have been working to get rid of the accumulation of security risk in the signal squad

15:34.080 --> 15:38.720
and that you have suspended a sizable number and you are working throughout getting rid of

15:38.720 --> 15:44.000
all of those who now consider royalty or security risk. We've got the eight states.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.800
General Martin, that is a question. I will answer yet.

15:49.520 --> 15:53.600
But don't go back six months. Let us go back.

15:53.600 --> 15:59.680
The last two weeks of effective results have been in the offings in the last two weeks.

16:00.480 --> 16:07.840
I have been working for the last 21 months trying to accomplish what is being accomplished in the

16:07.840 --> 16:14.080
last two weeks. The Chairman, I think that covers that. So like you would say that in the

16:14.080 --> 16:21.120
past couple weeks, you are getting some effective results. General Martin, absolutely that we have

16:21.120 --> 16:26.720
not gotten for the last four years. The Chairman, and you have the complete cooperation of the

16:26.720 --> 16:31.760
Secretary of the Army and this I understand. General Martin, absolutely, and things are moving.

16:32.560 --> 16:40.640
The Chairman, could you tell us why it is only in the last two or three weeks that you are getting

16:40.720 --> 16:49.680
to be effective results? General Martin, yes, one I have seven or nine. I know that so well,

16:51.520 --> 16:53.360
but I am working for Mississippi.

16:57.280 --> 17:05.120
Now, after that testimony, Mr. Jenkins, let me ask you a question now, Mr. Homefeel brother.

17:06.080 --> 17:13.440
Up to that time, as you ever heard anything, I was referenced to Mr. Holmes,

17:13.440 --> 17:18.640
the leading of General Martin of his command, the Secretary of the Army, not a word.

17:18.640 --> 17:25.680
Not a word. Now, if you sometime later, sometime later, learn of such a proposed

17:25.680 --> 17:31.520
basis like this. So now, we will get to that sometime later on. I had enough to see you start

17:31.520 --> 17:34.560
the makeup statement. I was going to address myself to that very point.

17:37.920 --> 17:45.680
Answer this testimony was given. I think the next day, Mr. Adams indicated that he was not

17:45.680 --> 17:54.080
to throw happy about it and that General Martin, that he was not pleased with General Martin,

17:54.080 --> 17:57.920
that was on October 15th. I believe that was around the 15th or 16th.

17:57.920 --> 18:04.640
And you recount as nearly as possible precisely what Mr. Hatham said. He said,

18:04.640 --> 18:11.360
then, and he said many times later, the touch of government, Mr. Jenkins, why? That he thought that

18:12.640 --> 18:21.840
he thought that General Martin had talked too much, that General Martin had no right to put

18:21.840 --> 18:29.600
the ceiling down his thoughts and what Senator McCarthy knows that a type of action in the

18:29.600 --> 18:34.960
investigation has come only after Senator McCarthy and this committee had entered the picture.

18:35.600 --> 18:40.800
And he was very much annoyed at General Martin from that point on.

18:40.800 --> 18:45.200
Who would Mr. Adams make those statements? He's calling to make him my nose.

18:45.200 --> 18:50.160
Senator McCarthy. Oh, yeah, he knew that Mr. Adams was very unhappy.

18:51.120 --> 18:59.520
There they are. Now, Mr. Kohn, is there anything you have significant as of the 14th and 15th

18:59.520 --> 19:05.360
of October? Nothing within my own personal knowledge, sir. There is another significant item that

19:05.360 --> 19:10.960
will be testified to by someone else. Shall we take now to the 19th of October's

19:11.920 --> 19:18.720
I would like to tell the committee Mr. Kohn, what for Kirdom, October 19th, the snails, the

19:18.720 --> 19:24.800
Peasant Mains, upon the issue of this conversation on the stopping of the investigation, life.

19:26.960 --> 19:34.800
Sometime prior to October 19th, I think over the weekend before, I told John Adams that I was going

19:34.800 --> 19:41.760
to go down to Fort Leinmas that I was going to accompany Senator McCarthy. Some other staff

19:41.760 --> 19:47.840
members might be going with us. I believe I told them that Mr. Rainbow, the very able assistance

19:47.840 --> 19:53.360
to Senator Durkson and the Bob Jones, the very able assistance to Senator Potter, we're going

19:53.360 --> 19:59.040
to go down to represent Senator Durkson and Senator Potter. But we were going to go through the

19:59.040 --> 20:05.280
evidence signal laboratory to see just where Aaron Coleman has been working. We wanted to look

20:05.280 --> 20:11.440
at the security setup and we had plans to talk to a number of witnesses down there. In other words,

20:11.440 --> 20:15.760
Senator McCarthy decided it would lead everybody's convenience to have some harmless

20:15.760 --> 20:21.040
pot worked on Senate Fort Leinmas. Mr. Senator, I believe you're right, Mr. Secretary.

20:21.040 --> 20:27.200
Senator, we were going down without any regard to Mr. Stevens on the throughout of the

20:27.200 --> 20:33.680
story. Mr. Adams either told me back or in a subsequent conversation, told me that he had told

20:33.680 --> 20:39.520
Mr. Stevens and that Mr. Stevens was likewise planning to strip down the Fort Leinmas and

20:39.520 --> 20:45.120
told it would be a very nice thing if we could all go down there together. And would I

20:45.120 --> 20:50.800
pass out along to Senator McCarthy and give him a drop of Senate? I communicated with

20:50.800 --> 20:57.200
Senator in some way or other. He said he had no objection at all to going down with Mr.

20:57.200 --> 21:03.360
Stevens and then anyone that Stevens wanted to bring along. I reported that back to Mr. Adams

21:03.360 --> 21:10.080
and the now famous trip of October 20 to Fort Leinmas was arranged.

21:10.080 --> 21:14.800
Well, there was nothing served by Mr. Adams to you, with respect to having prepared a

21:14.800 --> 21:22.400
hope to release to be given the post. I'm not a kid yet. How are you, Mr. Davis?

21:22.400 --> 21:29.280
Yes. No. I'm a little bit more respect for October 20.

21:30.640 --> 21:36.560
On October 19, as I recall, I was down here in White. I might say to the circumstances

21:36.560 --> 21:42.320
straight, Senator Lamont at that time was presiding in the chairman of a subcommittee,

21:42.320 --> 21:49.840
the Office of Committee, which was conducting hearings on the plot of a communist firing.

21:50.480 --> 21:56.000
The plot of communist firing had played in causing various officials of the United States government

21:56.880 --> 22:04.720
back a few years ago to actually deliver money play that the United States Treasury Department

22:04.720 --> 22:09.920
and the United States Mint chose the Soviet government. If none of the money was presiding in that

22:09.920 --> 22:15.840
investigation here in London and conducting open hearings showing the pattern of communist

22:15.840 --> 22:19.840
infiltration tonight in the Treasury and State Department, I believe, in how these

22:19.840 --> 22:26.480
communists and those two departments had used pressure to get our government to agree to shift

22:26.480 --> 22:31.680
for the first time in history the money play from the United States Mint over to the Soviet

22:31.680 --> 22:37.200
government. They were money played for occupation current theme journalists. We were all working

22:37.200 --> 22:43.840
to a greater or lesser degree assisting Senator Lamont in the preparation for executive sessions

22:43.840 --> 22:50.400
and public hearings in that case. It became obvious that not all of us could go up to force

22:50.400 --> 22:56.000
amendments. The part of the staff would say and help the Assemblyman ministerial for Senator Lamont,

22:56.000 --> 23:02.800
who had come back, I know, from South Dakota to conduct these hearings. We agreed that I would

23:02.800 --> 23:09.200
go up to my Mr. that Mr. Rainbow and Mr. Jones representing Senator Dertian and Senator Potter

23:09.200 --> 23:15.040
would come along and we advise Mr. Adams of just who would be in our party. Mr. Carr,

23:15.040 --> 23:20.640
as I recall it did not call but stayed and worked at the hearings with Senator Martin.

23:22.240 --> 23:27.280
Mr. Adams, I was down here on Monday the 19th. Mr. Adams,

23:28.080 --> 23:32.880
telephone and that is where the press release first came on.

23:34.240 --> 23:38.400
Now, Carr just what stood by Mr. Adams to give respect to the press release with

23:38.400 --> 23:43.360
whom he will please. As I recall Mr. Adams,

23:44.400 --> 23:52.000
totally for the first time on the morning of October 19th that he was preparing a press release

23:52.080 --> 23:58.800
which he wanted Senator McCarthy to issue down as Fort Monument the next day.

24:03.360 --> 24:09.840
He told me that I don't recall his words. He said, I think that he had a rough draft or made some

24:09.840 --> 24:18.000
notes and what he wanted Senator McCarthy to say and he would like to read that to me over the

24:18.000 --> 24:26.000
telephone. I listen and he read something to me. He was a copy of what he read to you,

24:26.000 --> 24:30.320
which called no. We have not had in this committee room a copy of what he first read to me.

24:30.320 --> 24:35.280
Do you remember the camera of the document he read to you? I remember the tenor very well.

24:36.400 --> 24:41.120
He said to the committee when he was smart. The tenor of it was that Mr. Adams wanted

24:41.120 --> 24:45.840
Senator McCarthy to say publicly in the next day at my minutes that this stuff committee was going to

24:46.800 --> 24:53.120
fill out of the investigation of Fort Monument and wait for you to see Mr. Adams.

24:53.120 --> 24:58.480
Have you ever promised to do so? No. Have you ever promised to do so? Never.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.160
Did Senator McCarthy do your knowledge ever promised to bow out?

25:03.040 --> 25:06.640
I was up for Fort Monument in 30th. Do you think he'd go over to the Army? No.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.320
Did you know why Mr. Adams prepared such a document Mr. Cole?

25:13.280 --> 25:18.320
I think the reason, sir. But what did you think was the read he wanted?

25:18.320 --> 25:22.720
You know, Mr. McCarthy so announced publicly and I will be bound by that announcement.

25:22.720 --> 25:28.880
That's the key in the committee. We're just going to stop investigating the Fort Monument situation.

25:28.880 --> 25:34.720
What's the guy that you made to him when he raised that stuff in which he was received the

25:34.720 --> 25:39.360
amount of Fort Monument? He read and a couple of sentences and what we do have here, sir,

25:40.400 --> 25:45.920
such as Mr. Adams wanting to send him a copy to say I have every confidence that Secretary

25:45.920 --> 25:51.360
Stevens and the Army will move immediately and effectively to continue the investigation

25:51.360 --> 25:55.120
all that he undertaken by the stuff committee. And then again, Mr. Adams,

25:55.760 --> 26:00.320
said I believe that our recent hearings have brought their names, meaning those of the people

26:00.320 --> 26:06.160
who are timing this record. Out and that's from here forward. The Army should be able to finish

26:06.160 --> 26:11.680
the job we have started. That's what he wanted himself to put. He wanted Senator McCarthy to say.

26:13.280 --> 26:20.160
When I heard it, my question was, what was your reply to Mr. Adams when you heard him?

26:20.160 --> 26:27.440
My reply at the start was that I was telephone Senator McCarthy and repeating him in

26:27.440 --> 26:32.240
the best I said what Mr. Adams wanted to say, that I would make a very fair presentation of

26:32.240 --> 26:39.200
what Mr. Adams wanted him to say, but that I had, that didn't make Mr. Adams to have any confidence

26:39.200 --> 26:44.320
that Senator McCarthy would say. Did you tell the phone Senator McCarthy in a private

26:44.320 --> 26:48.720
manner? Did you recall the Senator's reaction? I do.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.480
I will without using all of his words with gold.

26:52.480 --> 27:01.680
And by way of proper exposition, you tell him that's good what Mr. Sanders did.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.560
The answer was no. The answer was no.

27:04.560 --> 27:13.120
I can say this much more. The Senator said he had no intention of stopping the investigation.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.920
He didn't see why he should be called upon to say that he was trying to do it.

27:18.000 --> 27:25.040
And that he would not say so. I called Mr. Adams back and I said that as I had predicted to him,

27:25.840 --> 27:31.200
the answer was no and that the Senator was not a full receptive to Mr. Adams.

27:31.200 --> 27:31.440
Yes.

27:33.520 --> 27:38.640
Now you know, I might say this again. I said I went on to tell him that Senator McCarthy

27:38.640 --> 27:45.440
had said since we're going to hold executive sessions, since we're going to hold public hearing,

27:45.520 --> 27:49.440
there doesn't seem much sense in my coming out and say what's saying we're not going to do it.

27:49.440 --> 27:54.000
I told that to Mr. Adams and I said that the Senator said that this would be an act or

27:54.000 --> 27:58.320
how could he say he's going to stop the investigation when he was very clear on the subject that

27:58.320 --> 28:01.760
he was going to hold executive sessions and public hearing. And what's the panel? There's a

28:01.760 --> 28:05.280
matter of fact to meet you from time to time there after whole booths,

28:05.280 --> 28:14.640
private and public sessions we did. Now, Antroy, so Mr. Adams with Senator McCarthy and said that he

28:14.640 --> 28:20.400
wouldn't say we were going to stop and that's affirmatively he had every intention of continuing

28:21.440 --> 28:25.760
and that he would hold executive sessions and public hearing. Mr. Adams said something to the

28:25.760 --> 28:30.320
effect. I'll put that in there too. That you're going to hold Senator McCarthy is going to hold

28:30.320 --> 28:33.360
executive sessions and public hearing. Suppose I add that onto him.

28:35.520 --> 28:42.240
Maybe that'll look better. I don't recall what if any reply I made to that,

28:42.480 --> 28:46.800
but I do recall what happened later that afternoon. We'll want to happen later that day to me.

28:46.800 --> 28:51.680
Because I recall it, I was walking through three, five, seven. I haven't spotted the look up

28:51.680 --> 28:55.120
and see what was going on but there was some kind of a committee hearing on the way or some kind

28:55.120 --> 29:00.560
of a meeting. And a messenger from Mr. Adams offered to him to the door with an envelope from me.

29:02.160 --> 29:09.520
It contained a draft of a statement which Mr. Adams wanted Senator McCarthy to make publicly the

29:09.520 --> 29:15.760
next day. As such I could figure out, it was just what Mr. Adams had read to me originally.

29:17.360 --> 29:21.440
With the exception of the fact, he had added on a paragraph at the end saying,

29:21.440 --> 29:26.080
after having said it to the beginning, Senator McCarthy was spotted in that

29:26.080 --> 29:31.040
investigation. Mr. Adams added on a paragraph at the end saying, but executive sessions and public

29:31.040 --> 29:37.920
hearing would be held. So it seems to have felt what the item should be said and added on when I

29:37.920 --> 29:42.720
saw Mr. Adams at a number of things. He was kind of those. He knew one was a clarification. He was the other.

29:44.320 --> 29:49.360
I don't know just what it was, sir, but many, but he, he did work in the opinion of conversation.

29:49.360 --> 29:52.320
Oh, it's not the answer. It's not the answer. It's not the answer. It's not the answer.

29:52.320 --> 29:57.520
It's not the answer. It's not the answer. They were. And Mr. Adams was produced when we were

29:57.520 --> 30:03.520
clicked and we came about this a draft of a statement and I have no reason to doubt that

30:03.520 --> 30:09.440
it's a statement. He sent over that afternoon that contains the language I read. I believe having

30:09.440 --> 30:13.920
when it's right and wanted to put it in the McCarthy to say, quote, I believe that our recent hearings

30:13.920 --> 30:20.080
have brought the names of these the versions out and that from here forward, the army should be able

30:20.080 --> 30:25.040
to finish the job we have thought. He then goes on to say there are still some witnesses under

30:25.040 --> 30:30.400
the penalized subcommittee and they will be heard later this week in New York and executive sessions.

30:30.400 --> 30:35.920
Following these hearings, it is our burden plan to hold open hearings on the same subject,

30:35.920 --> 30:40.560
probably in New York. So you haven't one far in your ass. But you wanted to send it and say we're

30:40.560 --> 30:46.080
stopping it. And the next paragraph, he tried to embody the sentence, but that made it clear that we

30:46.080 --> 30:50.400
were not stopping it. We were going to continue. And if I get to just the words you have said,

30:50.400 --> 30:58.000
that's a original statement. Maybe that you were marrying out to the speech, putting your investigation

30:58.080 --> 31:03.280
that's on so many words. And that was where you are on the phone. And you convey it to the senators,

31:03.280 --> 31:08.480
message to him that he can be expected to continue. And when it was the life statements were

31:08.480 --> 31:13.040
added. That's my recollection. They've been not documented without those life statements with the

31:13.040 --> 31:19.360
code. I will ask you whether or not you can choose that as a network or any claims from the part of

31:19.440 --> 31:24.160
the army. I wish you could give them to me to add on that too.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.880
then

31:36.180 --> 31:38.480
you
