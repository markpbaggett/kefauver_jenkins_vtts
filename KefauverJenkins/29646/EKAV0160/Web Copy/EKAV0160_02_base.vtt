WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
I'm getting indicated in that opening statement within the hearing of people who will testify

00:07.720 --> 00:08.720
on this hearing.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.120
So the effect of this is the declaration of war.

00:12.120 --> 00:22.160
I say that when language, right, that is the use, it's very strong language, Senator.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.380
Right now, you say it's right, you say it's right, and you say it's right.

00:25.380 --> 00:27.380
But do this have a new time?

00:27.380 --> 00:31.380
What's the case with Mr. Cohn being excluded from the laboratories?

00:31.380 --> 00:33.380
As they've been let down there?

00:33.380 --> 00:34.380
That's right.

00:34.380 --> 00:36.380
All right, now, this has nothing to do with private time.

00:36.380 --> 00:39.380
It's all part of a pattern in my opinion, Senator.

00:39.380 --> 00:41.380
Well, now I'm a true secretary.

00:41.380 --> 00:44.380
Did this have anything to do with private time?

00:44.380 --> 00:51.380
Was it not, if you'd describe and exclude Mr. Cohn from the monolith laboratories,

00:51.380 --> 00:56.380
didn't Mr. Cohn tell you that he hoped for some day that he would have as much success

00:56.380 --> 00:59.380
and being able to get into the laboratory as the communists were having?

00:59.380 --> 01:03.380
I hope I told you last time that it was the case of ribbing you rather fairly.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.380
But no, sir, it was not ribbing.

01:05.380 --> 01:06.380
No.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.380
Does the column look deadly serious?

01:07.380 --> 01:08.380
Or let's say it's serious.

01:08.380 --> 01:10.380
Did that have anything to do with time?

01:10.380 --> 01:11.380
Yes, it did.

01:11.380 --> 01:12.380
It was part one of the patterns.

01:12.380 --> 01:15.380
Or what did he say about time when you told him he couldn't even get into the secret?

01:15.380 --> 01:22.380
Well, the subject of Mr. Cohn has been a subject of conversation on a number of the cases prior to that time.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.380
But how about this location?

01:24.380 --> 01:25.380
It's a picture.

01:25.380 --> 01:27.380
What's the science that's like now?

01:27.380 --> 01:28.380
We're down in Fort Monmouth.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.380
That's right.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.380
We were going through the laboratory.

01:32.380 --> 01:34.380
The left right, that's right.

01:34.380 --> 01:39.380
And as we went through the laboratories, we were discussing the various types of the equipment.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.380
The left right, that's right.

01:41.380 --> 01:43.380
And the importance of that equipment.

01:44.380 --> 01:45.380
The left right, yes.

01:45.380 --> 01:54.380
And the UNI and the virus all that day had a perfectly friendly discussion to the danger that could this nation,

01:54.380 --> 01:57.380
if they commenced in an access to those laboratories.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.380
That's right.

01:58.380 --> 02:01.380
Part of the assumptions of our conversation.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.380
Well, I don't remember all of that details.

02:03.380 --> 02:06.380
I mean, roughly one minute, I don't remember that he called that detail.

02:06.380 --> 02:08.380
I'm not asking you to remember details.

02:08.380 --> 02:11.380
But the UNI had put a couple of hours down there at all.

02:12.380 --> 02:19.380
We were discussing the radar equipment, our investigation, the importance of security at Fort Monmouth.

02:19.380 --> 02:20.380
That's right.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.380
We were not discussing some pilot in the Army.

02:22.380 --> 02:24.380
We were discussing that that's right.

02:24.380 --> 02:26.380
We were discussing inspection of Fort Monmouth.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.380
We were not discussing any pilot in the Army.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.380
We were not there, but I've heard this.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.380
Well, I mean, I'll answer it in a second.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.380
Were we discussing a pilot in the Army?

02:35.380 --> 02:36.380
No.

02:37.380 --> 02:44.380
When Mr. Cohn was excluded from the laboratory, you say he got irritated about being excluded.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.380
That's certainly correct.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.380
All right, let's assume that's true.

02:48.380 --> 02:50.380
Well, I had nothing to do.

02:50.380 --> 02:52.380
That event, nothing to do, was a pilot in the Army.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.380
In my opinion, it did.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.380
Well, he talked about the crime of that time.

02:56.380 --> 02:59.380
Not about the security time, but on plenty of other times.

02:59.380 --> 03:05.380
You think he gets mad and not security as a student in the lab, but because of the victim's crime?

03:05.380 --> 03:10.380
I think he was mad at that particular time because of being excluded from the laboratory.

03:10.380 --> 03:14.380
Now, let's get back to the threats and connection with private chat.

03:14.380 --> 03:20.380
What threats were made to you in connection with private chat?

03:20.380 --> 03:22.380
I mean, let me read the specifications.

03:22.380 --> 03:24.380
I hope in any way to see you.

03:24.380 --> 03:27.380
Honor above November 14, 1953.

03:27.380 --> 03:33.380
Mr. Cohn, continue to continue the threats and many investigations on the Army installation of Fort Monmouth, New Jersey,

03:33.380 --> 03:39.380
which had 34 results in exaggerated headlines, damaging the morale of Fort Monmouth.

03:39.380 --> 03:42.380
Honor above November 16, 1953.

03:42.380 --> 03:51.380
Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn, renew the threats that are excited and firecracky 11 above this time directing them to Secretary Steven.

03:51.380 --> 03:57.380
Now, I could appear from this that perhaps the alleged threats on November 14 were not made to you

03:57.380 --> 04:02.380
because the specification number 12 says, when the 16, they rejected some to you.

04:02.380 --> 04:07.380
Let's go to the 16. Where was the meeting held that day?

04:07.380 --> 04:08.380
In my office.

04:08.380 --> 04:20.380
And I know we've gone over this before, but just to keep the analogy of events straight, we're over there during the station, we're over there at the skill spot.

04:20.380 --> 04:24.380
I don't recall that you're over there at my invitation.

04:24.380 --> 04:39.380
This meeting and I believe was arranged by members of your staff and the sequence of events, which the pertinent here is that I held a new conference on the 13th of November.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.380
And I made it, and I made a statement, let me answer this question.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.380
Please, let me answer this.

04:43.380 --> 04:46.380
Can I answer the question? Do you have any answer?

04:46.380 --> 04:55.380
And I made a statement to the press, but after that time, I knew no current FB and I support Mama.

04:55.380 --> 04:59.380
The press published that statement very well.

04:59.380 --> 05:03.380
President McCarthy and members of each staff did not like it.

05:03.380 --> 05:14.380
And Mr. Colman and Mr. Carp came over to my office to tell me that the President of the party itself, I pulled a rug out for my room.

05:14.380 --> 05:25.380
I said I had no such intention, and I was glad to go to New York and discuss the matter with President McCarthy, which I did on the 17th.

05:25.380 --> 05:37.380
But in the course of the meeting on the 16th, in my office, there was 20 of what was going to happen now.

05:38.380 --> 05:42.380
I think the council tells me that I may have misled you when I referred to the 16th.

05:42.380 --> 05:48.380
November 16 was the date that we had lunch, and it was November 6th that we had lunch on your office.

05:48.380 --> 05:52.380
And 16 meetings with the different meetings, right?

05:52.380 --> 05:56.380
But you just asked me about the number 6 meeting, and I just covered it.

05:56.380 --> 05:57.380
Hurry.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.380
All right, go ahead.

05:58.380 --> 06:06.380
Now, this, uh, I used to use my, uh, to say, uh, told you that I was on the map, about the press release you had managed.

06:06.380 --> 06:07.380
Correct.

06:07.380 --> 06:08.380
As a conference.

06:08.380 --> 06:09.380
Yes, sir.

06:09.380 --> 06:14.380
Uh, and I told you that, uh, the investigation would continue.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.380
Do that, right?

06:16.380 --> 06:18.380
Certainly, sir.

06:18.380 --> 06:23.380
And, uh, did that tell you it would have been continued because of private time?

06:23.380 --> 06:26.380
Thanks.

06:26.380 --> 06:32.380
They told me that, uh, you were very upset about this, uh, I said what I've made, son of it.

06:32.380 --> 06:36.380
They didn't tell you I was upset about private time, did they?

06:36.380 --> 06:39.380
Well, but there's incident rather than such a habit, then.

06:39.380 --> 06:41.380
All right, now let's look to the facts.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.380
Sorry.

06:42.380 --> 06:45.380
We let you recite the elements.

06:45.380 --> 06:50.380
No, on this particular day, when you say touch from man,

06:50.380 --> 06:56.380
that time they didn't tell you I was disturbed about, they told me army that told you I was disturbed about,

06:56.380 --> 07:00.380
a release with two maids, I considered unsure.

07:00.380 --> 07:03.380
I'm not that red-faced, son of it.

07:03.380 --> 07:04.380
Certainly.

07:04.380 --> 07:10.380
If I were to request him, I'd be sure to leave you this acceptable to a yes, then I would.

07:16.380 --> 07:19.380
Question, let's stick to the facts, Mr. Secretary.

07:19.380 --> 07:22.380
We let you recite the elements.

07:22.380 --> 07:26.380
Oh, let's particular dates, when you say touch from man, that's not time, they just...

07:26.380 --> 07:30.380
They didn't tell you I was disturbed about, he's private and I mean,

07:30.380 --> 07:34.380
they told you I was disturbed about it at least, with two maids,

07:34.380 --> 07:37.380
which I considered unfair, is that what they told you?

07:37.380 --> 07:39.380
No, unfair, unfair.

07:39.380 --> 07:42.380
Where's the unsurï¿½able report?

07:43.380 --> 07:46.380
I think the senator has said he doesn't care the first time he can change his picture.

07:46.380 --> 07:51.380
I think that was, uh, if the word was unfair, I think that's the other way.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.380
Yes, that's about what happened.

07:53.380 --> 07:58.380
So this discussion was not an attempt to give the preferential treatment for a private.

07:58.380 --> 08:03.380
This was a discussion about a press conference that you're now.

08:03.380 --> 08:06.380
All part of a pattern in my opinion, Senator, is starting.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.380
No, I'm not telling you this is a consideration.

08:08.380 --> 08:18.380
Was there a discussion that morning about the Army climate, or was the discussion about this press space?

08:18.380 --> 08:25.380
The discussion was a press play about the press statement and not about Trump.

08:25.380 --> 08:29.380
So the public family is excited, is that it?

08:29.380 --> 08:39.380
The secretary you asked, Senator McCrudden, whether or not he or Mr. Cohen or Mr. Carr have threatened you.

08:39.380 --> 08:44.380
You recall the incidents of up to 20th and 40th and 40th, the court's model of the United States?

08:44.380 --> 08:52.380
In addition to what you know personally as those incidents, you were advised by Miss Adams and others of what occurred, were you not?

08:52.380 --> 08:53.380
Yes, sir?

08:53.380 --> 08:58.380
How else you were not on medication on that day at Fort Monk?

08:58.380 --> 09:09.380
You were told that when Mr. Cohen was not admitted to a certain laboratory, he became highly incensed and stated in substance that this is a declaration of war.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.380
Yes, sir?

09:10.380 --> 09:20.380
Did you accept that statement, Mr. Secretary, as coming from Roy Cohen in the victory, or as coming from the McCarthy Investigating Committee?

09:20.380 --> 09:26.380
My relations with Roy Cohen are such that I regard him as Chief Counsel for this committee.

09:26.380 --> 09:34.380
And you regarded that statement as you regarded him as being in a party with that committee, did you not?

09:35.380 --> 09:48.380
I, you regarded it as an entity, as one, as a unit, and that whatever was told to you by one member was accepted by you as coming from the McCarthy Investigating Committee.

09:48.380 --> 09:53.380
I thought that when Roy Cohen spoke he spoke up with a sorry and a committee.

09:53.380 --> 09:58.380
I asked you whether or not on medication you either heard or you were told.

09:59.380 --> 10:10.380
That Mr. Cohen in addition to what we have just stated, what you have just stated, made the further statement that in effect we will investigate the Army from now on.

10:10.380 --> 10:12.380
Yes, sir?

10:12.380 --> 10:18.380
Were you so advised by persons whom you regarded as reliable?

10:18.380 --> 10:19.380
Yes, sir?

10:19.380 --> 10:21.380
Did you regard that as a threat?

10:21.380 --> 10:22.380
Yes, sir?

10:23.380 --> 10:36.380
Did you know at that time, Mr. Secretary, did you have in mind at that time that many different requests have been made of you by some members of the McCarthy Investigating Committee?

10:36.380 --> 10:45.380
For preferences for a child, I had a month, including a direct request from the Senator for a commission for a child?

10:45.380 --> 10:46.380
Yes, sir.

10:46.380 --> 10:53.380
And including a request from Mr. Cohen and perhaps others for other special considerations for child?

10:53.380 --> 10:54.380
I tried.

10:54.380 --> 11:02.380
Then did you view and evaluate those statements by Mr. Cohen on October 20th in the light?

11:02.380 --> 11:06.380
I've had a first try there to on behalf of child.

11:06.380 --> 11:07.380
Yes, sir, I did.

11:07.380 --> 11:11.380
And as I said, I regarded as part of a pattern.

11:12.380 --> 11:33.380
I believe in your statement given to the committee and which you read on the opening day of the series, you stated that there have been no less than 65 telephone calls coming to you, Mr. Adams, or others as the Pentagon, from the McCarthy Committee with reference to David Shiong, is that right, Mr. Secretary?

11:33.380 --> 11:36.380
I don't think that was all to the Pentagon, but that was all Paul's on that subject.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.380
And with reference to Shiong?

11:38.380 --> 11:39.380
Yes, sir.

11:39.380 --> 11:44.380
Some of those calls came in fire October 20th as we understand it.

11:44.380 --> 11:45.380
Is that correct?

11:48.380 --> 11:50.380
Either calls are personal interviews.

11:50.380 --> 11:51.380
Yes, sir.

11:51.380 --> 12:01.380
I've reviewed further stated that in addition to the 65 telephone calls there were 19 personal contacts by the McCarthy Investigating Committee with reference to Shiong.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.380
Is that correct?

12:02.380 --> 12:03.380
That's right.

12:03.380 --> 12:05.380
Is some of those in fire at October 20th?

12:05.380 --> 12:06.380
Yes, sir.

12:06.380 --> 12:09.380
And in the telephone calls, the first fire at October 20th.

12:09.380 --> 12:28.380
Then in the light of those personal contacts and those telephone calls, were those words uttered by allegedly by Mr. Cohen, waiting words in your mind and conveying a threat not against you for personal violence, but against the army of which you are the haze, that's right.

12:28.380 --> 12:33.380
I think the question is, Mr. Director, I'm sure, will agree.

12:33.380 --> 12:42.380
If he's gonna talk about the way he works, and trusting so much, he should be able to tell us all those way he works, where I'm curious here about myself.

12:42.380 --> 12:51.380
The way he works, or as I recall, at on October 20th, when Mr. Cohen was not permitted to go into a certain laboratory, he violent, stated in substance.

12:51.380 --> 12:57.380
This is a declaration of war, and what I'm willing to investigate the army from now on is that what you did, right?

12:57.380 --> 12:59.380
Mr. Chair, Mr. Chairman, what way of arguing?

12:59.380 --> 13:02.380
The end of that has to do with private shying.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.380
If Roy could let you write that, it's not finished.

13:04.380 --> 13:11.380
If Roy could long a derit at it, because he was occluded from the laboratories, knowing the communists had three access to them,

13:11.380 --> 13:16.380
would that deritation not be justified, and what does that have to do with private shying?

13:16.380 --> 13:23.380
I'm not that he's about to have the right to interrogate the witness, but I'm sorry I was through the council, and I'm not going to do it right with shying, but I'm still trying to get the council to answer.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.380
I'm trying to get the witness to point the body to the rules.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.380
I am the council.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.380
I am following the gentleman, I'm just a minute.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.380
Again, you, sighted the body?

13:31.380 --> 13:37.380
Here's the share of a chair to listen before he rules that a British is ruled on the last one after the lettering of the new point of order.

13:37.380 --> 13:44.380
My point is this, even though council, very able council, among the British, right to ask questions,

13:44.380 --> 13:51.380
if he can't ask for a conclusion of this, there was this, the two willing to give those, he must ask for the words of the conversation what was left.

13:51.380 --> 13:54.380
He's not a chairman, well enough, they're a way to words.

13:54.380 --> 14:02.380
He has already asked questions, and he has a right to ask whatever questions he chooses, as long as they comply with the rules of the committee, a relevancy and maturity.

14:02.380 --> 14:06.380
Which I don't want the reporter to read the last question, he didn't find it.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.380
I have a request for reading the last question.

14:10.380 --> 14:21.380
My point is, while he's looking for that record, and looking up that question, I would like to set the record straight on one thing, and turn him a card, he just said a moment ago,

14:21.380 --> 14:33.380
and that is, he said, indicated that Commies did have three access to these labs up in the Fort Maun, and I say that Commies do not have three last access to those labs.

14:33.380 --> 14:36.380
Does everybody ready to read the questions?

14:41.380 --> 14:47.380
The Demont Television Network is bringing you through its facilities, the Army McCarty Subcommittee hearings.

14:47.380 --> 14:53.380
We go now for station identification. This is the Demont Television Network.

14:53.380 --> 14:59.380
This is WABD channel five serving New York threat in public affairs.

14:59.380 --> 15:09.380
Then in the light of those personal contacts and those telephone calls, for those words uttered by allegedly by Mr. Cohn, the weighty words in your mind, and convey any threat.

15:10.380 --> 15:14.380
Not against you, for personal violence, but against the Army, of which you were the head.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.380
Mr. Cohn, am I...

15:15.380 --> 15:18.380
You point it right against that question, but the press has been properly written.

15:18.380 --> 15:23.380
Tell all the words were, the subcommittee's determine whether or where the words are now.

15:23.380 --> 15:30.380
The chair believes that Commies is a response to your first suggestion, get the speech to words, and set this as an acceleration to words.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.380
That's the record.

15:31.380 --> 15:38.380
We will have to get down, it's now on, perhaps he did not say that, but whoever he is, the question is, but he calls you that thing, and Commies will make a decision.

15:38.380 --> 15:48.380
And I might call the committee's attention to the fact that I am following up the senator's direct question to the secretary.

15:48.380 --> 15:56.380
The question being whether or not he or Mr. Cohn, Mr. Car, ever threatened the secretary, and I'm exploring that one's big little point.

15:56.380 --> 15:59.380
Right now, the secretary charges before the committee.

15:59.380 --> 16:07.380
Mr. Secretary, last or in some of the good doctors over 20th, were you personally contacted or was Mr. Cohn?

16:07.380 --> 16:14.380
Yes, I did. I was, Mr. Adams personally contacted by the McCarthy Investigating Committee with reference to Shane.

16:14.380 --> 16:19.380
Yes, sir. I ask you whether or not they're actors.

16:19.380 --> 16:25.380
Many telephone calls were either transmitting to you or Mr. Adams with reference to Mr. Shane.

16:25.380 --> 16:36.380
Yes, sir. I ask you whether or not in those telephone conversations, there were discussions not only with reference to Shane, but with reference to the McCarthy investigation.

16:36.380 --> 16:45.380
The McCarthy Investigating Committee's work at Fort Monmouth, where are those two subjects discussed in the same conversation?

16:45.380 --> 16:49.380
All humorous occasions are on a few occasions or on North Asian.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.380
I don't know if that's the reason.

16:51.380 --> 16:57.380
Let's tell you a little bit about it.

16:57.380 --> 17:08.380
I ask you whether or not in those telephone conversations, there were discussions not only with reference to Shane, but with reference to the McCarthy.

17:08.380 --> 17:26.380
I'll ask you whether or not in those telephone conversations, there were discussions not only with reference to Shane, but with reference to the McCarthy Investigating Committee's work at Fort Monmouth, where those two subjects discussed in the same conversations on numerous occasions, for on a few occasions, for on North Asian.

17:26.380 --> 17:37.380
Yes, I word it's got on a number of occasions.

17:37.380 --> 17:40.380
Did you answer, yes, I said I word it's got on a number of occasions.

17:40.380 --> 17:53.380
So that the conversations with reference to the investigation of Monmouth and with reference to Shane were intertwined so to speak in one telephone conversation.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.380
Is that right Mr. Secretary, yes sir?

17:56.380 --> 18:16.380
And did or not you regard this as being a combination of a request for preferences for Shane, on the one hand that correlated with a discussion or a threat of a continued investigation of Fort Monmouth?

18:17.380 --> 18:19.380
Yes, I couldn't separate the two.

18:19.380 --> 18:25.380
And Mr. Secretary, is that why you leave you state it all?

18:25.380 --> 18:35.380
Want to see in the terror arms, Senator McCarthy asked you some four or five times to assign shine to the first time in the area in New York?

18:35.380 --> 18:37.380
Is that correct? That's correct.

18:37.380 --> 18:40.380
Was that subsequently gone down to October 20th? Yes sir.

18:41.380 --> 19:04.380
Now Mr. Secretary, is that why you say that you regard this the whole thing, all of these contacts, conversations from beginning to end as constituting one pattern and as constituting a pattern of unfair or unusual requests for preferences for Shane?

19:04.380 --> 19:06.380
Is that correct? That is correct.

19:07.380 --> 19:24.380
I'm sure that's the question started on but in the hope that perhaps we can finish with the Secretary's even dismorning and the sentimentality can conclude I'm going to refrain but if the Secretary is back on Monday I will keep the number 10.

19:25.380 --> 19:40.380
I wish to direct my question to the allegations of threats against Mr. Stevens or against the Army.

19:41.380 --> 19:55.380
I wish to practice my question by reading from the original document of chronological events that was delivered to me at the time they were delivered to others.

19:55.380 --> 20:06.380
And give the page of the page 22 of that document with third two of the dates that occurred on January 11th.

20:07.380 --> 20:13.380
I began with that and read the last paragraph under that date.

20:13.380 --> 20:28.380
Mr. Adams immediately telephone Mr. Cole and advise him of this development which is a development by reference you see was to an assignment born Mr. Shire.

20:29.380 --> 20:43.380
During the midst of the conversation Mr. Cole hung up on the telephone after telling Mr. Adams he would not stand for any more army double puzzles.

20:43.380 --> 20:54.380
Then I read from the same document chronologically best number 37 on January 13 and 14.

20:54.380 --> 21:10.380
They are so after the conversation with Mr. Cole. Mr. Adams went to the Capitol and called on Mr. Cole and Mr. Car in Mr. Cole's office in the Senate investigating some committees.

21:11.380 --> 21:22.380
General discussion was had concerning the private shine situation and the progress of the McCarthy Committee investigation at Fort Monmouth.

21:22.380 --> 21:36.380
Knowing that 90% of all inductees get overseas duty and that there were nine chances out of them that private shine would be facing overseas duty when he concluded his tour at Camp Gordon.

21:36.380 --> 21:57.380
Mr. Adams informed Mr. Cole of this situation. Mr. Cole of the hearing this said this would correct the army and calls Mr. Steven the date of the army.

21:57.380 --> 22:04.380
I ask you Mr. Secretary if that information was conveyed to you by Mr. Adams it was sir.

22:04.380 --> 22:15.380
Did you at that time consider those remarks a threat and do you now consider them a threat I do at all.

22:16.380 --> 22:27.380
I have only one question and that is this and it's based on three more rather than personal observation.

22:27.380 --> 22:44.380
It is my understanding that sometimes a time there was a good deal of benefit between Mr. Adams and Mr. Cole and the rest of the staff of the committee not only in the committee room but as I understand at the meetings that were held there was a lunch and meetings.

22:44.380 --> 22:55.380
Mr. Secretary do you strive some of this to ribbing and the banter you use the word ribbing him over the goal.

22:55.380 --> 23:10.380
These quotations that have been referred to I do not regard as ribbing or band or anything else but the very serious matter in your presence was there a good deal of banter about the shine matter.

23:10.380 --> 23:14.380
I was not in the back and forth and my presence I wouldn't say much better.

23:14.380 --> 23:30.380
Did you ever hear any conversations between Mr. Cole and Mr. Adams about this matter that was certainly not in an intense or in-temperature to at least induce this conclusion that it was banter and ribbing.

23:31.380 --> 23:39.380
I guess I'm not a very good banderer myself and I am inclined to take things seriously.

23:39.380 --> 23:55.380
And what conversations may have been taken place between Mr. Adams and Mr. Cole or they can testify to and I can't but the things to which references the May this morning for my mind are exceeding the series.

23:55.380 --> 23:58.380
And I so regard them then and do now.

23:58.380 --> 24:16.380
Well I want to make it abundantly clear of course that what I have depression is based only on report and the impartation on a report from one of my own assistance that was a good deal of banting from time to time either in the committee office or at the care of arms hotel.

24:16.380 --> 24:25.380
And the problem for the committee is to dissociate between what was said in a rather facetious or life hard to bane and what may have been serious.

24:25.380 --> 24:36.380
Well as I say, Senator, and I'm most anxious to answer all these questions directly and quickly as I can. These were serious matters as far as I've answered.

24:37.380 --> 24:46.380
I can imagine some explanations of a kind that might be made or set apart from all context and the atmosphere and what sort of made.

24:46.380 --> 24:57.380
It may sound like a bit whereas otherwise I mean nothing. I don't think anybody who has been given here in this room this morning in the last few minutes.

24:57.380 --> 25:11.380
So what have any doubt is the weather and not they were banter or serious. Well I'm only asking you opinion if they weather that kind of conversation just based on your presence and whether it seems of the bantering time.

25:12.380 --> 25:18.380
And the action is done until the point and the pattern only one of course not have Mr. Chairman.

25:18.380 --> 25:28.380
And I practice my question Mr. Secretary on not based upon whether this is true or not.

25:28.380 --> 25:46.380
I would certainly mention that Mr. Chairman had received a commission or had received a burden of assignment to New York that the committee would have followed all this investigation for a moment.

25:47.380 --> 25:55.380
Well I'd say that I had the feeling that something along the lines probably happened although that doesn't find the cause.

25:55.380 --> 26:00.380
I'd never stood to call on the investigation now since it's been changing the type of hearings.

26:01.380 --> 26:07.380
I'd like to say hello.

26:07.380 --> 26:09.380
I'd probably share this with you.

26:09.380 --> 26:14.380
I'd like to thank you for the time I thought I had a call on you.

26:14.380 --> 26:21.380
Mr. Secretary I appreciate you trying to answer this question yesterday.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.380
All right, Mr. Secretary.

26:23.380 --> 26:30.380
You talked about a pattern and you alleged that the army had been hammered.

26:30.380 --> 26:40.380
So did your idea, Nett, that the more you did for private shine the less hammering that would be the army?

26:40.380 --> 26:46.380
Yes sir, that was my idea. No further questions.

26:47.380 --> 27:14.380
And also I'd like, however, to, if I may, just add one, one, uh, great sentence-ligger to, uh, be sure that people understand that my one's got insofar as making any exception to a private shine was because I did not want the army to be in the position of a disgusting, the work of a Senate committee that was investigating the army vigorously.

27:14.380 --> 27:21.380
Now in that case, do we call, I said he could be available for committee work providing it did not interfere with his training.

27:21.380 --> 27:26.380
But all of the incentives? Thank you, Mr. Oshin.

27:26.380 --> 27:37.380
I call them to my cash and detention in the fact that it is close to solve a pot if he has an ambition to disclose the secretary we will have to move swiftly.

27:37.380 --> 27:44.380
Mr. Oshin, tell me the captain of the con. Mr. Oshin, are you sure?

27:44.380 --> 28:02.380
Much as I just like taking this additional time on a private who has successfully promoted by you as well the point that he's made private, I think you're sure that the American should win a bet.

28:02.380 --> 28:15.380
You know what his rating was before he was more than private? Is running more than private the army? I mean, in rating, I don't mean any other way.

28:15.380 --> 28:27.380
Is there any rating more than the rating of private? No, private. So the shine has received no promotion?

28:27.380 --> 28:34.380
No, I mean, after knowing you've received any promotion? I thought it was a recroed and he's now private.

28:34.380 --> 28:44.380
We're going to hire a big content that I propose.

28:44.380 --> 28:51.380
I asked him after another two or three weeks to learn how I got all this personal consideration meant to promote it and recruit the pilot.

28:51.380 --> 28:56.380
Was that the motion to recruit the pilot to resolve a pressure on you?

28:56.380 --> 28:58.380
That's routine.

28:58.380 --> 29:04.380
That's routine. I think the captain did not hear the full answer because of the last thing he said he did not consider that as a motion to make a bet.

29:04.380 --> 29:05.380
That's right.

29:05.380 --> 29:10.380
So he has received no promotion after his other question? That's correct.

29:10.380 --> 29:21.380
You personally did not approve any special considerations on the pilot.

29:21.380 --> 29:27.380
I've indicated a moment ago that my old family about the same thing that I had done on that I thought I was my friend.

29:27.380 --> 29:35.380
I thought that I was my new city so that you had allowed him to take time off to work on his committee work when it didn't seem no way in your curiosity.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.380
That's right.

29:36.380 --> 29:43.380
So now, as long as the gentleman appears in training, do you think that was a vital consideration given to the pilot?

29:43.380 --> 29:44.380
I definitely do.

29:44.380 --> 29:59.380
Well, if he did not work on the work of the committee, when he wasn't in training, I assume the usual work he'd be doing he'd told work would be over at the canteen or in the recreational or dating room.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.380
There's a lot of other jobs he'd be doing so.

30:01.380 --> 30:03.380
I'm not going to retire face.

30:03.380 --> 30:06.380
Unfortunately, he's been doing a good job.

30:06.380 --> 30:07.380
Very well.

30:07.380 --> 30:10.380
All weapons, cleaning, safety.

30:10.380 --> 30:12.380
He didn't clean his weapons.

30:12.380 --> 30:15.380
He didn't serve on the team to do that job.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.380
Be sure of that.

30:16.380 --> 30:23.380
Not for the extent that he should have or would have, that special provisions to make it impossible for him to work, but not for the effect.

30:23.380 --> 30:28.380
Then you're not having men down, that's the training camp. I assume you've got a report from someone.

30:28.380 --> 30:30.380
How much does he?

30:30.380 --> 30:31.380
Thank you, partner.

30:31.380 --> 30:34.380
How do you have an information to get a report from someone?

30:34.380 --> 30:38.380
Yes, I know. I've found out that one said that, fire.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.380
Who need to get the report now?

30:40.380 --> 30:42.380
Will you not agree with the light and some official?

30:42.380 --> 30:44.380
I got it from the general line.

30:44.380 --> 30:45.380
General line.

30:45.380 --> 30:48.380
Right now, for me, I should have...

30:48.380 --> 30:55.380
The investigation of a communist central place in the army started long before there was any...

30:55.380 --> 30:58.380
Talk about the crashing of private time, is there right?

30:58.380 --> 31:00.380
Long before he was met.

31:00.380 --> 31:03.380
Well, I think that's...

31:03.380 --> 31:06.380
And I don't mean this in an unkind way, but I...

31:06.380 --> 31:10.380
I'm sorry, but I understand that the subject of private time, the investigation is not necessarily...

31:10.380 --> 31:12.380
...they're not for quite a while.

31:12.380 --> 31:15.380
If you maintain that the...

31:15.380 --> 31:19.380
...investigation, exposure of communist, military...

31:19.380 --> 31:23.380
...spoiler to resolve the private time, being drafted.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.380
I'd like to have that one read.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.380
Right away, we can wait.

31:39.380 --> 31:44.380
What do you might think that the investigation and disclosure of communist in the military...

31:44.380 --> 31:48.380
...was resolved as private time to be drafted?

31:48.380 --> 31:49.380
No!

31:49.380 --> 31:51.380
I didn't think you did it.

31:51.380 --> 31:57.380
The mass of this was the course for the investigation change in any way...

31:57.380 --> 32:01.380
...after the drafting of private time to be left.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.380
We just continue on the same course.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.380
Did you continue on the same course?

32:05.380 --> 32:06.380
Yes.

32:06.380 --> 32:08.380
That's the fact, Elizabeth.

32:08.380 --> 32:11.380
Now, do you object to the...

32:11.380 --> 32:15.380
...disclosure of any of the security risks?

32:21.380 --> 32:23.380
Yes.
