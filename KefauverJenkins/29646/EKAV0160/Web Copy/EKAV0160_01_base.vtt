WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
May we come, Lord, please?

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
May the chair remind our guests to the audience because we have fun guests and chairs

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
this morning and each afternoon, they've not spent it before, as if you are welcome to be here.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
We're happy to have you observe the passengers are based in rational operation.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
But we want you to know that there is a standing rule of the committees,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
as there are to be no manifestations of approval or disapproval.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
A very time, and any time, from the audience and the officers in the room have been instructed

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
to provide an escort from the room, anybody who violates the conditions on which he enters the room,

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
names it if he would comply with the committee regulations against manifestations of approval or disapproval.

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
This afternoon, at 3 o'clock, when the officers were not trapped, the chair is calling an executive committee meeting

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
for purposes of the House.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
I know, really, getting approval for the program that says, and worked out for bringing before our council,

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
the monitor telephone conversations that we have discussed, that the executive committee meeting

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
has all objectives to be meeting to be open for any other discussion that any member of the committee wants to bring up.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
The chair is to get the reporters, as a man outside of the office of Mark's office is waiting him,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
and the event one is meeting.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Not the newspaper report, and now I'm asking for the hearing report, as I know, I don't have to.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I'll have to newspaper report it.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
And that council for all parties is available in the events that they might want to be taught,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
or representatives of council for all parties.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Mr. Council, you had an announcement that you made the right change from, I believe,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Mr. Hengel advised his money.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Chairman, I have an announcement to make respect to the Secretary of State.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
Mr. Fred Brown representing Mr. Hengel is attending the EAR on fire commitments,

02:01.000 --> 02:10.000
substituting in his place this morning as a distinguished looking gentleman at the end of the table Mr. John A. Wells.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Well, of New York, thank you.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Thank you very much.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
We're very, very happy to see the directories, we sure would like to say that he has done a style unofficially

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
but we have to accept the advice at least from the faculty and Mr. Cohn that they hope to be able to conclude their

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
ï¿½signings this evening this morning, that they may have some written interagency to submit later,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
depending upon how fast he progressed with the questions and answers,

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
at least to me, I can readily give their hopes that they can conclude within this month.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm going to make one of five efforts in that direction, so I'm going to go ahead and say,

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
we're going to try and make every effort to conclude the crossing,

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
and this time our success will depend somewhat upon the length of the answer,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
which means it may take some time to respond to the questions.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
We have to end with the time, but we decided to do them going over the record.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
If we respond to many questions unanswered, questions have been asked over and over.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
I thought that we'd gain nothing by asking other questions over again in this session.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
I thought that they could do it, not in a short time,

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
but to write out the questions, give them a minute to do them,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
and then take them back to his office, then get back here and answer them.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
That I don't mean answer them by a written statement, but answer them.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
We don't remember, that time after he has had that chance for a day to say to his father,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
the one time he wants to go over the questions with a couple of his claim,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
I still haven't answered. I'm sure that will be a great deal to everyone who's having concerns.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I think that might be a good right for him.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
That's what I've been interested in, because sometimes it's like the fact that he's unable to recall

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
and if he has a chance to, if I can remember, then he can testify the question that he's got a chance to see in the past.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
The council will start with you if there's any questions.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
There's no other questions. The chair has been sent in the maquillette.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Of course, any of the candidates to my head?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Any smell left?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Over.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
No.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Send him a fast game, Mr. Conn.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Mr. Steven, good news to Adam, it's not a far away, too.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
If you have any news left or any one of any of the pre-tiered of the charges

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
that he were to make against the Spanish family,

04:22.000 --> 04:32.000
however, this is the testimony developed that Mr. Adam has gave any individual several weeks before the Potter luck.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I look at all of the Army charges.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
That would be a violation of Mr. Adam's orders.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
But they end up on an action on Mr. Adam's part.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I know the grain of the con, but I see what the violation of these orders.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't think there are any orders out of any con on it.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, would you approve of the develops of Mr. Adam's several weeks before any centers of Congress

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
when you have the charges?

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
If he gains the charges in total to a wrestling newsman and discuss the matter with you.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
As I think I've said that kind of a carpea, I'm against the league that I don't favor.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Well, in other words, you'd be very much against that.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That's what I don't like.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
The league's business.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Do you know that a man called Elzwell testified before any moment?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
No, that's not.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
Do you know that he testified in regards to his discussions with Mr. Adam's, his under oath?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Mr. Chairman, if he doesn't know, he testified.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
He said nobody testified to him.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
That's what he said.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Had you heard Mr. Elzwell testified?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
No, sir.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Had your counsel discussed that with you, though?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
No, sir.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
And if Mr. Elzwell testified to her oath, then Mr. Adam's showed him all of the charges.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Now that he and Mr. Elzwell discussed them out there.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Elzwell urged that the charges be made public.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
I assume you don't know why, I'm questioning the accuracy of that.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I'll check.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Your answer is no.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
No, thank you.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
Mr. Steven's one of the specifications that were originally released on 20th of December.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
I know it's number 26 on 10 to come in 1953.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
If I may read it.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
At some democracies, we have close secretary Steven's, Mr. Adam,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
the lunch of the Center of McCarthy, Mr. Francis Carr, the Carr alarm.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yes.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
According to Mr. Carr, Mr. Colum was too upset to attend the lunch.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
Because of the private sign situation and the Army's unwillingness to settle on private sign, future signmen.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
And had the part of the meeting you were immediately asked of the conclusion of the morning hearing.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
Did you tell us now whether or not that was true or un-shrugged?

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
I have some recollection of the Center of the Somer-Marco-Lonat Line.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
I learned that later Mr. Colum's father was taken.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And I think that that is undoubtedly the main reason he went back to the yard.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
Well, actually you learned in the City of Mr. Colum's leaving after the morning session that he and Mr. Robert Moore

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
left the night before when he got word that his father was very ill.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Last day, there was no indication that anyone that day.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Mr. Colum had left because he was disturbed by the sign.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
Actually, we told you and Mr. Adams that Mr. Colum had gone to New York because his father had a right thing.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
It was very ill.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
And he didn't want that made public because of the phone calls that they came into the house for the disturbing father.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
We told you that reason.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
This was just information kept around the table.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
No question about it there.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
Mr. Colum was quite upset about David Chan.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Well, now let's get to the state which didn't begin.

08:01.000 --> 08:16.000
You'll let here, Mr. made public to find out given to Mr. House of Weeks as an allegation that Mr. Colum had left after the morning session.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
The reason he left was because he was upset about David and about private sign.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Now, you know neither you're not.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
So this is completely untrue. He left the night before.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
He left because his father became suddenly ill.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
We told you that at the time, did you recall, Adams, do you remember?

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
I do not know that Mr. Colum left the night before.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
Now, can you tell me who was responsible for making this very serious mistake?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Because that you were Mr. Adams who was responsible.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
You were doing two people there besides Mr. Carren myself.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
That's right.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
No.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
Who gave up this false information?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Mr. Kamenai.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
You're quite right, Mr. O.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Well, there's no testimony that the information is false.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
There's testimony from this but this seems to be quite clear.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Did he heard of that conversation that Mr. Colum was up?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
That meeting that Mr. Colum was up, said about private sign.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
And that's the testimony from Adams.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
If this is true, Mr. Stevens, you can tell us.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
If you now have any reason to think Mr. Colum left after the morning session,

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
they left because he was disturbed by private sign.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
You can tell us if you now know all the distance false,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
that Mr. Colum left the night before.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
He was taking the airport from Mr. Morris because of very serious illness

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
and he was probably taller having nothing whatsoever to do with the private mirror.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
If you know that's true, just tell us.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I think in fairness to the public here, you should do that.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
I think you should then explain who is responsible for this.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I frankly don't think you were.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I think it's someone else.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I'm curious, no.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Man, if I don't just do this, I think that much of what is going on here,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
in fact, 95% of it.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
For more has not been your fault,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
I would like to know who's been shoving you to this deal.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
If you're going to get a case, you can tell us.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
If you want to.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm not sure I got the question.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
That's what's rather wrong.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
The question's not in the cabinet.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Can I have any redness to chairman?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Maybe I can make it shorter.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I like that question, right?

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
There's something in there about something false.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I want to find out what that is.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Very well, you may read this.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I think it's a preliminary statement that's included in the word.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I guess so.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
It's also a statement in there that allows you to modify every sentence.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Not to that, please.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
I think that there is probably really no right to requesting this.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
That question will be very exact.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, if we put our final slide for the senator again, his statement.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
And we did loudly and slowly, because it's a very long question.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I would like to get the answer.

11:03.000 --> 11:10.000
If you don't have any reason to say, Mr. Cohen, let's tap to the morning session.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
He left because he was disturbed by private signs.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
You can tell us.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
If you now know that this was false, but Mr. Cohen left the night before,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
he was taken to the airport by Mr. Morris because in very serious illness on the part of his father,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
having nothing whatsoever to do with private, with a private sign.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
I think that's the only reason why I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Having nothing whatsoever to do with private, with a private in the army.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
If you know that it's true, just tell us.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I think it's very much to the senator here.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
You should do that.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
And I think you should then explain who's responsible for this.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I frankly don't think you're worthy.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I think of us someone else.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I am curious to know who.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
May I say, Mr. Stevens, I think that much of what has gone on here,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
in fact, 95% of it, or more, has not been your fault.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I would like to know who has been shoving you into this field.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
By this particular case, you can tell us if you want to.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Mr. Secretary, well, I don't know anything as full.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
I'd like to clear that point out by testify that I have a recollection of Mr. Carr,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
indicating that Mr. Column was upset about the private sign.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
That recollection I had.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Now, after the question of who's shoving me, if that's what,

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
if that is the question that I understand, nobody was shoving me.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
But otherwise, you say you personally are responsible for the charges

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
made against Mr. Carr, Mr. Cohn, myself, Tom Lutton?

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
No, I'm not here as your counsel, Mr. Stevens.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
But I have had, as you know, many conversations with you,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
but tell me this only is military.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
I got the impression and talked to you originally that you were just concerned

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
about a house meeting as we were.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
If you were concerned with the Mexican pound and you took over,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
all of a sudden almost overnight,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
there seemed to be a change of part.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
It's about the time we tried to get out those who were responsible.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
I can't conceive of this whole smear against Mr. Cohn, Mr. Carr, Mr. Chairman.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I'll be here as Mr. Senator.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Look at the charges for the smear.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Senator McCarthy, Mr. Chairman.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Senator McCarthy is making a statement of the fact,

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
that he gets statements being the form of a question.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Mr. Chairman, in order to understand the question,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
maybe that's the reason I've reviewed some of the past,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
which is no longer for me and my staff and Mr. Stevens,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I think they really would just enough.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
And I do think this is a proper trailer to the question.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Mr. Jenkins thinks now I certainly will not press the points

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
to be finding what the things are for you.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
The assumption is, Mr. Cohn, no, Mr. Sack,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
okay, we've no guts, then take out that.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
We've got the question.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And we have to listen to Mr. Stevens.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
She said there was nothing false about the statement as far as you know.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Let me call.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
According to Mr. Carr, Mr. Cohn was too upset to attend the lunch

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
because of the private shine situation.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
And the Army's unwilling to settle on private shine's future shine.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
And had departed from New York immediately after the conflict

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
of the morning hearing.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Now, in the formal charges, that was not.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Is it not attractive to the drop?

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Because you were some of your staff,

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
so Mr. Cohn, on a meet the press hearing,

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
or listen to him, at this time, we completely exported this lie

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
and it had an export of it.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
You decided to drop, or some of this out of the drop.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
And you had the question.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Mr. Cohn, I don't think it is all proper.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Mr. Cohn,ahh, Mr. Cohn,

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
is the suspect that he has testified that according to his best recollection,

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
he heard someone at the meeting referred to say that Mr. Cohn was upset

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
on account of shining as there was so upset that he could not attend the lunch

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
and have gone to New York.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
That's right, Mr. Cohn.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
That's something that's in some sense.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
And today, Mr. Cohn, this is when I have read you through or fall.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
We live out the word lie.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
The front of the question is retated, so that's the bad way.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
All right, we'll review this.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
I'm going to read you this statement now from the Army.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
Charges dated December 10, 1953, charge number 26.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
And starting on the middle of the charge.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Uh, Francis.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
According to Mr. Cohn, Mr. Cohn was view of such a terrible lunch

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
because of the private shine situation.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
And the Army's unwillingness to settle on private shine's future assignment

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
and had departed from New York immediately after the conclusion of the morning hearing.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
Do you know how Mr. Cohn has said that that charge is false?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
So do you maintain it's truth?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
No, it's nothing.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
You're a proper questioner.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
The charge is beginning for the committee as the right to ask him whether it's true or false.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
There's a great deal in that that it's obviously true.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
No witness can characterize that whole statement as false.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
The secretary has the right to make that answer, Mr. Cohn.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
He's being asked the question at all.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Question is preferable at the secretary's.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Is this charge formally made given to all the press?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Two or a full?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Is any part of the two called for part of the full?

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
Yes, it's already testified that I have a distinct recollection of Mr. Cohn saying that he was perhaps that Mr. Cohn was very upset about private shine

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
and what his future assignment was going to be.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
There's not the question, Mr. Secretary.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Let's divide this into two parts of the remain.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Mr. Chairman, I think that's the case.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I answer that question.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
All right, let's look at me.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I think he's given a fair answer.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
He says that he has a distinct recollection of what Mr. Cohn said about it

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
and that answer is Senator McCartney's question.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm not the question, Mr. Jenkins, and I have an answer.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I have an answer.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
The Jenkins?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I have no question, Mr. Chairman.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Chair has none.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Senator McCartney, or the senator to my left?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Oh, Mr. McCartney.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Mr. Welch?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
No question.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Mr. Cohn, or Senator McCartney?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Mr. Mr. Dittin?

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
I'm not asking you for enough charcoal, you're the tone of the set.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
The formal army charge was the development of two parts.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
But he was too upset to attend the once because of the private chain situation.

17:37.000 --> 17:44.000
Is that true or were you told that he could not be there because the father had been taken seriously ill?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Which is the point?

17:46.000 --> 17:54.000
I've testified that it was my recollection that Mr. Cohn said that Mr. Cohn was very upset about five of China and his future.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
Now the question you charge here that he couldn't attend the once because he was upset about five of China.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
Have you since learned that he didn't attend the once because his father became seriously ill the night before?

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
I was very sorry to learn that Mr. Cohn has been taken ill.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Will the reporter repeat questions?

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
The reporter will repeat the question and then he'll come whether the answer was his bunch of energy.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Mr. Chairman?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm not going to say it's time.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
On that occasion, the reporter has been quite a week to question the lady immediately.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
I need to find out, Mr. Jenkins, if you've heard of the question, please.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I can be stated very simply.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
He's glad for you.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I would like to have a read for the answer, my question.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
The same time, he has a question, you're giving me.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
We're trying to get you off the span of the story now.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
If you will try and answer the question, will you try and do that?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I'm fine.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
There is us at the bottom line.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Mr. Cohn, do you read so we can determine the answer?

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
Will the reporter please repeat the question and the answer?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
You charge here.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
He couldn't attend a luncheon because he was so upset about private charge.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Have you since learned that he didn't attend this luncheon because his father became seriously ill the night before?

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
I was very sorry to learn that Judge Cohn had been taken ill.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I did learn about Judge Cohn.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
He'll not be late if that's correct.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Did you learn the reason he left?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Was because he thought that he was ill, not because of the private charge?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Not because of the private charge.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Not because of the private charge.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't recall that.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
You know now.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
I know now.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
You know also there is the Army Faceman.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Nothing Army Faceman.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
The Army Faceman.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
The Army Faceman.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
Mr. Cohn had departed immediately after the conclusion of the morning hearing.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
You know that also.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
That side is also both.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
He had left the night before.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I did not know it left the night before.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I told him it's left after the morning hearing.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
You know it now.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
He was advised by the first time I had known it.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
Could you tell us why the formal specification number 18

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
differs from the informal charge number 26?

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
Well that's because in the meantime you or someone on your slam

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
heard the statement of Mr. Cohn on the air.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
The list was completely false.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Could I?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
You do, Mr. Cohn.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Can I write a bit about you?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I would rather say I didn't hear the question.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Could I hear it right?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I will really be right.

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
If you tell us why the formal specification number 18 differs from the informal charge number 26.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
Was that because in the meantime you or someone on your slam heard the statement of Mr. Cohn on the air?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
That this was completely false.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
I think it is in common from the Senate and the President to find out through the witness.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
The difference is in the respective statements of charge.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
So he will know precisely what he's called for mention.

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
Chair G. I think you said in the county it feels quite of the difference is the easier for the second charge to answer the question.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
Mr. Chairman, what do you want to do about the charge number 26 is very lengthy.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I can read it. The charge number 18 is very brief.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I can read it.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yes, the pertinence.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
I prefer if it's the same time as the secretary would just take you charges, tell them it's for him.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Would you prefer me read these with students?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
No, not necessarily.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
He has a display in the secretary's 18 and 26, is that right?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Yes.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Now be sure I understand your question.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
26, 26 of the original release for the army.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I'll strike it my way.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
That was the chronology of the fact.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Yes.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Not not charged.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Right.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
And the number 18 was the charge, right?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
That's right.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Now I answer you the simple question.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
Originally in the chronology of events as you call them.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
You charge the Mr. Cohn number one.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
What wouldn't happen to the luncheon because you were the set of a plan?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
We had read our office on truth.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Number two, you claim that Cohn left for New York after the morning hearing.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
Let me ask you, whether you know that that is untrue also that you left the night before.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I'll wait a minute, Senator. There's a lot of charges here on truth.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And I don't describe to anyone.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
So I'm usually as true.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
You say it's true.

22:26.000 --> 22:34.000
I say it too that my recollection is dead that Mr. Carr said that Mr. Cohn was very upset about five of Cohn and his future son.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
Well, Mr. Biong, I can say that this is pretty important with the secretary.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
If you are charging here, I think I could be prepared for this.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
But you plan with the time to get consideration for Cohng with me for some fifty to nine.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
You and I, Mr. Cohng, the luncheon, the luncheon, the car alarm.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
That's right.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
And you were told by Mr. Cohng was not present.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Were you?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
That's right.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
Now, if Mr. Carr is on her own, if you were told,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
well, the fact actually works can be established.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
When they plan reservations everything else, he left the night before.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
He had received words he followed a serious deal.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
Would you still claim that Mr. Carr, someone lines to you and told you that it's not for his statement,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
and I object to that, that's totally improper.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
That kind of a question.

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
It's not for Mr. Cohng's statement, Mr. Carr, telling the truth or lying, it's for this committee to say.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
And I've run out of game that the secretary has stated that at that meeting,

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
he was told that he has a distinct recollection that Mr. Carr told him that Mr. Cohng was so upset

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
about having decided that he was going to New York.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
And I've shared in one of the senator's questions that he made to state many of his questions

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
that he'd now was told.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
That he was there with respect to the actions of the men.

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
Mr. Cohng's, it is not your function to determine the truth or not to see any statements.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I intend to bring that by cross examination.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
The statement which the secretary has made is from quickly false.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
I intend to prove that by cross examination of him.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I intend that now, Mr. Cohng.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
I intend to ask him these questions. They made serious charges.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
One day, when they were in their fault, they don't include the truth among the formal charges.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
And if you just find and have a little bit of memory of the secretary,

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
they would get along the last master.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
You got it.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Council, you had asked your local questions.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
And asked your local questions.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I'll re-save this committee.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
The council's objection did not go to questions.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
The charity, whether it was true or false, they went to the fact that there were statements preceding the question.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I'll ask the question.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
Certainly it's entirely proper to determine whether or not any of the charges made against you are true or false.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
That's the purpose of these hearings.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Mr. Cohng's, and that's the reflection.

24:51.000 --> 24:58.000
Mr. Cohng's, do you now know that the statements that Mr. Cohng left after the morning hearing

24:58.000 --> 25:05.000
is a false statement as a day was a false statement that there was made.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Do you know that?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
What I know is I've already testified.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
But if there's no me as you know, I've already testified on that front of it.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Do you know Mr. Cohng's mother and aunt are the states?

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
But you're all of the police for the press.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
I beg your pardon, my office is not really press for this.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
You know, my office is not really press for the press.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
The witness tonight is all the police for the press.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
The police for the press.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
I think it's the press.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Who really is the press?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I don't know who really is the press.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Would you turn around and talk to Mr. Adams and refer to your recollection?

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
When asking whether or not he did not release that to Mr. Olsop,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
weeks before any newsman got it,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
with Mr. Olsop urged him to give an all the press and make it public.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Do you know that?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Mr. Tammus.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Do you want to say the funny word?

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
I suggest that this be handled as a matter of what is yesterday when it was when Mr. Adams and Ali,

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
you know, there's nothing used to be gained by talking back and forth

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
and trying to forward to the committee what Mr. Adams said.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
We saw yesterday how simple things were if you put Adams on the stand.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Now if you want to go into it, let's do it that way.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
Mr. Tammus says Mr. Tammus this witness continues on the stand next week.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
I assure you that he is prepared to stay on the stand as long as the senator finds questions to ask you.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Mr. Tammus.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Mr. Tammus, I think Mr. Welts,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
you're responding to his point of order,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
makes a good point that yesterday when there were questions that only Mr. Adams had,

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
we called him.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I would suggest if possible,

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
as a senator directs the questions to Mr. Stevens that he can answer

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
and make notes to those who want Mr. Adams to answer, we can call him to the stand.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
Mr. Stevens, I'm asking you about the correct point that occurred

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
asking you to answer from your own knowledge and what a quality of your support is.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
You just made the unqualified statement,

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
that this is the charge that we're not releasing to the press.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
That is not true that Mr. Adams told you

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
that he had given a copy of this to some of my friends.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
No, sir.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
You never told him that?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
No, sir.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
So if he just mess that up with us,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
without your knowledge, without your authority.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
That's right.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Good.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
Then, may you still have an answer to this question, Mr. Stevens.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
The unknown today,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
that Mr. Cohen, that the charge,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
that Mr. Cohen left after the morning hearings,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
because he was disturbed by the private sign,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
do you know the day the sign is on the truth?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Is that what you're saying?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Senator, no, I do not know that it's on true.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
I know.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
I have a strong recollection about what Frank Carr said.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Do you know why?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Do you know why it was left over formal charges?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Why was it left out of the formal charges?

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
And why does left out of your testimony also?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
I don't think it was left out.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Would you have one of your aid?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Check your testimony, tell us where you corrected this,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
and your testimony are covered in it.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Could you do that?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
You've got a lot of them around.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Yes.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
The Council for the Committee advises the chairman that it was left out of the house.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
The Council is wrong and wants to be quick.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
The gentleman that could move ahead that was left out of the...

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
The aircraft is carrying on its point.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Yes, why do you certainly make?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
There is a man that this incident was left out of the church,

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
and the formal charges presented by Council for the Army.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I would like to make charge number 18.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
What can you make of that?

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
Honor about December 10, 1953, Senator McCarty and Mr. Carr.

28:29.000 --> 28:36.000
So I have to obtain a special assignment for private sign in New York City for the purpose of studying textbooks at West Point.

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
I hardly need to point out these do not report to the allegations of the evidence,

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
but allegations as to our conclusion, as to what the evidence amounts to.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Well, we...

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I'm going to...

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
I'm going to amplify that little further.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
I don't fight against the connection between the murder and the luncheon and the farewell.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
I am certain that Mr. Jenkins was to support my statement to the effect that we were requested

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
to not simply copy down the chronology of the events as I charged,

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
but to condense them and put them in understandable form so that we can proceed

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
with these proceedings in an expeditious manner.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Now, if we were given an opportunity to argue the case,

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
we would certainly argue that this instance of Mr. Carr telling Mr. Stevens

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
that Mr. Collins in this position to attend would amounts to an attempt

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
to obtain special press or infiltration.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
We do not attempt to carefully evidence to simply stating what we believe

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
the elements facts speak.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Mr. Turner, what's the question?

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Mr. Stevens, as long as you hear the information we discover this,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
I'm not discussing it with you.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Just the money I'm asking you wouldn't want to be paid.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Just the second, second, second, money.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
How is Burr be discussed?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Do you need to talk to me the facts, but...

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
Mr. Cohen was not present because of the private shiner.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Whether or not to the rest of New York, because of the private shiner.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Because he discussed that with me the testimony.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
If so, I think one of these days should show his words of the Scott.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
I look into the testimony and I even have taken the time to read it over.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
And I find nothing but nature.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Can you have one of your A's to do that with Stevens right now?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I'm done.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
If I understand exactly why it is you want, son of s, they glad to do it.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Well, let's find...

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
...referred to the way you understand it.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Well, I haven't asked in you about patience.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
As far as it's made against Mr. Cohen,

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
one that he was too obsessed to attend the lunch because of the private shiner.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
And that he had left for New York immediately after the hearing because of being so obsessed.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
We both agree now I believe that it's false that he went from there to my house for.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
I don't know that the fact that he left me at the...

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That's a very deniesely, very clever.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
But then what's the answer to this?

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
You said you did discuss this in your testimony.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I would like to know about that true or not,

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
but you did discuss it in your testimony or if it only lasts a memory of it.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Well, now if I can have that question read, I'll find my best to answer.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Let me...

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Do it over again.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
You said that you had discussed this matter in your testimony.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I had said, where?

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
And I know you can't look over the testimony yourself or your testimony.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
So, will you have one of your many years?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Take your testimony.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
And point out to us,

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
you can testify at the time where you discussed or corrected for the...

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
To me it appears human safety.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
As soon as we get the record of this morning carrying,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
I will have that done and point it down to the...

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I think the fact that I mentioned this under 50 questions.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
The question was, where in your original safety or in your presentation of the church,

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
if you refer to this luncheon incident, that's the question?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I don't have to answer this question.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I'm a cargill, I'm afraid to catch some on it.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I've touched the part on this matter this month.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Mr. Stevens, I have to...

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I have to execute.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
I think you...

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
I hope you understand maybe now.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
I have to refrain in the formal target and in your statement.
