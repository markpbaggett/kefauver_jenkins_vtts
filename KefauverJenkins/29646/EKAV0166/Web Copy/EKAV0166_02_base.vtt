WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.760
Again, some of the principles in public will not be answered in public.

00:09.760 --> 00:14.680
It should obviously be answered in the same form where the charges were made.

00:14.680 --> 00:20.240
And I may say also that a part of this case is not just the right of an individual to

00:20.240 --> 00:26.320
rebut to answer testimony, but based on the record that is before this committee, which

00:26.320 --> 00:29.760
was the basis of this investigation, is the right.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.760
The principles to make charges are what will do answer them.

00:33.760 --> 00:37.760
This move forecloses one fan throw off.

00:37.760 --> 00:42.760
It's our right, our principles, who have not been heard and who are not being heard in public.

00:42.760 --> 00:49.760
If forecloses their right to even make those accusations, even in the executive section,

00:49.760 --> 00:53.760
let alone within our today public spectrum.

00:54.760 --> 00:55.760
That's a tabernacle.

00:55.760 --> 00:56.760
Send him a call.

00:56.760 --> 01:01.760
I will hold my remarks until you get ready to act on the motions.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.760
That's time I'll have a suggestion for the committee.

01:04.760 --> 01:13.760
Since 15th of the week, he tests among our, and we have some reluctance to fairly begin with the interrogation of the witness.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.760
We share with like to make a statement of two in connection with his co-op.

01:18.760 --> 01:26.760
In the first place, the chair has been derived from the stock, trying to find some more appropriate manner,

01:26.760 --> 01:34.760
in which the several of this unpleasant business, and by doing it, in this committee room, by this committee,

01:34.760 --> 01:37.760
which has part of its personnel involved.

01:37.760 --> 01:44.760
For that reason, I'll do with the occasion that's both out in public, on the radio and contestant's contestant against this procedure.

01:45.760 --> 01:53.760
And I thought that to this, by my voice, and by my voice, in the executive section, when he decided to have this committee undertake the task.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.760
I hope that at some time my colleague, John the committee, will see fit to vote.

01:57.760 --> 02:03.760
But the note in the minute is at the executive section, which has the field locked up in the state of my office,

02:03.760 --> 02:05.760
for the made part of the public spectrum.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.760
That's the tabernacle I have so moved.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.760
I talk in the motion.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.760
Very good.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.760
Is there any application?

02:12.760 --> 02:19.760
By unanimous approval, we will make public and as best as the short-hand reporting in front of the note of the opening session.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.760
It will help to get more of the facts on the record.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.760
Now may the chair continue by faith.

02:25.760 --> 02:33.760
Are you tremendously impressed by the fact that there are great many spot full amount, not motivated by partisanship,

02:33.760 --> 02:41.760
either from a democratic or a Republican standpoint, a genuinely concerned by the fact that the secretary of the army,

02:41.760 --> 02:48.760
and the large group of distinguished and able and important associates, and eight members of the United States,

02:48.760 --> 03:00.760
and a considerable portion of the staff, are tied up here, day after, day after, day after, day, trying to adjudicate this wordy and unhosen situation.

03:00.760 --> 03:09.760
We find ourselves, it seems to me, in a world, was a whole cause of freedom, as being challenged by tremendous questions.

03:10.760 --> 03:16.760
The men just be hired for the chair to believe that in that time the world was that time the challenge.

03:16.760 --> 03:24.760
When the enemy has an atomic bomb, when there is danger that all of our structures of civilization can be taken with traffic,

03:24.760 --> 03:32.760
terribly hired for the chair to, honestly, believe, that this is the most important business, the which the secretary of war,

03:32.760 --> 03:39.760
and his associates, and these eight members of the Senate and their associates can devote themselves.

03:39.760 --> 03:49.760
It seems to me, furthermore, that there should be enough give and take, there should be enough concern against this common danger,

03:49.760 --> 04:00.760
and the trying to stay in this age of survival our way of life, that we could find some more appropriate and speedier methods for adjudication,

04:00.760 --> 04:08.760
this miserable business in which we find ourselves in law. It seems to me, we could find some more constructive purpose in which we can devote our time.

04:08.760 --> 04:17.760
The chair is very much impressed by the long and careful efforts made by the introduction, in preserving his series of motion.

04:17.760 --> 04:26.760
The chair has not supported any of them in the past, because he has felt that his duty is what of the adjudicate words,

04:26.760 --> 04:33.760
to make sure that no one you're up with changing rules or threatening the regime, or eliminating them, was making them off the earth,

04:33.760 --> 04:42.760
should be engaged in which any one of the three entities involved would say they consider to be un-American or unjust or unfair.

04:42.760 --> 04:49.760
The chair has not voted for such resolutions in the past, the chair will not vote for such resolution in the future.

04:49.760 --> 04:56.760
As there are entities among us, with his afternoon we'll say they consider an honest effort to try to reduce the scope of this hearing,

04:56.760 --> 05:07.760
the fall within the category of injustice, or dishonesty, or un-Americanism, or unfair. Having said that, the chair would like to say that in his opinion,

05:07.760 --> 05:15.760
this is a pretty fair approach. I can't agree at all what some of the objections says when he says it's denied, what's right,

05:15.760 --> 05:24.760
there probably is everybody to be heard, because this keeps the status open. This provides something which I think Mr. Mitty might well have had a long time ago,

05:24.760 --> 05:32.760
which would have been possible of expediting the hearing. And that is an adequate opportunity to consult with Council concerning the fact he has,

05:32.760 --> 05:38.760
which we do not have, because he's had a chance to interview, he tells us all of the principles and all of the weapons.

05:38.760 --> 05:49.760
I'm persuaded a great deal by the fact that this provides that opportunity, provides us the chance to find out what has occurred in executive sessions and any executive sessions.

05:49.760 --> 05:57.760
And with those full facts people, I think we can more intelligibly decide whether more open hearing is desired or whether they are not.

05:57.760 --> 06:07.760
Having said that, the chair reaffirms his position, how it feels that in this body of responsible men, everybody was equally aware of the kind of world of which we live,

06:07.760 --> 06:17.760
the kind of challenges that can fund us, the kind of duties that beg for our attention. But if there be those among us who this afternoon are going to say they consider this resolution to be unfair,

06:17.760 --> 06:29.760
they consider this resolution to be unjust, that they think that it is more important to protect and continue these open hearings under the present system with the present rules going on and on.

06:29.760 --> 06:41.760
Then the chair is going to vote to support that position because they have a right to insist on their concept of justice, but they share belief in them, that their responsibility for prolongation and the spread responsibility for protection.

06:41.760 --> 06:54.760
To be firmly fastened upon those who say they want that to occur, rather than the members of this committee, who on both sides of the earth, as they go to the tremendous amount of time, first of all, we find the fine capital of the council which we secure.

06:54.760 --> 07:04.760
Then determining a rule of procedure which would be fair and equitable, the spice effect, the thorough integrity is trying to do the right job, the spice effect that we have enforced to try to a duty-gated situation,

07:04.760 --> 07:14.760
it's in which some of the personalities and laws, then we just go to long and careful patience to try and define the format for making the presentation of charges and charges.

07:14.760 --> 07:23.760
They've been going on continuously and unless we make some change, they're going on continuously the chair believes for many long, melancholy weeks in the future.

07:23.760 --> 07:32.760
During which time all of us in this room will have other responsibilities, will have to deny themselves the right to measure up to those who need it because of this responsibility.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.760
There's nothing further there.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.760
I'm going to have to make just one observation.

07:37.760 --> 07:43.760
I will see this over and over how regard these charges now serious they are.

07:44.760 --> 08:08.760
May I say, if the charges against Secretary Steven and he is that hard to, then the presence of Secretary Steven's and he is that year in this area means that they are doing less harm to their country while they're here, then it would be doing if they were in the synagogue.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.760
Mr. Cameron, I'm sorry.

08:11.760 --> 08:22.760
Some days ago I presented that here, the security of the country or for any other reason we should get ahead with the regular business of this subcommittee,

08:22.760 --> 08:33.760
that the staff of the subcommittee interacted in those problems to be transferred to another committee in order that the matter is a hand by communist and the French plan should be proceeded with.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.760
I still make that recommendation this morning.

08:37.760 --> 08:44.760
Now I agree with my distinguished colleague from Arkansas about the gravity of these charges.

08:44.760 --> 08:54.760
Very grave charges have been made against the army and very grave charges have been made against the chairman, the chief counsel and the executive director of this committee.

08:55.760 --> 09:08.760
As I read these memorandum or this memorandum resolution despite those charges the resolution provides that this committee before the charges have been adjudicated should go right ahead.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.760
That's all I have to say Mr. Chairman.

09:14.760 --> 09:19.760
The people at the straights the chair has never said that these charges are not important. They are important.

09:19.760 --> 09:27.760
The chair does not believe they are important as the theft from communism abroad or the federal communism at home.

09:27.760 --> 09:40.760
And the chair does not believe that in this resolution is incorporated anything which was preserved this committee from endeavoring to a duty table and report to the public the full set of facts and the public has the right to have the full set of facts.

09:40.760 --> 09:51.760
The chair is tremendously interested in putting those representatives of the army who are here and these representatives of the senate who are here back on the job of survival and protecting this country.

09:51.760 --> 10:01.760
And the chair wants to clearly understand that these hearings are protected. He will be here and he believes it should meet morning and afternoon and night sensitivities from now on if it's going to continue them.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.760
If there's that important he will be here.

10:04.760 --> 10:12.760
He will be here with tears in his eyes because he believes there are other duties so which everybody involved in this country for a seat should be devoting himself.

10:12.760 --> 10:19.760
And I hope and I pray that during the noon hour men will shift their souls and their consciousness to determine whether there isn't something more important.

10:19.760 --> 10:28.760
In time to protect these things and public as we have them and still without doing violence to justice signs them other way or do they get to consciousness.

10:28.760 --> 10:38.760
And the chair says now that all parties will know if you say to me at 230 you think this is unfair to take 5,000 television and all three air and change the rules.

10:38.760 --> 10:48.760
The chairman is going to vote to provide for those who insist upon that which they consider to be equity, the unjustness and fairness in the form of proceedings.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.760
Mr. Potter.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.760
Mr. Potter, I recognize him.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.760
I'll talk to you later.

10:55.760 --> 11:03.760
Mr. Chairman, I think all this discussion we missed the main point.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.760
Which line to ask the chairman?

11:06.760 --> 11:17.760
As a result of charges made on a part of personnel on the army and the Carter charges made on a part of send them across the end and members of his family.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.760
Now we never promised.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.760
That we were going to run in competition through Milton Burle.

11:23.760 --> 11:28.760
The only promise that we would entertain the facts that the public know the facts.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.760
Now, what concerns me?

11:32.760 --> 11:40.760
To the fact that we have, we know, that public opinion in this country.

11:40.760 --> 11:46.760
There's not pay to this type of a public role.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.760
They want to know the facts.

11:49.760 --> 11:57.760
But they're not interested in having the dignity of the United States, perhaps, the dignity of the administration.

11:57.760 --> 12:02.760
Consequently, be Lord and Lord, with each day of this here.

12:02.760 --> 12:07.760
Our prestige of law has greatly solved as a result of this.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.760
I think we must take into consideration and find it indiviable.

12:12.760 --> 12:29.760
As a result of this public discipline, a personality like is between the legislative branch of our government and the legislative branch of our government.

12:29.760 --> 12:35.760
I sincerely hope that we can divide the bill, but we have to take all the facts.

12:35.760 --> 12:51.760
We'll quickly, so that we can get on with these more important business of our government and so that our prestige at home and abroad will again have a place in the sunlight which it deserves.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.760
I'm sending Simon and you just a chair.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.760
I just have to, I want to just set the record straight.

12:56.760 --> 13:04.760
If in any way I don't think I did, but if in any way I implied that you did not think that these charges on both sides were grave,

13:04.760 --> 13:09.760
I will probably apologize for those implications because I never thought it and I did not mean to say it.

13:09.760 --> 13:18.760
I'm sure you didn't say it and I'm sure you didn't imply it, but I was not sure about the television audience might have concluded or inferred it so much that I think they are serious.

13:18.760 --> 13:23.760
But I certainly don't think they're the most serious business confronting the United States today.

13:23.760 --> 13:31.760
And while I think that every person in this room who's involved in the country, should have and must have a full and fresh hand,

13:31.760 --> 13:34.760
the main handy is reputation and defense.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.760
There's more important individuals and more important than reputation.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
And the future of America.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.760
And we have some pretty serious business to be done.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.760
And we're at the crossroads now.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.760
And we'll determine this afternoon whether we're going to find any means.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.760
We shorten these hearings which the parties to the dispute will consider fairly equitable.

13:52.760 --> 13:58.760
Whether we send our team into this thing for another two months perhaps and perhaps longer,

13:58.760 --> 14:04.760
while the internally long list of witnesses be called up and discussed in public and at the conclusion,

14:04.760 --> 14:10.760
we make a report as we make under any of the proposals before it, whether the McClellan, or the Dersen,

14:10.760 --> 14:13.760
or the one they continue on, Odin Fenyche.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.760
I think we are now ready to interview the witness on left.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.760
Uh, send him a package.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.760
I have a tray taking any time.

14:21.760 --> 14:26.760
It's all after we've come about two hours talking about how we're going to rush this thing through.

14:26.760 --> 14:30.760
But I would like to make my position crystal clear.

14:30.760 --> 14:37.760
As far as I am concerned, as the chair knows, I didn't have to initiate this and initiated by Mr. Davis and Madam.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.760
As far as I am concerned, I will lean over back for it.

14:40.760 --> 14:46.760
Do anything numerally possible to try and close up the circus so we can get back.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.760
Do they work at taking Communists out of government?

14:50.760 --> 14:53.760
Graphs, corruption, fraud, or the work of the committee?

14:53.760 --> 15:01.760
And, uh, the only reason why I'm not passing upon contractions was once in this morning,

15:01.760 --> 15:06.760
is that I wouldn't bring you new knower like to get the interpretation of some of the language in it,

15:06.760 --> 15:11.760
so that we won't have a long, grown-out, capital about this or some future day theory.

15:12.760 --> 15:17.760
Now, 1225, if you're sure you're watching, correct?

15:17.760 --> 15:20.760
I don't know whether we could start out for five minutes and interrogate them.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.760
I know, you'll be fine.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.760
Well, the undercover's going to go around for one round of the play.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.760
Uh, because you go around for 1230.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.760
Uh, Mr. Jenkins.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.760
I have no question, sir.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.760
Mr. Jenkins.

15:34.760 --> 15:35.760
The chair will pass.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.760
Uh, Mr. Wilkins.

15:37.760 --> 15:46.760
I would like to make a remark about the Secretary if I may, and about his physical condition.

15:46.760 --> 15:51.760
I think under the latitude between we have extended ourselves this morning's girl that you should have that for.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.760
Thank you.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.760
As a conclusion, the hearing is yesterday.

15:54.760 --> 15:58.760
The Secretary went to his home, which was, uh, to be a very unusual thing.

15:58.760 --> 16:03.760
And, of course, the evening I called Mrs. Stevens, and I learned that he had had a shot of Pemiscellani,

16:03.760 --> 16:06.760
and he had been here today because of a virus infection.

16:06.760 --> 16:11.760
He had concealed that from me and what I considered to be difficult fashion.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.760
He was given to him by an army doctor.

16:14.760 --> 16:20.760
I asked her if she, if he had a personal position, and he says, no, but I have.

16:20.760 --> 16:25.760
Well, I said, what you have in your personal position, look at the Secretary this evening.

16:25.760 --> 16:30.760
And that was done, and the same position looked at him again this morning.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.760
That position reported that the Secretary could go on.

16:34.760 --> 16:39.760
The Secretary could go on.

16:39.760 --> 16:47.760
I have learned, in the course of the morning, that the Secretary had a second shot of Pemiscellani.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.760
He attempted to conceal that from me.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.760
He wants to have me say, I'm feeling fine.

16:54.760 --> 16:59.760
I can go on for 30 days, it's easy, but I, well, I somewhat admire him.

16:59.760 --> 17:05.760
I am not totally convinced that he feels the fine is right to have you believe.

17:05.760 --> 17:11.760
It seems to me that it was the greatest act of the Committee to say now that he was dispensed with the Secretary,

17:11.760 --> 17:21.760
at least until he spent a film shot, and that we would take up the testimony of some other principles observed, if you will, the words principle.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.760
I do not think we ought to go off into collateral wetlessness.

17:25.760 --> 17:32.760
Yes, this Secretary is excused at this moment, but there are other principles that he was interrogation put together.

17:32.760 --> 17:43.760
Chairman, may I say that I agree with Mr. Wells, if the Secretary has been having kind of someone shot.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.760
He's got a virus infection. He should not be on this wetlessness plan.

17:47.760 --> 17:51.760
I think I should make it clear for the record, however, that when we talk about 13 days,

17:51.760 --> 17:53.760
that is rather just up to figures.

17:53.760 --> 18:01.760
Like, for example, we're getting credit for being on the same day today to take enough by speeches on how we can cut this short.

18:01.760 --> 18:10.760
But I do say that it's the Secretary has been receiving treatment for any human such as a virus I know it's like.

18:10.760 --> 18:15.760
I think it will be completely unfair to him, unfair to the Committee, but I've been justified.

18:15.760 --> 18:25.760
So far as I'm concerned, I would have no objections over it stepping down now until such time that he is, we'll be likely returned to the town.

18:25.760 --> 18:31.760
To me, I'm sorry, the fact that I'm with that explanation which you didn't have when we could just as we continue now.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.760
I can no longer talk about it.

18:33.760 --> 18:41.760
I acted on the Secretary, and the Secretary, and the fact that it is virtually 1230, the Chairman likes to suggest this.

18:41.760 --> 18:49.760
It will not be necessary in order to get answers to the questions that the Chair is going to ask before we pass on his resolution.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.760
The Secretary agrees I should ask.

18:51.760 --> 18:56.760
It will not be necessary for the Secretary to be here at 230 unless he wants to, but that's appropriate.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.760
Mr. Wells, you can fare with him till the noon hour.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.760
Let me implore this, and then we'll run you a chair.

19:03.760 --> 19:09.760
Let me implore Mr. Hensel, Secretary Stevens, Mr. Wells.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.760
And that's Mr. Ryan, who speaks to Mr. Hensel.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.760
But all of you will go to your respective shops till the noon hour.

19:17.760 --> 19:24.760
And hold yourself carefully and readiness to consult if you want to with some direction or our council.

19:24.760 --> 19:30.760
If there are some modifications in this which would enable you then to say that you think it is fair and just, I hope you'll make it.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.760
Or if you feel it's fair and just now, I hope you'll say so.

19:34.760 --> 19:40.760
Chair does not believe that there's much to be gained after two years this afternoon, again trying to change the rules of the procedure.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.760
If we start ourselves to this, we own business.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.760
From now until the board is July or whenever it's worth it.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.760
The council will be available and the direction will be available.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.760
They are the two that speak to one of the committee.

19:51.760 --> 19:58.760
If you have any suggested changes or reports, the two that he will take this up from Mr. Stevens, you will not be called as they witness this afternoon.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.760
And you can either ask the right, Mr. Wells to speak for you or tell me yourself if you want to be one of them.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.760
Mr. Chairman, we just...

20:04.760 --> 20:08.760
Mr. Chairman, first of all, Mr. Chairman, first of all, Mr. Justice, who will meet this afternoon?

20:08.760 --> 20:19.760
That we find out how the various parties feel about this, that we go to on it, and that we not wait day after day after day by, along with the Kim Zayn species.

20:19.760 --> 20:24.760
Chair, certainly, please. We should go to the afternoon. He's not going to undertake to deny the Sunnacras the right to be heard.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.760
However, we need to see the details after him.

20:27.760 --> 20:35.760
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, not enough to the committee will hold its next session, the two parties that have to do.
