WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
I don't want to get in trouble with any of your rival.

00:02.800 --> 00:04.300
That's what I do about this.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.240
I'm just trying to keep people to protect their videos,

00:06.240 --> 00:09.640
that you just try to, and then just bring it.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.840
It is good for you to take time out to come up here

00:11.840 --> 00:13.280
and interview me.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.680
And I'm ready for any questions you might have.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.800
And I'm ready to do that.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.640
At first, I want to say, I don't want to say it over

00:21.640 --> 00:23.640
to the, I'm there.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.520
I'm not going to let you mention it to my effort

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
that I'm not going to do.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.320
I hope that my services are pleasing to these people.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.520
I think it's not a state of fun to see

00:32.520 --> 00:35.520
as they are treated as a good time.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.520
Well, by the way, there's so many things I could ask you about.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.520
I hardly know what it began.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.520
But I assume that the people of color to you

00:42.520 --> 00:45.520
would just like to have a thumbnail sketch

00:45.520 --> 00:47.520
if I'm satisfied in the United States,

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
and I'm doing the week.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.520
But that's an easy question to answer,

00:50.520 --> 00:51.520
really.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.520
We have been considering to have two or three weeks

00:54.520 --> 00:58.320
not to get, not to get, not to get.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.320
And you know, the Senate has to throw amendments

01:00.320 --> 01:02.800
to the National Gas Act on the,

01:02.800 --> 01:03.800
to the remainder of the week,

01:03.800 --> 01:06.640
the voters are various thunderous views,

01:06.640 --> 01:09.080
including the rivers and towers of legislation

01:09.080 --> 01:12.120
and also the displaced district.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.520
Well, I suppose I'm in the immediate broadcast.

01:14.520 --> 01:15.960
It's not your reason.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.120
For your opposition to the vote-down,

01:18.120 --> 01:20.400
the farewell, yes, I have, Lee.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.440
Recently, I might say that I have pushed a bill

01:22.440 --> 01:24.440
in the Southern North Indian,

01:24.440 --> 01:27.440
there's an insufficient competition among gas producers

01:27.440 --> 01:31.440
as production and the whole of consumers' fighting gas.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.440
I think the rate for regulation

01:33.440 --> 01:35.440
by the federal part of the mission

01:35.440 --> 01:37.440
whenever it starts making progress

01:37.440 --> 01:40.440
and starts is essential to prevent material increases

01:40.440 --> 01:42.440
in the rates of natural gas users

01:42.440 --> 01:44.440
and electricity and elsewhere.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.440
Well, some of them are the producers

01:46.440 --> 01:49.440
of natural gas, but they were not repeating a fair pocket

01:49.440 --> 01:50.440
on their investment.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.440
They are very mild-compension,

01:52.440 --> 01:54.440
but the testimony on the hearing

01:54.440 --> 01:56.440
reflects the number of stockholders,

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
hardly large amounts,

01:57.440 --> 01:59.440
largely natural gas companies

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
who are getting dividends

02:00.440 --> 02:02.440
of 30% on their common stock.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.440
I would say that's pretty good return.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.440
Hey, how this needs to be pretty fast.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.440
But the teams just have been kind of fast.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.440
I will be on our engineering development center

02:12.440 --> 02:14.440
with that super-tonic aircraft

02:14.440 --> 02:15.440
and other mechanisms,

02:15.440 --> 02:17.440
and it's going to be quite a fight.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.440
I will be here,

02:18.440 --> 02:20.440
and you now win the construction,

02:20.440 --> 02:21.440
and we'll be talking.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.440
Well, I'll leave,

02:22.440 --> 02:25.440
but it's good to know that

02:25.440 --> 02:27.440
people like yourself are interested

02:27.440 --> 02:30.440
in the Arnold Air Engineering Development Center,

02:30.440 --> 02:31.440
which is for this,

02:31.440 --> 02:32.440
that is doing a whole lot to

02:32.440 --> 02:33.440
and another thing

02:33.440 --> 02:35.440
to advertise and and see.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.440
And I have no doubt

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
that an information has been

02:37.440 --> 02:38.440
constructed and constructed

02:38.440 --> 02:40.440
and is going to get started.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
The four engineers

02:41.440 --> 02:44.440
have greatly improved the construction program,

02:44.440 --> 02:46.440
and the top-around of our engineers

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
are the first part of the program

02:47.440 --> 02:50.440
to get underway about how it's first.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.440
A lot will probably consist of

02:52.440 --> 02:53.440
the steeping building

02:53.440 --> 02:55.440
and will cost $100,000.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.440
Then I hear the four engineers

02:57.440 --> 02:58.440
will begin the water systems

02:58.440 --> 03:01.440
with the vast planetary and fire detection

03:01.440 --> 03:02.440
a little bit later on

03:02.440 --> 03:04.440
about the middle of September.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.440
And then about a month later,

03:05.440 --> 03:07.440
I think the plan is to install

03:07.440 --> 03:08.440
a storage.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.440
The storage,

03:09.440 --> 03:12.440
the sleep in the railroad work will,

03:12.440 --> 03:13.440
again,

03:13.440 --> 03:14.440
along in November,

03:14.440 --> 03:17.440
according to the start destination I have,

03:17.440 --> 03:19.440
a first for living and earth-paring

03:19.440 --> 03:21.440
and stunts in and

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
the stuff is rolled

03:22.440 --> 03:24.440
to start until they got underway

03:24.440 --> 03:27.440
from time with them in the next two or three months.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
And I have a time

03:28.440 --> 03:30.440
at a $3,500,000 time

03:30.440 --> 03:32.440
that's going to be closed

03:32.440 --> 03:33.440
and we'll get underway

03:33.440 --> 03:35.440
and all it's also.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.440
The landowners in America

03:36.440 --> 03:37.440
have been mentioned

03:37.440 --> 03:39.440
and they can put on foot here.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
At any time,

03:40.440 --> 03:42.440
for the beginning of construction

03:42.440 --> 03:44.440
of the actual experimental units

03:44.440 --> 03:45.440
this year,

03:45.440 --> 03:47.440
I have no doubt

03:47.440 --> 03:49.440
that they're making about about either,

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
please.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.440
But I'll talk about it,

03:53.440 --> 03:54.440
talk about it,

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
talk about it,

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
but it's still a few tests,

03:56.440 --> 03:57.440
high altitude engines

03:57.440 --> 03:59.440
so perhaps that's probably

03:59.440 --> 04:01.440
a lot of part of this year,

04:01.440 --> 04:03.440
maybe a new kind of lower distance.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.440
And not though,

04:04.440 --> 04:06.440
one other experimental facility

04:06.440 --> 04:07.440
will probably be

04:07.440 --> 04:09.440
begun about the same time.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.440
The center of the UNO

04:11.440 --> 04:12.440
over the air force

04:12.440 --> 04:14.440
of the car of engineers

04:14.440 --> 04:16.440
has a project community

04:16.440 --> 04:18.440
and connection with the center world

04:18.440 --> 04:20.440
to the expected surrounding towns

04:20.440 --> 04:21.440
to handle this new,

04:21.440 --> 04:23.440
in-fox display.

04:23.440 --> 04:23.440


04:23.440 --> 04:24.440
of the most considerable difference

04:24.440 --> 04:25.440
of a tenium

04:25.440 --> 04:26.440
in the air force

04:26.440 --> 04:27.440
and the four engineers

04:27.440 --> 04:28.440
on that point.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.440
I understand

04:29.440 --> 04:30.440
in about the matter is

04:30.440 --> 04:32.440
that at the present time

04:32.440 --> 04:33.440
a community will be filled

04:33.440 --> 04:34.440
on the spot.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.440
Of course,

04:35.440 --> 04:36.440
the incident of trade

04:36.440 --> 04:38.440
coming to the area

04:38.440 --> 04:40.440
will be tight and item

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
and very sizable one

04:41.440 --> 04:42.440
indeed.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.440
For the very own

04:43.440 --> 04:44.440
scientific keyboard,

04:44.440 --> 04:45.440
the fourth-giolin tenet

04:45.440 --> 04:46.440
will be answering questions

04:46.440 --> 04:48.440
for the center takers.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.440
That's what ends

04:49.440 --> 04:50.440
the purpose of the ten-year

04:50.440 --> 04:51.440
center.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.440
And the first place leads

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440
to substitutions

04:53.440 --> 04:54.440
of the bad part

04:54.440 --> 04:55.440
is the spending of

04:55.440 --> 04:56.440
centers to determine

04:56.440 --> 04:57.440
the number of representatives

04:57.440 --> 04:59.440
in the lower house of centers.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.440
These were demonstrated

05:00.440 --> 05:01.440
in types.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.440
At the same time,

05:02.440 --> 05:03.440
valuable information

05:03.440 --> 05:04.440
is covered by

05:04.440 --> 05:05.440
this number

05:05.440 --> 05:06.440
to store

05:06.440 --> 05:08.440
prevent the 19th

05:08.440 --> 05:09.440
of days.

05:09.440 --> 05:09.440


05:09.440 --> 05:10.440
and other

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
educational organizations

05:11.440 --> 05:13.440
have with public

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
agencies.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.440
And this is

05:15.440 --> 05:16.440
a question that income

05:16.440 --> 05:17.440
of just the majority

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
of the 13th house.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.440
And a battle for businesses

05:19.440 --> 05:20.440
and serving the very

05:20.440 --> 05:21.440
market.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.440
All of these

05:22.440 --> 05:23.440
information are

05:23.440 --> 05:24.440
gained in one

05:24.440 --> 05:25.440
fifteen and the

05:25.440 --> 05:26.440
one-class

05:26.440 --> 05:26.440


05:26.440 --> 05:27.440
add up to

05:27.440 --> 05:28.440
a level of

05:28.440 --> 05:29.440
the most

05:29.440 --> 05:29.440


05:29.440 --> 05:30.440
efforts to obtain

05:30.440 --> 05:31.440
information

05:31.440 --> 05:32.440
relating to

05:32.440 --> 05:33.440
subtraction, housing

05:33.440 --> 05:34.440
and other

05:34.440 --> 05:35.440
services.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.440
The 45 basic

05:36.440 --> 05:37.440
substance in the

05:37.440 --> 05:38.440
population

05:38.440 --> 05:39.440
is done.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.440
But only several of these

05:40.440 --> 05:41.440
are made to be answered

05:41.440 --> 05:42.440
by most people.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.440
What's the first

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
kind of thing that I

05:44.440 --> 05:45.440
reviewed the antics

05:45.440 --> 05:46.440
items with

05:46.440 --> 05:47.440
high-continuity

05:47.440 --> 05:48.440
and conventional?

05:48.440 --> 05:49.440
Nobody has

05:49.440 --> 05:50.440
been it, but my own.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.440
Well, the federal

05:51.440 --> 05:52.440
lower clouds of

05:52.440 --> 05:53.440
the antics,

05:53.440 --> 05:54.440
but the same

05:54.440 --> 05:55.440
amount of the

05:55.440 --> 05:56.440
clouds of the antics

05:56.440 --> 05:57.440
are made to the

05:57.440 --> 05:58.440
criminal of the country

05:58.440 --> 05:59.440
reveal any of the

05:59.440 --> 06:00.440
young, under the

06:00.440 --> 06:01.440
implementation of

06:01.440 --> 06:02.440
the cloud that

06:02.440 --> 06:03.440
is given.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.440
The only one

06:04.440 --> 06:05.440
for fifty-fifth

06:05.440 --> 06:06.440
people is

06:06.440 --> 06:07.440
designed to be

06:07.440 --> 06:08.440
designed to conceal

06:08.440 --> 06:09.440
the identity of those

06:09.440 --> 06:10.440
who devide the

06:10.440 --> 06:11.440
nation.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.440
That population

06:12.440 --> 06:13.440
came and

06:13.440 --> 06:14.440
are in both

06:14.440 --> 06:15.440
committees this year.

06:15.440 --> 06:15.440


06:15.440 --> 06:16.440
country's bureau

06:16.440 --> 06:17.440
is tough to

06:17.440 --> 06:18.440
serve you to be

06:18.440 --> 06:19.440
up.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.440
The power of the

06:20.440 --> 06:21.440
nation is confirmed by

06:21.440 --> 06:22.440
more than nineteen

06:22.440 --> 06:23.440
million persons

06:23.440 --> 06:24.440
over nineteen-hundred

06:24.440 --> 06:25.440
percent.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.440
The population of

06:26.440 --> 06:27.440
poverty run in the

06:27.440 --> 06:28.440
neighborhood of the

06:28.440 --> 06:29.440
Rhino-hundred-and-fifth

06:29.440 --> 06:30.440
one million people

06:30.440 --> 06:31.440
is here.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.440
I have stuck

06:32.440 --> 06:34.440
in the

06:34.440 --> 06:34.440


06:34.440 --> 06:35.440
country

06:35.440 --> 06:36.440
for the

06:36.440 --> 06:37.440
first time in
