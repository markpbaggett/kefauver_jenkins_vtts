WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.580
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Tennessee, we are very proud of the volunteer state of

00:08.580 --> 00:14.020
the part that many of our distinguished citizens are playing in the federal government at the

00:14.020 --> 00:16.020
present time.

00:16.020 --> 00:22.860
We have, as you know, a citizen, Ram Dixon, who is chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,

00:22.860 --> 00:27.260
one of the most important regulatory agencies in Washington.

00:27.260 --> 00:33.380
So Joe Swedler, who had a long and fine record with the Tennessee Valley Authority, is chairman

00:33.380 --> 00:39.180
of the old powerful federal power commission that has to do with fixing gas rates and other

00:39.180 --> 00:41.340
matters of that kind.

00:41.340 --> 00:47.420
We are proud of the fact that they are doing very good jobs in their respective positions.

00:47.420 --> 00:55.220
But I know that all of you were related, as I was, when a few weeks ago, President Kennedy

00:55.220 --> 01:00.860
announced the appointment of William Henry of Memphis, Tennessee, to be chairman of the

01:00.860 --> 01:04.460
Federal Communications Commission.

01:04.460 --> 01:08.260
This is a most important agency in Washington.

01:08.260 --> 01:13.980
We are honored to have Bill Henry of Memphis with us on this occasion and Bill Amp have

01:13.980 --> 01:19.900
it introduce you to the listeners and viewers of this good television station.

01:19.900 --> 01:20.900
Thank you very much, Tom.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.860
Pleased to be here for my first time.

01:22.860 --> 01:27.180
All your information, you can see that Mr. Henry is a very young man, of course, both

01:27.180 --> 01:29.180
ever saw it.

01:29.180 --> 01:37.460
Young, I said he came from Memphis where he was practicing law, is one of the leading young

01:37.460 --> 01:39.860
attorneys of that city.

01:39.860 --> 01:45.940
He graduated at Yale University of Yale, with its AB degree, then came down to Vanderbilt

01:45.940 --> 01:48.540
to get his law degree as LLB.

01:49.260 --> 01:53.580
He was very active in the last campaign, doing a great job.

01:53.580 --> 02:01.020
And he has made a fine impression in Washington among people in the broadcasting industry and

02:01.020 --> 02:05.500
others that he has had an opportunity of being associated with.

02:05.500 --> 02:11.820
Bill, some of the part of the best part about him is that he has a lovely wife Sherry,

02:11.820 --> 02:16.740
who is a very popular with the ladies in Washington.

02:16.740 --> 02:21.180
She has a daughter Elizabeth VI and Sherry III.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.380
And you have a...

02:23.380 --> 02:27.020
Only that junior.

02:27.020 --> 02:29.220
And only that junior, we have a two-year-old son.

02:29.220 --> 02:32.060
Yeah, two-year-old William, William, Jr.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.060
Right.

02:33.060 --> 02:34.060
A very fine family.

02:34.060 --> 02:37.060
That picture was in Washington, post just a few days ago.

02:37.060 --> 02:41.940
Well Bill, how do you like being in Washington and tell us something about the Federal Communications

02:41.940 --> 02:42.940
Commission?

02:42.940 --> 02:46.620
Well, I like it very much and I think the reason I like it is because I like my job

02:46.620 --> 02:47.620
so much.

02:47.620 --> 02:50.300
It's fascinating, challenging work.

02:50.300 --> 02:55.180
Well, what is the most important job at the Federal Communications Commission?

02:55.180 --> 02:58.100
Well, we've got a lot of them.

02:58.100 --> 03:03.860
We are set up to regulate not only the broadcasting industry, radio and television, but also telephone,

03:03.860 --> 03:05.860
telegraph, international communications.

03:05.860 --> 03:07.620
I think perhaps we should be able to do that.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.100
How much do we pay for our phone rates?

03:09.100 --> 03:10.100
Right.

03:10.100 --> 03:16.580
We have to fix interstate phone rates, telegraph rates, overseas cable rates and so on.

03:16.580 --> 03:24.140
I think our most important job at the moment is to implement the Communications Satellite

03:24.140 --> 03:26.820
Bill that was passed last year by the Congress.

03:26.820 --> 03:32.980
See that gets off the ground properly and it integrates properly with the rest of the

03:32.980 --> 03:34.540
countries in the world.

03:34.540 --> 03:39.620
So that we can truly have an international space communication satellite.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.620
That's right.

03:40.620 --> 03:44.180
I think hope we all consider some of the good amendments that some of us offer to the

03:44.180 --> 03:45.180
Bill when we have it.

03:45.180 --> 03:48.700
We're considered all of those.

03:48.700 --> 03:52.940
It's extremely important now because it's a unique thing.

03:52.940 --> 03:54.740
It's never done with something about it.

03:54.740 --> 03:59.620
We talked about it on the floor of the Senate for weeks and weeks and weeks at Info Nimton,

03:59.620 --> 04:03.460
but tell us something about the space communication satellites.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.620
Well, we could take up the whole program with that.

04:06.620 --> 04:14.140
Briefly, it's a unique combination of business enterprise and government regulation.

04:14.140 --> 04:21.700
It's 50% owned by the so-called Common Carriers, which would include AT&T, IT&T,

04:21.700 --> 04:27.140
medication, RCA and so on, right, communication carriers, and 50% by the public.

04:27.140 --> 04:31.460
And then it's regulated thoroughly by the FCC.

04:31.460 --> 04:33.500
We established the rates.

04:33.500 --> 04:40.460
We decide where the ground stations will be, what type they'll be, whether the corporation

04:40.460 --> 04:43.780
will own them, whether they'll lease them and so on.

04:43.780 --> 04:51.260
And the corporation itself has the job of putting the orbiting satellites into operation

04:51.260 --> 04:55.340
and of dealing with all of the foreign countries that they must deal with to interconnect over

04:55.340 --> 04:56.340
there.

04:56.340 --> 05:01.380
So all in all, it's a most challenging job that we have in front of us.

05:01.380 --> 05:09.460
Bill, the communication satellite is put up a NASA rocket.

05:09.460 --> 05:18.380
I believe the present ones are 600, 700,000 miles high.

05:18.380 --> 05:25.380
Has been proposed to the UNB in orbit 22,000 miles, as in the 23th.

05:25.380 --> 05:30.980
A signal is sent, and then it's from here, then it's sent back to a ground station in

05:30.980 --> 05:34.980
England, so that people can talk back and forth.

05:34.980 --> 05:38.180
Television can be sent by way of the satellite.

05:39.180 --> 05:44.340
The idea is to bring the world closer together to make it easier to communicate.

05:44.340 --> 05:47.540
And that will be the way of communication in the years to come.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.460
I don't think there's any doubt about that.

05:49.460 --> 05:56.420
The problem is to, it's extremely expensive to get a satellite system in operation.

05:56.420 --> 06:04.060
And that's why it's got to be so carefully watched and guided so that it can be done in

06:04.060 --> 06:05.060
a practical manner.

06:05.580 --> 06:13.300
But even in this nation, as between Washington and San Francisco or Washington and Hawaii or Alaska,

06:13.300 --> 06:19.900
communication satellite can be used rather than the regular telephone lines, can't they?

06:19.900 --> 06:22.900
They can, of course, it's not operational yet.

06:22.900 --> 06:27.900
And many of the companies are going ahead and putting in the regular cables.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.740
So it's got to be all tied in together.

06:30.740 --> 06:34.620
And it's just tying in and coordination that really makes it the job that it is.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.700
And do you think it will be operational?

06:36.700 --> 06:37.740
Well, it's hard to say.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.460
Some people say it'll be in 1970 or so.

06:40.460 --> 06:45.060
Some people say it'll be in the mid-60s.

06:45.060 --> 06:51.020
Of course, we all hope that it will be as soon as possible, but yet not oversold and put

06:51.020 --> 06:52.260
up before it's really ready.

06:52.260 --> 06:59.500
So it has to be a number of satellites in order to have communications available for all

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
parts of the world.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
Right.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.980
I just wanted to look because if one goes out, then you've lost communications and you've

07:04.980 --> 07:06.780
got no real system at all.

07:06.780 --> 07:12.940
Well, are you the FCC and others talking with the British and the French and the Germans

07:12.940 --> 07:16.220
and even the Russians about joining in the program?

07:16.220 --> 07:22.020
That's one of the jobs that the corporation satellite itself is now doing.

07:22.020 --> 07:28.060
We at the FCC and we are using our good offices to put them together and to help them.

07:28.060 --> 07:32.540
But they are in the process now talking with the Canadians and I think they plan to go

07:32.540 --> 07:39.140
to Europe very shortly and talk to the British Post Office and the offices on the continent.

07:39.140 --> 07:44.700
And then there will be a meeting I believe at the end of this year, the reference to the

07:44.700 --> 07:47.500
assignment of channels in Geneva.

07:47.500 --> 07:52.580
There's an conference in Geneva in October that will go into the allocation of all the

07:52.580 --> 07:56.860
frequencies for all purposes that will be used in space.

07:56.860 --> 08:00.900
So that's all very interesting and that in itself is a big job.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.900
How many members of the FCC are there?

08:02.900 --> 08:04.900
Well, there's seven commissioners.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.900
Seven commissioners, one of whom is Chairman.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.820
Then you have quite a staff, but we in the Congress never give you quite enough money

08:10.820 --> 08:11.820
to do it.

08:11.820 --> 08:15.420
Well, we never get enough money, but on the other hand, we are trying very hard to abide

08:15.420 --> 08:22.060
by the President's order which he issued some time ago saying to try to let the President

08:22.060 --> 08:26.940
know, do the extra jobs instead of hiring extra men and try to get along on the same

08:26.940 --> 08:27.940
budget?

08:27.940 --> 08:35.660
Well, you have a charge of program programming of television and radio.

08:35.660 --> 08:40.100
What's the FCC's concern about programming at the present time?

08:40.100 --> 08:45.140
Well, programming, of course, is the end product of broadcasting and therefore we must be concerned

08:45.140 --> 08:50.300
with it since we are required to see that television radio operate in the public interest.

08:50.700 --> 08:57.980
Is a very fine line, however, between regulation on outlawed in the public interest and in

08:57.980 --> 09:03.660
no censorship provisions of the First Amendment and the Section 326 of the Communications

09:03.660 --> 09:04.660
Act.

09:04.660 --> 09:11.220
We operate somewhere in between and we are concerned primarily with the overall operations of

09:11.220 --> 09:12.820
the stations in the public interest.

09:12.820 --> 09:20.820
What I mean concern at the moment is to see that the programs which the people can listen

09:20.820 --> 09:28.860
to and can pick from and choose from is a variety of subjects, not just the same old thing,

09:28.860 --> 09:30.780
every night or every weekend.

09:30.780 --> 09:34.580
And I think they could stand some improvement along those lines.

09:34.580 --> 09:41.060
Yeah, well, I had the flu here a while back and I was in bed and seemed to me about the

09:41.060 --> 09:45.420
only programs I could find would be to shoot them up programs, the violent programs,

09:45.420 --> 09:48.140
while some of my enjoy to them.

09:48.140 --> 09:54.540
But of course, there again, you got problem censorship, but I do know that you're interested

09:54.540 --> 09:59.420
in trying to get television stations to have more public service programs, more...

09:59.420 --> 10:04.220
The reason that we are is because I think there are a lot of people who feel that they

10:04.220 --> 10:09.260
should be more and that's our job after all is to see that what they get, what they feel,

10:09.260 --> 10:13.380
what the people feel there is a need and an interest in.

10:13.380 --> 10:19.620
And then how about the programs, the educational channels?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.660
Do they come under your supervision?

10:21.660 --> 10:26.260
We have to, we license all, not only the commercial broadcasters, but also the educational

10:26.260 --> 10:27.260
television stations.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.260
How are they getting along?

10:28.260 --> 10:29.260
I've been very interested in that.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.740
Well, they are progressing pretty well.

10:31.740 --> 10:36.540
There's been a great deal of recent interest in educational television.

10:36.540 --> 10:43.940
With the passage last year by the Congress of authority for the federal government to

10:43.940 --> 10:49.620
provide matching funds to states for educational television facilities.

10:49.620 --> 10:53.180
A lot of the states have now applied for networks.

10:53.180 --> 10:59.100
We must issue the licenses for those educational networks.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.900
The whole thing is developing, I think, very well.

11:02.900 --> 11:09.700
It's interesting, I think, your audience would be interested in the fact that we believe,

11:09.700 --> 11:15.420
some of us do at any rate, that the more educational television succeeds, the more it gets an interest

11:15.420 --> 11:22.580
in the community and people begin to look at it and enjoy it, it will upgrade all television.

11:22.580 --> 11:27.620
The commercial television will then have some competition will better itself.

11:27.620 --> 11:31.260
Commercial television then have programs like we're putting on, very educational,

11:31.300 --> 11:33.140
and struck many people.

11:33.140 --> 11:38.220
How many educational channels do we have or stations do we have in Tennessee?

11:38.220 --> 11:43.300
I don't know, offhand, I think the Tennessee legislature, so I'm not mistaken,

11:43.300 --> 11:51.220
just passed the law authorizing the proper state authority to petition the FCC for some channels

11:51.220 --> 11:54.900
looking towards the state in-school network.

11:54.900 --> 11:58.180
There's some in-school, there's some out-of-school.

11:58.180 --> 12:04.340
The one in Memphis, I do know, was one of the very early television stations, and of course,

12:04.340 --> 12:05.740
I think it can be proud of that.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.740
I mean, everyone in Nashville, I believe.

12:07.740 --> 12:08.740
Very well.

12:08.740 --> 12:09.740
Very well.

12:09.740 --> 12:10.740
Very well.

12:10.740 --> 12:11.740
Very well.

12:11.740 --> 12:12.740
In Nashville, Channel 2.

12:12.740 --> 12:17.060
I heard the television stations doing generally, I think we have some other fine television

12:17.060 --> 12:18.060
under it.

12:18.060 --> 12:21.380
Well, I haven't heard any complaints, and so I can assume that they're doing well.

12:21.380 --> 12:24.060
You mean, if they weren't doing what you'd be hearing complaints, you know?

12:24.060 --> 12:25.580
Well, hopefully we would, yes.

12:25.980 --> 12:28.580
Well, what is the public's role in broadcasting?

12:28.580 --> 12:31.380
Well, that points it up.

12:31.380 --> 12:37.580
The public's role, as I see it, is to let the stations know what they like, what they don't

12:37.580 --> 12:41.540
like, and when they're interested in not being served.

12:41.540 --> 12:45.780
And I think one of our big jobs is to try to get across to the public that they do have

12:45.780 --> 12:49.060
a role in what's put on.

12:49.060 --> 12:53.900
We're set up by law to try to get the stations to put on what they want.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.740
And I think it's a good combination.

12:56.740 --> 13:00.020
The more they would be interested in it, the more they would let us know about it, and

13:00.020 --> 13:01.740
I think the better they'd be served.

13:01.740 --> 13:06.820
In other words, are you like to have suggestions from the public for kind of programs they like?

13:06.820 --> 13:07.820
Well, I think, yes.

13:07.820 --> 13:11.780
I think it's more important that they tell that to the broadcasters.

13:11.780 --> 13:18.780
And if they have general suggestions about lack of variety or that programs they like

13:18.780 --> 13:24.260
or not at the right time or things like that, that they're all helpful in us, we can't,

13:24.260 --> 13:28.860
as I say, we can never get into specific programs because of the censorship provision

13:28.860 --> 13:29.860
and rightly so.

13:29.860 --> 13:35.300
We understand there must be commercials in order for the television radio stations to

13:35.300 --> 13:38.140
make money, which has come out even.

13:38.140 --> 13:41.780
How about some of these very, very loud commercials?

13:41.780 --> 13:46.900
Well, we've had a lot of complaints about that, and we're looking into it.

13:46.900 --> 13:50.540
It's a tough question because it's a subjective thing.

13:50.540 --> 13:54.620
What is loud to one person may be a little bit different to another, and the problem is

13:54.620 --> 13:57.980
measuring it, but we're hopeful, and I think we'll get out of rule on it shortly.

13:57.980 --> 14:03.700
Well, Bill Henry, I want to thank you for coming and being with us, and we're very

14:03.700 --> 14:04.700
proud of you.

14:04.700 --> 14:05.700
I am.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.700
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.300
We'll see you again later on.
