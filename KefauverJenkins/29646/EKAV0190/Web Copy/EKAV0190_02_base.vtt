WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I was not meeting that afternoon with the White House

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
representatives and the Justice Department officials.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I wouldn't have made the trip that day.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
There's little about in my mind, but that we were moving in

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
extrabally to the point where we would have to call on those

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
members someday.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I wouldn't have made the trip that day.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Now, Mr. Adam, when Mr. Stevens said in the face this

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
morning that the act of the day was going to be a little

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
long, Mr. Stevens said in the face this morning that the act

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
were the act of the Army alone.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
So you consider a visit by you to the Senate in Durkton,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
or constantly buying a White House assistant as an act of the

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Army alone?

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Well, a White House assistant couldn't have gone without me.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Could you have gone without him?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Well, there's some doubt in my mind as to whether or not I

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
would have had as ready access.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I was at that time, Senator Durkton has indicated that I

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
probably would have been able to get in on call.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
And so what you do with that, it appears to me as though I

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
could have gone to see him alone.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I was pleased to have Mr. Morgan accompanying me for the very

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
reason that I was not personally acquainted with Senator Durkton.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Had you been personally acquainted with Senator McClellan?

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
As I state, I had met him once a few years ago, but he

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
wouldn't have remembered it.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
But you went to see Senator McClellan alone, did you not?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yes.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
But the next day you couldn't go to see Senator Durkton alone.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
You saw a high tide quote going to see Senator Durkton alone.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Well, why didn't you say, why didn't you bring along the White House

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
representative? This was an act of the Army alone.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Why did I bring along the White House representative?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Yes, sir. This was an act of the Army.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
The question is that he said to me, I said, well, I don't know Senator Durkton.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
And he said, well, I do well, go with you, or something.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Do you ever attempted to get an appointment with Senator Durkton and been

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
turned out? No, I haven't. His office is always open.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Is it not, sir? Are you or anybody else having business with him?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm quite sure it is. I've always found it for these, so I know that.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Now, the U.L. explanation is then that Mr. Morgan wanted to go along

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
to perform the introduction to that, right?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Well, I'm not sure that he wanted to go along.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
He offered to go along because we weren't acquainted for the purposes of performing the introduction.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Does Mr. Morgan do anything to introduce you on the event?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Leave the room and let the Army alone carry out his business.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
No, I'm at a occasion. I think Mr. Morgan, who knew Senator Durkton

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
much better than I, who had a long acquaintance with him.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I think Mr. Morgan did more of the talking than I did,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
that he talked about the Army's problems.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Well, would you say this was an act of the Army alone when you brought us the senator

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
or company by White House representatives getting to his office

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
and the White House representatives even outporked you on the matter?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Would you still say this was an act of the Army alone?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Yes, it was an Army. It was a, it was a, it was a,

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
it was a children made on behalf of the Army by an official of the Army

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
who had the responsibility.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I, I was taken there by somebody who performed the introduction

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
and who could tell him the story, if he chose to or could remain quiet,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
he happened to have spoken more than he remained quiet.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
I think he did more than half of the talking on behalf of the two of us.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Do you think that's reconcilable with the statement that this was an act of the Army alone?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Yes, I think it is, sir.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
Now, Mr. Adam following the events of these few days,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
when he said that I didn't hear you.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Surely, sir, I just started to say following the events of these few days,

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
did you ever communicate directly or indirectly with any of the persons

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
who had attended that January 21st week,

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
or did they ever communicate with you directly or indirectly?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
They respectfully, sir, I believe that the directive of the President

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
is precluded in the testing mass.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
Well, Mr. Adam, an approach to listen here, we're trying to decide whether the Army

04:10.000 --> 04:21.000
was acting alone or whether the fact is this was part of a plan instigated by other persons.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Now, how is my own?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
You can make all the questioning you want, but this was not part of a plan

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
that was instigated by people outside of Pentagon.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Your interrogation can go any way it wants, if you will not develop that,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
because that is not true.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Sir, I can't go any way I wanted to if I can't get any answers.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
Now, my question to you was following this January 21st week,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
at which a decision was made,

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
for a person to go to members of this committee and try to kill the investigation

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
of loyalty for which cleared money, coupling those requests with these stories

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
about myself and the staff members, following that meeting,

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
did you ever communicate again with the people who participated in that meeting

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
or did they ever communicate with you on this subject?

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
Mr. Chairman, I suggest the investigation to that question is,

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
not fuck with 50 him by the members of the Executive Department

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
who attended the meeting of January 21st, the question was whether or not

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
the Everett any time there has to be a consequence of January 21st.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
And so, with any of the members of the Executive Department,

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
are the Justice Department who will attend on the day of January 21st?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Is that right, Mr. Colman?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Exactly.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Now, if he asks, later what was said,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
then I will say your point with me well taken.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
The question now is, did he ever not subject the subsequent to January 21st?

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
Consult with Mr. Sherman Adams, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Brown-Mail, Mr. Logs,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Mr. Marguerite.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
I would suggest then that it be asked in respect to one gentleman at a time.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I, uh, there were all of us just so much.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I'm pretty much normal.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm trying to say it a little time, sir.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
He's one gentleman at a time, I will.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
All right, so I'll be glad to.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
After the January 21st meeting,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
did you ever communicate directly or indirectly with Mr. Sherman Adams on this subject?

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Sir, I must ask for time because I believe that if he's the line of questioning

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
and violated of the fourth paragraph, the third paragraph of the sentence directly.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
But I'll read his instructions.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm meeting, if there are only some of them,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
just to say, I don't know whether you haven't before or not.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I do not have that.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
I am meeting the line of the instruction boys.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
There's just five samples right here.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
So, you, I'm reading now from the President's directive.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
You will instruct him, I'll wait a moment, sir.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
I'll follow you.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I can get up here.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
You will instruct employees of your department

07:27.000 --> 07:35.000
that in all of their appearances before the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on governmental operations,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
regarding the inquiry now before,

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
they are not to testify to any such conversation or communication,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
or to produce any such document already productive.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
This principle must be maintained regardless of who would do that,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
and if it is not for others, I would rather say that by the marriage,

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
you know, reading, you specifically said conversation, yes sir.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
And what else is there else?

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Any such conversation on horror or communication?

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Now Mr. Coleman is not asking about any conversation or communication.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
He really asked this witness further and asked something subsequent to January 21st.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
He ever consulted with any of the members of the executive department or the justice department

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
who were a person on January 21st.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
That is the asked by conversation or communication,

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
then I would certainly advise the chair to room with you.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Well, if your person is this day's meat, this day's fault, not what must be it.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, if this in the mere fact of reading is a communication,

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
not necessarily we need a lot of people with whom we do not communicate well.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yes, may it be.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Yes, that is just this that you would see them on the street.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Or as a theater or something of that sort.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I can see no object into it.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't think that's what Mr. Coleman is saying.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
I think Mr. Works that each of us further and often met them had a conversation

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
or a communication, but he certainly could not ask what the conversation or the communication was.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
Would you manage here, Mr. Welch, to lead up our whole project in that heard?

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
And this is one of another, Mr. Jenkins and I discussed with the attorney couple.

09:28.000 --> 09:36.000
He had said that it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communication

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
for any document or reproductions concerning such advice be disclosed.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
And it was our intended to see security orders go to the disclosure of what occurred,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
not whether or not they were sent to meet.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
Now whether or not they were sent to send, but we've made clear to us that there would be no discussions about the disclosure of what was said.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
What was in the communication?

10:00.000 --> 10:10.000
Mr. Chair, you can find the believes that Mr. Jenkins has interpreted the executive order in line with the understanding we received from the Attorney General.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Mr. Chairman.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Madam MacRoddy.

10:15.000 --> 10:26.000
I hate to find myself on the side of Mr. Welch, but we have a name of Mr. Chairman that I think the Chair should avoid.

10:27.000 --> 10:36.000
Knowing that these questions must be answered or must not be answered, I feel that from the theoretical time,

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
the touch must determine that we're entitled all of this information.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
One of the reasons why I have agreed to assign my staff to testify and testify myself with your voice,

10:46.000 --> 10:54.000
and the facility of this committee going into this question is just what the executive can deny to the Senate.

10:54.000 --> 11:03.000
And what Mr. Jenkins has to counsel, but you say as Chairman can be quoted as a precedent in the future,

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
and we decide just how far the President can go in a state that the order.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
May I say that I think of the witness asserts a type of mental privilege here?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I'm not a Secretary.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I'm a presidential privilege.

11:19.000 --> 11:27.000
I think the Chair should allow him to do it rather than to get into this question which will take his months to decide.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
May I say this?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I hope so, please.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
May I finish with, Chair?

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
I think this is beautifully more important than anything we bring out of this hearing.

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
If the question is just what a President can do, and I disagree to the Chair and I'll go with the Truman Black Out Order of 1948,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
I think that Eisenhower has been badly advised.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I think he's been extremely busy and matters far more important than this.

11:50.000 --> 12:01.000
I don't think we should, however, in this glumine of hearing, establish a precedent as to how far a President's now in the future can go.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
For that reason, Mr. President, pardon me for the—

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Are you saying that Mr. Cohen has no objections?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
May I say that I'm not finished with the Truman?

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
So for that reason, I have a great to advise my staff to go on a stand, to go on a stand myself,

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
so as not to put the Chair in the position of having to decide this question and drag his hearing over my—

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, I would frankly advise the Chair if I may.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
Let's do the longest Adam for a few, even though we may feel he's not in title for a few.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
It's the only way we can get through with this in a hurry.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
So the Chair say, first of all, that's up to this point, at least Mr. Adam,

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
who says, need to get to know him, exploring with his counsel and with our counsel.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
Whether or not he desires to claim this presidential executive order,

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
and if the minister is concerned and believes, if the question has not been answered yet,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
he might have Mr. Cohen with us.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, the question is Mr. Chairman, I think the counsel cannot object to the question.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
I think there's only one person, and plan for the three-pervilates.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
For the Fifth Amendment, for the presidential privilege?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Now, for any of us, just a moment.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
I mean, I think I'd like the senators to which comes and inferring that I'm claiming the Fifth Amendment in privilege,

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
because I'm not, and I'm not claiming any privilege on this memorandum.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
This is an instruction from the President of the United States, and I consider myself found by him.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, we are today—I think it's very important that we follow the time-worn rule

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
that no one can exert a privilege except the wits of it.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
I don't care whether it's a Fifth Amendment privilege, whether it's this new privilege,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
who would have today or what if it?

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Mr. Wolf cannot get out of service.

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
I understood that from the chair's state of this morning that he was not doing a rule of one last but let's go to some future times.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
That's correct, but of course, the counsel has the right to advise his witness,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
and he was controlling with him and trying to arrive at some determination.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
Mr. Chairman, I hope that's part of my dream, why not just for me?

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
You tell me in what term or what words you use in your question.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Did you consult with that towards you?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I think the word was communicate first, and I'm calling it.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Did you communicate—that's not there any communication between?

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I thought you used words in terms of what you consult with me.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I might work with you, but no, I don't.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
I'm at the chairman. I just want—I don't know what's going to happen here, but I want to make my observations read.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
I may not agree with the president's order. I may think it should not have been issued, but since it has been issued,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't think it's been sought with a person without communicating with them and vice versa.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
I feel about it, and I would rather be all to read.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
I don't believe the question would be proper, who's on the first presidential order.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
Mr. Chairman, may I ask me how to get out to report a leased-knit-cone question?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
First, Senator McCarthy, are you requesting Mr. Cone to withdraw his question?

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
No, Mr. Chairman. Very well, and I don't like to have that question read.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Mr. Pairo, I'll read your question, and I know what we're having to do.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I'll be going to the—really in the chair.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Mr. Jenkins, may I make myself very clear?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I think you have, sir.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I don't think we have.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I'll be hearing from Mr. Pairo.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Mr. Chairman, I have a question.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Mr. Carter, I'm equal.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
And then, Senator, you took the position through opposition to the position taken to the chairman.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
No, I did not. No, I did not.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Well, very well. I think that's—let's make this clear.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
I take the position that the presidential order is completely improper,

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
that this committee is not bound by it, but that committee should order,

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
under ordinary circumstances, the witness to testify that there is no type of

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
system and privilege which is being exerted here.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
However, as I advise you also, and as there,

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
the length of time consumed and doing well will be so great.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
No. 1, get it the only way of enforcing it, will be the type to which it's for contempt,

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
such as the mean going to the phone committee to the Senate floor for a grand hearing.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
It will take—I believe the chair expressed it very well this morning.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm sure that the chairman of this Congress to get to a final result.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
So that means in order to get rid of this show, to get back to our work,

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
I have a dream that the fire science concerns any witness.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
To once exert this privilege, even though I think it's improper,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
and telling the people they get something to hide,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
the fire's work is terrible for everything on the sound.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
And I think that any—if there's any—there's any ruling here, Mr. Chairman,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I think we've got to go into this in detail.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
I think we should merely let the witness exert the privilege

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
and recognize these exerting and witness no ruling whatsoever.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I don't think you have any disagreement among ourselves at all.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
It will simply commit, Mr. Adam, to determine

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
after controlling with his counsel whether he feels he can answer this question or not.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Now, if we'll have the question read by the reporter, we will know exactly what is before it.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Will the reporter please read the question?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
The current question is written down here.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I'll be going to read today to Senator Manusattles.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Let's start over then, the noble.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
My question to Mr. Adam is following this January 21st meeting with Mr. Adam,

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
were you in communication with any of the persons who attended that meeting

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
on this same subject at any subsequent time?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Mr. Chairman, very respectfully.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
There I believe is the directive of the President of the United States.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It's 17 Mays.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
We didn't hear the news from the stuffing that.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
And what was pro-Hedithney from answering this question?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Mr. Chairman.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Second, I should like state's position.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
I think both the Chairman and my fellow.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
The question is not what was the communication between Mr. Adam and any members?

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
Of the executive or justice department who attended the meeting of January 21st?

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
His question is merely whether or not I have a later date.

18:27.000 --> 18:34.000
There was a communication between Mr. Adam and any member present on January 21st.

18:34.000 --> 18:41.000
It has been asserted here by the Secretary of the Army that the Army and the Army alone was responsible

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
both prior to and subsequent to January 21st,

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
by the preparation and the prosecution of these charges.

18:50.000 --> 19:04.000
Patently, the inquiry not being presumed by Mr. Coln is looking into the question of whether or not Mr. Adam's or Mr. Stevens was advised or was influenced by any member

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
present on January 21st to prepare and pursue those charges.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Mr. Coln, is that correct?

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
Second, he is merely asking the question, a very simple question.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Did he had a later date subsequent to the 21st of January?

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
How did communication with any member present on January 21st?

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
I advise the Chairman and the Chairman agrees with me that it was a perfectly legal question.

19:32.000 --> 19:40.000
And I reiterate that Mr. Coln pursues an MS for that communication law.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Are the conversations, are the context of a conversation,

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
was we would be the first time sure to have given Mr. Wells that it would be unpopular and violated of the President's agreement.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
If I may, I think to send him a coffee point on that, why?

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
And I have a very strong point that there is nobody here who can rule on the admittability of the question.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
It's all up to the witnesses to whether he will answer the question or not.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
Now if he can answer the question about the communication, whether they were communication, that we all agree, he must answer.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
If you next get to the point, I believe so, I have the right answer.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
What were those communication?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
What did they invite him to do?

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
And then, the witness is not objectionable, but I believe so.

20:21.000 --> 20:28.000
The witness may then, under this directive, re-use the answer to the question on the ground and answer is precluded by the terms of the direct.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
That's the way I am saying that, that might be wrong.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
That's correct.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Well, I'm not going to inquiry.

20:33.000 --> 20:49.000
I wonder if I could ask Mr. Wells as to his interpretation of the word, as used in the third paragraph of the President's letter to the Secretary of the Senate with reference to the word communication.

20:49.000 --> 21:07.000
Is it his understanding that the word communications prevent the witness from asking a question, did you see so and so after January 21st?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Is that your...

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Mr. Sanders, actually, the answer is in the affirmative.

21:11.000 --> 21:24.000
If you see the directive, use the two words, that use the word conversations, that says they may not be disclosed, and then goes on and says communications, which is an even broader term.

21:24.000 --> 21:34.000
But the broader term, so that I can only take the view that the President is candid that this should not even testify that there was a communication.

21:34.000 --> 21:46.000
I would like to say to you, Senator, that I don't count myself the greatest constitutional lawyer in the world, and this is a question of some important.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I hate to differ with Mr. Deacon.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I happen to want this occasion.

21:50.000 --> 21:58.000
This could be referred to as the Attorney General, and you would certainly have an opinion far more valuable than the two of the opinions.

21:58.000 --> 22:08.000
But I cannot sit at this table and advise the witness that he could answer this question on my study and my understanding of the directness.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
I have not seen that I could not be wrong. I have often been beautifully wrong.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
But I think at the moment I am right, and I am a fact in accordance with my best judgment.

22:18.000 --> 22:27.000
Mr. Chairman, and the Secretary of the Senate, the Army is suggesting with a provision in as much as the difference of opinions between counsel and the court.

22:27.000 --> 22:43.000
The reason for the Army and our distinguished colleague, as he said at the Mark and Saw, I suggest that the matter be referred to the Attorney General, the provision is that we don't give seven days recess to get the answer.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Mr. Chairman, I am in the party.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Mr. Chairman, before that is done, I would like to ask if that suggests the might be followed.

22:50.000 --> 22:59.000
I would like to ask Mr. Adams, have you had any meetings with anyone from the Attorney General Office since that meeting of the 21st?

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
Well, I would think that that was equally covered by this.

23:06.000 --> 23:15.000
The Attorney General Office are in the executive branch, and I think my instruction, the instruction, the Miss Never-Anter, cover that equally, sir.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
No, we have a rather unusual situation here than the panel. Maybe you could help us on.

23:19.000 --> 23:34.000
I am curious to know, if you have the fact that Mr. Rogers has invited you to do in the first place, that the inception of these charges according to your foreign testimony, unless we know how many times we've been there.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Definitely, please don't interrupt. I guess so.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Why don't you make a good one at the time?

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
We get all the time on the world when 15 days.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
How much?

23:45.000 --> 23:53.000
In view of the fact that according to your testimony, Mr. Rogers advised you, you followed his advice.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
The advice I had to do was calling off the hearing.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
I think it's rather important for everyone concerned to know how many times you have consulted with Mr. Rogers,

24:03.000 --> 24:10.000
since then, if any time. How many times you've consulted with Mr. Brown-El?

24:10.000 --> 24:20.000
Father, as I have taken the position, they took him to 21st right up until today, because we refer to Mr. Rogers as Mr. Femmeing from the Jeff.

24:20.000 --> 24:28.000
They questioned whether or not Mr. Adams can tell us about the conversations of Mr. Rogers.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
We wanted one unusual situation.

24:31.000 --> 24:40.000
May I say, Mr. Chairman, that we have this identical situation, I think, practically in back in 1924.

24:41.000 --> 24:49.000
At that time, the Attorney General was signed as Vice-Mr. Coolidge to keep certain information from a congressional committee.

24:49.000 --> 24:59.000
Mr. Coolidge stepped to position that the Attorney General was an interested party, and he asked the Attorney General to resign,

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
asked all the information to made public. Now, I'm not even remotely suggesting that Attorney General Brown-El resign.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
I'd be very surprised to find that Brown-El himself and anything to do with this. I've got a lot of respect for him.

25:12.000 --> 25:21.000
I think it's unfair to the Attorney General, unless we can get that information, and we can do know that Mr. Rogers, the deputy,

25:21.000 --> 25:31.000
is the man who is acting upon these requests we've signed over, and if we follow Mr. Femmeing's suggestions and some to Mr. Rogers,

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
we question whether or not we can get the information about what Mr. Rogers' weight of this.

25:38.000 --> 25:47.000
I just a little bit doubtful about how much weight we can place upon that very sympathetic answer, which we'll get.

25:47.000 --> 25:55.000
Mr. Hammond, and then Madam White, the commission was only made in an effort to get the hearing deck predited. I withdraw this suggestion.

25:56.000 --> 26:06.000
Yes, and then, Mr. Cohn, if the witness says he's going to stand on this presidential directive, then there's stand right there, satisfied the job.

26:06.000 --> 26:15.000
The question is, if Senator Munnify might, and I can be just as long about this, anyone else here in probably am, but as I understand it, the question which I have now asked is

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
whether or not there were such communication without going into their details, is not covered by the presidential directive.

26:22.000 --> 26:31.000
Mr. Adams must answer that question whether he wishes to assert the directive or not. If he refuses to, Mr. Chairman, I respectfully ask you to direct an answer to the question.

26:31.000 --> 26:42.000
If then, I ask him for the substance of the communication, and Mr. Adams asserts the refusal, then that's not refusal to give the substance of the conversation or communication.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
My feet proper, under the directive, and I could not ask you to direct an answer. That's the way I see it, Mr. Jenkins. I might be wrong, I don't know.

26:51.000 --> 27:02.000
Mr. Chair, I'll say that his understanding of the directive conforms completely with that of the Council, Mr. Jenkins.

27:03.000 --> 27:24.000
I'm sure we obtained that understanding right or wrong, as a result of that conversation with the Attorney General Brown Hill, at which time we discussed the various interpretations and that was made very clear, that they held, that there would have been no distortion, of any of the confidential, global information passing among the presidential's advice.

27:25.000 --> 27:40.000
We did not understand at that time, that that would preclude stating whether or not meetings were held or conferences were held or communication was repressed, but it didn't preclude going into the content or their purpose or what was said.

27:41.000 --> 27:58.000
Mr. Johnson, I have here placing a broader interpretation, on this, executive director, the one that the Council has, and the one that the Chair has, then of course you have a right to advise your witness in conformity with your own interpretation of the directive.

27:58.000 --> 28:13.000
I may also suggest you submit the questions of the committee, I will agree with the Chair. Chair may have the majority, the chair may be involved in the committee, I have the questions submitted directly to the Attorney General.

28:14.000 --> 28:35.000
Mr. Johnson, I am sure the members of this committee of C clearly advise you, there was an occasion within a week or two when I happened to see the Attorney General whom I know, and Mr. Rogers and the Pentagon, and they were conferring with someone in the Pentagon.

28:36.000 --> 28:54.000
I happen to know they were not conferring about this matter, but they were conferring about something. Now if they saw Mr. Adams on that occasion, as they may have done for all I know, and he said, oh yes, I saw Mr. Brown, L and Mr. Rogers two weeks ago.

28:55.000 --> 29:03.000
The inference would be that they were talking about this matter when they were certainly to my knowledge, I know they were not talking about this matter.

29:04.000 --> 29:16.000
The Council is possible to give a very wrong impression here, the executive departments are constantly in touch with each other, they constantly must ask the Vice-Chair of the Attorney General.

29:25.000 --> 29:35.000
I have said in my original question, I use the words, communication on this subject, if they talk about something totally unrelated, I have no interest in that.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
There was a poll signing in a theatre, I am interested in how I find out that the importance behind this thing is who is in honor.

29:43.000 --> 29:51.000
Mr. Chairman, I agree with my distinguished colleague, the senior senator from Arkansas.

29:52.000 --> 30:14.000
If in any way one of the principal's fields that is submitting this to the Attorney General, it would be submitted or two people in his department to somebody who might be present at this particular question and we can rule now and get on with it.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, is further confidence with the witness?

30:20.000 --> 30:32.000
I think he can make a statement that to what contact he has had, which is sought as part of the committee and the senator of Mr. Colm, I hope he hopes the witness will make her effort at least.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
I think he can.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Would you allow one more moment of confidence, really?

30:38.000 --> 30:48.000
Mr. Chairman, I have seen or talked to two or three of the people who were at that meeting subsequent to January 21st.

30:48.000 --> 30:58.000
On no occasion did I discuss with them in a personal interview or by telephone or by any other form of communication, anything having to do with the bringing of these charges.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
I'll seem to be a first right answer to the direct question, Mr. Colm, and we continue with other questions.

31:04.000 --> 31:12.000
Did you discuss with them anything pertaining to any of the matters discussed on this controversy at the meeting of January 21st?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Objective, Mr. Chairman.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
I won't have a go.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Mr. Jenkins?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Will you state that?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
We state that question, Mr. Colm.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
How do we have a redness of Jenkins?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
I'm sorry.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Before you go, please do question.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
I think so.

31:34.000 --> 31:44.000
Did you discuss with them anything pertaining to any of the matters discussed on this controversy at the meeting of January 21st?

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
How that called for any discussion or conversation.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
And here we go again.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Wilson has no look to the content and is this both?

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
Which both Mr. Jenkins and the Chair had ruled earlier.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Obviously, it was covered by the executive workers.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
It's a different question from the President.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
And was there a meeting?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Was there a time?
