00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
You thought it might violate the directives of the president for impeding you from giving that information.

00:11.000 --> 00:21.000
I asked you at that time if the army took the full responsibility up to that date and you said it did.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
That's correct, yes.

00:23.000 --> 00:36.000
Now subsequently, I believe you're superior to the secretary of the army has not only issued a press release but has testified

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
but you only have the full responsibility after that date.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
That's correct, yes.

00:44.000 --> 00:55.000
Therefore, this delay in proceedings is caused by that misunderstanding as to whether you did have the authority to give out that information or not.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Yes, the press release that I mean directly has in no sense been changed.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Has it directed the president's directive since you testified here last month?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes, then you did have there where I answered the question that that's correct.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Didn't you and saved all this delay?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes, sir.

01:13.000 --> 01:27.000
If I may, I told you, sir, that I have seen it for only about 20 minutes more than you had at that time and the delay was because of the necessity for all of us to study an interpreter.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
That's all I did.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
You could have answered that still before I made it.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
You could have answered it that day and saved all this today.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Interjection? No questions.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
I have no question to this time.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
It's a well-known democracy over the past four years.

01:45.000 --> 01:58.000
Mr. Ad, you described pulling to the statement made by Secretary Stevens under oath this morning that the action decisions in this controversy with oath of the army and the army alone I do share.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
I do suggest that you go to the Senate in Maclaw in on January 20th of whatever day it was.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
As I have stated earlier, a suggestion was made to really go.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
I am in this decision to go. I did not need to follow the suggestions.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Would you agree on this suggestion that must have been made?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Probably not, because it's a good idea.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Who gave you this good idea?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Mr. Rogers, I think that's previously just fine.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
And the good idea was to go and see the distinguished senator from Arkansas as I write today.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
He was not that a member of the committee, wasn't he?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
No, he was not.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'll just talk to him any I talk to him.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
No, he was not.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
I think the newer applied to go to the distinguished senator who was not a member of this talk committee.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Is that right?

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Well, I wasn't as wise as there he was suggested to me that that was the step that I might take.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I thought that it was a good idea.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
Could you tell us why you thought that was your better idea and going to people who were a member of the committee?

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, I can't say now that I can remember what my thinking was in January on that particular Sunday.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
What's the decision I took?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
That I took at that time?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Didn't Mr. Rogers ask you to go to the senate in Maclaw?

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
I don't consider that it was in order, a direction or anything other than a suggestion.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Had I chosen not to go, I wasn't happy.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
My question was, is there any ask you to go to the senate in Maclaw?

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
The merely thing maybe you ought to think about this, what did he say?

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
He said, because he asked you to go to the senate in Maclaw.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Is Mr. Rogers asked you to go to the senate in Maclaw?

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Well, we're in there, we're in the field of the mathematics now.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Which were he used?

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Whatever he said, whether it was after, six yet or whatever it was.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
The decision as to whether or not I could go with mine.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Hold on to the important, you are Mr. Rogers.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Mr. Rogers, have you known the senate in Maclaw?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
No, sir, I have not.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
You were not on the phone.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Now, I have met him once, and he wasn't different.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Now, Mr. Rogers, you still stand on your testimony given in page 268, Mr. Rogers, a record.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
Later that afternoon, Mr. Rogers telephoned me and asked me if I was going to the senate in Maclaw,

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
whom I did not know, and told him the story, and how these matters seem to be related.

04:23.000 --> 04:32.000
He arranged the important, and tried to near fact that he asked in the case that he was leading to the state in the need.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
What you think for too many years, then you have the option of refusing the thing doesn't count.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
No, I didn't say that. You said that.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
How would you put it, Mr. Rogers?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I had the option of refusing.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
That's an eight-in-a-dé›£y decision, and it's whether or not I went.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And you made the decision, that's correct.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And so I think you said you were thirty seconds in command of the army.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
That's right, that's the little statistic.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I don't think that one know is where I stand.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm an outsider to the secretary of the army. I am reading on them.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
Well, did you get so much to solve any superior in the army before making contributions?

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm not sure whether I can solve it any superior before making that decision.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Mr. Seaman was out of the country.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
The undersecretary of the army was acting as secretary of the army, and I was in regular complication with him during that period.

05:25.000 --> 05:33.000
I cannot get you whether or not I actually advised him of the fact that I intended to make that call prior to time I did it.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
But at any event so we can move on, you will agree with me.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
But you weren't asked by the deputy attorney general who was not connected with the army in any way.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
The go to see the United States senator who was not a member of this committee.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
That was passed but not required.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Stone.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I think he's done.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
I think senator he is left.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, so we have a stand on this day you are asked by the deputy attorney general not connected with the army because he's sent it in the maquallant.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Not a member of this committee.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
The language says there on page 26-18.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yes sir.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Mr. Rogers, telephone me and ask me if I would go.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes sir.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
That's right. He asked you if you would go and it stands out and you did go.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
That's right.

06:28.000 --> 06:41.000
Now the next day you attended a meeting in the department of justice with the attorney general, a deputy attorney general, chairman of the department of the White House staff and the United Nations ambassador, Henry Salivore.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Henry Salivore, Secretary of the President, that's right.

06:44.000 --> 07:02.000
Does that mean he's conclude with a decision with the decision that he should call on the Republican members of the subterranean and talk to them about the sweetness of the oil before and in the same conversation about the so-called shion matter.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
That's right and the decision.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yes sir.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
What I thought you would say is the decision was subject to my disagreement.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Had I not agreed to it? Had I not favored it? I would not have gone.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
You're concerned with sort of a condition subsequently.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
It is written with a nation in three seats.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
There had I not agreed to it. I would not have gone.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
No such decision could have been made.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
My suggestion is that I understand that then your testimony is that the decision was made by the attorney general, deputy attorney general,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
the two five-dimensional decision in the UN ambassador.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
It did not become operative or effective until you gave your agree that it's quite correct.

07:42.000 --> 07:55.000
Now, is chairman who was the justice that you prepared this report which had led to this conference?

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
I have previously specified here that that was a suggestion made to me by Governor Adam.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
That was made to you.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
But for the first time by Governor Sherman Adams in front of the assistant to the president.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Is that right?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
What do you mean for the first time?

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
Well, I had made this suggestion to myself about six times in the last six weeks and I just didn't get around to do it.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
You didn't get around to do it but when Sherman Adams rejected it to you, you then got around to do it.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
No, it's not quite that simple sir.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Would you correct me ever since mid-December?

08:26.000 --> 08:41.000
I have been feeling that I have with guilty of lashes as the lawyers like to say in not having prepared contemporary memoranda of the six experiences through which I was doing.

08:41.000 --> 08:54.000
And I think the thing which more than anything else convinced me that I should go ahead with these which the preparation of these papers was not the suggestion of that day.

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
But the meeting of the following day in Sendin Makakis, a partner on which I wrote a memorandum the following morning.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
And then I decided that I would try and reconstruct the situation of the previous few months.

09:09.000 --> 09:21.000
And there is no doubt about the fact that because an official from outside of the defense department had observed that it would be a good thing for me to have that memorandum.

09:21.000 --> 09:31.000
As those memorandus, I took this step which I might have been a little bit derelict about.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
I took this perhaps a few days earlier but there is no doubt in my mind that I ultimately would have prepared those memorandums.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
But in any event the specific preparation was at the suggestion of Sherman Adams.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Is that right?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Not quite sir. It was after it had been discussed.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
I think well, will you testifying truthfully Mr. Adams when you testifying truthfully from the beginning of this hearing?

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
Yes, and then it would follow that you gave a truthful answer to this question of Sendin Makakis.

09:59.000 --> 10:11.000
I believe this comes from, say, about, volume 17, page 2 9, 1 4, I believe you can, I'm not quite sure of the page.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
That would be a 2 9 1 12 through 2 9 1 5. The quote I have is this.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Would you wait?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Now, would you wait just a moment to find me, y'all be quick.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
What day, Gaya?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I have the 5 6 20.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Secretary Stevens, there's been an excuse for the stand for the moment.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Now, Mr. Adams, the Army Councilor, is back on the stand.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
They're looking up a particular bit of testimony.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Here we go, sir. The bottom of the page 2 9 1 2.

11:00.000 --> 11:10.000
Now, Mr. Adams, you said that, you said that, at the suggestion of Governor Sherman Adams.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
You made up this report with respect to Mr. Sean. Is that correct?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Mr. Adams, yes, sir.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
Do you stand on that statement that it would have to be the suggestion of Sherman Adams if you made up this report?

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
That is the statement I made the other day. I think that's my statement of today is more accurate.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
In other words, you're changing the statement of then, so it wasn't said today, and you say, you can now go.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
I think today is an elaboration of what I said the other day.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
And you want to stand on the, what you said today.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
That is correct. I have no requirements from Governor Adams, which is what the line of testimony seems to be attempting to elicit.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I have no requirements to resolve that conversation.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, sir, what I was so much interested in the requirement, I was interested in Mr. Stevens' statement,

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
that all of the facts and decisions were both of the army and the army alone.

12:04.000 --> 12:13.000
And I'm trying to reconcile that, especially I can, with the many steps that would take only on the suggestion or advice of whatever you want to call it,

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
a higher up nut connected with the arms. That's why I made some of these questions.

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
Now, after this decision was reached, this is me, a decision which you'd buy me, Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General,

12:27.000 --> 12:35.000
to why House advisors in the UN ambassador, which decision I know you'd say was not of an operative unless you concurred in it.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
You did go to some of the Republicans under truck committee, didn't you, sir? Yes, sir.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
Was that accurate and outactually on the army and the army alone?

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
Well, I was accompanied on one of the visits on the first evening, by Mr. Morgan.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
On the next day, I went along to see Senator Monson.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Hello, Senator DeFair.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Thank you for any questions.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Hi, Senator.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Chair, passes any defenders to my left?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
No, I'm Mr. Chairman.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And in the comments?

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
Mr. Allen, you've got it in the sense that you've come to the malls that I've not shown you any time.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
I simply gave you an appointment at the request to Mr. Rodgers, the day's drink.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
Far too the case request that I have any knowledge to board.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
You know all this problem that you've been relating?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Not for me, sir.

13:31.000 --> 13:39.000
If you come there for the purpose of voting to me about that, I came here for the purpose of talking to you about that, sir.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Were you at that time concerned about the defense of being an issue?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yes, sir.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
I was in law earlier, sir.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Did you discuss that with me at that time, also?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yes, sir.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
Were you also concerned about a life treatment of the general's liquor at that time?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
No, sir.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I can't help but drink.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
The liquor isn't as much as about a month later.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I mean, can you even call a user at every call?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I did talk to a lot of early voices.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
You know, and about the company's matter.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
At that time, I was not a member of the subcommittee.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
No, sir.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
You were a company, and I've so stated to you,

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
well, you concerned about what you were at that time, contemplating, and did you so advise me

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
that, uh, refusing to let the law to go out of here and respond to this thing?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
We weren't contemplating that, sir.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I shall advise you.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And you were discussing that with me.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Yes, sir.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
Now, what you advised by me here was this matter discussed,

14:46.000 --> 14:55.000
let if you disresuse, and the committee desired to take in the action upon your refusal of subcommittee

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
for resolution, for citation, for contempt, would have to come before the full committee?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Yes, sir.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I think you did talk to that.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Well, I then tell you, as you have related this story to me,

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
but I wouldn't use this information that you had given the unless you put it in writing.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I tried to require specific about that, sir.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I said, the specific about it.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
You said you'd have to have a written report,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
and that you would have to be back on the committee.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
Both of those things would have to be 30, 40, if you would be able to do anything.

15:29.000 --> 15:38.000
That is all the subcommittee, as Fred, I'm talking about, if a citation resolution came to the full committee,

15:38.000 --> 15:46.000
then I wouldn't make use of this information unless you placed it to me in writing.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm not sure that they were connected that way, but I know you did tell me you could make that...

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
You didn't say so in so many words, but I think it was clear.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
We hadn't met before, and I was relating to you, rather, unusual story, and you felt that you weren't having a right.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Where's our one's going to use an intumacary you gave me unless you backed it up in writing.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And the right rule, you understood it, and I played it.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
What did you do then?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
That's exactly what you said, sir.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
And I also advised you then to go talk to your public and members that you did say.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
That's all.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
You understand it, am I right?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I'm sorry.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
No question.

16:22.000 --> 16:32.000
When the time came, Mr. Adams, in executive hearing, I stated that I, to the best of my recollections,

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
you and Secretary Steven came to see me one day in my office.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Yes, but I correct in that statement.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Yes, sir.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
I believe that the U.R. outside and at the end of the conversation, you came into the office.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
That's correct.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
That is correct, sir.

16:52.000 --> 17:03.000
Was that the same day according to Mr. Steven's testimony that he visited five senators?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I think it is, sir.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
I think we saw you first in Senator McClellan's office and walked to your office with you.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
From Senator McClellan's office.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yes, sir.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
I think so.

17:13.000 --> 17:21.000
Now, Mr. Adams, the question was asked you whether in the discussion in my office,

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
there was any discussion of Mr. Cohn or Mr. Shine.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
To the best of my recollection, I do not remember it.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Do you remember any?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
And yes, you remember me very fine.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Well, I was out of the office.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You'll recall, sir, for 15 or 20 minutes.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
And I came back into your office.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And when I came back in, you asked me one question, sir.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
You said, what is the worst thing that ever happened in Safari, Houston,

17:48.000 --> 17:57.000
what do you think is the worst thing that was done by Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn Shine matter?

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
And I eliminated it for a moment, sir.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
And then said to you, well, I think that the day that he said that he was repressed the Army

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
and Mr. Stevens would be proved with Secretary was as bad as anything.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And that was the extent of the conversation, sir.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, now I want you to be very frank with the committee you're on the roll.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Is there anything else with respect to Mr. Cohn and Mr. Shine?

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I'd like you to tell the committee now with respect to our conversation.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I don't remember it, sir.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
I don't remember that there was any discussion with reference to Mr. Cohn and Shine.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
While we were in Senator McLean's office with you,

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
while we were walking down the hall for during the time that I was a new woman,

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
at all other than that one, that's their show.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Now, Mr. Adams, I'd like to ask you this question.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
So whom do you report?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
To the Secretary of the Army, sir.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
Is there anybody else in the Army or in the Pentagon building

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
that the Secretary of the Army is asking to be frank with the government

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
who can give you any orders?

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
In the absence of the Secretary, the acting Secretary can.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
While the Secretary is here, I take my orders from the Secretary of the Army informally.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
Well, when the Secretary of the Army is asking, the acting Secretary of the Army is the Secretary.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
That is right, sir.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
That is right, sir.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Now, Mr. Adams, shall it be your testimony?

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
I got it. You tried to get along with Senator McCartney and Mr. Cohn.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
The Chairman of the Subcommittee staff,

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
because you felt that was necessary in order to do the job you were hired to do for the Army.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Is that right? Yes, sir.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
Did you think that asking Mr. Cohn to do personal favors for you to get you to see the ticket

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
and so on would make him feel friendly to you?

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
Well, I asked Mr. Cohn one to get there to take it for me.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I didn't think it would make it.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
I didn't mind giving me a direct answer to the question.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Let me repeat you, question.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
Did you think that asking Mr. Cohn to do personal favors for you to get you to see the ticket and so on

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
would make him feel friendly to you?

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
Well, I don't think I gave that as talk toers who had to make him feel friendly.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
In that respect, our relationship with satisfactory, he was in New York.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I was in Washington from time to time. I'd asked him to do me minor favors.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Is it your habit to ask favors of people after they have been abusive to you?

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
Well, as I have stated on a number of occasions, sir, excepting on the matter of shine,

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
I got along very well with Mr. Cohn.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
And when I could divert the subject away from shine,

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
the matter, our relationship was fairly normal.

20:36.000 --> 20:44.000
And I felt that I had a continuing problem of getting along with Mr. Cohn.

20:44.000 --> 20:52.000
After we had a very serious break out in January, I still came back in February and placed the call to

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
and for the purposes of seeing if I couldn't re-establish our relationship.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
I thought I had to have discussed quite a little bit the port-mindment investigation.

21:03.000 --> 21:12.000
And I'd like to know just what you thought was wrong with the way the McCarthy Subcommittee was conducting itself in the port-mindment investigation.

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
And in that interest or in that end rather, I'd like to answer specifically the following question.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
Yes or no, if you feel you can answer them that way.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
I profess this because I think at times we get away from the basic charges.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
Did you feel that Southern McCarthy was abusing army officers?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Not during the port-mindment investigation, sir.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
At any time?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Well, not until the time of the liquor incident, sir.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
After the liquor incident?

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
Yes, sir. I felt I wasn't present while General Wicker was being interrogated.

21:48.000 --> 21:55.000
I was present when another officer was being interrogated and I thought that officer was given a difficult time.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
I was ordered from the room before General Wicker was taken in.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I asked you to hold your questions.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Yes, sir.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
I'm not appreciate you're answering them yesterday.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
I'll repeat the question, although I'll pass that one.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
Did you feel that Southern McCarthy was disrupting the morale of army officers?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Of army officers?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
That's what I said.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Yes, sir, I think so.

22:26.000 --> 22:33.000
Did you feel that Southern McCarthy was misrepresenting to the public the extent of the problem of communist ill-sultration at port-mindment?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
I did, sir.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Did you think the system's bad for the army of the United States and the country?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Yes, sir, I did.

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
Did you think that Southern McCarthy was misrepresenting and distorting what went on at the subcommittee hearings to the press and the public?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I did, sir.

22:48.000 --> 22:55.000
Can you recall specifically what was said with Miss Represented or distorted what went on at these hearings?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Well, there were a number of things, sir.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I can recall.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
You too, sir.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
You too.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Well, I can recall too right off.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
And they cannot be answered in just a few words, sir.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
If you'll excuse me for a slightly longer answer.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Though it was an individual interrogated,

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
and the press made a lot over the fact that he had broken down

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
and was going to tell all about a communist firing and about it, you know, that sort of thing.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
I think the executive transcript,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
in the case of the individual,

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
had left the room obsessed,

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
and he came back and that's...

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
What he had to tell a committee when he came back

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
was far, far short of the existence of an espionage ring.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
And his breakdown

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
was partially brought down by the fact that he had left home,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
his mother had died the baby boy and he was home,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
with his family in bereavement,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
and it comes down to his interrogation,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
and he was upset by the cross-examination.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
And headlight made a lot over the fact that he had broken down

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
and was going to tell all about this denies and the firing and all that sort of thing.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
And the executive transcript on that day and on subsequent days

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
they just did not bear it out in my opinion.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Well, that's the first one, is that right?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Yes, sir. I was the second one.

24:36.000 --> 24:47.000
There was another incident of a man who was first referred to as a scientist,

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
and who was a defector from East Germany.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
And the headlines made a lot over the fact that he had come from East Germany

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
and was going to tell about American classified information,

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
which was in the hands of East German technical plants.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
Well, as I went on, it developed that he was not a scientist,

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
but that he was a technician 21 years of age

25:15.000 --> 25:25.000
and also that the fact that he had given earlier in intelligence interrogations

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
so far short is what the headlines indicated he had to give.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
And also his veracity was open to questions.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Now I want to ask you, Mr. Adams, please be specific.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
And tell me just how this published in the European Union was harmful to the Army.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Therefore, I want to ask you these questions.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Did you feel the channel's record was being unjustifiably abused?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Yes, sir. I felt that he was unjustifiably abused.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
Did you think that his statement by the subcommittee was in a straight to a uniform?

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
No, no. No, not exactly.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
I merely made the point the other day that if we were going into the Zwicker case,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I would have to go into it in detail.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
I will not let Mr. Flemington make such a complex answer, Mr. Adams,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
let's cross-examining him for him.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
But he'll have to do that with an aching opinion.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Let me finish the other day.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
So, at the same time, we're going into the Zwicker case.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
If we want to restore the Zwicker case, good, let's restore it right here.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
I believe that we have had several other colloquies about the general's risk of case.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
And I thought the subcommittee had agreed that we would classify as much as the peresse case,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
as something which he would not endeavor to explore in detail,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
who was doing the case.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
And as a little bit afraid that if we start interrogation with the Bouch general's Zwicker,

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
we will be beginning a long new diversionary trail,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
but respectfully suggest to sound as time engender,

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
that it is not imperative that his mind, that he has no question about the Zwicker case.

27:01.000 --> 27:08.000
But, to my side, I hope Mr. Brownington does pursue all these individual cases.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
If he does, it will give me the opportunity of bringing out the facts to him.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
I have no objections whatsoever if he's going into those cases.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
I merely want him to make it known that if he does,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
I will proceed to bring out the facts.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
And as much as the charges of the college charges,

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
it's not involved to tell the Zwicker case that he shares very much believed

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
that we should not get ourselves involved now,

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
in a whole new step to charges and counter charges about an incident,

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
which might better seem to me be discussed by some other forum than this.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Mr. Chairman and the timing.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
I respect the chair's position.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
We've wasted, in my opinion, some eight days,

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
in trying to find out for the President Eisenhower or Sherman Adams

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
or Ambassador Lodge or Secretary Wilson, or somebody,

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
was responsible for a meeting on the 21st of January,

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
which in turn was responsible for each charge being made.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
As I understand it, Secretary Steven,

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
who reports in direct lines to the President,

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
made a statement with the President referred to in his press conference last week.

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
Now, for many hours, we have been questioning the accuracy and the integrity of those statements.

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
I for one do not see how and why it is fundamental to the pursuit of the basic charges of improper action

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
and the counter charges of blackmailing and hostage.

28:42.000 --> 28:49.000
I for one do not see why it is essential that we spend so many days and hours today

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
in finding out whether these charges were charged,

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
which were drawn up by Mr. Steven, by the group in the Pentagon,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
or by the entire executive department.

29:01.000 --> 29:07.000
It seems to me that the question, as long as I am correct,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
and we're getting to the end of the day,

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
the question came up of my conversation with Secretary Steven.

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
I said, I told this committee, including the junior senator from Wisconsin,

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
that I have discussed matters with Secretary Steven.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
In fact, I volunteered at executive hearing,

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
and I know that the matter, which was on his mind,

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
was the problem that he had with his army here in the board as a result of this worker testimony.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
Nevertheless, I believe very smart,

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
and once the junior senator was conscious about bringing in journalism workers

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
that will further prolong these hearings,

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
and therefore, with the chair of the fight, I will withdraw this line of questions.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Thank you very much.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Have you had any questions, Senator Simon?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I have no further questions.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Before the next senator starts,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
the question Mr. Adams,

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
I would like to return to us to be here as a cost for countries to permit our stations to identify them.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
This is ABC Television Network.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
What plan I believe, Dr. Hall, everyone's against my husband.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
It was the same idea when I was university president.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
I'm sorry, I didn't inquire with Ariadz.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
We hope you conclude.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
We have a right to test the money,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
and we conclude with this plan.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I have a question very good, sir.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I might say this is the chairman before I proceed to ask some questions.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
In response to a question by Senator Simon,

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
Mr. Adams has given two examples of what he calls, I think he calls,

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
misrepresentation of some kind by Senator McCarthy in the committee in connection with the fourth-mind material.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
I suppose this is something we can cover on our side of the case,

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
but I don't want the record to stand now without some statements from us

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
that Mr. Adams has grossly misrepresented the facts and falsehood instances here that they have to know.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
And I hope we will have the opportunity to put those facts on the record in the right way.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
The dearer say that when you take the stand that the witness under oath,

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
you will have the opportunity to say what you're going to say in direct testimony

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
or after firing a statement to be read, provided you follow the committee rule

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
of submitting the statements to 24 hours.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
And we will be able to deal with these matters, Mr. Adams.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Certainly any questions are been injected into the country,

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
so you have the right to comment upon when you get to understand.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Thank you, sir.

31:39.000 --> 31:48.000
Now, Mr. Adams, getting back, I think we were at a point where we had this meeting of the 21st

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
and the Attorney General office attended by the five individuals whose names were well known.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
And...
