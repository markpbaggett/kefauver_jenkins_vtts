WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Well, coming up to where in OSS during the war we're blanketed into other agencies.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.360
That was going to be my last question on this point.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.160
Even though there are, there were a great number of loyal Americans, the public record now

00:13.160 --> 00:21.960
shows that OSS was the victim of a highly successful plot of communists by SB&R's infiltration.

00:21.960 --> 00:27.900
And there have been persons high in rank in OSS who have since both days involved the

00:27.900 --> 00:33.280
victim amendment to whether they were engaged in SB&R's before the Senate Internal Security

00:33.280 --> 00:38.080
Subcommittee presided over by so great American Senator McCarran and then later Senator

00:38.080 --> 00:39.080
Jenner.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.080
Is that right, too?

00:40.080 --> 00:41.080
Right.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.080
Nothing further.

00:42.080 --> 00:45.080
I rise to point a personal part of the U.S.

00:45.080 --> 00:51.080
So far as the prior CIA, to turn it, I was not thinking of the late great General

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Van Bergh.

00:52.080 --> 00:57.720
I was thinking of a colonel with whom I grew up, who is now working for the CIA.

00:57.720 --> 01:03.020
I have no doubt that we have communists and agencies in the government.

01:03.020 --> 01:11.480
I also have no doubt that the Soviet Kremlin leaders would hope that we have this union

01:11.480 --> 01:17.080
with respect to all government agencies under this Republican administration.

01:17.080 --> 01:22.320
So far as the OSS has concerned, somebody hate it, these initials to me as a correction

01:22.320 --> 01:25.320
with respect to the CIA was technically correct.

01:25.320 --> 01:30.300
I know literally nothing about it except I do know that one of the greatest and one

01:30.300 --> 01:37.100
of the most courageous human beings that I have ever known is Bill Donovan and Rachel

01:37.100 --> 01:40.640
Melovanna-Winner, who ran the OSS during the war.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.640
Mr. President, no further question.

01:44.640 --> 01:51.800
Mr. Wokey, I have ten minutes and before you take them before your time starts, I

01:51.800 --> 01:59.280
wanted you to turn the benefit of the hard-working members of the press and the photography and

01:59.280 --> 02:04.280
the radio television core, the conversation which we had during the recent.

02:04.280 --> 02:09.840
When I suggested it seemed to me that probably the committee members were taking more time

02:09.840 --> 02:14.880
with questions and statements that afternoon that you might have anticipated that it might

02:14.880 --> 02:19.880
specifically be running rather long, if we were to press for an adjournment today and ask

02:19.880 --> 02:22.920
you what you thought about it and I want you to do it like to express yourself so that

02:22.920 --> 02:27.880
our friends out in front of the guidance that you really are the key man in the time situation

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
now.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.560
Mr. Chairman, I think you flatter me when you say I am the key man.

02:32.560 --> 02:36.440
It is true that we have moved more slowly today than I have supposed.

02:36.440 --> 02:41.000
It was true last night that I rather felt we might include today.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.860
It is unhappily true that today is one of the, well, with a single exception, one day

02:46.860 --> 02:53.860
when I have not felt quite up par physically, which is that I would like to say not fight

02:53.860 --> 02:54.860
lightning.

02:54.860 --> 02:58.940
It follows that we can't say tonight as I do it even if we ran late.

02:58.940 --> 03:02.500
And my only wish would be that we would either adjourn at the regular time or slightly

03:02.500 --> 03:03.500
ahead of that.

03:03.500 --> 03:07.340
And I could then say that assuming the temperature stress is up pretty dearly at an end,

03:07.340 --> 03:11.020
surely around the middle of the day tomorrow, I think we would come to a conclusion.

03:11.020 --> 03:16.020
But dear President, perhaps we could finish with the conclusion of the morning session.

03:16.020 --> 03:19.740
Mr. Welch, I think we might have once again guessed that we strived at the regular time

03:19.740 --> 03:23.020
that we take a recess tomorrow, depending on how in the morning.

03:23.020 --> 03:26.020
And by running late at some time, it's now what we might get.

03:26.020 --> 03:29.620
Once again, depending somewhat on what happens to this side of the table.

03:29.620 --> 03:35.020
I realize you haven't controlled very much of the time, so that will depend on my colleagues

03:35.020 --> 03:37.020
that I have talked with them.

03:37.020 --> 03:41.020
They are narrowing the end of their questioning, until I was hosted by tomorrow.

03:41.020 --> 03:45.020
And they pass more frequently and feel that you have the more consecutive opportunities to talk.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.020
Thank you, sir.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.020
And I may proceed with a ten minutes to start the clock.

03:48.020 --> 03:53.020
Then at the moment, I want to say something to you, sir, with some gravity upon it.

03:53.020 --> 03:59.020
I have on more than one occasion heard you say, casually, both.

03:59.020 --> 04:04.020
Now that the Army charges have proved entirely false, unfold.

04:05.020 --> 04:08.020
And you have said such things. Have you not?

04:08.020 --> 04:09.020
Yes, sir.

04:09.020 --> 04:11.020
As I have said, the Stephen Adams charges.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.020
Yes.

04:12.020 --> 04:13.020
This is not an Army charge.

04:13.020 --> 04:19.020
May I remind you, Senator, with all humility on my part,

04:19.020 --> 04:24.020
that you are a witness in this case and not a judge, when you agree to that, sir?

04:24.020 --> 04:26.020
The ramwit was.

04:26.020 --> 04:27.020
And not a judge.

04:27.020 --> 04:29.020
And not a judge?

04:29.020 --> 04:30.020
Yes, sir.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.020
That's right.

04:31.020 --> 04:40.020
And that your testimony today, and what you may hear after you give, must be weighed on the one hand by this committee.

04:40.020 --> 04:41.020
Is that right, sir?

04:41.020 --> 04:43.020
You said it pretty much way, my...

04:43.020 --> 04:44.020
Yes, sir.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.020
My obviously.

04:45.020 --> 04:49.020
And the country, much also, or will at least make up its mind.

04:49.020 --> 04:54.020
Yes, I think the jury was watching on television.

04:54.020 --> 04:57.020
We'll make up its mind watching all the witnesses.

04:57.020 --> 05:05.020
And the I think that to your senator, that whatever the outcome, it would be more grateful at least,

05:05.020 --> 05:12.020
for you to await the verdict rather than to announce it so you think from the witness, sir.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.020
But there, well, my...

05:14.020 --> 05:16.020
I tell you, sir,

05:16.020 --> 05:22.020
that when you were anyone else, makes charges against my staff,

05:22.020 --> 05:26.020
which are charges which are completely unbounded,

05:26.020 --> 05:31.020
and you and I will agree now that the charges against Mr. Carr were completely without foundation,

05:31.020 --> 05:35.020
that I will not be graceful of some sort of a situation.

05:35.020 --> 05:36.020
I've got to do it.

05:36.020 --> 05:39.020
Let's make it clear, Mr. Welles.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.020
This is no game.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.020
This is no game.

05:43.020 --> 05:49.020
When I hire, when I get these young men to come down here, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Carr,

05:49.020 --> 05:52.020
and I get them to come down, and I warn them ahead of time,

05:52.020 --> 05:58.020
but they're going to be smeared by every left-wing communist publication of the country.

05:58.020 --> 06:06.020
I didn't anticipate that the smear would extend the places where it has.

06:06.020 --> 06:09.020
And I just want to tell you, Mr. Welles,

06:09.020 --> 06:17.020
as long as it proves them now that those charges are completely fraudulent, completely unfounded,

06:18.020 --> 06:23.020
I don't think they're dancing graceful about my trying into my,

06:23.020 --> 06:25.020
that there's something truthful about them.

06:25.020 --> 06:28.020
Now your name was trained to the charges, Mr. Welles.

06:28.020 --> 06:32.020
Your name was trained to the charges.

06:32.020 --> 06:35.020
I am not accusing you of having popped them up.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.020
I don't think you did.

06:36.020 --> 06:41.020
I think you were merely the lawyer in the case, brought him, told the fact,

06:41.020 --> 06:45.020
and drafted that they can find that any lawyer was.

06:45.020 --> 06:48.020
But I repeat again, I repeat again, sir,

06:48.020 --> 06:54.020
that now that it has been proven that Mr. Cohn and Mr. Carr

06:54.020 --> 06:59.020
guiltly have only one crime, namely that they fight communism,

06:59.020 --> 07:04.020
that they fight communism, that they work making day to day to do that.

07:04.020 --> 07:07.020
As far as I am concerned,

07:07.020 --> 07:12.020
they have all of my ability,

07:12.020 --> 07:18.020
all the power of mind and body that I have to prove how dishonest,

07:18.020 --> 07:21.020
how fraudulent those charges are.

07:21.020 --> 07:23.020
I hope that answers your questions, sir.

07:23.020 --> 07:25.020
Have I ever suggested to you, Senator,

07:25.020 --> 07:29.020
that we are sitting in this room playing a game?

07:29.020 --> 07:32.020
I would think from watching you, Mr. Welles,

07:33.020 --> 07:37.020
that you do not grasp the seriousness of this threat.

07:37.020 --> 07:40.020
I would think that if you did,

07:40.020 --> 07:46.020
if you did, maybe you would have worked with the committee

07:46.020 --> 07:50.020
trying to call this all after it appears

07:50.020 --> 07:52.020
those don't-american charges,

07:52.020 --> 07:54.020
so we could get back to exposing some.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.020
Senator McCarthy, I work at an address

07:57.020 --> 08:00.020
where there are men with house limbs

08:00.020 --> 08:03.020
who lost them fighting communism,

08:03.020 --> 08:06.020
and where men confirm, confirm,

08:06.020 --> 08:10.020
warnings to my colleagues about the possibility of a war

08:10.020 --> 08:14.020
that may be closer to us than either you or I know.

08:14.020 --> 08:18.020
And those men with whom I confer are going to fight that war,

08:18.020 --> 08:22.020
and many of them are going to die if we have it.

08:22.020 --> 08:25.020
Don't think, sir, that under those circumstances,

08:25.020 --> 08:27.020
I think we are playing a game.

08:28.020 --> 08:31.020
I am only suggesting to you, Senator,

08:31.020 --> 08:35.020
that as to this case, which has to be done

08:35.020 --> 08:37.020
to design the way to entire front of people

08:37.020 --> 08:39.020
and in part by the committee,

08:39.020 --> 08:42.020
it would be grateful for Welles

08:42.020 --> 08:46.020
and not to announce that your charges are completely false

08:46.020 --> 08:50.020
and that the army is surely a complete winner

08:50.020 --> 08:53.020
and that we might all as well go home tonight.

08:53.020 --> 08:56.020
And I think that it will permit me to say it.

08:56.020 --> 09:00.020
It would be grateful for you to await a burden

09:00.020 --> 09:03.020
to drive those who are placed in a position

09:03.020 --> 09:05.020
to render the burden to Welles.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.020
May we go on or would you like to say something?

09:07.020 --> 09:09.020
I would like to come on that one, too.

09:09.020 --> 09:12.020
Well, you said that you have had contact

09:12.020 --> 09:17.020
with Manila Adlem's reports in the last four.

09:17.020 --> 09:19.020
When I tell you, Mr. Welles,

09:19.020 --> 09:23.020
but just to certain that you sit here today,

09:23.020 --> 09:28.020
the four months we've wasted on this hearing

09:28.020 --> 09:33.020
called on by your clients will result

09:33.020 --> 09:38.020
in the end with many more young men,

09:38.020 --> 09:41.020
being with us limbs.

09:41.020 --> 09:45.020
While we investigate these fraudulent charges

09:45.020 --> 09:49.020
of your wealth, there are communities working

09:49.020 --> 09:51.020
in our defense plan.

09:51.020 --> 09:55.020
There are communities being left unmolisted in our government.

09:55.020 --> 09:58.020
That is the tragedy of this hearing.

09:58.020 --> 10:03.020
The only good thing about it is that I believe

10:03.020 --> 10:07.020
the American jury, if I judge the reaction

10:07.020 --> 10:10.020
I've gotten properly, are getting a picture,

10:10.020 --> 10:15.020
a picture of the seriousness of the situation,

10:15.020 --> 10:18.020
a picture which Mr. Welles done fortunate to am afraid

10:18.020 --> 10:21.020
of some of us in this room do not have.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.020
The I only say to that senator,

10:23.020 --> 10:24.020
which is Senator Matata,

10:24.020 --> 10:27.020
that has to every day in with any subversive

10:27.020 --> 10:30.020
most harmonious threatening this country.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.020
But he is reachable by the army in any way.

10:33.020 --> 10:36.020
If you in the last weeks had given their names

10:36.020 --> 10:40.020
to the army or if you would give them to the army now,

10:40.020 --> 10:42.020
they would either be under surveillance

10:42.020 --> 10:44.020
or suspended or kicked out.

10:44.020 --> 10:46.020
Mr. Welles, don't pull that on me.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.020
Do you not know Senator?

10:48.020 --> 10:50.020
Don't pull that on me sir.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.020
Don't you know?

10:51.020 --> 10:53.020
Don't pull that on me.

10:53.020 --> 10:56.020
Don't forget to be there if you will be

10:56.020 --> 10:59.020
that the United States army is going to cut it

10:59.020 --> 11:03.020
on top by letting communists cut its borders

11:03.020 --> 11:05.020
and say they will be.

11:05.020 --> 11:07.020
Don't kill these girls.

11:07.020 --> 11:10.020
The United States army doesn't fight Congress.

11:10.020 --> 11:13.020
You do not have a monopoly during that field.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.020
You do good work.

11:15.020 --> 11:18.020
I aspire to work through two-and-a-half minutes and 16.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.020
But for these things, sir,

11:20.020 --> 11:23.020
steadily, day by day in this government,

11:23.020 --> 11:25.020
not only in the arms,

11:25.020 --> 11:27.020
but in the hands of the army and in the air for them

11:27.020 --> 11:28.020
throughout the government,

11:28.020 --> 11:32.020
as you know, the fight goes on and on and on.

11:32.020 --> 11:35.020
And you should raise your eyes with me

11:35.020 --> 11:39.020
that there are people after communists tonight

11:39.020 --> 11:41.020
in a dangerous museum.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.020
Mr. Welles.

11:45.020 --> 11:52.020
I think you and I should be on the same side in this fight.

11:52.020 --> 11:57.020
I think essentially we are.

11:57.020 --> 12:01.020
You tell me that if I would give the names of communists,

12:01.020 --> 12:02.020
you say to the army,

12:02.020 --> 12:04.020
let's make it clear, Mr. Welles.

12:04.020 --> 12:10.020
This is no contest between our committee and the army.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.020
I, as far as I know,

12:13.020 --> 12:18.020
have the uniform man and the military

12:18.020 --> 12:21.020
pulled partially back up

12:21.020 --> 12:24.020
any effort to get the huge traitors,

12:24.020 --> 12:28.020
the two rotten apples that set the four out of the barrel.

12:28.020 --> 12:31.020
We intend to continue to do that.

12:31.020 --> 12:35.020
Now, the only way on earth that our committee can now

12:35.020 --> 12:37.020
get back to its job

12:37.020 --> 12:40.020
is to end this investigation.

12:40.020 --> 12:43.020
And I think it has served a purpose.

12:43.020 --> 12:46.020
And then when we do that,

12:46.020 --> 12:49.020
we have a vast amount of work to do,

12:49.020 --> 12:50.020
which we intend to do.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.020
And may I say,

12:51.020 --> 12:53.020
I hope we can do it.

12:53.020 --> 12:54.020
I hope we can do it

12:54.020 --> 12:58.020
with the cooperation of your clients, Mr. Welles.

12:58.020 --> 13:01.020
But with or without such cooperation,

13:01.020 --> 13:04.020
take my work forward, we will do it.

13:05.020 --> 13:07.020
And that connects your senator

13:07.020 --> 13:11.020
and in a calmer move perhaps.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.020
Your committee does have one thing

13:13.020 --> 13:16.020
that no executive department has,

13:16.020 --> 13:18.020
and that is the power to subpoena,

13:18.020 --> 13:20.020
if that's not so, those tricks.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.020
And that's, you agree,

13:21.020 --> 13:23.020
it's an important power.

13:23.020 --> 13:24.020
Very important.

13:24.020 --> 13:27.020
And once you know the location

13:27.020 --> 13:29.020
of a real army,

13:29.020 --> 13:32.020
then you can expose him swiftly.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.020
I think the easier person is to answer.

13:35.020 --> 13:36.020
Right. You are right.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.020
You have that wonderful power,

13:38.020 --> 13:40.020
subpoena, and it's good that you have it.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.020
On the other side,

13:41.020 --> 13:44.020
at least from the picture senator,

13:44.020 --> 13:46.020
people like the army and the Navy

13:46.020 --> 13:48.020
and the Air Force

13:48.020 --> 13:50.020
have the power of surveillance,

13:50.020 --> 13:53.020
which you can't do with 14 men.

13:53.020 --> 13:55.020
You agree to that, too, don't you?

13:55.020 --> 13:56.020
Well, you're 100% correct.

13:56.020 --> 13:58.020
We only have a few regulators.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.020
And that's the millionth.

13:59.020 --> 14:00.020
They have hundreds.

14:00.020 --> 14:01.020
And that can be important.

14:01.020 --> 14:04.020
Because if you have a suspected communist,

14:04.020 --> 14:06.020
and you've been putting him under surveillance,

14:06.020 --> 14:07.020
and you're watching closely,

14:07.020 --> 14:09.020
and I'll be late, turn up, not only once,

14:09.020 --> 14:12.020
but that communist and nine others making him.

14:12.020 --> 14:16.020
Yes, I think that putting a man under surveillance,

14:16.020 --> 14:21.020
while it's a very complicated procedure,

14:21.020 --> 14:24.020
I believe it takes six men on average

14:24.020 --> 14:28.020
to keep the man under surveillance for 24 hours.

14:28.020 --> 14:30.020
I think that's a very important thing.

14:30.020 --> 14:31.020
Right.

14:31.020 --> 14:34.020
So when you say there could be cooperation

14:34.020 --> 14:35.020
between New York and the Biddy,

14:35.020 --> 14:38.020
and someone like the Army or the Navy or the Air Force,

14:38.020 --> 14:42.020
I agree with you that that is sublimely true, sir,

14:42.020 --> 14:45.020
and I agree with you that peace has a weapon,

14:45.020 --> 14:47.020
an important weapon,

14:47.020 --> 14:49.020
that the other one does not have.

14:49.020 --> 14:50.020
You're right.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.020
I'm welcome.

14:54.020 --> 14:56.020
I thought I had a desire.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.020
I wanted to be a commander of the committee,

14:59.020 --> 15:01.020
and they feel, if you feel,

15:01.020 --> 15:06.020
that they haven't perhaps murdered one ten-minute periods

15:06.020 --> 15:08.020
each left, and not all of them have that.

15:08.020 --> 15:11.020
And if you feel that will give you ample time tomorrow,

15:11.020 --> 15:12.020
we're willing to make them, we say,

15:12.020 --> 15:15.020
now because you say you're not feeling quite as much.

15:15.020 --> 15:18.020
It could be that that would mean to somewhat like lunch,

15:18.020 --> 15:20.020
which I don't think anybody would know,

15:20.020 --> 15:21.020
unless we have to run a little late.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.020
And it could even be eye-wrong, be wrong,

15:23.020 --> 15:24.020
they're tired to death.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.020
I think we could finish by lunch,

15:26.020 --> 15:28.020
and even if we were a little late,

15:28.020 --> 15:30.020
we'll certainly have to go meet session two o'clock tomorrow morning.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.020
You have just heard Chairman Montenau,

15:40.020 --> 15:43.020
the next session of the hearing will be at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

15:44.020 --> 15:47.020
The ABC Television Network is bringing you

15:47.020 --> 15:50.020
the complete hearings into the McCarthy Army controversy.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.020
The UNIQ has announced the three sets until tomorrow at ten a.m.

15:56.020 --> 15:58.020
when it is expected that tomorrow session will see the close of the hearing.

15:58.020 --> 16:00.020
That seems to be the general consensus of opinion here.
