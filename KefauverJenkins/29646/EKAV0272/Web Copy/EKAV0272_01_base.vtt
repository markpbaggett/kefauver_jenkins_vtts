00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I assume you'll announce it and answer that.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.480
Mr. Jackson, you know I made a break clear that the call Mr. Clepper was a lawyer who can

00:13.480 --> 00:18.080
claim illegal for a break without Mr. Simon can take the stand to be a great way of

00:18.080 --> 00:19.080
time.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.280
Now I have made it clear that I am not going to ask for Mr. Simon to be subpoenaed.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.680
I think out of the constitution he cannot be.

00:26.680 --> 00:30.440
I think it would be a great contribution here whoever.

00:30.440 --> 00:35.560
If we could get Mr. Simon's in, come on a stand and my very good friend you've done

00:35.560 --> 00:36.560
with well.

00:36.560 --> 00:41.560
I'm curious to know what that conversation was by a day before he came back on the committee.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.560
I would only like to hear that.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.560
I would only like to hear that role.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.560
I would only like to hear that role.

00:48.560 --> 00:54.240
Not that I don't, not that I crossed in your truthfulness, but the rest of us have taken

00:54.240 --> 01:01.240
the oath and I frankly am very curious about the conversations you have, the conversations

01:01.240 --> 01:10.240
with Mr. Simon, what is behind all of them?

01:10.240 --> 01:14.240
It's one of the miscarries of time.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.240
It's one of the miscarries of time.

01:18.240 --> 01:25.240
I think it was a quote from some magazine.

01:25.240 --> 01:36.240
He said Stephen came following any spelling.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.240
That's him quickly.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.240
Nothing to it.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.240
Mr. Stevens and the other Republicans are present now.

01:43.240 --> 01:48.240
We have a very fun conversation with him.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.240
We made an agreement.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.240
I shouldn't say an agreement.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.240
We all agreed that Stephen left the committee with some kind of a certain information.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.240
Nothing new about that.

01:59.240 --> 02:06.240
Apparently after that meeting something happened I don't know about it.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.240
And the best thing I think maybe Senator.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.240
You and Senator Simon don't judge the way.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.240
I've said a lot of things happen.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.240
I have to democrypt the oath to the committee.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.240
That's what we're investigating now.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.240
No, we have to get him out.

02:18.240 --> 02:26.240
Senator Solomon has been proven now that the charges against Mr. Carval have been proven

02:26.240 --> 02:31.240
that the only thing Mr. Cohn has done according to the testimony Mr. Stevens and the Madam.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.240
Well, he couldn't get me to refuse to call.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.240
Remember the loyalty board?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.240
Mr. Cohn didn't try to do it.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.240
If he tried he was not a succeeded son.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.240
Has or not we know the charges are completely broken.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.240
Connecting it as a fact.

02:44.240 --> 02:47.240
Well, we'll get away from the luncheon from that.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.240
I mean the chicken luncheon.

02:49.240 --> 02:53.240
Senator, I had understood you to say that.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.240
And if I'm wrong I want to be corrected here.

02:55.240 --> 03:02.240
testimony earlier this afternoon that you didn't feel that all of these staff need to have clearance.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.240
And I wondered if you would just elaborate.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.240
No, no, I didn't say that son.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.240
Oh, you strike not so.

03:06.240 --> 03:13.240
I have said that I have asked the FBI for a full deal of investigation of everyone on the staff.

03:13.240 --> 03:18.240
I have said that they have given me a known as a name check on the number of the staff.

03:18.240 --> 03:24.240
I said that originally I thought that perhaps they clearance from the atomic energy commission.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.240
Or if the Pentagon might be of importance,

03:27.240 --> 03:30.240
while it appears that we're going to be able to get information from them,

03:30.240 --> 03:34.240
since I discovered that we cannot get information from them.

03:34.240 --> 03:41.240
For example, CIA has refused to cooperate at all.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.240
It's no sense to find an aspirant experience for organizations.

03:44.240 --> 03:48.240
If we can work out some kind of an arrangement.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.240
Or by this committee can get some extra information from the various departments.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.240
And I think those departments should have the right to object to.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.240
You'll remember all the factors.

03:56.240 --> 04:03.240
I made a motion in the committee in the administration requesting a full deal investigation of all staff personnel.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.240
If that's possible.

04:04.240 --> 04:10.240
If not, a clearance from whatever other agency that we could obtain.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.240
You move the full deal and let's get to the FBI.

04:13.240 --> 04:18.240
Well, do I understand that a request was made of the Department of Defense for clearance?

04:18.240 --> 04:21.240
Of staff personnel?

04:21.240 --> 04:25.240
Mr. Jackson, I'm sure that originally we made different decisions.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.240
Originally we made those requests.

04:27.240 --> 04:34.240
I don't think we made any such requests over the past four or five months.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.240
I thought that was all done.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.240
Have they all been acted upon? That's what I'm getting at.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.240
As far as I know, none of them turned out.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.240
Nobody has been able to let me all receive clearance.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.240
I don't know.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.240
Could we have that information?

04:47.240 --> 04:49.240
You're searching for him.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.240
Mr. Jackson, for whom?

04:50.240 --> 04:51.240
That's point.

04:51.240 --> 04:56.240
I think the material was requested as well, Bill.

04:56.240 --> 05:02.240
I understood Senator signings to this day that he wished it presented an executive executive.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.240
And that's correct.

05:03.240 --> 05:10.240
That means, too, I have a report in writing which I propose to hand to the chairman.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.240
For such use as you wish to me.

05:12.240 --> 05:19.240
But I think that it is very important on my left would like to make a comment about the addition or subtraction of names from the court.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.240
I think that's a huge change from a purely mechanical admit here.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.240
A lot of objections, the committee will hear from Colonel Murray.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.240
Is that right, Colonel Murray?

05:26.240 --> 05:29.240
We don't wish any information on any particular man.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.240
I just want to be sure that the chairman understands what he is getting.

05:33.240 --> 05:39.240
The chairman of the Senate is having a request to be able to be presented in the executive session because of the signings in particular.

05:39.240 --> 05:45.240
I know intention of saying to discredit or smear anybody who might have been fired for a job and turned out.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.240
That's right.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.240
The fire is a threat for a certain term.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.240
I have the material that you requested in two lists.

05:51.240 --> 05:56.240
Two separate letters both dated today from the office of the Secretary of Defense.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.240
And I've been authorized to present it to the chairman of this committee.

05:59.240 --> 06:09.240
The reason it's done, two separate letters because when we did not receive the list of employees, we worked with an older list.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.240
So wait until someone's here to see if there are listed employees?

06:11.240 --> 06:13.240
Then I'll tell you what they're doing.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.240
Yes, we did not receive it when we requested it.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.240
And I was anxious to get this as soon as possible.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.240
So I initiated a request upon the department.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.240
And they...

06:24.240 --> 06:28.240
I told you on a different list for a new and our, you got it during the new and our report.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.240
I think we got it at yes or during the new and our.

06:30.240 --> 06:34.240
But we had already initiated work in order to produce this today.

06:34.240 --> 06:38.240
And the two names on the list that Senator McCotten presented to Mr. Welch,

06:38.240 --> 06:41.240
that were not on our original list.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.240
And that is why we have a supplementary list.

06:44.240 --> 06:50.240
There was one name on the list that we prepared that was not on Senator McCotten's list.

06:50.240 --> 06:56.240
That's the zone that probably somebody that was employed back in December that is not with you now.

06:56.240 --> 07:00.240
I think you might, just as I was a little bit complete, I think you might find that list.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.240
There should be one more name added to it.

07:02.240 --> 07:10.240
I didn't check the list personally, but there is a young man, a name of Bernie Kabelman, who is on my personal payroll.

07:10.240 --> 07:16.240
I'm not sure if he's on there, but his name should be added to it.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.240
His name is not on either of these.

07:18.240 --> 07:23.240
So that should be added to it, because it's not there because his name is not on the, on the staff payroll.

07:23.240 --> 07:28.240
Then Mr. Chairman, if it meets with your approval, and if anyone else who is interested,

07:28.240 --> 07:33.240
I will hand these lists to you now, or have them handed to you,

07:33.240 --> 07:38.240
which couple of the testimonies of this witness, I think, makes the situation clear.

07:38.240 --> 07:43.240
And they can be dealt with by the committee and executive, say, oh, another session, they do be fit.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.240
Thank you very much, Senator.

07:45.240 --> 07:49.240
I accept them, and then we'll call on executive station to present them to the members of the committee.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.240
Who has the time, Mr. Senator?

07:52.240 --> 07:54.240
I think it's a good answer, Senator.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.240
Before the next senator comes, Mr. McCotten, let us return.

07:57.240 --> 08:00.240
Yes, we just time out for the interview.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.240
Senator Sanders.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.240
Mr. Chairman, I do.

08:05.240 --> 08:11.240
I should have made a point of something, for a fact, when we were talking about,

08:11.240 --> 08:16.240
when Senator McCotten and Senator McCotten had their colloquial,

08:16.240 --> 08:20.240
and I'd like to just make a couple of observations.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.240
It's a question.

08:22.240 --> 08:27.240
The list of questions which I have, and I'm nearly through with,

08:27.240 --> 08:32.240
first is as I testified in executive session,

08:32.240 --> 08:38.240
before getting a lawyer, whose name has been banned in the back here, quite a little,

08:38.240 --> 08:46.240
I tried to get Mr. Bill Watches, former chief counsel of this committee, and he was not available.

08:46.240 --> 08:53.240
I wouldn't have been any better off though, but it got him because as I read the...

08:53.240 --> 08:55.240
You know, you're...

08:55.240 --> 08:57.240
You know, I want to let me finish that, Senator.

08:57.240 --> 09:01.240
You know, with that, I'm sure of me, I continue, I've been very patient and quiet all day.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.240
I read the development.

09:04.240 --> 09:10.240
We all remember as kids, at least all the old men, like me, tinkers to ever stand.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.240
A great Chicago infield.

09:12.240 --> 09:16.240
Let's go to Stevens, to Adams, to Hensel, to Sherman Adams, and Bill Rides,

09:16.240 --> 09:19.240
to Clifford to the chicken dinner.

09:19.240 --> 09:24.240
And so, if I had gotten the Republican lawyer, why I wouldn't have been any federal off,

09:24.240 --> 09:28.240
and I would have fathered him just severely, could have died.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.240
Does happen, however, as I also testified in executive session,

09:32.240 --> 09:43.240
that the last time that Mr. Clifford talked to Mr. Stevens, which incidentally was the second time he ever talked to him,

09:43.240 --> 09:48.240
was on February 21st, and that was day before the chicken dinner.

09:48.240 --> 09:54.240
And weeks before the issuance of any charges.

09:54.240 --> 10:00.240
Now, it seems to me that there's been a little too much made about this,

10:00.240 --> 10:11.240
made out about this democratic lawyer, accepting the request of the Republican Secretary of the Army

10:11.240 --> 10:16.240
to help him with respect to a problem that involved Army morale.

10:16.240 --> 10:23.240
It seems to me that the senator now on the witness stand, during these hearings,

10:23.240 --> 10:31.240
has had considerable help from another democratic lawyer, and I see nothing wrong in that.

10:31.240 --> 10:35.240
I'm Mr. Chairman, the adversary to my question, and I'll try to get him through this round.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.240
I have to agree.

10:37.240 --> 10:41.240
Senator McCrathy, do you think that President Eisenhower could put any classification on a secret document,

10:41.240 --> 10:47.240
which would prevent you from being a person authorized to receive an exam?

10:47.240 --> 10:53.240
I'll answer that. The first one I've been saying that I have got some information I've been longing for for many a long day,

10:53.240 --> 10:58.240
and that was truly positive, I recommend it to Bill Rogers to give that advice.

10:58.240 --> 11:03.240
That's what's going to happen here, that January 21st, for meaning.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.240
So I thank you for the information that's been made.

11:05.240 --> 11:08.240
Now, the senator is totally incorrect. What I said was that I tried to get hold of the line,

11:08.240 --> 11:13.240
without success. If anybody recommended him to look into your problem, there was not I.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.240
Now, your question was, Mr. Eisenhower, I have one.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.240
President Eisenhower, sir.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.240
President Eisenhower, please.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.240
May I repeat the question?

11:23.240 --> 11:24.240
If you will.

11:24.240 --> 11:28.240
Do you think that President Eisenhower could put any classification on a secret document,

11:28.240 --> 11:32.240
which would prevent you from being a person authorized to receive an exam?

11:32.240 --> 11:40.240
Yes, the answer is yes or no?

11:40.240 --> 11:42.240
I don't know. I don't know.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.240
No question.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.240
I don't know what you know.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.240
You think the FBI could have any documents, but you as chairman of this committee should not be entitled to receive?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.240
I will certainly.

11:49.240 --> 11:53.240
Was that the only agency in the government that has documents you're not entitled to receive?

11:53.240 --> 11:56.240
No, I think that the timing from that.

11:56.240 --> 12:00.240
Neither my committee nor any other investigating committee should receive any documents,

12:00.240 --> 12:02.240
which will disclose the names of informants.

12:02.240 --> 12:06.240
Number one, number two, demonstrate and investigate a technique.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.240
Number three, go and take the national security.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.240
O CIA's not been called our worldwide FBI.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.240
Abuts CIA.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.240
I think that's the factor from the FBI to call it CIA.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.240
They worldwide FBI.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.240
President, did you ever hear a vaginal fanarist?

12:21.240 --> 12:23.240
My authority, whatever they say.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.240
Remember who he is?

12:24.240 --> 12:26.240
I couldn't give you his record.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.240
Before the record ends, much as the CIA is another lifeline to our security.

12:30.240 --> 12:34.240
I'd like to say that Adela Cunarras was a man who's turned against Hitler.

12:34.240 --> 12:38.240
And with the key reason that we have cheated so rapidly and confidently,

12:38.240 --> 12:40.240
it's from what I've got.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.240
And I'll check it for the record and break myself if I'm wrong.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.240
But do the effort for Christmas to Alan Dulles.

12:44.240 --> 12:49.240
The president had the CIA had a tremendous amount to do.

12:49.240 --> 12:55.240
It saved the lives of many, many American boys, the magnificent job that the CIA did,

12:55.240 --> 12:57.240
an establishing contact.

12:57.240 --> 13:03.240
When this $1 heading the show, and I understand it, was some fighters in German.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.240
Mr. Birmingham, there was no CIA at that time.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.240
Well, it was the same thing as the CIA.

13:09.240 --> 13:16.240
The initials may be wrong, but what I was getting at more than the agency was the man who was getting the agency.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.240
Mr. Carfield, there wasn't any special agency in that character.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.240
I know he spoke to you about it.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.240
I have just as much pride in the CIA, Mr. Carfield.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.240
You have in the FBI because it's part of America.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.240
I'm just telling you that the CIA was not...

13:29.240 --> 13:32.240
I just recollected it was the O.S. and Office of Strategic Service.

13:32.240 --> 13:37.240
I thought about the O.S. that's good, but let's make it clear that the CIA was not farmed in the long after the O.S.

13:37.240 --> 13:44.240
The O.S. and the CIA is a researcher to the O.S. and I think we're now dealing in semantics and I'd like to proceed.

13:44.240 --> 13:48.240
The next question, do you think there can be any information contained in documents,

13:48.240 --> 13:53.240
any at all, in the executive branch, which the chairman of this committee should not be entitled to receive?

13:53.240 --> 13:57.240
If he, the chairman, thinks his bear is on an investigation, he is conducting.

13:57.240 --> 14:01.240
You asked three or four questions, Senator.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.240
I'll repeat it.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.240
I got to go.

14:03.240 --> 14:03.240


14:03.240 --> 14:04.240
I got to go.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.240
I got to go.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.240
I got to go.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.240
First, you say that the CIA has done...

14:09.240 --> 14:12.240
The front book, the front, like that, is where you read it.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.240
It was not the CIA.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.240
You say the O.S.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.240
You say the CIA was the secretary of the O.S.

14:17.240 --> 14:22.240
I believe that anyone in Washington, including Senator Simon,

14:22.240 --> 14:28.240
and I believe a little great, if the O.S. was the most heavily injured by Communism,

14:28.240 --> 14:34.240
any organization that we've ever had in the country, because there's no doubt about that.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.240
Now, how many of those are blanked in the CIA?

14:37.240 --> 14:41.240
I don't know, but you know what I think you brought up the special O.S.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.240
I want to make it clear that I am no admirer of the Communist O.S.

14:45.240 --> 14:50.240
Bill Donovan, who had about, I think, of a outstanding individual.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.240
At the time, the O.S. was formed.

14:53.240 --> 14:58.240
We were using them behind the line to work with Russia.

14:58.240 --> 15:03.240
So it was only logical that there would be a lot of Communism, the O.S.S.

15:03.240 --> 15:07.240
I think it's extremely unfortunate, however, like we have blanked it.

15:07.240 --> 15:12.240
Many of those come into the CIA, and as the Senator knows,

15:12.240 --> 15:18.240
the House Committee headed by, I believe it was from Tonsky, I'm not sure,

15:18.240 --> 15:25.240
pointed out that Communism from the Army and Tonsky were classically shifted over to the CIA.

15:25.240 --> 15:34.240
Now, I want to say something here that I think the worst situation that we now have is not in the military.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.240
It's in the CIA.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.240
Senator Martin, I don't want it erupted, but I didn't add too many questions on that.

15:40.240 --> 15:45.240
If the CIA is not in the military today, it's a problem for the Republican administration, not for me.

15:45.240 --> 15:51.240
All I was trying to say, all I did is a problem for the country, but it's under Republican administration.

15:51.240 --> 15:55.240
All I was trying to say is that Mr. Allen Dullard, who runs the CIA today,

15:55.240 --> 15:59.240
and all I know about it is from a great fly with a record in both wars and networks for us,

15:59.240 --> 16:03.240
he is responsible for one of the most magnificent intelligence jobs that was done in World War II.

16:03.240 --> 16:07.240
That was told to me at one time by Bill Donovan, who was in the family,

16:07.240 --> 16:10.240
was also my personal lawyer. I'm sorry for his sake.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.240
Now, can we get on with the question?

16:12.240 --> 16:14.240
No, I'd like to come.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.240
I would rather ask the question that you could comment later at some point.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.240
I'm wondering what you would like to comment.

16:19.240 --> 16:24.240
Well, I know you might not be working with us, I don't want it, not because it's just a Republican problem.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.240
What's the cause of an American problem?

16:26.240 --> 16:28.240
I'd order up what I thought was right.

16:28.240 --> 16:32.240
I will have a statement for the hearing tomorrow with respect to the CIA and the OSS.

16:32.240 --> 16:40.240
It was my understanding that the OSS was an organization that handled intelligence abroad outside of the United States in World War II.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.240
If that's wrong, I think correct it.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.240
The agency now that handled intelligence outside of the United States is the CIA.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.240
I knew very well the first head of the CIA.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.240
General Van Enberg was the second head of it.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.240
I think I know a little about it, but I don't think it's on this issue and I'd like to proceed to the question.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.240
Do you think the FBI, or you're into that?

16:57.240 --> 17:01.240
Do you think there can be any information contained in documents in the executive branch,

17:01.240 --> 17:04.240
any at all, which determines if the committee should not be entitled to receive,

17:04.240 --> 17:07.240
if he determines things that bear on an investigation, he's conducting.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.240
Yes.

17:08.240 --> 17:13.240
Do you think the two would remember the committee are entitled to receive all executive department documents

17:13.240 --> 17:14.240
and they don't take good information?

17:14.240 --> 17:15.240
No.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.240
Including the Defense and Security of the United States?

17:17.240 --> 17:18.240
No.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.240
Does that also go for all members of the staff?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.240
Yes.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.240
Does the best of your knowledge have all members of this subcommittee staff

17:25.240 --> 17:28.240
been cleared by the defense department to take good documents?

17:28.240 --> 17:29.240
I don't know.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.240
I asked her about the annullet staff.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.240
I don't know.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.240
I'll never turn down.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.240
I'll answer now.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.240
Mr. President, I'm Mr. Chairman.

17:36.240 --> 17:40.240
On this question, I have a brief statement made by the president.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.240
And I'd like to add something to my question, comments on it.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.240
It's made on May 12th.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.240
All right.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.240
I'm your time.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.240
I'm your time.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.240
I'm your time.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.240
I just know two and everything.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.240
I'm gonna put a long story out.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.240
I'll show you how long it says.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.240
I suggest you wait until I throw around because you have several questions.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.240
I'll have to be able to do what can and each of them.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.240
All right.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.240
Take our afternoon recess to finance.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.240
I don't need to identify them again.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.240
Mr. Robert, vote for it.

18:06.240 --> 18:15.240
Mr. Chairman, I think it's unnecessary to remind our guests who were here before the recess of the fact that we have a standing committee rule against

18:15.240 --> 18:19.240
audible manifestations of approval and disapproval.

18:19.240 --> 18:26.240
And we will, of course, expect our guests to pass the known to continue to comply with that regulation.

18:26.240 --> 18:35.240
I'm sure they know by now that the instructions that the committee has given to the Capitol Police Boys and to the plain clothes people who have asked for it from the rule.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.240
Anybody who violates that standing committee rule.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.240
Mr. Chairman, I'm a copy.

18:41.240 --> 18:52.240
For the information of Mr. Wells, under a timing that's not here, I think I should make one correction in this list.

18:52.240 --> 18:56.240
People who work for the committee that I gave to Mr. Wells.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.240
We have a vast number of people.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.240
I shouldn't say that number of people.

18:59.240 --> 19:06.240
We've got a sizable number of people who act as technical advisers and no salary whatsoever.

19:07.240 --> 19:12.240
Take, for example, in this room today, there's Mr. Robert Vogler.

19:12.240 --> 19:22.240
Sitting back here, Mr. Vogler was in a communist prison for some 17 months.

19:24.240 --> 19:28.240
He was kept at a sleep for some 82 hours.

19:28.240 --> 19:33.240
Question, some 73, 74 hours.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.240
No fifth amendment.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.240
All out there, Mr. Chairman.

19:40.240 --> 19:50.240
And I have a great number of individuals like Bob Vogler who give us extremely valuable advice on the communist conspiracy.

19:50.240 --> 19:56.240
And I have nothing to do with them in the list, Mr. Wells, because they are all on the tape.

19:56.240 --> 20:06.240
And no definite hour is ending like that, but just good oil Americans who like those who are in those spots.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.240
Communism.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.240
Communism really stands for it, right Bob?

20:10.240 --> 20:14.240
The chair of the league is just the list that has been supplied to Senator Simon in the Army.

20:14.240 --> 20:19.240
All that's been had in mind was the people on the payroll, so that I think it's the least you've not completed.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.240
I'm happy to have Bob Vogler into their list.

20:23.240 --> 20:28.240
The dissimilar states have said that the steady kind of American patriotism that we should all have promised.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.240
Mr. Chairman, let my God grant you time.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.240
All right, then that's my election, and that's what we concluded.

20:47.240 --> 20:51.240
And I hope we got a lot of our system right now so that we can be encouraged during the rest of the day.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.240
Mr. Chairman, what are you doing?

20:53.240 --> 21:01.240
I want to ask Senator McCarthy, you recall that I asked a question whether there are any untape people on the staff.

21:01.240 --> 21:10.240
I assume that you're just on the bottom of the tape, such as Mr. Vogler and others that are acting in an informal capacity not working on the staff as such.

21:10.240 --> 21:17.240
That is right, I'm referring and I want to make the record clear that we do have a number of individuals like Bob Vogler,

21:17.240 --> 21:21.240
who I feel can give us good advice.

21:21.240 --> 21:30.240
I agree on that, but you recall a, and fairness to you, you recall the question I asked earlier, you said there were no untape staff assistance.

21:30.240 --> 21:34.240
So that there are no untape full-time staff assistance.

21:34.240 --> 21:38.240
Well, either quite a number of part-time people who work on investigation.

21:39.240 --> 21:44.240
I don't know, I'm glad you raised a number and I don't forget my name.

21:44.240 --> 21:53.240
I can't estimate the number, there are five of the number of people who are deeply concerned about this communist threat,

21:53.240 --> 22:02.240
who give us advice, information, I mean I'm not working on the staff as such.

22:03.240 --> 22:10.240
No, there's no one, I assume you're referring to anyone in the type of position they've signed with them, the answer is no.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.240
Part-time assistance for anything like that.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
No.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.240
You can serve with a lot of these people in so long.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.240
That is correct.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.240
Any time I can ask you a question.

22:21.240 --> 22:34.240
As chairman of my primary interest in the CIA aspect, but because it is our agency for worldwide intelligence,

22:35.240 --> 22:40.240
to be frank, I knew a little of the OSS.

22:40.240 --> 22:45.240
I found out the following facts.

22:45.240 --> 22:50.240
The OSS was run by so-called wild build-on of them.

22:50.240 --> 22:54.240
It was, I said, it was my friend and formerly was my lawyer.

22:54.240 --> 23:00.240
I know we'll all agree that he is a great American.

23:00.240 --> 23:05.240
Actually, he holds the highest decoration that this country can give for valent.

23:05.240 --> 23:09.240
The congressional Medal of Honor.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.240
At this time, he is in town.

23:12.240 --> 23:23.240
At this moment, I understand he is convening with a joint duty to staff for the respect for the grave problems we now face in Southeast Asia.

23:23.240 --> 23:27.240
I have had confirmed my statement with respect to Mr. Allen Dulles.

23:27.240 --> 23:38.240
From early 1943 from Switzerland, he was in contact with the anti-Nazi German underground, which included Admiral Sennar,

23:38.240 --> 23:48.240
and which produced the attempted revolution against Hitler on July 20, 1944, which almost resulted in his death.

23:49.240 --> 24:00.240
Although he was one of the leaders in the successful efforts to get the Italians to surrender long before the Nazi did,

24:00.240 --> 24:03.240
I wanted to make the record clear on it, Mr. Chairman.

24:03.240 --> 24:14.240
I know little or nothing of the OSS that was suspended before I came into the government either or just afterwards, way back in 1945.

24:15.240 --> 24:27.240
And then, as I understand it, there were a series of trusteeships which were set up and carried over until the presidency of the CIA was established.

24:27.240 --> 24:43.240
I know little or nothing of the OSS, but I know quite a bit about the CIA primarily because the late great general, poet Van Enberg, was head of the CIA just far after the time.

24:44.240 --> 24:50.240
He came into the airport, said, first write a sheet of death, and then a sheet of death.

24:50.240 --> 24:54.240
I thank the chairman for letting me plate the remarks in the record.

24:54.240 --> 25:02.240
Yes, indeed. Now, we've included that statement around, and so Mr. Cohn, if you have any questions, give the next man to the pass.

25:03.240 --> 25:11.240
That's not your estimate. Well, that was your question, sir. Mr. Chairman, you talked about CIA and signing the infiltration of CIA.

25:11.240 --> 25:19.240
I'll ask you this first of all. Has it always been your position that there are in CIA and other infiltrated agencies?

25:19.240 --> 25:23.240
That number of great loyal Americans who are sending outstanding guns.

25:23.240 --> 25:34.240
I've said that CIA has a very sizeable number, and thanks to the vast majority, who are good loyal of sending Americans, for example, Admiral Hill and Sutter.

25:34.240 --> 25:45.240
So the head of CIA, I think, was a set of Americans, a set of Americans. I agree with Wild Bill Dunlman, great soldiers, great persons.

25:46.240 --> 25:54.240
I may say, Mr. Cohn, that I think the son of the time he's been, and I certainly think he's very sincere about this.

25:54.240 --> 26:02.240
When he says, oh, I know about the CIA, as far I learned from my great flyer, he's inclined to do what many people do.

26:02.240 --> 26:14.240
To get someone to say just a great organization, a wonderful group of men, and that point onward, I think the center of the field he does, he sends everyone in the organization.

26:15.240 --> 26:27.240
I would say there's no favor of the CIA, not to expose those who may be traitors even though the number may be a very, very small percentage.

26:27.240 --> 26:30.240
I think that's the last question I suppose to be this.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.240
Senator Timington is likewise.

26:32.240 --> 26:39.240
I made a man saying, Mr. Dunlman, the own laughable war, for example, is one of the top men in the West as I recall.

26:39.240 --> 26:43.240
Well, when I was going to make a visit there are, I assume you would agree.

26:43.240 --> 26:50.240
There were, and all I said was when it was an existence, a great number of very April and very loyal patriotic Americans.

26:50.240 --> 27:05.240
A great number of very loyal Americans, and may I say, Mr. Cohn, that the new FS was organized, it was organized during the war, four years, and they utilized the service of the...

27:09.240 --> 27:11.240
...
