WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
And I did not know that I was going to ask you to fix through that, that's you.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
You're not, I wanted to do it.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
I've been pushed upon the people of this nation that we all are so well,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
that there was something to take into your body.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Let me just, if I have any ideas, they're not crystallized in my mind.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
But wouldn't it be a fine thing?

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
To begin, the incultations into the minds of the new positionation,

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
to respect the behaviors and the threats of this form of government

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
stay around the hearts of those on them, when the mind is young and fable and questionable.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
And they get ideas and impressions that they would pay for up to their lives.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
That would be a fine place to start, isn't it?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
You've done that well, isn't it?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
To the toughest of the stories.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
To letting the spread of the communism in this nation,

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
and this possible eradicating it to the end of our form of government might live all the know.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
And then go from where, and again, go from where to the schools, to schools.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Where to use the things?

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
And to get the right kind of situation, and the right kind of birth,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
and the things that will hit me especially.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
You feel it means perhaps that in a sad, limited, neglected, disused and especially,

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
the schools, the reuse of the nations, the issues of great position,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
our dismayation of this form of government,

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
people in need with that too, and the trustee should be done about that.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
So with me, that would be a good step in directing some of our talking about the deadrights and events.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
There's only one group here who are pushing out of justice.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
I would say that as a whole, they do have a really good job,

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
but one, one hundred, one hundred, one hundred,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
one hundred, one hundred, one hundred and one hundred and one hundred and one hundred.

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
And stay it on from the schools, the first radius is the few shadows,

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
on the leaves, on the leaves, upper flight is.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
The college is a university is a nation, and the state is the ideal age.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
I'm in city organization.

02:43.000 --> 02:54.000
The road is the option of the Kowana, and in the churches, and all through all the levels of life.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
And picking chin to victory through responsibility of each individual Americanism

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
to be active and to be articulate about.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Those are very mentioned.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
I think that it's not high-flowing time, and in the morning I'll talk to you generally.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I thought it would be a good thing to make it.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
In the morning, you get sounds that simply get on our direct examination.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Sure, there's not a reason to go well.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Special Council and what I've thrown out for the next four weeks.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Saturday day, June 9, 1954.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Mr. Ray H. Jenkins, the square at Special Council,

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
from the Southern Canadian investigation set out to the Berlin Washington, D.G. to Mr. Zink.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
In the past several days, the tension has been called on more than one occasion

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
to the fact that Mr. Ray H. Kowana's scheduled for a three-year-old evacuation military duty

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
was a unit of the New York National Guard.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
In this connection, the gestions have been made that the absence of Mr. Kowana

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
for this purpose to make a difficult, it's not impossible, to continue with the earth.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
It is suggested that you or the chairman of the Southern community request the Agents and General of the State of New York

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
to postpone Mr. Kowana's call to duty and collapse to the hearing-jacking forces.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
I do not believe that this would be an unreasonable request, and I feel certain that it would be up.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
As the President, you might cite the cooperation given to you by the Army

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
when you requested to try the time, dear time, the year's Subcommittee for the duration of the hearing.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
The only year is Joseph N. Wilk's special conference.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I will say that I have passed that request, Mr. Wilk, which is a very thoughtful one,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
to the members of the Subcommittee, and we have unanimously concurred in it.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
And I'm asking Mr. Jenkins now to proceed and confirm that he was that request.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
I wonder if I could add for an investigation of the testimony passed in just preferential conditions.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Not a point of particular time.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I would like to make the second announcement from the phone.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
If you are to consider yourself still as a witness to be going to available tomorrow

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
and other Subcommittee members and Council have questions to ask.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
The third in substance is for the members of the committee.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
I can tell you that all of the executive testimony, which has been heard,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
which includes testimony of the 11 witnesses, has now been transcribed and is now available.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
So all of Subcommittee members, Mr. Wilk and Mr. Kowana,

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
and I'm attacking the Associate and the Mr. Kennedy's minority conference in the Office of Mr. Jenkins.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
So hopefully the chair that the members will review that executive testimony,

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
because you will be followed and now familiar that I would like to have all members of the Subcommittee

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
and Council for all sides of the country, which is the midst in writing and misdegencies by the Moranook.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
The list of any potential witnesses that they would like to have appeared.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Finally, the chair will say that as the conclusion of tomorrow afternoon here,

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
if he hopes to conclude a little bit so, there will be an executive committee meeting

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
of our committee at noon 357, so the purpose then of times of the coming,

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
how many more witnesses we must hear and how much longer these hearings are likely to run.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
We shall in recess until the time of time.

06:09.000 --> 06:19.000
You have dealt with Chairman Monternau, the next session of the hearing will be at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
