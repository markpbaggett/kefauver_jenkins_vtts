WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
I suggest that the interest of these hearings, the charges are often forgotten.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
The charges were discerning my charty and two members of his staff, used improper questions

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
against Mr. Davis-Shine, or rather for Mr. Davis-Shine, with the Army.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
The counter-choice was that there was blackmail on the part of the Army and the use of Mr. Shine

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
as a hostage. At all the charges that have been made, I have told Mr. Farky again that

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
anybody in this government, even a cabinet member, like Secretary Davis, when they come

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
to be in the day before I'm in the belief for Europe and ask for my help and I'm going to give it to them.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
And I also was agreeable because they're having the advice of a good lawyer, whose name seems

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
to build its portfolio in custody and its name seems to be particularly silent today.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Now, as far as the additional charge you've made, were expected by finding out for Mr.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
Stevens, when I got back March 6th, they're about to about an article, about a group of charges,

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
which was in the press about Mr. Shine. I called Mr. Stevens and asked him whether or not he

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
would give me the charges. And on that, I think in his fair to say he did not agree that I should have

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
at that time, or before that, or after that. I did not have the slightest vote for more

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
ideas that I was going to get these documents until I received it for the letter stating in the court

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
for the request that the potter of whom they sent to me, nor did I have the remoteest idea

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
that any charges of any time were going to be preferred against the committee, nor did I have

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
the remoteest ideals that any counter-targeting was going to be preferred against the army.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
And what I am standing on now is senatorial dignity of the leaders of the Senate,

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
believe that it's advisable for me to set forth this committee and go into what they said,

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
and all of that is an offense to very serious charges. As the right was counsel to interrogate me,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
I'll be glad to do it. Now, Mr. Chairman, I hope we can get on with it here.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
And the next thing you have to say, Mr. Chairman, I have no question.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
I have only an entity to remember to the committee and to the principals in this case,

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
but we can avoid the following year relevant and extraneous measures that have no bearing whatsoever

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
of all the issue of the forest, and that they can move on to a conclusion of this procedure.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
That's all I have to say.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I have to ask Mr. Chairman.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Then the potter that I said in answer, senator Polar had asked him to announce the least calling to be

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
and call out a time for the rest of the afternoon in the back with us right and more.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
And the question is, if there be no committee votes taken any doubts and our calling can be greeted out of that again.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Send it like that.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Mr. Chairman, may I ask?

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Mr. Welch or Mr. Timberlach?

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Yes, we call them.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Mr. Chairman.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I have just one answer.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Well, I have to ask you two minutes of my time. I'm talking about it.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I take it not out of my time.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
No, it's not on my time.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm afraid Mr. Welch, I'm afraid I've got to wait until I get to material plan.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Chair, if you're waiting about that first time you had a good lot of tasks and had Mr. Welch.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Mr. Welch, Mr. Timberlach.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Mr. Colin, I have been interested in the course of the hearing.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
To hear the occasional description of Mr. Stevens as a personality with emanate from the senator and from you.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
We have a difficulty about seeing each other again, Mr. Colin.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
There isn't much room for you to move to, sir.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Could you hit your little to your last, Mr. Colin?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Sure.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
There.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
And unless that runs someone else into trouble.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
I think it was as late as yesterday, Mr. Senators spoke of Mr. Stevens in reasonably flowing terms.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Well, do you remember, sir?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I remember in the statements that I've stated.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And you have from time to time.

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
In that connection, I would like to throw our minds back to, shall I say, happier days when everybody thinks happier thoughts and titles.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Look at the individuals involved in this case as of the Christmas season last year.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Will you select that as a good happy day, sir?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Sure, sir.

04:34.000 --> 04:47.000
I happen to know that on that date, the senator sent five pounds of Wisconsin cheese to the secretary of the Army.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Was that being consistent with your thoughts on that occasion?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, I know the senator sent a lot of it with time to try to surround himself.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
And not forgetting Mr. Adam.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
He sent a light quantities to him.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
As for you, Mr. Colin, I believe you restricted yourself to ordinary Christmas greetings.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And I don't criticize you for it.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Is that right, however?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
I did not send Mr. Stevens on the throughout.

05:12.000 --> 05:24.000
And turning to the senator and losing for wealth where I am not a candidate, the very states of New York and Vermont, I too eat Wisconsin cheese, sir.

05:25.000 --> 05:35.000
Now as of Christmas, I take it to the words that I find in the record of yours, and you may trust me to read them correctly.

05:35.000 --> 05:44.000
I regard Mr. Stevens as a fine, gentlemanly, prettiest person with certainly a pie, wouldn't I?

05:44.000 --> 05:53.000
As far as I'm concerned, sir, they still apply. Mr. Stevens never treated me in any way, but with complete courtesy, and I only thought of the day very fine, prettiest, down the street.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
He is an extremely thoughtful person, isn't he?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Very pleasant pleasure.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
He is an extremely cardinal hope.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Yes, sir.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
And whether it's back and out, and he's the greatest person, I think he is.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And a kind person.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Yes, sir.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And an honorable person.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
He's that migration sometimes.

06:19.000 --> 06:29.000
And as a Christmas, and as a Christmas, 1953, remembering that station, it was your duty that he was an honorable person.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Yes.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
Now let's call in due of those simple statements.

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
I want to direct your attention to what I think is the toughest in this case.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Will you look at the memorandum you dictated on November 6th, Friday?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Sure.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
It's number two.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
Of the man that you thought was courteous, and gabbled, and high, and an honorable, you'll all see his words.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
He meaninglessly, Stevens.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
The guest that will go after this lady, airport, and defense department in the day.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
Here, we said, first of all, we had no evidence wanting an investigation of these other departments.

07:21.000 --> 07:32.000
Adam said not to worry about that, because there was plenty of dirt there, and they would punish us for leaving.

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
Mr. Stevens thought this was the answer to his problem.

07:39.000 --> 07:52.000
Let me say to you again, Mr. Holmes, I think the start of those English words to you are the toughest things in this case.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
You know how I like to use simple and sometimes gutter language, don't you?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Well, I tried your comment, right?

08:01.000 --> 08:12.000
If it's this charge that I have read to you in the language of the underworld, an offer of Stevens too much on the other two services, I don't think that's right.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
It's an offer if I can read English.

08:18.000 --> 08:28.000
The new eight psychopi opera, it was the suggestion that you will ask the lady, the airport, and the defense department, wasn't it?

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
I know you did, and when you said you didn't have any evidence, Mr. Adams, both of us, rightly, and then.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Don't worry about that.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
There is plenty of dirt there, and they would punish us for leaving.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Mr. Stevens thought this was the answer to his problem.

08:50.000 --> 09:04.000
Can not mean anything else, Mr. Holmes, except that Stevens offered to betray the other two services, and that Adams would help turn up the dirt and furnish the lease.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh, sorry, I think it means that's what it says.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Well, doesn't it mean that what it says?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
No, sir, I think I described the conversation.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
Do you want to stop on these words that seem to me so, sir, I'm glad to have you and stop on them.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Why don't you get the question of talking to Mr. Wells?

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
I think it's a question of understanding the context in which they would say what happened at that meeting.

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams had one of us who, let's go someplace else and leave their department alone for a while.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
But I felt that if we spread things around, so that, what's that alone for a while, spread things around, so that the army was not single that.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
But the army would seem single that, and that other branches were included as well.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
It was not point things, so directly at that department, which I assume they were trying to represent, as they could.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
It was a north context with those statements were made, and they were made.

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
But the other place to which they wanted you to go was the brother or the sister services as you wish to name them.

10:01.000 --> 10:15.000
That is today, here was Stevens the second area of the army, and he said in substance, pick your dogs on the Navy, or pick your dogs on the Air Force, and I'll have gone out and stand by him,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
and he believes that there's plenty of dirt.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Wasn't it just that simple?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
No, sir.

10:19.000 --> 10:29.000
Well, he certainly said, Adam said in his presence, Adam said, Dr. Worry, there's plenty of dirt there, and they were spreading dust, leave, leave.

10:30.000 --> 10:44.000
That's the call, if you ever have a finer and formal offer to them, then this highly placed secretary of the army, who said to you in substance, I will write on the other two services,

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
even if Adam and I will punish you as a death and the least, and you crucified them and let us all know.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
That was never said, sir.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I understand the word crucify was not said.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
No, sir.

10:55.000 --> 11:08.000
But for anything, these planners, then that this fine, courteous gentleman offered himself as the prized informer of all times, one place on the cabinet level,

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
isn't it fair to say that this is actually the offer he made?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I don't think it happened for it that way.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I don't care how it happened.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm talking about the English you used.

11:18.000 --> 11:26.000
Didn't you say that in the plaintiff's English and this memoranda of this fine courteous gentleman that he offered to be a traitor to the other two services?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
No, sir. I don't believe I used the words to do.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
If you, if, then, for any other time about this, please.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Yes, and I don't use that word now.

11:33.000 --> 11:46.000
If this memoranda of yours means what it seems to be to say, it means just what I have said, and that is that Adam was punished for dirt, and Adam was punished for leaving.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
And you could investigate the other two branches, and Steven and Adam could lean back and breathe deeply and softly.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Isn't that what that means?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Not exactly.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
Well, if it doesn't mean that, you want now the change of meaning to something other than things to mean to fair meaning of it.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
No, sir, I want to let the meaning stand as what it actually is.

12:05.000 --> 12:15.000
And do you want us along, Calingon, that as of Christmas, 1953, after Steven's had offered to rack on his sister services,

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
you regarded him as a fine, courteous gentleman.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Mr. Rosciott, how many fires have you had to pass your question?

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Yes, sir. The answer to the question is this is the well.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
You put some work in there, which I've never used, such as crucify and traitor and things like that.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, Mr. Steven suggested we build well.

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
That's not single out the army. He thought the army was being singled out at the target of the investigation, and he thought if we could spread it around,

12:43.000 --> 12:51.000
and include in other branches of the southern military, wherein there was a situation and problems which the army had,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
that would not leave him out and touch boldly with.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
That was what his suggestion was.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
These other words and characterization for our U.S. and not mine.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
I think I was very careful to say, which was the fair and the honest things of the day on direct contamination,

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
or it's a very beginning of my testimony, that Mr. Steven's no Mr. Adam ever suggested to me,

13:11.000 --> 13:24.000
that there would be false information, or that they wanted, or that they wanted any untrue or unfair or false things on concerning the Navy, the Air Force, or any place else.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
They wanted us to spread this thing around, so that they would not be the whole target of what they regarded as an embarrassing situation.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That's what it is.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Thank you, Mr. Steven.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, the next round of questioning, again, again, I'm going to be kept here.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I'm going to sign with last year.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I have to know it, and say Mr. Love's a question.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Stand in the top.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Mr. Stone, that's what's back to the S.D.I.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
That's the minute to do it.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
I think we were discussing the two documents that were signed before.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
I was trying to help quite a bit.

14:02.000 --> 14:14.000
One of the most serious problems, I think, in contributions of the research that came some of the latest ladies and some of the effective friends to the government.

14:14.000 --> 14:22.000
I'm trying to ask the saying, you've said a few years ago, that's rather than Mr. Love's, on some aspects of this.

14:22.000 --> 14:40.000
What I'm trying to ask the saying is whether we can get valuable processes from Mr. Middits, documents that are not classified as secretive consequences.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
So, here, it's been found being released, in which the following executive can control it.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Yes, sir.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
On the sweetly-can-a-panel for tax.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Very good, sir. I say we can get certain of such information.

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
You can get it by the means of, well, for not even the Venus there, there have been documents.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
No, but I'm well-informed, that's well-informed, isn't it?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
You can't get any documents if you want to get the U.I.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
You know what I'm talking about.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
No, we can't get any from this reason, sir.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.000
I'm keeping FBI reports in their original form from, uh, inspection by committees or things of that kind.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
Just, first of all, the FBI reports will frequently contain the name of an FBI informant.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
And if there were a publication of the name of both informants, that would eliminate that source of information to the FBI.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
And then, in a minute, documents down there that are more confidential than those who do not contain the nameable informants.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
That might be, sir.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Well, don't you know that to be exact.

15:36.000 --> 15:48.000
Uh, I will say this, and I'm a colon. I've never seen a full FBI document which does not either directly or indirectly contain the name or identification of an informant.

15:48.000 --> 15:56.000
No, sir. They usually use, they're, they're really investigative reports that usually say on information given to them, and they will usually, I think this is a matter of record.

15:56.000 --> 16:04.000
So, usually begin with a reference direct or very often indirect to the informant from whom the information might come.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
So, I'm not using code names, but, yeah, I use simple symbols to the usual thing in the case of, uh,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
So, I put it on that image, and I think you know exactly what it is.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Do you feel the first committee has a right to get those documents?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Otherwise, if they cannot get somebody to be in.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
Well, they can't get somebody to be in about the scene, and they use to be a weather act, get some other words.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You're talking out to them or about them.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm not about that. I'm about to move to the next year.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Uh, we have no right to get any documents directly from the FBI.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
But if you didn't get any directly, no, I'm not.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
No, I'm not. It's just a question of doing indirect consent on the phone.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
No, that's what I'm going to look down on. You have an additional text.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
You have to document the reports and the information forward to a government agency.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
If that's not an agent, it's failed to act on the basis of the FBI information, which is cancelled.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
It's not so much important for us to get the FBI document or the documents from the other agency.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
It's important for us to know that the agency has mishandled a situation that they protect its communists.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
All that's kind of like, is your, is the FBI document?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Is Mr. Smith? Is he not?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Is he not?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Is that kind of a sense of another agency?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yes, sir.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It's an FBI document.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yes, sir.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Still Mark Confidential want to go there.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
This is what you're talking about, and the wise Mark Confidential.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
All right, that's the character I'm talking about, so the metchatical, you know that.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
Yes, I noticed one thing in British English, and that's why I'm not pretty as well as anybody.

17:29.000 --> 17:37.000
I'm simply trying to bring the focus on this thing just because of it that we're confronted with in those that we may not solve.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
Now you have a two and a third day document here, so putting the D or public in season to D,

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
a document containing vital information out of the 15 days document.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Is that true?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Yes.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Well, I noticed when it's presented here, Council would not speed it.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
No member of this committee would need it.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
They get it to commit a document.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
Now, if that document is, if this committee is legally inside of this, and the use of it,

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
for the life of me, I can't see any reason why members of this committee wouldn't need it.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
He counseled me to take it and use it.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I thought it was all of a question.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
You thought it was all over the talk.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Now, to see that is a fair problem and it's a fair.

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, there, that constitutes a legal presentation and a legal unity of an FBI document and not.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I thought it was a bit significant.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
But now the member of this committee would present it under those circumstances.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Now, you're convinced that they have a perfect right to do it in the use of it.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
My defense and senator McCullough, that's correct.

18:41.000 --> 18:49.000
The testimony had a perfect right and a duty to investigate instances in which the accurate has felt the act on generations.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
That's right, and so the question is, just like the very case you're talking about, you have answered the question.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You know what an invasive witness is.

18:55.000 --> 19:03.000
I said, this committee, do you think this committee, the members of this committee, have a right to use that document to carry out the functions of this committee?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Sir, you talk about invasive on the front.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm sorry, not to be a invasive senator.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You're asking all your, you can answer that.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Senator McCullough, you're asking me some questions.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yes.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Which range, very, very long and complicated questions.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Now, that's all I answer yesterday, all not sir.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
They raise very long and complicated questions, sir.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Some of which I'm probably not even qualified to answer.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm doing ask in the Democratic.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I can't give you the information on it.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
These are the type questions in the area within which I just be way over my head if I try to give you the answer.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
So use your consention, you don't know.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
This is my preference.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
My consention is not that I don't know sir.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
My consention is that it is a problem which requires a curfew of exploration.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I can discuss with you individual cases.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I'm not just particular case.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
We need one more round.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yes, sir.

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
Are we in title under your theory and view of the law to use that document for the full participation functions of this committee?

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Or was it made right in declining views?

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
I think that the member, you stress me on how I think the members of the FUTS committee were perhaps all the questions.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I think they could have thought.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
I think that's all I ask.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yes, we can ask that.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I think that's a no arm in the members of the committee.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Well, I'm asking one or two other questions.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I think everything is good.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
I believe you said that you have an access to FBI documents get a full.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I have to.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, I wasn't when I was with the department of justice I had.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
That's why you were with the department of justice.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Well, yes, while I was there.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
That's what it says.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
You should have access to them then.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
Just as in those files that were transferred to you, you should carry out your official duties.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yes.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
That's what only you don't have access in those cases where documents contain those cases that were assigned to you.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Is that correct?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
No, not exactly.

20:48.000 --> 20:57.000
I was for a good area to sign the confidential assistance of the United States Pacific Attorney up in New York, which was the largest and 50 US Attorney's Office in the country.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
And as such, I acted for him in a good many instances.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Well, if you have no scientific way, I might try to come down and be there.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
If you have access to any FBI documents you want to do, why are you in the Pacific Attorney's Office?

21:09.000 --> 21:16.000
And also a lot of them against the funds that are left to share to any relevant to any matter depending in an office in which I was working.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yes, sir.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
That's correct.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Did you have access to them in the Rosenberg case?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yes.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Because of the Department of Conviction of the Office.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
Did you have access to this 15 case document in the Rosenberg case? Is it a part of the file?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Is this one here?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Yes, so this 15 case document is in this case.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
I never know.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I've never seen it in my life.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
So it was not in the file.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
No, sir.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Well, you had no access to it.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I did not know.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Although it differs, to some aspect of that case, you didn't have the benefit of it.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Are you service?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
No, sir, I believe.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I don't know what the case is.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I believe that that's the document with the past.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Answered.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
The Rosenberg's prosecutor never had the use of it in or had access to it.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I did not see it.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
I saw you in my life and I have not seen the 15-day ad.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
You've seen it all the time.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I have not seen it.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
So the information that's in here in the 2nd and 3rd page document is information that

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
was obtained other than any information used in while you were in the district.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
So it's all the time in the department of justice.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
You are right.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
You have never seen the buy ad.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Never seen it.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
In fact, if you had been in the department, you said that you had access to it.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
If I was talking to you, I asked you that question.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yes, sir.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Because you should have asked.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
If it was possible that you should have asked it, why you were there in the department?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Not for this reason, kind of, my colleague.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I believe that we had direct appeal.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
I thought it should be clear that.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
So all the implication you were there in the department, that access to it, the ad.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
I thought you should stay on the rules one way or the other whether you did have access to those documents or did not.

22:42.000 --> 22:52.000
Well, Senator Mr. Hoover, in his letter or a communication committee made a very clear that the distribution of this particular 15-day ad document was, I believe, one copy to the army,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
one copy to the ad for and the other copy to state.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Well, you did have it and didn't see it.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
I'm very glad to tell you, I never saw it in my life before I came with the committee.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
No.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
One more second.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Any touch on?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Just one question.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yes.

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
You think, I mean, that's the ad document, but the two-in-the-fourter page document should be turned over to newspaper men.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Turned over to what that's to newspaper men.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
I was asking by anyone.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
No, I don't think.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
I read my ass, I read something in the paper that a newspaper man at least won had a copy of it.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Well, sir, you could read a lot of things in the papers. I don't know if any of you have seen that copy or not.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I have never seen a public in any place.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
No, I say, I've done that a lot in public, I think you, I asked the question, do you think?

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
It's such a document, a label confidential, you're saying.

23:46.000 --> 23:58.000
I'm referring to the two-in-the-fourter page document that was offered in evidence that was a watered-down version of the 15-page document, which was offered in evidence and unclose examination.

23:58.000 --> 24:08.000
Do you think that document, which was a label confidential, which is the highest classification the FBI put on a document, should be turned over to a newspaper man.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I'm not afraid of that public.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
No, sir.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
I didn't know.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Well, let's look at the column.

24:14.000 --> 24:35.000
There's a number of hundred percent here about documents that get down to the specific document for document about a two-in-a-half or two-the-quarter page document, but that bridge could be properly described as a warning from the FBI, the Army Intelligence,

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
that there were potential espionage agents in the important radar laboratories.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
That's right.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Yes, sir.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
And one of the men mentioned that document was Aaron Coleman, right?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Yes, sir.

24:49.000 --> 24:57.000
And the document was headed, but as the one we received was headed, espionage, R, meaning espionage Russia.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yes, sir.

24:59.000 --> 25:07.000
Prior to time, we received that document until we started to hear a whole hearing there.

25:07.000 --> 25:17.000
Aaron Coleman still had access to the radar material at Fort Monmouth, right?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Yes, he was still working at Fort Monmouth.

25:19.000 --> 25:34.000
Now, it was a strike that one theory of defense that we have is that if we build a radar stream, then you could call Knight, and I'm not talking about anything secret.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Here's a machine called Knight or Knight yet, and I pronounce it.

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
It's when Red R picks up the enemy's fire and Knight blocks upon it.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
The fire is automatically not set over here.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
That's one of the developments of the made public.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
We know there are many other developments that have nothing made public.

25:53.000 --> 26:01.000
Here's a correction that's there, going to assume that if there are, you know, agents at Fort Monmouth.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
That said, well, meaning the loss of a war for the country, yes.

26:06.000 --> 26:16.000
In other words, your next year, coming bomb installations, it's pretty difficult to think of anything anymore important or any more secret than our radar.

26:16.000 --> 26:23.000
The experiment takes them and laboratories, and I also wanted the offense together with the defense.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
It's very hard to.

26:25.000 --> 26:36.000
Now, after we add to this, in the soon-and-a-half-page document, do you feel there was any security information?

26:36.000 --> 26:44.000
In other words, give the names any informants, any of the investigators techniques to the FBI or anything like that.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
I recall it, if not, sir.

26:47.000 --> 26:59.000
Do you feel this committee had an absolute duty upon the receipt of that document, because it's only one of many apparent to the sent by the FBI to the FBI?

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
You
