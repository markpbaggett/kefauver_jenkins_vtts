WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
I was referred to in that document as espionage R, espionage Russian.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.280
I probably had a duty search going into the situation of communist infiltration in the

00:12.280 --> 00:13.280
most laid out laboratory.

00:13.280 --> 00:23.360
Yes, and at the far as you know, at the time we received that document, none of the individuals

00:23.360 --> 00:29.880
named and had them suspended, even the parents that were available to all of the security

00:29.880 --> 00:31.200
officers at Fort Monk.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.600
Let me answer you this way Senator, especially remember without having the documents inform

00:34.600 --> 00:39.280
me, they were a number of people named in that document that the regulatory information

00:39.280 --> 00:44.960
was still working at the radar laboratory at Fort Monk and who had not been suspended,

00:44.960 --> 00:48.360
that who have now been suspended since we began our investigation.

00:48.360 --> 00:53.800
If I can recap the Fort Monk situation as you know it and I realize that we have been

00:53.800 --> 01:00.600
denied the positive information from the military, so we have to take a piecemeal.

01:00.600 --> 01:06.840
This is roughly correct, but over the past number of years prior to our investigation,

01:06.840 --> 01:13.760
there were some 35, I believe, so you are roughly 35 individuals who were suspended by

01:13.760 --> 01:17.360
the commanding officer.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.680
Both of them found unsafe to serve by the First Army loyalty board.

01:21.680 --> 01:30.320
Then they repealed to the training board in the Pentagon and almost let exception, maybe

01:30.320 --> 01:31.640
there are two exceptions.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.720
There were some facts that were working at the Secret Red Alibatory.

01:33.720 --> 01:40.680
Yes, sir, you were told in my presence by people high in the military that the top screening

01:40.680 --> 01:45.920
board had been almost consistently reversing the case of the people against whom there was

01:45.920 --> 01:52.240
powerful evidence of communist activity and overruling the finding of this loyalty by

01:52.240 --> 01:54.760
law board and by commanding officer.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.520
Just one or two other questions.

01:57.520 --> 02:06.760
I find myself more or less in the role of the Panther-Pernie Corps, Mr. Steven, which

02:06.760 --> 02:14.560
is unusual for me, but Mr. Ralph intonated that Mr. Steven's offer to Rath, Rath on

02:14.560 --> 02:20.000
the Air Force, Rath on the Navy, offered to be a traitor to the other servicers.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.800
Is it not correct, Mr. Tone, that there was no such an offer made that all Mr. Steven's

02:26.800 --> 02:33.840
offer to do was to give us information about what they thought was wrong doing and there

02:33.840 --> 02:39.680
was nothing of a racking nature involved, nothing that you've even remotely referred to

02:39.680 --> 02:42.080
as a space near being a threat.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.080
Oh, absolutely not.

02:43.480 --> 02:49.960
Otherwise, they were offering the information with any loyal Americans to get.

02:49.960 --> 02:55.320
I certainly thought nothing in that, sir, which would justify the righteousness of

02:55.320 --> 02:56.320
us.

02:56.320 --> 03:04.800
And could you, the final question would you and I agree that when Mr. Ralph intonated on

03:04.800 --> 03:12.720
the other servicers of the best, about as unfair as saying it as as simple about Mr. Steven,

03:12.720 --> 03:14.720
either you nor out of this, the many rooms.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.720
Yes.

03:15.720 --> 03:16.720
Helen Kriller.

03:16.720 --> 03:23.040
Well, that's the cold.

03:23.040 --> 03:28.040
Once again, Adam said that interview and I'm looking at your memorandum.

03:28.040 --> 03:33.040
Both there was plenty of dirt there on the cold.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.040
Did Adam say that?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.040
Yes, sir.

03:36.040 --> 03:40.400
Where did he mean there was plenty of dirt, these other branches of the North Earth.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.000
And they are airports and the Navy.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.400
And he says they, who do you mean by they?

03:47.400 --> 03:54.160
I would apply that with Mr. Adam, sir.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.160
And Mr. Steven.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.240
Is that right?

03:58.240 --> 04:07.000
I would say, sir, that's probably for it by my own hands there.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.920
Who haven't used the pronounium properly, have you, sir?

04:09.920 --> 04:10.920
I might very well.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.920
Well, do you want to tell us you did?

04:12.920 --> 04:13.920
I mean, sir.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.920
Do you want to say you used the term properly?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.920
I used the word on it, sir.

04:17.920 --> 04:22.440
Well, what do you think the word they refer to unless it refers to Steven's and the

04:22.440 --> 04:23.440
ad?

04:23.440 --> 04:27.400
I think it refers to Mr. Adam and his organization, the people who work with him.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
Do you think it is?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.400
Anyhow, it refers to Adam's doesn't.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.400
Yes, it does.

04:31.400 --> 04:36.400
And they would furnish up the leaves.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
Yes.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
Did he say that?

04:38.400 --> 04:39.400
Yes, he did.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.400
Well, then, isn't it just this difficult?

04:43.400 --> 04:47.400
He says there's plenty of dirt in the other two services.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
He does that.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.400
Is that right?

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
Yes.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.400
And we will furnish the leaves.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
That's right, isn't it?

04:55.400 --> 04:56.400
Yes.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.400
Now, that's precisely what they say.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.400
It's precisely the terms they say.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.400
Now, Mr. Cole, let's not duck it.

05:04.400 --> 05:10.400
If you had taken that offer, you put some then on when you waste.

05:10.400 --> 05:18.400
Gone over to Steven's and Adam's and said, within the other two services, we're going

05:18.400 --> 05:22.800
stock with you, but come on, kids, let's see the dirt and the leaves.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.400
You would have had a right to say that, wouldn't you?

05:26.400 --> 05:34.400
And they had promised you that show you the dirt and the leaves.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
Haven't they?

05:35.400 --> 05:37.400
Yes, that's right.

05:37.400 --> 05:41.400
And you want to say that, doesn't sound you like rapping?

05:41.400 --> 05:45.400
Sir, I just tell me, doesn't that sound you like rapping?

05:45.400 --> 05:49.400
Sir, I would like to say that I can tell you what was said in that occasion and leave it.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.400
You just told me that they said there was plenty of dirt and they were furnished the leaves.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.400
I'm asking you, Mr. Cole, has one man to another.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.400
Doesn't that sound you like rapping?

06:00.400 --> 06:01.400
No, so I don't think I'm saying that.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.400
You don't think it is.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
I don't think I've said words to you enough.

06:04.400 --> 06:10.400
Mr. Cole, when you look at page 1866 of the records, his volume's in.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.400
I get it right away.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.400
Why'd you go ahead and start reading just to help?

06:13.400 --> 06:16.400
No, because I want you to look at it, Mr. Cole.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
Sure.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.400
Time out, I'm leaving.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.400
Reckoning it.

06:31.400 --> 06:35.400
Mr. Cole, have you tabbed the page?

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
Yes, I have.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.400
May I?

06:37.400 --> 06:42.400
Yes, may I say, Mr. Cole, this is the reason why I'm going to say now that the test warning is prepared here.

06:43.400 --> 06:50.400
Yes, this is a page where, if you will look back, I think two pages you'll find looking at 1864.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
I was there earlier, Mr. Lambert, I think.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.400
Mr. Lambert, I think you'll speak.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.400
Yes, Mr. Calder.

06:55.400 --> 07:05.400
And I'm looking at the last full paragraph on page 1866 and I call your attention to these words of the senator.

07:05.400 --> 07:15.400
I received information also to the effect that, and Roy checked with me on this.

07:15.400 --> 07:21.400
But in 1949, there was a report made of the same nature from the FBI.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.400
Did you check with the senator on this while he testified?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.400
No, it's a receipt.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
Can I go back in a minute?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.400
Yes.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.400
What a question, sir.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.400
What a question is.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.400
The senator has to be checked with him.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.400
You notice that.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.400
He says, as Roy checked with me on this, you notice those words.

08:00.400 --> 08:07.400
And then he says that in 1949, there was a report made of the same nature from the FBI.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.400
My question to you is, did you check with him?

08:09.400 --> 08:10.400
Yes, sir.

08:10.400 --> 08:16.400
I think what happened with the well-twentess senator turns me in to follow this and see if I'm...

08:16.400 --> 08:17.400
Check with him.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.400
Now, there's no mystery about this, this code.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
Of course, we all gathered from that.

08:22.400 --> 08:29.400
That in 1949, there was an FBI report of the same nature, don't we?

08:29.400 --> 08:33.400
I would say that the page shows that there were...

08:33.400 --> 08:37.400
The point of the thing is that there were a number of warning yons on the FBI.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.400
Well, that's what I wanted to develop.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.400
Yes, sir.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.400
There was one in 1949 from the FBI.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.400
Is that right?

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
Well, as I noticed.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.400
And you were the senator having?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.400
No, sir, I don't think we have it.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.400
Well, you had it at some time, did you not?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
No, sir.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.400
Notice the next phrase, complaining of what would appear to be apparently ex-binant.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.400
You noticed that phrase?

08:57.400 --> 08:58.400
Yes, I noticed.

08:58.400 --> 09:02.400
Then, September 15th, 1950.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.400
Did you check Mr. Senator when he spoke those words?

09:06.400 --> 09:09.400
I don't remember whether I had it or not.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.400
Have you an FBI report?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
Of that thing?

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
No, I...

09:13.400 --> 09:14.400
Look at the next thing.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
Now, over 20-something else.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
We didn't have that thing.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.400
We were always checking against the very close.

09:19.400 --> 09:25.400
We had some memorandum in the file, giving the state of FBI 1.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.400
Not setting forth the details of the warning.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.400
We had another one, I think, or a two or three or four memorandum with state.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.400
That in the following years, in some cases, you get the exact date, some cases a month.

09:36.400 --> 09:41.400
The FBI sent warning to G. Tull and the Army about it.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
Did you all right?

09:42.400 --> 09:45.400
Now let me read this whole sentence to you.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.400
And then come back over again.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.400
May I am a soldier?

09:48.400 --> 09:54.400
Because I have certainly got a very long impression from it in view of what you're now apparently saying.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.400
Sorry.

09:55.400 --> 09:59.400
To go back a way and read for several lines.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.400
The senator says, I received information all told to the effect.

10:03.400 --> 10:10.400
And Roy check with the Army that in 1949, there was a report of the same maker from the FBI.

10:10.400 --> 10:15.400
Now that's clearly the reference to a 1949 FBI report, isn't it?

10:15.400 --> 10:16.400
No, so this...

10:16.400 --> 10:20.400
Complaining of what would appear to be apparently FBI.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.400
September 15, 1950.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.400
October 27, 1950.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
December 1950.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400
Again, December 1950.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.400
Again, June 5, 1961.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
January 26, 1961.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.400
I believe that is the one we have here.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.400
February 13, 1961.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.400
February 1952.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.400
June 1952.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.400
September 19, 1952.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.400
January 1953.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
April 10, 1953.

10:52.400 --> 11:01.400
And the young man who gave me this information was deeply disturbed.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.400
That is why he gave it.

11:04.400 --> 11:13.400
Because there was no action taken by the Army to get rid of the individual after the FBI had given the ACM police record.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.400
Have you read that with the head?

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
No, I'm not.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.400
By the way, I request the Chairman.

11:21.400 --> 11:25.400
Mr. Chairman, we have a request that the Chairman now ask the...

11:25.400 --> 11:31.400
The Robert and Charter, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wells, for the freedom to...

11:31.400 --> 11:33.400
...select the report.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.400
And see whether or not the dates that I gave were actors,

11:37.400 --> 11:40.400
whether or not they received warning in those days.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.400
And whether they had to do with...

11:42.400 --> 11:44.400
...a ledger, you know, just for the Monuments.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.400
I think that's very important because...

11:47.400 --> 11:51.400
...I gather Mr. Wells here is trying to create a theme question that because I did not have the...

11:51.400 --> 11:54.400
...document physically in my possession,

11:54.400 --> 11:58.400
...but they might not have an existence, my think it's very important now that the chairman...

11:58.400 --> 12:04.400
...the mill of those documents were in existence that they were not in existence, so I could be clear.

12:04.400 --> 12:10.400
I wonder if Mr. Wells wouldn't have his plans to make a search and tell us tomorrow morning whether or not those dates are correct.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.400
I will tell you this, Senator.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.400
If there are FBI reports of the nature that you talk about and the nature is yours,

12:18.400 --> 12:24.400
...under my concept, the law I will tell you nothing about them because I believe...

12:24.400 --> 12:28.400
...and if the FBI reports of his marked confidential, is confidential.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.400
Mr. Chairman, I ask the witnesses.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
Mr. Chairman, you order.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.400
And his funds to be available requested, and here we call.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.400
But with the same questions as Mr. Evans and Mr. Stevens,

12:42.400 --> 12:47.400
...many days back in the testimony, at which time they agreed to detect the files and the chairman,

12:47.400 --> 12:52.400
...whether or not those certificates were quite clear, they were not going to disclose the content,

12:52.400 --> 12:56.400
...they were simply going in the case whether or not the information you had with them.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.400
They shared his not-know-what-of-the-quest that there was an invite with.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.400
He stated that the subject is in correctional resemblance, but he was out there,

13:05.400 --> 13:09.400
...he was back in the record and determined whether or not they were supposed to be placed made and that's up to him.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.400
And if it was, then he takes the information to be made.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.400
But, at the time that the president of my company was a stringent about,

13:15.400 --> 13:18.400
...I think I think a written number in them.

13:18.400 --> 13:24.400
Somebody over on Mr. Welch's death, giving the date of the FBI's communication,

13:24.400 --> 13:25.400
...that's like a fixed measure.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.400
The reason that that's a question was that, and the reason that we totally will get the information.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.400
So, let's call.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.400
Oh, that's an obeyed until I pass that I just have to correct the right to make sure.

13:33.400 --> 13:38.400
And the senator asks you to check with me on this.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.400
With what did you test there?

13:40.400 --> 13:44.400
I think I have there Mr. Welch and I don't have a sentence like election.

13:44.400 --> 13:48.400
I think I probably have there a memorandum which is in our file,

13:48.400 --> 13:57.400
...which sets forth the sort of chronology of communication between the FBI and the Army,

13:57.400 --> 14:01.400
...containing what the Fourth Amendment,

14:01.400 --> 14:04.400
...right-all adversary, communist central trade, did you?

14:04.400 --> 14:08.400
If you get that from the young man who was deeply disturbed,

14:08.400 --> 14:11.400
...I believe that that changed the standard from the young man.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.400
...this young man that was deeply disturbed, yes sir.

14:13.400 --> 14:17.400
And if he, I may have misunderstood this record, sir.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
Yes sir.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.400
But if he or if he not, give you some of the documents.

14:22.400 --> 14:27.400
Not that the file I know in the present number, talking about the answer that,

14:27.400 --> 14:31.400
...to my knowledge, the only one in the day with the one we have here.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.400
I think anyway, 26, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19 jestees.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.400
I think senator McRodney said a little earlier than what you read.

14:37.400 --> 14:42.400
I received information also to the effect that they all law a report, so on so forth.

14:42.400 --> 14:47.400
I think if I recall it, he told us that on such and such states,

14:47.400 --> 14:52.400
...reports have been sent over, there have been communications back and forth,

14:52.400 --> 14:57.400
...and which the FBI had warned about the situation of communist infiltration at Fort Launth.

14:57.400 --> 15:01.400
Well when this informant gave you and the senator,

15:01.400 --> 15:08.400
...the one day is February, January 26, 1951, he gave it to the senator.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.400
You must have learned about it, Tom.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.400
I don't know how from there, sorry, I learned about it.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.400
Did you learn the date of the other one for the peer in the record here?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.400
I did learn that at some point.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.400
Did you ask informant for those?

15:21.400 --> 15:23.400
No, I did not.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.400
Did the senator ever ask for them?

15:25.400 --> 15:26.400
I don't know.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
It was a good time with his fire.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
All right, Mr. Jenkins.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.400
The chairman passed on the move.

15:33.400 --> 15:39.400
What's the column just one of the questions where the record shows?

15:39.400 --> 15:46.400
On page 50384, that's the money I've given.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.400
The one-shot and senator.

15:56.400 --> 16:02.400
First I'll ask you if you have any special in eastern western western shine.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.400
I know it's made by special in the secretary's opinion.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.400
On the in-friend's ship, we have thing he often does,

16:08.400 --> 16:11.400
...and buying it at him, goes through them to the ordinary friends.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.400
Not a single very good friend, my half-the-half, I have a lot.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.400
Fort Launth, having a lot of them.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.400
Now then I want to meet you this testimony.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.400
On page 50384, the record is up today.

16:23.400 --> 16:30.400
Mr. Jenkins, as I recall, he was reading from one of the monitors call to send the record.

16:30.400 --> 16:38.400
It is one of the two things I have seen him completely unreasonable about.

16:38.400 --> 16:45.400
I was told from some of the records that I call him and he I'm not told to you as I understand it.

16:45.400 --> 16:52.400
He takes days to be a general and works from the turnout of the world.

16:52.400 --> 16:56.400
Now your boss first to file the letter, that is, that's his statement.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.400
Now is that your statement?

16:58.400 --> 17:01.400
No, I don't think he's satisfied with that.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.400
A lot of his statements are sworn to you and the letter is sworn, that's the moment that he said it.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.400
So I've one statement and a lot of statements from the first of his phone call.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.400
Well, I didn't take any of the evidence you want to answer them.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.400
I'm just asking about that if it's true or false.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.400
Is it true or false to send him a call to send that to secretary?

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
No, what is it?

17:17.400 --> 17:19.400
What is the truth?

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
That I was completely unreasonable?

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
Yes, I'll say this.

17:23.400 --> 17:30.400
Like I explained before, we've had discussions about their problems and I just make the point that I thought,

17:30.400 --> 17:33.400
Cheyenne, why, whether you consider that you were completely unreasonable?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.400
No, I did not think I was being unreasonable.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.400
You don't think so?

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
No, I did not.

17:38.400 --> 17:45.400
And he says that you thought the day should be as good or worse than I was to set off to the world or I.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.400
You don't think that to you?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.400
No, of course not.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.400
I never said it.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.400
I'm not sure if you never said that to me.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.400
You learned certain about the truth?

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
Well, so I never heard of a general who was working for you.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
I was.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
Of course, that's an exaggeration.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
Absolutely strange.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.400
Sure.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.400
But I wonder if you don't say something about the truth.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
I didn't say that.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.400
I didn't say that.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.400
I didn't say that.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.400
I might have said it.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.400
You think I did it?

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
Probably did.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.400
I don't think it's a question of being suspicious there.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.400
I think that you read the old conversation.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.400
You would see that it was certainly a good nature.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
I thought they read them all.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.400
Or they had them monitored by the world.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
And I had shown.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.400
Yes, I think there are few reads of all conversations.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
I think you'll see that there was.

18:22.400 --> 18:28.400
Well, the point I like to talk and the point I make is I realize the last thought of them is suspicious.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.400
But at first thought it was statement to be very suspicious.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.400
He found you very only even more about Dave John.

18:35.400 --> 18:40.400
He got told to say, uh, Senator, this was a question of finishing up the committee work.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.400
Whether I was on reason, or completely unreasonable or not,

18:43.400 --> 18:46.400
and thinking he had to work, so no more thoughts.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.400
There is something which I was glad I had you.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.400
I spent a lot of time.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.400
I don't know if I was going to talk to you.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.400
You need to object to questions on this.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.400
Now I want to get to you, but you can hardly tell you that.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
All right.

18:57.400 --> 19:03.400
My testimony is that I don't think I was unreasonable in believing that he had a right to be forced and finished this work.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.400
Well, why the statement was made to be unreasonable?

19:06.400 --> 19:09.400
I would have imagined it was made to be 30% of the trust he brought,

19:09.400 --> 19:12.400
but I was unreasonable and some of this worked my feet down.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.400
I was off stage.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.400
That's what my interpretation was.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.400
Now, before the next discussion, to ask by another person.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.400
I have a voice, Alex.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.400
Any McCockey?

19:26.400 --> 19:28.400
Just one and a half minutes.

19:29.400 --> 19:34.400
I gather and I'm sure it's not difficult.

19:34.400 --> 19:44.400
I talk with Frank, just the impression that I claim to have all of those FBI documents a bit forgiven.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.400
He said he must understand the testimony.

19:47.400 --> 19:52.400
I was the gentleman who caused the memory with the trust that made of that time.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.400
I accepted that time as I recall.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.400
Well, the anti-intelligence session,

19:58.400 --> 20:00.400
Stephen, I'm not a little bit of a tech date,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.400
not a little bit of an FBI document.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.400
The left-hand citizen, Kenneth McCockey,

20:04.400 --> 20:05.400
and the department for that.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.400
But, to a curiosity impression,

20:08.400 --> 20:12.400
I have said that we had all of those documents in that position,

20:12.400 --> 20:14.400
which was not true.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.400
I'm living for the lieutenant.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.400
The lieutenant from the Supreme Court.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.400
I was the lieutenant.

20:21.400 --> 20:27.400
Is the two in the court of page documents from the FBI that we kicked around this room?

20:27.400 --> 20:32.400
The only FBI confidential copy to secret documents.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.400
You've got documents.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.400
You are the senator or anyone on your staff.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.400
Everly, the me pertaining to the subject might have hit the...

20:39.400 --> 20:42.400
Yes, sir, or any FBI documents?

20:42.400 --> 20:45.400
No, I can't say anyone, so I can say as far as I know,

20:45.400 --> 20:49.400
it is the only one we received in connection with this list here,

20:49.400 --> 20:51.400
the Zionist Man, if the...
