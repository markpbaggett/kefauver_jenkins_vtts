WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
All right.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Now let's ask them out of my time.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
All right.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Now, as I referred to the 15-page document,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
and the two-in-a-half or two-in-a-third-page document,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
you will know what I am talking about.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Will you know?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Yes, I'm not.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Now, in this constitutional problem that we are discussing,

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I want to ask you to further clarify your views.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I'm not far from them.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm simply trying to point this issue up so that all involved here

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
and others who are interested will understand just what is involved in it.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
Now, the 15-page document, I believe we can assume from the proof

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
and the case and from the reports that have been testified

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
through from here to whoever, is a top classified confidential document

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
that the FBI will not release.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
If it was more confidential, yes, I understand that that means

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
it is not the big given out, don't you?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Yes, that is classified.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I understand that's the mean it's not the big given to an unauthorized lawyer.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
All right.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Let us say now you have testified here that under the law

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
creating this familiar is the duty of this familiar and the use of the duty

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
of the new, the members of this familiar and the fact.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
To undertake to investigate and see whether the laws are being carried out

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
with respect to this confidential information, is that correct?

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Yes, sir, we haven't really investigated it like all of them.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Now, it is an act.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Let us assume and it may be true, it may not be a violation of this.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Does that 15-page document that is down there, or which excerpt

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
or now in the possession of the chairman of the committee,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
as a submitted document as I am the sir used?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
And yet, the members of this committee refuse to read it.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Now let me ask you, if your position is to law,

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
and we have that duty under the law, why can we not support them?

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
The other document, the 15-page document now in the files of the FBI

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
and has been a bit of all of the information

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
so that this committee can perform its duty.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I believe we could have seen it, sir, but I think that probably

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
if the chairman order is still interpreted as being an effect,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
there would be a refusal to give it on the ground

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
and contain loyalty and security information,

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
which under the 1948 order cannot be given to congressional.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
So let us talk about that.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I was in our document a little, can they give it under that?

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
No, I don't know, but there has been a decisive pattern of justice.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Why not is your position that we are entitled to get it by the 15-page?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Why not?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
My position is that we are entitled to ask for it.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
We will then move on from there.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Well, I know, next move is the 15-page, but don't get it back in order.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yes, sir.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
All right, absolutely. If we should be in it, are we entitled to it?

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Well, at that point, Senator MacRollett, I would anticipate,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
we would have to see what position would be taken by the recipient of the 15-page.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
We would have to counsel on that.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
That's a good need to take the position.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Mr. Hoover takes the position that you cannot have this document.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I'm not at all.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I don't think that's a good decision, sir.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Mr. Hoover, what was it?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Today is the president's position.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It would be some bothers. Let's take it to the top of the government.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Mr. Hoover takes the position that he's certainly being released.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Mr. Hoover has had an investigative agency,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
and I don't believe he makes policy on those things.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
So he works for the attorney.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
You want to say this, Senator General?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I would say Senator, yes, probably would be.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I don't think that's an agenda now, sir.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, we have turned in general to take the position.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
We've seen in this document, the 15-page document,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
with a supply of what's missing in the 2nd and 3rd page document.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And that will, by reason, and getting that document by the team,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
that they're submitting with the information and have information

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
that would enable it more thoroughly and that's the gate, the matters and all.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Now, under those circumstances,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
do you take the position that we can prevail

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
or should be able to prevail,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
or should we have the department to release that document to this committee?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I think I gave you an incorrect answer to one thing.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I don't think the attorney general would come in at the first point.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I think the idea is not a lot for us.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Let's get down to it.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
We get through it in the open window.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah, ultimately you would get through it.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
All right, we get through it.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Now we're all, when we get there, can we come tell him?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Who should submit that document?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
The Miss Committee can tell him by contempt for cheating.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Otherwise, who should submit that document?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
That was a sign on the circumstance.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Well, the circumstance will be reviewed.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Yes, sir.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Can we compare this?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
By contempt for cheating.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Who should submit that document?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
You can tend that.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
The committee has that authority.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
The committee can certainly make a test.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Sure, make a test.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
But you can tend that test would be successful.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Or that it should be successful.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Is that your opinion?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I don't know whether it would be or would not.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
That's the understanding.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
No, no, maybe neither do I.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Maybe the government doesn't know.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I think that's the situation.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I think that's where we are on this.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Now, do you think that's the attempt should be successful?

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Sir, and once again, Senator, I'm very hesitant about getting a policy.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Well, but this is...

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Is it going to be the policy of this committee to get it?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
If all are not to get it.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Why are we?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I would say we're here, sir.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
My hope is that some arrangements could be worked out

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
whereby the executive could make available to the...

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
So this committee and other committees are the legislature.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
That isn't the point.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Maybe it's something can be worked out.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And maybe this issue will be resolved.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
That's what I'm going to make it now.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Do we have the legal rights to speak to them and get that document?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes, there's a committee having it.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That's a reasonable question, sir.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I know, and you're very good lawyer.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
What is your position?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm not that good.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
What is your position?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
That we do get it?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Or that we don't under the law as it is now?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I would have to say that on that, Senator.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
That's two things.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Number one, it would depend on the circumstances of the committee.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Here are the circumstances of the circumstances.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
The committee decided it needed that document to carry out its functions

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
and perform its duties just as soon as the circumstances

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
present a case like that.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I thought I'm trying to do nothing more.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
I'm trying to place you almost part of the way.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I'm trying to get this issue clarified.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
So we can know whether we're operating legally.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Whether this committee is going as far as it can go.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I'm not existing more.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Or if it is not.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes, sir.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I would say that's on the question of law.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
The time of the bill is the presidential elected.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
The question then comes up as a matter of law of whether the executive has the power.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
What I'm trying to tell you is that it's going to be a simple decision.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
It's a very vital issue on the certain circumstances that I see.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Or the FBI file to be shaken, to be confidential,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
to young, to reach out and investigating the minute.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Or the investigation of the right of the subpoena in the power to compare that to the production.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Now, that is the issue.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I think it must be resolved.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm sorry.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I'm not helpful on this.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
There are legal questions.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm afraid I'm not good enough to resolve or even give you a...

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
The next one will be a sound decision.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I can give you what our general experience has been.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
What I think it has to be said.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I don't see a reason why there should be a conflict.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I think that each vote needs to be registered to have their functions to carry out.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I know they both want to accomplish the same thing.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
But you do know that.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
So I hope that the conflict is going to be there.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Some people will try to make it.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
So if there is a chance to get to recess until two o'clock.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
I'd like to see if you can get to the second session.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
What is the drawing for the second session?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, it might be for what I've hear.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
You have just heard Chairman Montenawts that the next session of the hearing will be at 2 p.m.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
No, Senator Montenawts will be at 2 p.m.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Senator Montenawts will be at 2 p.m.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
The chairman will begin this session in the usual way by welcoming the guests who have come to join us in the committee room.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
I'm happy to take care of you to the extent of the rather limited capacity of the committee room.

08:19.000 --> 08:32.000
I must follow your attention to extending rule of the committee room for this, any other than manifestations of approval or disapproval of any kind from the members of the audience.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
And to retire you, that's the uniformed officers of the Capitol Police who are in the room before you.

08:39.000 --> 08:53.000
And the playing clothes and scattered throughout the audience have standing instructions from the committee to escort immediately from the room for likely but firmly any of our guests who select to violate the terms under which you enter the room.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
Namely to refrain completely from any manifestations of approval or disapproval.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
So I'm sure that we can count on the continued through operations of our audience in that connection.

09:06.000 --> 09:19.000
We shall be like to announce for the benefit of his power that he is requesting Senator McClellan and Mr. Alderson of the Refugee of the Civil Service.

09:19.000 --> 09:35.000
In my office, immediately after the conclusion of each hearing for the purposes of making available from my custody and the state, Mr. Alderson, all of the Senate's petty notes of all of the executive testimony that has been taken.

09:35.000 --> 09:48.000
The coincidence was the decision of the subject that he took a type of in-suffee as though the executive came in the office of the council as the defendant, where it will be available to all of the members of the subject.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Also, the minority council, Mr. Kennedy.

09:50.000 --> 10:00.000
And since the chair does not want to do anything in the practice of the moon, I want to be sure that Senator McClellan is there when we empty out the congenstment of the cabinet in my office.

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
The chair would like to also announce for his calling that he is asking all principals, Mr. Welch, and I want you to hear this.

10:07.000 --> 10:17.000
Mr. Carpick, Mr. Cohn, he is asking all principals in this country, and all members of the subject, that apply to Mr. Jenkins in writing by very few.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
A list of the witnesses in your mind, you believe, should be called before the hearing is a terminus.

10:24.000 --> 10:37.000
After that is done, and the chair will suggest we have an executive meeting of the committee to see whether at that time, when there has been ample opportunity to read the testimony, we can agree upon a stipulated list of witnesses.

10:38.000 --> 10:53.000
The floor either of you are council, the names of the witnesses will be called to now be called as expected by the list of the committees, the chair, or you said to Senator, yes, you are a man.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
No, not tonight. He is going to continue until he gets the list of the assembly committee's housing and principals.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
To call the witnesses as they are proposed to him by Mr. Jenkins, and we have followed the list.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
We know not to enough publicly in his death, either the identity of the witnesses to be called next.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
No, there is no.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
There is no firm list prepared at the time.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
Then I address the testimony of the council, he can now announce who he and Jen is before the hearing is closed.

11:27.000 --> 11:36.000
So we may know, there is no use to duplicate. We know who you are and learn to call before the show is being heard, and we can consider what other witnesses might be.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
So we might regard as Mr. Sarge.

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
Mr. Chairman, you need to address the matter of my particular incident of the McClellan, I want to say this.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
This far I have called the kitchen every witness. I have been requested to call by Mr. Wells for the Army.

11:53.000 --> 12:04.000
We are now putting on the side of Senator McCarthy, one of the principals of Senator McCarthy's side of this front of her case, and on a witness standing number of days.

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
I have been requested to call additional witnesses as stated by the chairman.

12:11.000 --> 12:21.000
It has not been my policy to announce who they are. If it was the status secretary of Senator McClellan, I would be happy to inform him and all of those members of the committee's secretary.

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
Now, I was in a few minutes. As a means of the witnesses, we expect to call before the hearing is completed.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Chair, thank you very much.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I think that we have reached and published in this time.

12:32.000 --> 12:40.000
But the chairman at the moment, I would say, it is back to the main, that if we had some discussion about the committee, no, we think we know are going to be called.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I would not want to admit those.

12:43.000 --> 12:51.000
If I submit a list, I would let go of it. If I can know who is going to be called now, I would let the magazine Chair of the Facial.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I'm sorry, I could improve.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
So let's look at people who are close to the Senate. Let's just pass that through.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
We have the knowledge also before.

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
Simply in an effort to try and close the minds of all the bodies of the President, the President, the President, the President, the Committee of the Committee of the House.

13:07.000 --> 13:17.000
Looking towards the hope that we can then meet and agree upon a stipulated with the witnesses, I think we need to find out perhaps we can agree upon some targets they could include here.

13:17.000 --> 13:28.000
Mr. Chairman, Senator McKayton, on the monthly basis of the Elevator, I had just, what's the meaning to be used to include?

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Senator signings him to testify and give it every new order.

13:33.000 --> 13:44.000
For the use of the hold of the image, you're secretary, say, then, we solve, let's get a clear of some of these circles and let's explain that he was finally reduced.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Even not coming from the committee.

13:46.000 --> 13:54.000
I've gone over that to detail some stuff that the Chairman was constitutional lawyers.

13:55.000 --> 14:07.000
The general agreement is that, as you as the constitutional provision, I can't afford a first-rate, but an effective effect to the Center can only be made to master for his act upon the front of the floor.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
I don't really use that. We can force under-timing them to testify.

14:15.000 --> 14:35.000
I know the Center signings are not called for my advice, you might have walked, but if the calls are left on explain, if it appears to be average listener, I know those 30,000 people who write to me every day, the Center signings him was trying to induce this fight.

14:35.000 --> 14:47.000
I mean, not of them. I say he hasn't asked my advice, but I would strongly advise him if he did ask for that advice to secretary, and testify.

14:47.000 --> 14:56.000
I think that would be very important, such as many of the clear of a question that has a day in the minds of a last number of people.

14:57.000 --> 15:17.000
I'm just having my advice to a point of personal service. You may have any chance that it suggests that after that, the guarantee can be eradicated because the last thing you have in mind is to specificate any number of the callers, so if you've wanted to solicit some of your associates, so if the witness you want to have thought, you're recognized as kind of a financial service.

15:18.000 --> 15:27.000
I said before, I have no objection of any time to say anything under oath, but I say none of those because I tell the truth.

15:28.000 --> 15:45.000
And I'd be very glad to go on the hold, even though it's a rather extraordinary situation, to be a judge of the case of a judge, and then suddenly to have one of the defendants indicate the man of the judge, come to the stand, take an oath and testify.

15:46.000 --> 15:54.000
I have said, however, if I would be glad to discuss this, we'll tell the McCarthy on the floor of the United States Senate.

15:54.000 --> 16:01.000
Since that time, I have checked with the leaders of the Senate. My side of the aisle, it could take you a brief in my condition.

16:01.000 --> 16:13.000
I've said even further than that, that the McCarthy would like to agree through the arrangement between him and me because I have nothing to hide, I'm sure he doesn't need my advice.

16:14.000 --> 16:33.000
I will make a call from the floor of the Senate, and then come before this committee, and testify on the oath that he will make a call from the floor of the Senate, and then come before this committee, and testify on the oath that the charges of the May against him in 1915, which will unanimously be signed by Democrats and the Republican Army Committee.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I was kind of in a new position.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
But, Cal and I made my statement that if I'd gone high time, I'd be glad to hear.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
I would like to ask something, because I think you've read a very attractive talker there.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
I wonder if the necessary for me to make a speech from the floor of the Senate.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
I don't think any of the stuff that could last, and the press is not enough.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
We've justified the Florida committee. You have not said that you will no under oath.

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
If I am willing to under oath answer the old Benvin charges of 1932.

17:09.000 --> 17:20.000
While I think those are not from the Bureau of this case, I would consent to let you anyone question me and detail on those Benvin charges.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
If I'm so doing, we can get you under oath.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
You mentioned the speech from the floor of the Senate.

17:26.000 --> 17:34.000
I just wonder, some of the President's now here are offered to make it that the vote comes before the committee.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
If you require that I make a speech, of course I can go over and make a five-minute speech from the floor if I get to the testify.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
We've also come before this committee's agenda.

17:45.000 --> 17:58.000
I'm not talking about the Benvin charges. I'm talking about the charges that were made in the report that was signed by all members on the Democratic side and a member on the Republican side had to do with the last five months.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
Didn't have anything to do with any charges that were made by Mr. Benvin as far as the report was concerned.

18:04.000 --> 18:13.000
Now, you have picked your place where you would like to take a judge off of a committee and have it come down and testify where you could have interrogated.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
He was known you were on an offensive here and not I.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
And I say, you know what I'm going to be on a scatter of an hour about it.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
You have your committee here.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
We'll go on the floor of the Senate and arrange it to hear you.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
The committee to hear me would have to be willing to have this committee.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Now, there's where I stand and you can take it early.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
I don't understand. I'm just a journalist for a minute.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
You're enjoying the fan that your offer is to form a different committee.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I'm just about for this. Mr. Calvin.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I'm trying to accept your offer.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Have your opportunity, Senator.

18:45.000 --> 18:55.000
Mr. Calvin, I believe it would be only fair under the circumstances that the committee has done that to McCarthy came before with respect to the charges against him.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
But the committee we can discuss on the floor of the United States Senate.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
And it's a matter that you can put me on those with respect to this hearing.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
But the committee that we will discuss before the United States Senate.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
Carol, please just tell us this call is getting no place at the end.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
We have a misunderstanding between the two senators.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
We're going to propose them.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
And shall I deny just one more point of personal privilege on the subject of the allocation of the Dr. Jackson?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
This is very important.

19:19.000 --> 19:31.000
Senator Pyming from this morning, and expected a press conference that he would testify under a multiple violence ruling to testify in regard to all of these charges made in 1952.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
I am still even in touch with the committee.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
No one else in any jurisdiction, some are finally in touch with him.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
Now while I think he will be completely irrelevant to the election crisis, the Maryland campaign.

19:44.000 --> 19:52.000
When I say that you see him that way, we can introduce the senator from Missouri to take the stand here and take the oath.

19:52.000 --> 20:03.000
I will, in fact, hear now to request him in detail about all of those left and right, the Maryland campaign, everything else.

20:03.000 --> 20:13.000
Now if the senator from Missouri is suggesting that at some time in the future he's going to take the floor and find a different committee to find out what part is true.

20:14.000 --> 20:33.000
In calling on the adherence what part is perfectly fine and do, Secretary Seedow, not to testify and to call off the investigation coming to see that is such an obvious nod that I don't think a single one of our jury of millions of people wanted to see.

20:34.000 --> 20:54.000
I thought that you would take the oath and testify if I leave myself open to cross examination on all of the mentioned charges, all of the views that were covered and I propose that I come by from five to seven hundred.

20:54.000 --> 21:22.000
I will accept that offer and allow myself to be fully taught the examined before the committee on that, even when I think it's irrelevant, if you will, if you will take the stand and I don't intend to put any of your activities except your activities insofar as a deal, insofar as a deal with your getting the democrat political advisor, Parks Frederick, to advise Secretary Seedow.

21:25.000 --> 21:34.000
To advise Secretary Seedow, not to come and testify on the extent which you are successful, that is all I am concerned about and I'm concerned with issues with the state.

21:34.000 --> 21:47.000
However, if it takes today, if there's five or ten of close examination, above my fan's voice I'll be glad to submit myself to that in order to get up to five from the state, to carry it with the time.

21:47.000 --> 21:56.000
I'm not asking any of the time, I'm not asking any of the time, I'm not asking any of the time.

21:56.000 --> 22:06.000
Nobody is a tenant, no more about how to avoid justifying than the Jewish center from which time.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
And everybody in the United States knows that that fact is true.

22:11.000 --> 22:28.000
If I come before this committee, which today in effect for it is not to hear what this is, it only yesterday, perhaps it be heard, then I certainly think he should go before this committee, that's investigated him.

22:29.000 --> 22:37.000
Because they, the need to the charges of the murderous campaign is ridiculous. I have no interest in whatever in the murderous campaign.

22:37.000 --> 22:48.000
At the same time, that the charges with respect to the senator from which time to were investigated, the charges with respect to the senator from Connecticut, Mr. Bettingward investigated.

22:48.000 --> 22:57.000
And it was a joint report. Now he knows that he just has come before that committee, even though he wasn't staying on it, so many like I am now.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
I'll be very glad to discuss this matter on the floor to start with him, any time that he would like to.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
And now renew my offer, that I will be glad to go, if he will be glad to go.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
Mr. Chairman, there's one more point. Now I'm sure that it's not supposed to be there, so I don't think we're not getting any place where the point is personal.

23:14.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm sure that, of course, if you have the exact date, you'll point to the personal details on an argument with his by running on not in the meeting before it's several days.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Mr. Chairman, I have an important point for the point of order.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
It's a way about hearing questions, but it's a way of like, it's this Mr. Chairman.

23:30.000 --> 23:39.000
That there has been a mistake that's made, Mr. Timingham has said that no one knows better than the senator who has come to avoid testimony.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
So I have now a different plan.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
May it be offered to go on a stand and let him question me about everything.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
I don't care how you're relevant to this.

23:50.000 --> 24:04.000
If he will merely consent, they go on a stand and tell us why and how it happened that number one, he got the political advisor of the Democrats' party,

24:04.000 --> 24:15.000
his guide undercover, the Republican Secretary of the Army, and number two, while our friends think the moon is blue,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
that's on the ivory deck that I'm bringing my birthday.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
You're a huge icon.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And I don't like a lot of people lying for you.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
What's my final statement when he was advising us that he won all the fact, laid on the table,

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
quietly when he was advising the Republican to testify, he kept secret.

24:35.000 --> 24:44.000
He kept secret to fact that Mr. Steven told him the day before the tragic incident or a couple of days before it.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
There's nothing to this and climate is never the last.

24:48.000 --> 24:56.000
But Steven, in getting Mr. Steven's official, those unsounder charges, I know I won't come after climate.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
I think he should be going to do it.

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
When he says that I'm a master at the hour of avoiding being questioned, I have an unrolled treatment for him.

25:05.000 --> 25:13.000
I intend to take you over again and I will let him run as far as he will as he wants to, if he will only want the time.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
And after those few persons and nothing further than this attempt, I'm at the chairman.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
I'll recognize the understanding he won final time on this attempt.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
In any way, in color, it was just speaking to be against the senior election, this is a decision to protect him.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
But I'll recognize that this time, I'm in the chairman.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
Well, I would say that all the respect that it's given, is not an arresting of me.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
But I believe that any American has a right, which both charges like the least,

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
is charged just stated by the Senate with time and amaze.

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
And I want to gain to remind him that he and what he specifically called my step,

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
although I've told him that I have some situation to give respect to the committees.

25:52.000 --> 26:06.000
And the people that he has around him, I'm certainly going to get the opportunity of questioning me, providing the people who may not report about him, but he...

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
...
