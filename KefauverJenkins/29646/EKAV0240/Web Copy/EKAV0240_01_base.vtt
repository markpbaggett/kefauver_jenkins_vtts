WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
But he needed him for that, and that if he wanted to put shine on KT duty, put him on some

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
other day, if he could, because he felt he needed him that day.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Wasn't that the conversation?

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
Lieutenant Blanc, no sir, Mr. Collin on that particular day, never mentioned to many

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
words.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
He did say that what we wanted to do was five a time from Monday to Friday would be okay,

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
as far as he was concerned, but he didn't see why five a time had to pull KT on Sunday.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
Now Lieutenant Blanc said some on the, as I read it from that record, it was directly

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
contradictory.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
No sir, I don't believe it's ten to three at all.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
I had talked to Lieutenant Blanc on a number of occasions.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
He knew that the arranging has been made by Secretary Steven to make shine available to work

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
on these reports and other committee work.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
He knew that that was the only reason for which I or any other member of the staff would have the

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
authority to contact him.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
And I don't think I started off every conversation by saying I refer you to the arrangement of

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
November 6th, the terms of which I or so, he knew sir.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
He knew why I was calling and it's perfectly possible I didn't go into a speech about it on every occasion.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
The only reason I had to go.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I understood your testimony was that you asked to get import committee business.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, there's no doubt about it, Lieutenant Blanc, does not know that.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, was it implied or did you directly ask, I don't remember what I said to him in detail.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
And I said I do know that I'm sure that Lieutenant Blanc, the General Ryan's aide,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
did not have had authority to speak to me about any such thing.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Well, wasn't that a pretty heated conversation between you and Lieutenant Blanc?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
No, it wasn't.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I wouldn't say the same.

01:32.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, now, General Ryan, you recall, testified, you find it on page 3454, 3452.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
He said that Lieutenant Blanc told him of the conversation you recall and that he had with you.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
Within a couple of days, and then Blanc told him that you were extremely excited and upset and very causting in your remarks.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
Now, that General Ryan testimony, I said General Ryan saying what somebody told him that I said.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Now, he reported that that is a kind of blow.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I might have been excited.

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
I might have been excited and said why we've made preparations for him to do the work, why is the arrangement being going back on,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
why can't he do whatever else he has to do when he's supposed to do it?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Why does he have to do it?

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
During the period, which Mr. Stevens has said it's right for this other work, I might have been excited.

02:26.000 --> 02:37.000
Now, following from the TPM to that Lieutenant Blanc on page 30509, that was a follow-up on your conversation on the TPM situation.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
That pursuant to that, Mr. Cohn didn't agree with me by the way.

02:42.000 --> 02:56.000
He said that some people at Fort Dick had been cooperative, but that Colonel Ringler and Lieutenant Miller, and Lieutenant Miller is not captain Miller, the company commander, had made things especially difficult for five of John.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
And that he, Mr. Cohn, had a very long memory and was never going to forget their name.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
Now, what about that testimony of Lieutenant Blanc?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, the end is the same I gave you the last time he had been about a sentence.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm having a sentence.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
No, I'm referring out of a lot of parts of the testimony if you're not going to forget their name.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes, sir. I thought you had to have to be about it.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I certainly had a conversation with Lieutenant Blanc.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I do know that Ringler incident, which has been brought in here, I'm sorry it has.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
I don't know whether Colonel Ringler said those things or whether he didn't say those things.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
And I did mention it.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
I recall at some point or other to Lieutenant Blanc.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It might very well have been a point.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I have no dispute with that, sir.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, but the, I'm saying, are you getting ready for this?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm asking you specifically, you want to know that I say,

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
that you have been making it especially that Colonel Ringler, the regimental commander,

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
and let's call him Captain Miller, who is the company commander,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
had made things especially difficult for private shine.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
And because of that, you were not going to forget their name.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Now, would the veteran crew or the veteran ball be fine with it?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
The veteran would wait to interrupt here.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It's not just that.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
I thought we had found the rule, and all of some people knew it, but it's been proper to ask one with them to evaluate.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
You know, there was a testimony.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I think you can ask them for the phone, how he did.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
But he said, for any of these actions, but I don't think he could ask him to.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
The way he was evaluated, wasn't he?

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
That's why we asked him what was he, and he had made the statement or not.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Yes, I think it was very far as far as him.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
And it's pretty important.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Because quite a point was made, I'll never listen to you as anyone did.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I thought he was asking the places.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And the veteran crew, we ran there, and they went with me after him.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
I thought they were just going for us at the end of the night.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Did you see what the code was?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
You are an officer.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
I don't think I'm going to have to say it's going to be an action you want to be able to call.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I'll finish you when I go around next time.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
You may be waiting out for whatever.

05:10.000 --> 05:23.000
The three simple, Mr. Tom, the Senate's flop has testify that you are not going to forget Colonel Ringler and Captain Miller.

05:23.000 --> 05:35.000
Because you're not going to forget the names because to quote him, you have made things that they have made things especially difficult for private time.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I mean, that's the substance of the time.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes, that's the substance of the time.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
The substance of what I say is that the conversation did take place.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I did talk to him.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.000
I know this undoubtedly on this occasion, he said that it was well, I think he told me that Colonel Ringler makes a difficulty about it.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
I told him that I reported to him that what I had been remarked, I had heard attributed the Colonel Ringler.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Whether I said I had a...

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh, was that applied to Captain Miller?

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I don't think there's anything about that in connection to Captain Miller.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I certainly never heard anything I never met.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
I was in the middle of my life.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Colonel Ringler, I do remember, sir.

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
And, saying I had a long memory, and I forget the names, I don't know whether I said that or not, I do know that I...

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
It put the Ringler name through the Miller routine, the names check.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
What do you guys think?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Not even an investigator.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
Whenever we have information about somebody or something along the lines, what you do is get a...

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
What's known as a quick name check, if there's nothing to it, it shows up in the form of negative.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
If there is something to it, it shows up in the form of positive, and you go on from there.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, you know what I mean?

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Now, you're going to investigate the regimental commander of Sergeant investigation.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Now, if you've spent some unkind words about Sergeant Provincine,

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh, not so, I don't think.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Sorry, situation America, people can't speak out.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
I, for fear of an investigation, let's say, speak their minds.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
I fully agree with you, so he could say anything he wanted about Private China,

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
it was not any comment about Private China, it is that it's me, it's all that.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Uh, Lieutenant Potter?

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
Uh, Lieutenant Cameron, the 400-partig-craft, I wonder if it's, uh, the phone was just...

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Make fear of what's under the question of COVID, and this is the limit.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I didn't give it to him.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Now, that wouldn't be a point of order, it would be kind of that right, and it didn't take it to me.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
So, if some other question is asked, and you may ask him a question on your time, it's in the matter.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
Lieutenant Potter, Mr. Cameron, an answer to the statement made by Mike,

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
which then, in college, he's been identified from Washington, and he's pertinent.

07:42.000 --> 07:50.000
Very well, about the witnesses to be called, I think he made some of the Jackson made a statement

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
that went up for his name, as I mentioned before, and published before the television camera,

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
that that person should have a right to appear before the committee.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
I, I clearly agree, that a person should have a right, and that they're standing committee rules,

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
to appear to his name, as I mentioned in a blog before the matter.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
Now, I think to possibly, the other look-along factor is considering,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
that the public and the three-shortish should not be called,

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
I think that this is what can still, any news like upon the account of the question,

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
I think that the committee should have to say what information he had,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
but this is called electricity, so that they can all work,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
so because his name has been dropped, it's here.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
And, careful that we'll be here for many, many months,

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
I just happened to recall a few names that have been mentioned in the post-desire,

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
and I know that I only have a few of the many, and I'd like to mention that this time,

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
for example, as an Eisenhower, David Shine's Schoepers, General Reaver's lover,

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
Aaron Fowl, a man by name of these, also referred to as Mr. H.

09:14.000 --> 09:24.000
Clark Slipper, by President Nixon, Gary Morgan, Bill Ryger,

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
General Wapu, Harriet Moore, the William Burst, I assume,

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
the big little football team, Bill Remington,

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
Sherman Adams, Lou Berry, Harold Greenville, Bob Jones,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
David Shine's girlfriend,

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
Fateman, who was the, that phone was a little bit,

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Don Green, the Colonel's old secretary of army Stevens,

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
he cut up, the Colonel Ringers, he was about to, Jack Bell,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
our coming news lady, who made great,

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
who we have the 11th top string company,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
and we have the second top string company.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
We have George the Colony, we have Peter's lawfuls,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
I assume they may have the perfect majority of them,

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
but they can't, Elmocker, Mr. Filmker,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
and we have David Shine's father and mother,

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
and we have, we have just a few of the names,

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
that have been mentioned, and I, before the Committee,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
and I'm the one bringing up, when we'd ever conclude,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
because there's one witness come down,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
we find that about four names are dropped,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
and it would be, not only at 7 am,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
but it wouldn't be keeping up with the fifth.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
So I've just mentioned in man, I do think,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
however, that doesn't exist,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
because all of these can show new light upon the controversy

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
in that book.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Senator Fanniken.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Senator Fanniken.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
The board of next senator asks the question,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
while we have the opportunity, let's return to it.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
The whole of these statements, which you have been referring to,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
the state of H.O.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
is finally a 254,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
of the middle of the state,

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
that is meaning you make this comment.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And I quote, for example, when a congressman intervenes

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
to have the overseas order to make your heard in corrects,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
coming in part, Trump and Harry's canceled

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
the no report was issued, on the pope.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
And on the following, the state is making

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
the similar scars that the overseas order

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
that makes it correct for a substantial effort,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
intervention that made Congress.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Are you prepared to testify

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
as to the specific state?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I am, sir, but we'll inject a very big test.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Isn't that thinking any name to any country?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Can that be violating the very finest

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
right to get the test in such a pot?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Well, I would submit to that point

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
for that ruling, Mr. Chairman,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
again, to, if we're trying to verify some

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
of these charges and counter charges,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
if it seems to me that this would be a very relevant

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
matter, may the chair say that his different,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I think, is the trick before he became a member of the commission.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
And we thought it was redeveloping our self-turve

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
that two things you were not going to believe

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
were the rights and the wrongs of the truthfulness,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
or the entertainment of who it was who actually did promote

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
and give certain expectations to make this the right.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
However, by all the functions which I think

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
we might be doing someday, we reassemble

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
it on that happier occasion when the defendant

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
is coming with the chair, he's no longer here.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
So, Mr. Chairman, I'll apply for that to ruling,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
but I wanted to say very satisfatously

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
that I cannot believe that it's counter charge

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
for any member of the country, for inter-beings

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
in behalf of an awful, terrible and elusive man

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
in the farm and foreign, any franchise

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
that they are in service and succeed in preventing

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
his assignments overseas.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
I cannot believe that it's possible

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
under the operations of the armed services.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
And I think the American people have a right to know

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
of whether such preferential treatment is important

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
to any member of the armed services

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
married by the inter-section of some member of the party.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
You're okay with the illegal attendance.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
You have ten minutes.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I would like to say for us to be somewhere from

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
side of all that, the record shows that this

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Fifth Amendment's Communist had orders to go to Yulkham

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Hama when he got to the port of Dubai station.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
His orders were same, and he was given space

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
by duty. The record shows that a Congress

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
was in her lean.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
A chair said out to you please, you're not

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
mentioning the name of the country.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I will not thank you enough.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
And in fairness to the Congresswoman, it's

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
impossible to know how much influence that

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Congresswoman had because the Communist

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
pleasure refused to tell our father it was the

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Congresswoman or some communist who

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
proceeded to get any new daughter's name.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Mr. Cohn, we're talking about Mr. Ringler

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
and I'm afraid that it was left up in the air.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
If this correct, the few reports to me that

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
you heard that Ringler was condemning our

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
exposure of communist preferring who was

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
witch hunt, I told you that time that we

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
couldn't broaden our investigation too much

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
with your busy but to get a quick name

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
of the tech economy which you did.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Yes, I was not so proud of committee, I believe

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
of. The comment allegedly made and they might not

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
have been made as fault, but I don't know,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
he might be the finest man of all that.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
Where direct as well as the activities in

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
exposing and investigating comments.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
In any event the name check had nothing

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
whatsoever to do with this.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
It had nothing whatsoever to say.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
Mr. Rolt asked you a question, he said,

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
by some mysterious magic, you find that

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
a department is written with some of them.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
You see what the duty of the committee to

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
expose us back to you, but they asked you this first

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
question of the number of communists.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
There's one false duty in a proper

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
clock and decree the death of hundreds of

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
thousands of millions of Americans.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That's right. No doubt about it.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
There are one communists in the right place

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
into the work of tens, fifty, a hundred

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
thousand people not in that place.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
So I don't think you and I will agree

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
there's rather aval thinking to see

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
the full way of remain department's riddles

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
of the time that we have a duty to do in.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.920
If we find one of the single

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
better, one of the single communists,

16:16.920 --> 16:18.920
we have a duty to expose us.

16:18.920 --> 16:19.920
Well, that about that.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.920
They're in a way to come in and move

16:21.920 --> 16:22.920
and operate very often.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.920
They will play for only one communist

16:24.920 --> 16:26.920
to make certain spot there is not need

16:26.920 --> 16:29.920
for further duplication to get the same type of information.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.920
No, and further, for another question,

16:32.920 --> 16:34.920
one of the communists who are well-to-one,

16:34.920 --> 16:36.920
are pressing, and said it by some mysterious

16:36.920 --> 16:38.920
magic.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.920
There's nothing mysterious or magic

16:40.920 --> 16:42.920
about where to come and operate

16:42.920 --> 16:44.920
where there's hydrogen sulfate.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.920
No, sir, there is nothing magic

16:48.920 --> 16:50.920
about it. It's due to a deliberate

16:50.920 --> 16:55.920
well-planned, well-thought-out design,

16:55.920 --> 16:58.920
which goes back many years

16:58.920 --> 17:00.920
in which they have been following,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.920
unfortunately, with remarkable success

17:02.920 --> 17:04.920
in many countries throughout the world.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.920
And sometimes they will say five,

17:06.920 --> 17:08.920
ten, fifteen, twenty years

17:08.920 --> 17:10.920
to work them out up to a position

17:10.920 --> 17:13.920
where he can perform a service

17:13.920 --> 17:15.920
for the communists in spirit.

17:15.920 --> 17:16.920
It's happened in our government,

17:16.920 --> 17:18.920
sir, yet.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.920
That's all for the time being.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.920
It's still out here, Tenant.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.920
Armageddon, Claire.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.920
That is calm.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.920
When you were under examination

17:30.920 --> 17:32.920
by Senator Monsullin,

17:32.920 --> 17:34.920
the name Forest came up

17:34.920 --> 17:36.920
to one more time.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.920
You understand, of course,

17:40.920 --> 17:42.920
the misconceptions that said we can't

17:42.920 --> 17:44.920
try that case here.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.920
Yes, sir.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.920
I have the similarity to say

17:48.920 --> 17:50.920
one or two things about it,

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
or ask you one or two things about it

17:52.920 --> 17:54.920
for this reason.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.920
I suspect, Mr. Cohn,

17:56.920 --> 18:00.920
there may be people listening on television,

18:00.920 --> 18:02.920
who think this arrest was right

18:02.920 --> 18:04.920
where in the middle of some radar

18:04.920 --> 18:06.920
laboratory, a fort monument

18:06.920 --> 18:08.920
about which we have talked so much.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.920
Can you see how someone might

18:10.920 --> 18:12.920
guess that impression, Mr. Cohn?

18:12.920 --> 18:14.920
Well, the fence, oh, much that person

18:14.920 --> 18:16.920
is right about the first case.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.920
Well, how carefully they listen to us.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.920
Now, that isn't where

18:20.920 --> 18:22.920
correct was.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.920
No, he was in the dental court.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.920
And he wasn't anywhere near this

18:26.920 --> 18:28.920
delicate installation of fort monument.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.920
Well, actually, he was near it.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.920
There were no hiding he wasn't there.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.920
No, I know, I can say that there are

18:34.920 --> 18:38.920
no triumph between

18:38.920 --> 18:40.920
nature, perhaps, and the fort monument.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.920
And he had no unusual

18:42.920 --> 18:44.920
clearances to let him know

18:44.920 --> 18:46.920
high secrets.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.920
Oh, there was a question about clearance

18:48.920 --> 18:50.920
because I would say that Mr. Wilt,

18:50.920 --> 18:52.920
you're certainly right.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.920
That's a good one.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.920
Because I don't understand much time there.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.920
I just wanted to keep it

18:58.920 --> 19:00.920
clear before the country

19:00.920 --> 19:02.920
that he wasn't sitting right

19:02.920 --> 19:04.920
where in the middle of fort monument

19:04.920 --> 19:06.920
that was what we have talked about.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.920
He was not a fort monument.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.920
And he was how he made

19:10.920 --> 19:12.920
the happenance of the cemetery

19:12.920 --> 19:14.920
as crystal clear, won't you?

19:14.920 --> 19:16.920
And secondly, he was a dentist, wasn't he?

19:16.920 --> 19:18.920
Yes, sir.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.920
And he was a dentist at a point

19:20.920 --> 19:22.920
when he was a patient

19:22.920 --> 19:24.920
that's a camp tumor, New Jersey.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.920
Well, I understood and I have been

19:26.920 --> 19:28.920
this informed there that that was

19:28.920 --> 19:30.920
a stadium camp or overseas.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.920
Well, if I'm wrong, that's what it is.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.920
You might be right.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.920
Anyhow, is that the way it is?

19:36.920 --> 19:38.920
It's like that.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.920
Anywhere, as I have said, is that right?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.920
Yes, he was.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.920
Now I have only

19:44.920 --> 19:46.920
I don't minimize the importance of the forest case.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.920
I don't even care to stare at myself.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.920
Don't misunderstand me or I don't like

19:50.920 --> 19:52.920
us commoners, even if he's

19:52.920 --> 19:54.920
a dentist here. Don't misunderstand me.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.920
But I do want to get the guy

19:56.920 --> 19:58.920
imperfective.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.920
Now let's, brother, could I say one more

20:00.920 --> 20:04.920
saintly humorous thing about him

20:04.920 --> 20:06.920
if it's possible that they are saintly humorous thing about it?

20:06.920 --> 20:08.920
I certainly won't stop this.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.920
Wherever there is the commoners,

20:10.920 --> 20:12.920
the fear of often is that they may

20:12.920 --> 20:16.920
indoctrinate other soldiers or other people.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.920
That's right, isn't it? That's one of them.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.920
That's one of the things.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.920
Now, whatever you say about

20:22.920 --> 20:26.920
indoctrinating other people,

20:28.920 --> 20:30.920
it wasn't the two happy

20:30.920 --> 20:34.920
away.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.920
The stride has drilled in the people

20:36.920 --> 20:40.920
with a dentist drill and an 18-by-tuck wood.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.920
It might be an effective way to

20:44.920 --> 20:46.920
have the guy as a

20:46.920 --> 20:48.920
cancer very well, if he's too

20:48.920 --> 20:50.920
hurt.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.920
If that rightness is cold,

20:52.920 --> 20:54.920
let's pass this path.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.920
Well, Mr. Loz, the plot is a fair

20:56.920 --> 20:58.920
to say it's a fair. You've got this situation.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.920
You have a man with an open record as they

21:00.920 --> 21:02.920
call. I'm not meant to call. We understand this.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.920
Forrest is a no-good time of my own.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.920
No, I don't need to care about you.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.920
That's the question you should give me

21:08.920 --> 21:10.920
a chance at. Well, I'll be sure.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.920
No, I'm not. I'll be sure.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.920
The stride is hearing.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.920
It is the importance of the

21:16.920 --> 21:18.920
forrest case to me. Number one, you are

21:18.920 --> 21:20.920
arriving. That's the importance of the

21:20.920 --> 21:22.920
forrest case. Well, sure. If that's the

21:22.920 --> 21:24.920
number of questions, if you give me a chance,

21:24.920 --> 21:26.920
I'll try to keep it real.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.920
No, I want to run this if I can.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.920
If there's some question that you haven't had a

21:30.920 --> 21:32.920
chance to answer, I'll try to ask it over.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.920
But what I'm only, what this is only what I'm saying is,

21:34.920 --> 21:36.920
that if you want it,

21:36.920 --> 21:38.920
you can check your young soldier and make a

21:38.920 --> 21:40.920
commoners out of him.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.920
He can't care.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.920
Is it much of a pass, isn't it?

21:44.920 --> 21:46.920
It's not right.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.920
Well, the answer's off.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.920
It is. It's not an answer.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.160
I'm not going to say that, but you asked

21:53.160 --> 21:54.920
to answer, you won't get much out of it.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.920
He's obviously the frontman with it again.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.920
When he takes the deep breath, I only want you

21:58.920 --> 22:00.920
after no.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.920
One pass at him.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.920
And the dead is a scare.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.920
It is very dangerous to me.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.920
And so I'll just ask you a number of

22:08.920 --> 22:10.920
questions, which I haven't answered.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.920
If I can say a few sentences, I can probably give you a question.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.920
No, let's just say one sentence.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.920
Let's take this one.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.920
No, he wants to make a speech.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
I've got a simple question.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.920
I'm going to say, well, number one,

22:22.920 --> 22:24.920
we shouldn't be talking about the correct case at all.

22:24.920 --> 22:25.920
Right.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.920
There is, given you the opportunity to do so, you can simple

22:27.920 --> 22:30.920
justice when you ask a wister to clarify a question about it.

22:30.920 --> 22:34.920
And in a wister, every time, it isn't right the way to see the wister

22:34.920 --> 22:36.920
and the senatorial committee.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.920
If you want to ask him the question, which I don't think you should ask.

22:39.920 --> 22:40.920
And I'm not stopping, right?

22:40.920 --> 22:42.920
Really, you should give the answer one of the six.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.920
So I have the question, right?

22:44.920 --> 22:46.920
The last question.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.920
Well, this is one of the reasons.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.920
I have a question.

22:50.920 --> 22:54.920
I could not discuss anything relative to the state of the major

22:54.920 --> 22:57.920
perit, and now you permit others to discuss it.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.920
What is the distinction?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.920
Well, I think the distinction is this.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
I think Mr. Walsh was in the interest of the fact that it might

23:03.920 --> 23:04.920
be a question.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.920
Mr. David Peresse is not a quite man.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.920
That is not just a minute, Mr. Walsh.

23:08.920 --> 23:09.920
Now you can have the new chair.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.920
That you can't do.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
I know.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.920
I'm sorry.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.920
I just have wonderful and move on from Peresse.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
I know that.

23:16.920 --> 23:17.920
But we're really in simple justice.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.920
Give the witness a chance to answer the question about the new red letter.

23:20.920 --> 23:21.920
The report.

23:21.920 --> 23:22.920
All right.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.920
Please be quiet, Mr. Dupin.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.920
I'll be equally glad to waver or look forward to a few ways, Mr. Dupin.

23:29.920 --> 23:30.920
I don't know.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.920
I don't even have to have the question said.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
But I can answer the question.

23:33.920 --> 23:34.920
No, that's fine.

23:34.920 --> 23:35.920
The question.

23:35.920 --> 23:36.920
No, that's fine.

23:36.920 --> 23:37.920
The question.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.920
We'll even not take it out of the time.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.920
I'm the only happiest author.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.920
We have to determine there are serious questions.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.920
I think the witness remembers them.

23:45.920 --> 23:46.920
I do.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.920
Mr. Walsh can probably have an image.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.920
The last question was, so it peeled before the last.

23:49.920 --> 23:50.920
I couldn't get much in on it.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.920
Well, maybe I didn't want to get too much in it.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.920
Oh, and then I just wanted to straighten the answer.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.920
The reporter asked me to ask me if I could have a question.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.920
I'm sorry.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.920
I'll write the answer to the answer.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.920
The reporter asked me to read the question.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.920
I'm not really with this, my answer is.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.920
That's what I'm saying to you.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.920
That if you want to catch a young soldier and make a communist out of him,

24:11.920 --> 24:15.920
one task at him in a death's chair isn't much of a past, is it?

24:15.920 --> 24:16.920
Isn't that right?

24:16.920 --> 24:18.920
I can't do answer that question, Mr. Walsh.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.920
I'll give him a chance with the world.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.920
Yeah, but I say, can he answer it twice?

24:22.920 --> 24:23.920
We'll never find out.

24:23.920 --> 24:24.920
Let's give him a chance.

24:24.920 --> 24:25.920
Try.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.920
Go ahead, Mr. Walsh.

24:27.920 --> 24:36.920
Sir, your question about recruiting young soldiers and the way in which it would be done,

24:36.920 --> 24:38.920
I can only say this to you.

24:38.920 --> 24:45.920
Major Perez was a man with an open communist record, and decided that open communist record,

24:45.920 --> 24:50.920
which should have been well known to any alert intelligence people in the army.

24:50.920 --> 24:55.920
He was commissioned a captain, which gave him a rank as a commissioned officer.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.920
As to that, he claimed to flip the amendment to the army.

24:58.920 --> 25:03.920
In spite of that, they promoted him to be a major, and they gave him other preferential troops,

25:03.920 --> 25:10.920
being a major, and a commissioned officer and in contact as an officer of some rank,

25:10.920 --> 25:21.920
which soldiers working under my was safety, you there had a situation which was susceptible to the recruitment of people serving there,

25:21.920 --> 25:26.920
who did not have his rank and who were soldiers into the body.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.920
I do not observe that when we ask him those very questions, he invoked the fifth amendment,

25:30.920 --> 25:41.920
and refused to tell us whether he was using his rank in the army and his post to recruit soldiers into the communist movement.

25:41.920 --> 25:46.920
And we think the case, how, and we think they're finally, my way of things on it,

25:46.920 --> 25:54.920
we think that the mechanism of how it is possible for a man to get a commission in the army and then get a promotion,

25:54.920 --> 25:59.920
to fight an open communist record, and to fight the fight he claims the fifth amendment,

25:59.920 --> 26:04.920
must leave this committee to inquire who in the army knowing that a man has a communist record,

26:04.920 --> 26:07.920
would promote him to the rank of major.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.920
We've talked about with an extremely important and relevant thing to us,

26:10.920 --> 26:13.920
and not with the importance of the forerstate you are right Mr. Wells,

26:13.920 --> 26:19.920
for as it not work at Barnmouth, and as far as I know, he had no connection with Fortmont.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.920
Well, the time will be resumed and Mr. Wells may continue.

26:22.920 --> 26:27.920
Thanks for the last few words. Just one other question you have to call.

26:27.920 --> 26:34.920
If you were a lawyer in the carpool and got the answer, you just gave me an answer to the question I asked you.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.920
Would you move this right? The answer is irresistible.

26:37.920 --> 26:42.920
I would have objected to the question, sir, and I would have objected to the affair to give the witness an answer.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.920
That the right to answer.

26:44.920 --> 26:48.920
Now, one other thing, we saw in the preliminary,

26:48.920 --> 26:53.920
and this I think we've already touched somewhat, it can quickly agree on.

26:53.920 --> 27:00.920
One other constitutional issue that is in the field here and eliminated,

27:00.920 --> 27:05.920
is the question of what your committee or any similar committee has the right to do

27:05.920 --> 27:10.920
in respect to calling members of Loyalty Force and reviewing their actions.

27:10.920 --> 27:15.920
And you meant to call and realize that you and I have a different opinion on that,

27:15.920 --> 27:17.920
and the right to differ, don't we? I do so.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.920
And it's a very important question, isn't it? It's important, sir.

27:21.920 --> 27:28.920
Now, Mr. Cohn, I have a little section here in long hand of my thoughts and examination of you

27:28.920 --> 27:34.920
before we come to some tougher thing, which has, I think, a very pleasant heavy.

27:35.920 --> 27:41.920
It's got the heading, let's make the country feel a little better, and see if you can't help.

27:41.920 --> 27:48.920
I'll begin with this. Have you, sometimes, in this room, been a little dismayed as I have,

27:48.920 --> 27:54.920
but the charges and counter charges that have been long around here,

27:54.920 --> 27:59.920
or does it all sound all right to you? I think it's made by the whole thing, sir. Thank you.

28:00.920 --> 28:11.920
In that dismay, or to a lay that dismay, what you and I care, and I think some of the country shares,

28:11.920 --> 28:17.920
would you help me say to the country, as I would like to have you help me,

28:17.920 --> 28:25.920
that our government is really in the hands of patriotic men, and sure it is for us.

28:26.920 --> 28:31.920
And it's not, Mr. Cohn, in the hands of the traitors, as I'm sure it is not.

28:32.920 --> 28:39.920
Would you help me say to our country, and I think they'd like to hear you and me join in saying

28:40.920 --> 28:52.920
that our fighting forces on land and in the air and on the sea are wonderful today as they were in World War I.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.920
But the world there is. Yes, could you mind yesterday? Absolutely, no.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.920
It's not about it. We've made it crisply.

28:59.920 --> 29:04.920
Right. And as wonderful as they were in World War II.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.920
Yes, sir. And as wonderful as they were in the Korean conflict.

29:09.920 --> 29:17.920
Absolutely. And when you join me in saying that our armed forces, the army included,

29:18.920 --> 29:22.920
recognizes all over the somewhat frightening thing to say.

29:22.920 --> 29:31.920
We used to try to skirt it, but the principles and frightening enemies are the commoners.

29:31.920 --> 29:40.920
Yes, sir. And that our first line of defense is our armed forces.

29:40.920 --> 29:44.920
That's clear. Certainly is one of the most important.

29:44.920 --> 29:50.920
And Mr. Cohn, in spite of all of this may any of us may have felt in this room,

29:50.920 --> 29:57.920
or that it may that the country may have felt that all the wrangling with the past has taken place here.

29:58.920 --> 30:05.920
The country and particular of the mothers and fathers of the boys in service may rest easy.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.920
It's a beautiful army, Navy, and Air Force, isn't it?

30:10.920 --> 30:14.920
Certainly. And it's ready to fight ominous the war, isn't it?

30:14.920 --> 30:18.920
No doubt about it. And ready to fight ominous at home.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
Yes. Are you talking about it, sir?

30:20.920 --> 30:21.920
Yes.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.920
Right, Mr. Dickens.

30:23.920 --> 30:30.920
Mr. World War II, we're working in this area of poverty, which is wonderful.

30:30.920 --> 30:34.920
I would like to have you join me if you would now.

30:34.920 --> 30:41.920
We are showing the public about our executive station this morning, because we're not reporting.
