WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:45.780
From your center of development in the Pacific Charlemagne, on hand, the greatest inter-extra-steep

00:45.780 --> 00:49.380
forward on the activities of the past week in our nation's capital.

00:49.380 --> 00:53.540
The first part of the week is to vote into much discussion about the Roman party.

00:53.540 --> 00:58.780
At this time, it wasn't about the chargers of the upper-Johmins party, and the communist

00:58.780 --> 01:08.780
Republic.

01:08.780 --> 01:15.400
Everyone would like to follow this order in order to destroy this particular miles, and

01:15.400 --> 01:18.900
make the decision of America's stated passed on.

01:18.900 --> 01:22.900
President Truman is on hand to call out to you first, please.

01:22.900 --> 01:28.580
He and his colleagues are prepared, and Kennedy is going to keep the free to put an afternoon

01:28.580 --> 01:30.580
moving all of these.

01:30.580 --> 01:33.740
Yes, John, there are been about 20-30s out of the state.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.740
I've got a number of Congressmen.

01:35.740 --> 01:39.240
And this was the first time that I had an opportunity to attend this.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.920
Although I do like baseball very much, it's quite a sight to see by thousands of

01:43.920 --> 01:48.920
officers and the kind of old funny night watching the park with it.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.920
Glad and out of the 30s, the race will go in.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.920
31,000 persons to the Japanese pension either national or civil states.

01:56.920 --> 02:02.920
And it's five-all three-fold fans everywhere watching the night on a very good focus.

02:02.920 --> 02:07.920
I know that three of us are eating this, eating this, eating this.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.920
I like my face.

02:09.920 --> 02:14.920
I've got a couple of hours to look at these with a tap on first, so I never have to be in the

02:14.920 --> 02:15.920
NBA.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.920
And probably I'll do it in a week, we have to kind of see the history here in one.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.920
Many were attending the national possession of the daughters of the American Revolution.

02:23.920 --> 02:28.920
I think that we had about a hundred, kind of three, kind of three, one of the year for

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
the children.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.920
Other studying at the end, the intentions of the American appreciation of these people are

02:35.920 --> 02:36.920
very important.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.920
And we had a type of usual number of high schools using Mexico for watching this.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.920
That's five-thirds of their graduate.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.920
One type of school has to eat, eating that, and that's how it really is.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.920
There is one of the half-taughts in the young folks who is definitely elevators inside the

02:52.920 --> 02:56.920
Washington Monument, which is five-hundred and sixty-five feet high.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.920
Take the one member from the land you have to live in, elevators.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.920
The lady at that time is on the way back down, the elevated dam, about the forty-eighths

03:04.920 --> 03:05.920
of the bottom.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.920
Let the dress be squadred, please, let's pack the one and more thing, please.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.920
Let's see if we can start it down in nine minutes, any steps to go.

03:14.920 --> 03:20.920
The way down is the next high, this is the time that we see the ground,

03:20.920 --> 03:25.920
if we start it from the bottom, and large mothons, like that of the long events.

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
We eat five-hundred of the tights.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.920
Well, unfortunately, none of the ladies suffered any elevators like the ground.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.920
They were taken to a local hospital who far had checked up on the relief.

03:34.920 --> 03:39.920
We checked up on them, and all the five-hundreds that they had to stay in nothing more than a good scare.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.920
Let me say a good connection, and I think it's one of the finest things that the people

03:44.920 --> 03:49.920
have done for regulating high school students, maybe just to wash them,

03:49.920 --> 03:53.920
and just to do the nation's type of rules, do you have time and work.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.920
I'm going to say all of the things that they have been reading from us about it,

03:56.920 --> 03:58.920
is the two most powerful years.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.920
I think the government's 30 years broiled our fifth up year too.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.920
First, I'm just thinking of being watching the money level there.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.920
I'm going to continue my stuff.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.920
I think we have to reassure our Kennedy-Bites years today,

04:11.920 --> 04:14.920
which is just a great part of how you do things that are best.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.920
I didn't use that these minutes, and it's close.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.920
Well, see the finish pass, you're not going to continue gold on the word of the night.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.920
The bill was to prohibit the children of the Scottish Games and the New State Commerce.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.920
I just tried and found what the New State's proposal that the nation has made to last time,

04:29.920 --> 04:32.920
since it's a new education time.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.920
Well, I was very afraid that this important source of the National Crime Secretary's plan

04:36.920 --> 04:38.920
has been sent after by Congress.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.920
These don't fall one-on-one bandits.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.920
Just to stop the color back, $2 billion dollars every year.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.920
Prevention and management of the state commerce,

04:47.920 --> 04:51.920
and after the new rule, a long way for shutting off as part of the source

04:51.920 --> 04:54.920
of the big gamblers' revenue.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.920
And I can't have a list of tax rates for these people and legalize these.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.920
Well, I feel it's advised that if the governor of the state,

05:01.920 --> 05:05.920
whether it's legalized gambling, certifies that it's not a fact,

05:05.920 --> 05:10.920
that these devices may move and everything commerce and that state should have come in.

05:10.920 --> 05:15.920
The water, as you know, has big glass gambling legalized for everything.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.920
Maryland, for example, has local options on its own, by faith.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.920
And this bill can act in only the active education.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.920
No, hearing how this government's getting it,

05:25.920 --> 05:29.920
but in fact, it's possible that it's termed the administration

05:29.920 --> 05:31.920
and foreign commerce committee.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.920
And so that you think the bill may be unprofitable.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.920
And I think the bill is spent to find what we thought one-on-hand is

05:38.920 --> 05:39.920
to do in the legal system.

05:39.920 --> 05:40.920
This is not a baseline.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.920
No, the bill is not to refer to any government's advice.

05:44.920 --> 05:49.920
And I have to admit it by contrast to the fact that the force may hold it on its own.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.920
You know, there are many types of gambling devices.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.920
Many devices just do not see off, maybe use the gambling.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.920
And the matter of fact, as the police call it,

05:58.920 --> 06:00.920
the compound which we have gambling device,

06:00.920 --> 06:03.920
they use the gambling for me.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.920
The government's going to have different definitions of gambling devices.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.920
And that frankly will be difficult to find with the outlawed improvement of gambling

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
and the virus and the fake commerce.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.920
But some of the police have law making this a food-divide vehicle.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.920
So long after the nut-free government's purchase,

06:20.920 --> 06:22.920
and I have had it the past few days,

06:22.920 --> 06:25.920
the next few years, that's been moving.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.920
So while I was telling the government that there's been only a small part of the thing that we have buy food,

06:30.920 --> 06:34.920
the nationwide community is minimum-faring about this.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.920
Gambling is just one of the,

06:36.920 --> 06:39.920
and gambling devices, provide just one of these

06:39.920 --> 06:42.920
are the most beautiful gambling.

06:42.920 --> 06:46.920
Even if those gambling devices are not the only big betting system,

06:46.920 --> 06:48.920
a matter of fact, I do very well,

06:48.920 --> 06:51.920
I don't think November of 1949,

06:51.920 --> 06:55.920
I got up to be open to be able to talk to the government

06:55.920 --> 06:58.920
and to take public profit from gambling,

06:58.920 --> 07:00.920
the government is not shut.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.920
And I thought it would be better to have them that they see us afford 50 phones

07:04.920 --> 07:08.920
about the deal with the business market.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.920
But here's three of these,

07:10.920 --> 07:13.920
and the kind of thing that I know that you are afraid to make them wild,

07:13.920 --> 07:16.920
and he's trying to get them out of the big box,

07:16.920 --> 07:18.920
not be able to talk to the government,

07:18.920 --> 07:20.920
just because you have no evidence to be a good victim,

07:20.920 --> 07:24.920
make them wild, and get it back in the end of the fine and draw.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.920
So I've got to have to go through the pocket,

07:26.920 --> 07:28.920
talk about the pocket,

07:28.920 --> 07:30.920
talk about the pocket,

07:30.920 --> 07:32.920
talk about the other day,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.920
talk about the rate of the other day.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.920
And I think that it's not just the same age that you can't have any suspect of,

07:38.920 --> 07:42.920
just about every organization that is looking to the situation,

07:42.920 --> 07:44.920
that doesn't carry out a national firm,

07:44.920 --> 07:46.920
the rain or rain,

07:46.920 --> 07:48.920
that's for Thomas Dorx,

07:48.920 --> 07:51.920
that is how they can ask the government to take it and draw.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.920
And he's been up to make it reliable that the American people

07:54.920 --> 07:59.920
are putting up with about $40,000 every year just for gambling,

07:59.920 --> 08:02.920
and he's been going through the hand to be gambling.

08:02.920 --> 08:06.920
And I recommend this national budget in $42,000 a year,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.920
only about the money,

08:08.920 --> 08:10.920
about the gambling state.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.920
I think the situation is with that a little looking at it.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.920
So there are those things that you can keep on,

08:16.920 --> 08:20.920
who will argue that you, that the American people want to get,

08:20.920 --> 08:24.920
that you can't legislate more than you're talking on that.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.920
But I do know that I am all for each individual,

08:27.920 --> 08:30.920
and I'm all for the private sector.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.920
I'm all for the private sector.

08:33.920 --> 08:35.920
But first of all, the gambling and the government,

08:35.920 --> 08:37.920
I'm all for the private sector.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.920
I think it's the same age that you can get.

08:40.920 --> 08:44.920
But when gambling and crime is the point that I've seen

08:44.920 --> 08:47.920
from the government, I've seen from the government.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.920
I say that we all just got out of time.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.920
We have content from the people in the local government

08:52.920 --> 08:54.920
from all over the parts of America.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.920
The criminals are getting so rich and so powerful

08:57.920 --> 09:00.920
that they're about to become bigger than our local government.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.920
And that must be the case.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.920
One of the main things that I think is my investigation

09:05.920 --> 09:08.920
for people to explore and have our overnight time

09:08.920 --> 09:11.920
is going to corrupt the law enforcement.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
That is interesting about the latest criminals

09:13.920 --> 09:15.920
and operate wide openies.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.920
And that's how the people of the law,

09:17.920 --> 09:19.920
the public sector must be all the way.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.920
Then I think the East and East,

09:21.920 --> 09:23.920
and the East and East,

09:23.920 --> 09:25.920
that they can really appreciate the magnitude

09:25.920 --> 09:27.920
of criminal operation in this country.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.920
So I've been talking about that to that in this time.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.920
I'm still advocating my great-grandson

09:31.920 --> 09:32.920
to the next problem.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.920
After the denigrate,

09:34.920 --> 09:36.920
there's a pretty much an effort to take.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.920
Having done in public life for a dozen years,

09:38.920 --> 09:41.920
I've kept up to the world with public intent.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.920
A commission of points by one of my states,

09:43.920 --> 09:45.920
the Spanish parliament,

09:45.920 --> 09:46.920
to look into the time,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.920
the district, and the district,

10:18.920 --> 10:20.920
and the public.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.920
Well, that's a wonderful thing.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.920
I mean, I'm not sure if it's going to work.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.920
But I know it's coming along.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.920
I'm pretty hopeful that there are things

10:28.920 --> 10:30.920
about the time it's corrupt,

10:30.920 --> 10:32.920
that's the 30th country.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.920
The country will authorize the inductive case

10:34.920 --> 10:36.920
for another country work.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.920
In the air, this is the only investigation site

10:39.920 --> 10:41.920
you have to call negative Illinois.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.920
So that's the case for natural gas,

10:44.920 --> 10:46.920
the only thing that's done.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.920
I'm a friend of the human.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.920
You see, I'm a 30th country.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.920
Well, I can know a night in the first

10:52.920 --> 10:54.920
thousand years of this work,

10:54.920 --> 10:56.920
and I think I'll do that.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.920
We must have seen lots of things on my one-time,

10:58.920 --> 11:00.920
I think the first one,

11:00.920 --> 11:02.920
a little bit of a friend.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.920
I think the future's primary group,

11:04.920 --> 11:06.920
the future and many others.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.920
On the other side, I think the man by mail

11:08.920 --> 11:10.920
is about 18, 18th-century.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.920
I think that in the very first few people

11:12.920 --> 11:14.920
in my group,

11:14.920 --> 11:16.920
the future's gas list.

11:16.920 --> 11:20.920
Now, since the situation is very stunning,

11:20.920 --> 11:22.920
I have good friends with kind of people

11:22.920 --> 11:24.920
who are interested in the future.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.920
And I just like to fight the

11:26.920 --> 11:28.920
villain with my friends,

11:28.920 --> 11:30.920
and if the villain is not in the section,

11:30.920 --> 11:32.920
that is the third.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
We've got a half-time rape

11:33.920 --> 11:35.920
and another is the film of the film.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.920
So at the same time,

11:37.920 --> 11:38.920
at one time,

11:38.920 --> 11:40.920
there's nothing that the past is going to do.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.920
We'll have to go to an unjust,

11:42.920 --> 11:44.920
not be a master's tip.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.920
I don't know, just the richness

11:46.920 --> 11:48.920
of many of the top-all

11:48.920 --> 11:50.920
in the country that's good at public.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.920
And having seen the future

11:52.920 --> 11:54.920
about it, I've asked you up to

11:54.920 --> 11:56.920
an author to do an actual act of

11:56.920 --> 11:58.920
an overlay that I remember

11:58.920 --> 12:00.920
to do a few things.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.920
You and the record label

12:02.920 --> 12:03.920
go on.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.920
Remember to keep the communication

12:05.920 --> 12:07.920
from the food.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.920
Well, that's about the record show.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.920
It's about a separate record

12:11.920 --> 12:13.920
that's played in the

12:13.920 --> 12:15.920
political and political

12:15.920 --> 12:16.920
exists.

12:16.920 --> 12:17.920
I remember I thought

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
it was right under the

12:19.920 --> 12:20.920
30th line.

12:20.920 --> 12:21.920
And I'm still old,

12:21.920 --> 12:22.920
not quite.

12:22.920 --> 12:23.920
I'm thinking,

12:23.920 --> 12:25.920
that's what they would like.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.920
That's what I'm thinking.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.920
It's about to be alive.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.920
I think I'm happy to continue.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.920
And I think I would keep

12:32.920 --> 12:34.920
that up to the 30th line.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.920
I'm not going to be that

12:36.920 --> 12:38.920
very clever.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.920
I'm not going to be that

12:40.920 --> 12:41.920
Channel director.

12:41.920 --> 12:42.920
There were so many

12:42.920 --> 12:43.920
members that decided not to

12:43.920 --> 12:44.920
call these words big nights.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.920
And I think that's the only

12:46.920 --> 12:47.920
reason I'm trying.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.920
It ain't right, Paul,

12:48.920 --> 12:49.920
and you think it says

12:49.920 --> 12:51.920
when you are good enough?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.920
With the first,

12:53.920 --> 12:54.920
that's the right style every

12:54.920 --> 12:55.920
way for the first要

12:55.920 --> 12:57.920
the first liquid force

12:57.920 --> 12:59.920
or so making it a

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
b濝, slowly

13:00.920 --> 13:02.740
dig into the whole type of

13:02.740 --> 13:03.740
瑞.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.740
Right into the blue part.

13:05.740 --> 13:06.760
Good morning, Francis.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.700
Hello,gun, I am your

13:09.700 --> 13:10.700
