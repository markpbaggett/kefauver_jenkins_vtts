WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
He is a native Washingtonian. He has a long and highly successful career as a political writer and newspaper editor,

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
as assistant to the president of the telephone company, which did he took from to Alaska

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
with a late president party, as publicist and paying for several presidential inaugurations,

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
as a many prohibition campaign. More recently, Mr. government has devoted his time to radio commentating.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
Back in 1938 and 1939, he was heard on the southern shagant of NBC, and his president featured

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
from Washington on both NBC, Radio and NBC television. May I say answer then, please,

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
that when I first came to Congress in 1939, I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Earl Godwin,

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
and he is a great friend for any member of Congress to help. He not only knows his business,

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
but he is always willing to give kindly advice to young brothers and brothers.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Mr. government has the great pleasure to be interviewed by you, and I should be glad to have you asked me

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
whatever question you take is public is interested in, whatever question you will. This is completely unrehearse.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
The sound of my overtlement in generosity and of your introduction, I must say.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
I thought I would come here and say to the feet of wisdom and the earth and I attend to it,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
and I am going to do this for just about, you know, this interview by a saying,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
and I spent the morning chopping wood off my plate on the fire. We're out of coal.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Now you know, that leads into this coal strike, which is not only a universal,

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
and it's interesting, but entirely personal. You are the lawmaker,

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
and they have to act upon some drastic measure, might be in a position to let me ask you question,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
what do you think, and what's going to happen?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Mr. government, I'm glad to know that you've been cutting wood too,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
because they've been building a house out next to where we live,

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
and I've been spending some Saturday afternoon, sewing up wood.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
We have a pretty good supply and preparation for this situation.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Of course there's coal strike as we all know, and the coal situation is one of the most difficult problems

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
that we've had in a long, long time, and it's been a recurring one.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
It goes a lot of saying that something must be done to wake the young taxi immediately,

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
and the people can't always stop ringing, cannot wait long.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
They're taking off of trains, and they're laying off of people in plants and fast-roos,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
which are dependent upon coal, and simply cannot go on.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Personally, I cannot criticize the decision of Judge Keach,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
which Federal Judge District Judge, when he will,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
is extremely contemptuous.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
Because, very frankly, it seems that they have found a way of getting around the last provision

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
for action of the task partly while that is the executive procedure.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I'm just going to start with Justice Department,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
and conference with members of the executive committee,

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
on the executive court of appeals, and on Judge Keach and on the executive committee.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
The most destruction of the court of appeals early next week,

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
and if that review doesn't change the ruling of Judge Keach,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
and it's where the United Man Works Groups are in contempt,

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
and after going back to work, then I see only one thing that can be done,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
and I'll use for the process of legislation,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
and then the process of the disease and after it's coal mass.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I don't like that way of doing business,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
because I hate to see it get in the habit of seeping industries

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
in order to have operation go on, but the public emphasis of course,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
permage in this case.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
That's pretty true. I was very much interested in sounding to read this lying in interview,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
which is out of office, crock,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
but in our times, I am John Lewis, and in the interview,

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Lewis said that there never had been a coal strike,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
which impaled the nation, or brought it to a state of crisis.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
But I notice in all the angry, I remember whenever,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
he got a coal, he got a wood pile in his own backyard.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
So that might give you some thought on it.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
I was threatened at the first news conference yesterday in our other occasions,

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
where he has shown considerable disdaste,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
exactly what you do for grabbing an industry.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
And I believe that he would not seize any industry,

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
even if he has in here power, which might be a disputed point.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Unless he has a direct or specific authority of customer,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I don't know if you have any particular point,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
but I would like to join his next two degrees,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
to present him with a quick phrase that something is going to break in the matter.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
I know that I was attending a committee hearing on my behalf of John Spiels,

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
who was in post-war spending,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
and that was about a situation starting with a situation.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
He left the meeting very early,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
saying that he was going down and he quit Mr. Lewis and others,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
and then attempt to find what's up to get this strike subtle.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
But we never heard any news from that effort, is it?

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
No, I'm not the most confident to get one of the coal burns on the outside,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
I am so much more over-cured in this question.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
I noticed that there are a bit of members of the Senate

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
and a congressman said that they agreed that the only way to handle a matter

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
unless something goes back in a few days is to pass your job,

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
legislations, and I think the miners should work for the government.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
I think they were too, and do you see any other way that this could be done?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
And do you have a...

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Not unless they suddenly come, not unless they both suddenly come to an agreement

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
and sign a contract, and I think you're going to agree with that too.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Yes, we are.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
That's right.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
I was another two, over two, not exactly as dramatic in its news presentation.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
And that's natural gas, and we're getting to depend more and more.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
And there's a natural gas legislation in the Senate,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
which I can propose the men must remove,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
control, the government, federal power commission.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Of course, it's a little gas production in Tennessee,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
but I'll bet you're using a lot of it.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
What do you think of that? Tell us about it.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Well, Mr. Governor, we are very much interested in natural gas,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
and kind of stay particularly from the consumers viewpoint.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
Only recently, in Italy, our company has done extremely gas lines

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
so as to bring service to more and more cities and more and more people.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And particularly, indeed, of the coal shortage,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
these people are interested in seeing that they got natural gas,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
and they get at a reasonable rate.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Our West Tennessee is not the natural gas for a long, long time,

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
where it's the fuel for many, many homes and many factories.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
We do not produce much natural gas.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
There's a little in parts of middle and east Tennessee,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
but Tennessee is largely a producer state.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, the situation that's happened in connection with the President's legislation

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
is that the federal power commission here in Washington

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
has decided that when gas is sold for interstate commerce,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
that they have entered a great pipeline,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
that they have a right to regulate the charge for natural gas.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
That is, the company has sent it as a public matter, public fuel,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
and those interstate commerce that they have a right to see

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
that no company makes more than a reasonable profit,

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
and that the consumer of natural gas is not charged too much.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Also, at the state, there's another right to impose a great proxy

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
upon natural gas when it shifts from one state to another.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
That's the President's status of the matter.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Now, this legislation has been proposed by Senator Kerr

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
and he is a great friend of mine from Oklahoma,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Senator Lyndon Johnson from Texas.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Of course, in those states, they produce a lot of natural gas

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
as to the matter, but only the natural.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
The amendment says they have to the natural gas act simply provides

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
that the federal power commission has to end the company's

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
should now have a right to impose restrictions on the price

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
and that they could not prevent their states from imposing a tax

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
on natural gas going out of the state.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
But 85% of the gas of transmissions are owned by independent companies.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
So, all of those who are asking for this legislation,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
this, although it has the House of Representatives

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
and is coming up in the United States Senate,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
sometimes we got to take it and from the viewpoint of the consumer,

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
certainly they would want natural gas cheaply as possible.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
First, we want the companies like the reasonable profit,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
which I think they've been doing.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
You are not sure at all on the side of the consumer,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
but you're not sure.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
You know you've got to do it right.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
That's right.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Now, before we end it with time,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
I just want to tell you, I want to add a smokey sometimes.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I hope to see you there.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
You're telling me that you're fine with that.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
You're just a punitive state of smokey.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Here's a hearing started, boy.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
You have a several, so this has got these freightways on your mind

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
and have a great place in the cost of living.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
There's a rather difficult thing going on

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
with basic points of mind,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
but return to conference.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
That has to do with freightways.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm, I'm rather the former Mr. government,

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
the basic questions we have before the nation today.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm here to throw the most important ones from our southern viewpoints.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
We want to equalize freightways so that we can develop

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
the natural resources of the south,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
which we have a great abundance.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
The question about the basing point grows in that sometimes,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
great many industries have been using a basing point,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
which works against the development of resources in particular countries.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
That is, they hold a price up in the south

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
and don't develop our resources in order to sell more

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
from a Pittsburgh and young South in places in the official territory.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
There is a bill which is pending saying that it shall not be unlawful

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
to afford freight or to afford delivered prices.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
And I don't object to anybody selling on a delivered price basis

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
or absorbing freight, so why did they do not do it

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
for the purpose of violating the antitrust laws?

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Why did I get in the memo then is Bill

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
and I got to send it to a dog one that I submitted to say that

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
all I have told freightways is to not violate antitrust laws.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
In some ways in these countries, don't like mine

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
and the other kind of amendments are the same thing in the house.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
And I thought that's what the shooting is about now.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
I want to hit this a red object.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I picked an FEPC and I saw a Catholic activist commercial appeal

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
of a meeting in the Memphis London restaurant,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
but you got to the resolution.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
I decided here was an attitude of meeting of 18 other settlers

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
and there's a pilot filibuster against the FEPC.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
I wonder if you would like to file a file I want to have a round of it.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
No, yes, I'll file it.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Not a factor in not a position on the FEPC representative.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
There's more opposed to the FEPC democracy.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
It's a part of the current meeting with our House of Poses,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
if you and the folks you don't attend,

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
you'd be standing in condom as a PPC even if I had done a racial point

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
that the regimentation is our accelerator,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
and the selection of employees.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
And I'm always opposed and I'm holding reasons.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And then I'm always willing to work on staff.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
We've got two.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
We're staying on education in a graduate way.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
So, sounds a bit harder than I had.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I've been opposed to other members who told about this.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
I think at some time or another, we have to make issues to decision that.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
If it sounds more important than the argument that we have,

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
we've got to look to see if we are in a perfectly graduate sense

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
that I'm talking to you.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
You think this will be just a good time for me?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm an American.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I think it's not enough.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
We're special trademark.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
We get to walk around the radio.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
You know that.
