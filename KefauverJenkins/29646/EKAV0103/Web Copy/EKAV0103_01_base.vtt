WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Ladies and gentlemen, friends, I kind of see.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.120
This is Lestus Kefau, the venue of the first and the series of television programs from the

00:12.120 --> 00:17.320
nation's capital, where we will review from time to time the proceedings in Congress and

00:17.320 --> 00:21.000
happenings of importance are going on in Washington.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.440
Last year we did this for five minutes once a week.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.840
This year in order to have more depth in the news and to be able to have more distinguished

00:29.840 --> 00:33.600
guests on the program we are going to take 15 minutes.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.440
And I certainly appreciate that this station carrying this program as a public service.

00:37.440 --> 00:42.760
I would appreciate you writing me and your suggestions about the program so that we can

00:42.760 --> 00:45.760
make it more useful and more informative.

00:45.760 --> 00:52.360
Today we are highly honored to have on our next program of the four weeks front today.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.040
Today we are highly honored to have with us the new majority leader, the Democratic

00:58.040 --> 01:01.360
leader of the United States Senate.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.240
We had a able and efficient leader in Senator Lyndon B. Johnson for the past eight or

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
nine years.

01:08.240 --> 01:13.840
Senator Johnson has been elevated to the vice presidency as all of you know.

01:13.840 --> 01:18.680
And succeeding here is the distinguished senator from Montana, Mike Mansfield.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.000
Mike, it's certainly good to have you.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.760
You were elected by unanimous vote of all of the Democratic senators.

01:24.760 --> 01:29.960
We thank you, a patient, able, that you will carry out the program for the good of the

01:29.960 --> 01:30.960
people.

01:30.960 --> 01:35.080
And I want you to say introduce you to people of Tennessee.

01:35.080 --> 01:40.600
Well, as to say, I only hope that I can live up to the high hopes, the higher expectations

01:40.600 --> 01:44.680
that you and my other colleagues have placed in me.

01:44.680 --> 01:50.200
I have no illusions about the job, but I'm depending on people like you and others to help

01:50.200 --> 01:52.200
me over the rough spots.

01:52.200 --> 01:58.920
We'll do our best collectively to reinforce the Kennedy program and to try and get this

01:58.920 --> 02:03.320
country back on an even keel and to bring some stability in the field of formulations.

02:03.320 --> 02:06.320
Well, Mike, you've been our very effective grip.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.600
That's the second in command for a number of years.

02:09.600 --> 02:14.520
We all know of your ability, your sincerity, your great integrity, and your forward

02:14.520 --> 02:20.040
looking ideas about what's good for our nation and what's good for our best chance of

02:20.040 --> 02:22.200
having peace in the world.

02:22.200 --> 02:27.040
And we can certainly count on all of us to help you in every way that we possibly can.

02:27.040 --> 02:32.360
Incidentally, folks, Senator Mansfield is no stranger to Tennessee.

02:32.360 --> 02:40.040
We've been reserved in the House of Representatives from 1943 until I left in 1948.

02:40.040 --> 02:45.880
And then you came to the Senate in 1950, I believe Mike.

02:45.880 --> 02:51.640
Back in 1954, when I was running for my separate term in the United States Senate, Senator

02:51.640 --> 02:57.040
Mansfield was good enough to come down to Cookville, Tennessee, where he made the opening speech

02:57.040 --> 02:59.880
in my campaign during that year.

02:59.880 --> 03:04.040
A lot of people in Nashville and Cookville remember you very pleasantly.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.040
You remember that occasion?

03:06.040 --> 03:07.040
Yes, yes.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
I certainly do.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
And I remember the five of the years.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.040
I remember that year as one of the finest speeches you ever made, too.

03:12.040 --> 03:15.920
Well, the reason was because it was one of the nicest groups I've ever faced.

03:15.920 --> 03:21.320
But you know, I want to go back to Tennessee someday to spend some time in the mountains and

03:21.320 --> 03:26.160
the western part of your state to look over the TDA and see the benefits it's brought to

03:26.160 --> 03:27.800
your people.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.360
And incidentally, you know, there's a great deal of similarity between Montana and Tennessee.

03:32.360 --> 03:37.280
We have mountains, we have dams, we have rivers that need controlling.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.680
And you may be surprised.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.480
Everybody thinks that people from Tennessee always migrate to Texas.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.800
But we have a good many Tennesseans out in Montana and I'm happy to say they're a good

03:46.800 --> 03:47.800
demifact.

03:47.800 --> 03:48.800
Well, that's right, Mike.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.080
I was out there during the last campaign and I saw a lot of them, so the tool and all

03:53.080 --> 03:54.080
the vote right.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.000
All we want you to come back, because we both of our states are developing.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.520
We have great plans for the future and we want you to bring more in down sometime when

04:03.520 --> 04:09.440
the session is not so hectic and enjoy our mountains or TBA even our people.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.440
Well, Mike, what's the program?

04:13.440 --> 04:19.920
First, let's say, talk about the members of the cabinet and the official family that President

04:19.920 --> 04:22.840
of the Black Kennedy has designated.

04:22.840 --> 04:27.200
I think that he has a fine team and the field of foreign affairs.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.000
I think he has experienced people.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.400
And I think he's getting a well-rounded group of people to carry.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.680
A car with his new friend to your program.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.080
What is your feeling about it?

04:38.080 --> 04:39.720
I agree with you, Estes.

04:39.720 --> 04:44.520
I think that he's made a wonderful set of selections so far.

04:44.520 --> 04:49.160
It is anticipated that beginning very shortly, the appropriate committees in the Senate will

04:49.160 --> 04:54.440
start hearings on these nominees so that we can bring them to the floor of the Senate

04:54.440 --> 04:58.080
shortly after the inaugural for confirmation.

04:58.080 --> 05:02.760
And after that, we will of course expect the committees likewise to start hearings before

05:02.760 --> 05:09.400
the inauguration on the various legislative proposals, which President Kennedy has announced

05:09.400 --> 05:12.000
during the course of his campaign and six.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.560
Well, Mike, as much as he has picked good people in and as much as the Senate always respects

05:18.560 --> 05:24.320
the right and the desire of the President to have the people that he wants to help him,

05:24.320 --> 05:28.560
I wouldn't anticipate any trouble on any of the confirmation of any of the cabinet members.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.560
Would you?

05:29.560 --> 05:36.240
No, I dare say that all of them will be approved fairly expeditiously.

05:36.240 --> 05:42.000
And I look for little friction, little argument, and fairly speedy consideration and approval.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.360
But Mike, I've been telling everybody that I thought there were so many problems in the

05:46.360 --> 05:52.080
world, both domestically with unemployment and difficulties we're having here at home

05:52.080 --> 05:58.920
as well as many hectic problems and international affairs that I thought we would have.

05:58.920 --> 06:04.120
Very good teamwork was among the insiports, the Democrats are concerned and insiports,

06:04.120 --> 06:10.040
the Republicans are concerned, at least for a considerable period of time, a good honeymoon.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.560
Do you think that will be true?

06:11.560 --> 06:17.000
Yes, I think so, especially in the field of foreign policy, I believe that both parties will

06:17.000 --> 06:22.200
face the interests of the country ahead of the interests of their particular party.

06:22.200 --> 06:28.120
I think even in the field of domestic affairs that there will not be the friction which

06:28.120 --> 06:34.280
you great many anticipate because many Republicans will vote for these programs and do so all

06:34.280 --> 06:38.640
the more willingly because they are now not under pressure from the White House to vote

06:38.640 --> 06:41.960
the way the White House wants them to.

06:41.960 --> 06:46.040
So I look forward to a period of harmony and unity.

06:46.040 --> 06:50.460
There may be a few squabbles here and there, but it wouldn't be a Senate or a Democratic

06:50.460 --> 06:53.240
party if we didn't have these squabbles occasionally.

06:53.240 --> 06:59.000
But I anticipate that we're carried through the President's program in fairly good fashion

06:59.000 --> 07:04.600
and I would hope that when this session of the Congress is concluded, we would be judged

07:04.600 --> 07:08.720
not under quantity of the legislation which we passed but rather the quality.

07:09.440 --> 07:13.040
Well that's what we're all hoping for and let's hope that honeymoon lasts as long as possible

07:13.040 --> 07:18.600
and we can get the President's program over and get some things done for the people and

07:18.600 --> 07:20.960
improve our situation in the world.

07:20.960 --> 07:27.760
Well now Mr. Majority Leader, Mike, we're now engaged in a fight about the amendment of

07:27.760 --> 07:35.480
rule 22 which is the, as all of you know, is the rule with that about determination

07:35.480 --> 07:39.520
of the faith in preventing the full of usters.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.360
What is the situation about that?

07:41.360 --> 07:44.120
Are we going to be able to get that behind us pretty soon?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.760
I would hope so, Estes.

07:45.760 --> 07:50.640
I would imagine that there will be a motion to table or move the previous question in

07:50.640 --> 07:52.440
due time.

07:52.440 --> 07:57.480
That will bring this matter to a head and then we will be able to get on to the business

07:57.480 --> 08:00.040
of the President's program.

08:00.040 --> 08:05.040
You know I think people ought to recognize the fact that while there is a need for some

08:05.040 --> 08:11.840
reform and rule 22 that the important thing now is to get the President's program underway.

08:11.840 --> 08:18.840
It encompasses a great many facets in the field of our domestic economy, housing for

08:18.840 --> 08:23.720
example which is in a terrible slump at the present time and which will do much to create

08:23.720 --> 08:25.120
employment for our people.

08:25.120 --> 08:29.600
The depressed areas, and I'm sure you have some of them down in your state as I have in

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
mind.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.320
Mike, on that subject, depressed areas, but we're getting more letters about that and most

08:34.320 --> 08:35.320
than the other subject.

08:35.320 --> 08:42.720
We have some 76 communities where there is an unemployment particularly in cool mining

08:42.720 --> 08:49.400
sections like Innerians, Cochyan, Grande County where the coal is running out and it's

08:49.400 --> 08:53.400
expensive to man it and perhaps in very bad situation.

08:53.400 --> 08:57.800
So that bill is greatly needed in many parts of Tennessee as it is elsewhere.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.840
Do you think, of course, we passed a bill one time in Congress and we got to be told

09:01.840 --> 09:02.840
it is bad?

09:02.840 --> 09:03.840
That's right at all.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.680
But now we have a President who will not be to a bill of that kind and I think we can

09:07.680 --> 09:12.040
pass a bill more in keeping with the realities of the situation.

09:12.040 --> 09:18.720
And Mike about unemployment, unemployment is a pretty high peak.

09:18.720 --> 09:24.480
And what is your feeling about the best thing we can do and the most expeditious one to

09:24.480 --> 09:26.880
try to enable people to get back to work properly?

09:26.880 --> 09:33.800
Well, I think we ought to engage upon the President's program, aged depressed areas,

09:33.800 --> 09:40.040
both rural and urban, housing program which will spur the construction industry and give

09:40.040 --> 09:46.600
sustenance to our people, aid to education, raising the minimum wage, all these are important

09:46.600 --> 09:51.880
and all of them are necessary because if my information is correct by about the 1st of

09:51.880 --> 09:57.800
February, we will have something on the order of 5 million perhaps more unemployed.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.840
Now this has been referred to during the course of the late campaign as a quote, quote,

10:02.840 --> 10:05.160
unquote in our economy.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.480
I hope it is not the pause that depresses.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.720
It is certainly something which calls for action with a man like Kennedy in the White

10:10.720 --> 10:11.720
House.

10:11.720 --> 10:17.360
Action will be taken to try and alleviate the situations in what you, in these areas you

10:17.360 --> 10:22.880
have referred to, sometimes known as pockets of poverty, so that men and women able and

10:22.880 --> 10:27.760
willing will have the opportunity and the right to work and achieve a decent life?

10:27.760 --> 10:36.720
Well, Mike, I always heard that there feel that a good housing program, and we have two

10:36.720 --> 10:42.840
vetoed last year and we finally got through a very, very watered down housing program which

10:42.840 --> 10:48.600
is not adequate at all, but do more to aspire and to increase employment immediately than

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
almost anything else.

10:49.600 --> 10:56.080
Not only in the timber industry and among construction workers, but also in the factories

10:56.080 --> 11:00.960
where they make frigidaires, stoves, and heaters and apprentices.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.840
So I imagine that will be how many poverty lists.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.960
It will indeed, and what you said is correct because it goes far beyond the building of a

11:07.960 --> 11:13.120
house that affects so many other fields of economic endeavor, that what it does is create

11:13.120 --> 11:17.160
employment as it goes along and I think we have to do something to overcome the terrible

11:17.160 --> 11:19.720
slump and housing evident this past year.

11:19.720 --> 11:24.640
Well, Mike and Montana, you are interested in the development of the harnessing of the

11:24.640 --> 11:28.880
Columbia, I mean of the Missouri River and other rivers.

11:28.880 --> 11:33.400
We in Tennessee, of course, are very proud of the Tennessee Valley Authority and for the

11:33.400 --> 11:39.360
information of all you good folks, that Senator Manstil, both as a Congressman and as a

11:39.360 --> 11:44.920
Senator, has always been a tower strength for the Tennessee Valley Authority to protect

11:44.920 --> 11:45.920
it from Father Ifon.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.920
So we feel, matter of it, on that school that he is the majority reader.

11:49.920 --> 11:54.280
Well, as to if I can tell you this, that it was because of your constant and unfeeling

11:54.280 --> 12:00.440
championship of the TVA that you were so easily able to convert so many of us to thousands

12:00.440 --> 12:01.640
to keep us under your banner.

12:01.640 --> 12:05.840
Well, of course, Senator, going to have very much for the TVA, but that's how you feel

12:05.840 --> 12:08.480
otherwise you wouldn't have been so enthusiastic, Mike.

12:08.480 --> 12:13.880
But a resource development and building up our country will be a vital part of the

12:13.880 --> 12:17.160
program of the President and of the Congress.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.160
Very vital part.

12:19.160 --> 12:24.160
In the minute or two remaining, I'm going to talk about the development of our great

12:24.160 --> 12:25.160
national parts.

12:25.160 --> 12:31.960
You have a, we have a smokey mountain national part and you have Yellowstone and Clayshare.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.200
Clayshare and others.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.200
We need to give them more attention, not your thoughts.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.200
Yes, indeed.

12:37.200 --> 12:42.200
Considering more attention, I would hope that the Mission 66 program would be accentuated,

12:42.200 --> 12:45.920
that the amounts of money which must be spent would be put into our parks because they

12:45.920 --> 12:49.960
do represent an investment in which all America can participate.

12:49.960 --> 12:54.840
And I think that if we do not undertake a program or this kind that we will be the losers

12:54.840 --> 12:59.520
and the result may well be that the parks will be terrible, they're still better.

12:59.520 --> 13:04.440
Well, I might go, we don't have much time remaining, but we've seen that you've been

13:04.440 --> 13:09.000
have a package for the reform of the electoral college of which I'm interested to.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.960
Will that be part of the program?

13:10.960 --> 13:15.360
No, that is my own personal idea, but I think something ought to be done about the

13:15.360 --> 13:18.960
electoral college, something ought to be done about the length and the cost of campaigns

13:18.960 --> 13:22.360
and something ought to be done about the interregnum between the election and the time of

13:22.360 --> 13:23.360
president takes over.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.600
Well, I certainly agree with you and I've been working on that myself as you know for

13:26.600 --> 13:27.600
a number of years.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.600
But thank you very much, Senator Mansfield.

13:29.600 --> 13:34.160
You're a great leader and a great friend of the people of this nation under Tennessee.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.160
As does it's a pleasure.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.840
I'm Lewis and Devamon until four weeks from now, that's all.

13:38.840 --> 13:39.520
Thank you very much.
