WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I don't have a situation.

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
Better response of answer, Matt.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
I can buy a partial response.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm not in my area.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
I'm really trying to do it.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
The way I should be done.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Then the further question was whether or not you directed Mr. Adam

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
and asked Senator McCarthy whether or not he said

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
that the McCarthy was faithful as you.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Against, General.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
I guess you, if you relieved the welcome of his command.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
No sir.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Good-moments.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
No sir.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
I wanted to inform that I'm a part of your public

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
when I was giving some consideration.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
But if you go and mispronounce what I was trying to get it to,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
did you add Mr. Adam?

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
So, the Senator McCarthy and get to you and ensure that Senator McCarthy

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
that Senator McCarthy would not make a public issue

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
of the remaining of General Watkins command.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
I have him to inform Senator McCarty of the night

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
that I had this matter under consideration.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
And now I must pull that is not a direct answer.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
You can answer that Mr. Vick-Tay.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes or no, and then make such an explanation as you see it.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, they're not Senator McCarthy.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
With make a public issue.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
General Watkins is relieving General Watkins

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
command the reason of General Watkins having cooperated

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
with the committee.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Did you want to know whether or not Senator McCarthy

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
was making a public issue of that if you relieved General Watkins

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
from Fort Monmouth?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I wanted to.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I want Senator McCarthy to have the information.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
I was telling Adam to find out how he fell about it.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Well, I must pull that is in the direct answer.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
So, I just question these.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Did you want a share in this from Senator McCarthy?

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
That he would not make a public issue.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Obviously, if you relieved General Watkins of his command

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
and I have no recollection about it at all.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Maybe Mr. Secretary, possibly Mr. Vick-Tay.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Like sir.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Not that I can refresh your recollection.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
If Mr. Adam called you at approximately 2 p.m.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
on the afternoon of November 25th,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
from a room adjoining the hearing room

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
at the United States 4th house in the presence of Senator McCarty

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
to tell you that he had bad news for you

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
in that Senator McCarthy was not agreed to silence.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
If you relieved General Watkins of his command at Fort Monmouth.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't remember that exactly.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I can look it up and see.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I know that I call Mr. Coleman.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I call Mr. Stone.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I call Mr. Adam one step further myself.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And he called me back.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Did he?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm sorry.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
He called me back and said that very call it.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
He had a poor man on McCarthy who was depressed about it

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
because he felt the Senator Watkins was cooperating

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
for me with the committee.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
And he therefore would like to have General Watkins continue on.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Now, if one of the things concerning which you demanded

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
a written explanation of General Watkins on November 25th,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
praise by him of Senator McCarty.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
No sir.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I can reiterate that, Mr. Secretary.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Did General Watkins that lived to you through General Watkins,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
a memorandum,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
before he to give you explanation of various matters

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
which he had said which you thought he should not have said?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I keep a word of memorandum.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
At my request, I was lining the substance of some statements

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
he made at Fort Monmouth, the substance of which I was interested

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
in knowing about.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
And I try to answer you for that memorandum.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
You had indicated the general facts that you were thoroughly

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
displeased with General Watkins and his judgment

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
and his safety of may.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Had you not?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
No, I did not say I was following the spree.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
So simply alerted General Watkins back to the fact that I was giving

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
him out of some thought and I'd like him to do likewise.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Mr. Secretary, does not paragraph nine of the memorandum

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
that General Watkins was required to submit contained

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
an explanation by him as to a compliment which he had paid

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
to Senator McCarty?

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I think there's something in there about I don't remember the paragraph.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Now my next question is this, sir.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Did you not refuse to see General Watkins when he was in your

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
waiting room on the afternoon of, I did not see General Watkins,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
but I don't refuse to speak to the fellow back and possibly work him in.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
But I have a pretty heavy schedule over there.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I can't see everybody that's a light and streaming.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Maybe I didn't make myself famous, please.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
On the afternoon of November 25th, the general back

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
bring General Watkins to your outer house.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I think you did.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Did you know back into your out?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I think you did.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Did he ask you if you would see General Watkins?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I don't think he asked me.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I think he told me General Watkins out there and that I want to clear him.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Did you see General Watkins to get his explanation to what he said?

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
No, because I had this memorandum coming in and that was the information

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I wanted about the speeches that he made on the post.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Was this the same afternoon that Mr. Hatton's telephone

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
you informed you that Senator McCarty was not agreed to remain silent

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
if a reprisal was taken against General Watkins?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I don't remember what that was in the morning about.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I think it was the same day.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
It's all around the same time.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
It's my right turn.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Same day, I think.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Now, I wanted to leave that for a minute to find my secretary

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
and turn to this.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Alligation numbers and alligations on the Adam and Steven's alligations

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
whatever it might be called, number 12,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
of improper means used to get proper rental treatment for private shine.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
You looked at meetings that took place in your office

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
on the afternoon of November 16th,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
and which you say that Mr. Farr and I made threats to you.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
That is listed as Alligation number 12 of the youth

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
have been properly to get proper rental treatment for private shine.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
I wonder if you could tell the committee whether or not private shine

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
made was mentioned on that afternoon.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
So, yeah.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
I don't recall Mr. Conn at this moment that Sean was,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
but I'd like to think about it.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
I say Mr. Chairman, I have no more objections to the secretary

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and I think about anything he might have said or know about me

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and I do about it, if he's about anything, but about Mr. Farr.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I wonder this, sir.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Could you now tell us having listed this as a very serious allegation

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
against me whether or not you can recall my saying anything?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
About private shine to you on that afternoon.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
But I can remember some other things you said.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Were they with reference to private shine, sir?

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
They were with reference to my press conference and also to the hearings.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
First of all, I had asked you now if these as listed as allegation number 12

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
of youth of improper means to get proper rental treatment for private

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
gee David shine.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
And I was wondering if you want to tell the committee whether or not

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
I'd use any improper means or Mr. Cri did on that afternoon

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
to get preferential treatment for private shine.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Well, Mr. Conn at my, I only know how to answer these questions

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
by using a few words and it's not an attempt to prolong or do you say it

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
or anything else, but I can tell you, give me a mic.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
My general feeling about that meeting if you want me to.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Well, I'll have a wee time and I wonder if we first deal with this.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Would you agree with me, sir, that Mr. John Adams,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
if you're a present telephone me at my home on Sunday afternoon, November 15th.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And ask me to come to Washington and be in your office the next morning

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
and state a bit of like if not be there, if you and he would like in New York

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
to see me that Sunday night.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
John Adams, perhaps, put about that I don't recall.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
So I just wondered if you could tell us whether or not Mr. Adams called me carrying a message

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
for you asking me to be present in your office the next afternoon

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
to discuss a matter with you concerning which you are very much stressed

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
whether or not you sent Mr. Adams to tell me that you're required

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
that if I could not be there, the matter is the such urgency to you

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
that you and me would fly up in New York to see me that very thing Sunday night.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I have no knowledge about that.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I don't remember anything on your time as he's fine.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
So Mr. Jenkins.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Secretary of the understandings you have under consideration

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
for leaving General Lawton fired on November 24th for reasons that you state is that correct?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yes.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
And does that other understand it?

08:40.000 --> 08:47.000
You have the authority as Secretary of the Army to release the General of his command

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
using your discretion you think it's proper.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yes sir?

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
And without the adviser consent of any other person?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Well that is in a way of a work of conduct about to do it

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
or certainly without the adviser consent of Senator McCartney.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
That's what.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Now Mr. Davis.

09:05.000 --> 09:15.000
Even if you were asked whether or not Mr. Adams went to New York City on November 24th

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
and was sent there by you and whether or not his mission was to help to Senator McCartney

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
and find out whether or not Senator McCartney was making such a easy rally

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
if you would please General Lawton of his command and the design district you are and so you state

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
you did not remember it.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Is that right Mr. Davis?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
My recollection is that Mr. Adams wants New York to attend the public hearings

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
of the Fort Moments hearing service committee and that I telephoned him while he was there

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
and told him I was giving thought to this matter and asked him to take it up to Senator McCartney

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
and advise him about it.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
All right you called him in New York on how to send some soaring details Senator McCartney

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
that you were giving thoughts to relieving General Lawton and the sign out had he to Senator McCartney tell about.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
That's right.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Well I wanted to inform him.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Absolutely.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Now what if we ask him what?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Well why was that a matter of any concern to you Mr. Secretary?

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
Because what he felt about it and that you made the decisions without controlling the crimes in New York

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
and it started here that you were going to relieve General Lawton from his command

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
because he had cooperated with the McCartney committee.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Now you see the improvements of the years and the importance of it and the committee wants to know

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
do you now say that you told him Mr. Attas and told him to tell Senator McCartney

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
that you had under consideration relieving General Lawton and that you wanted Senator McCartney

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
and advise him about it to get his reaction.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
It is that right.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
That's the way that I was at this section.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
The following on the basis of the cooperation with Senator McCartney and this committee

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
would not testify to Attas and this is another evidence of my desire not to take any action

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
that could be considered non-cooperative by Secretary by Senator McCartney.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
And I think if I had taken the arbitrary action of relieving General Lawton

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
that Senator McCartney would have put it back as an act of non-cooperation by the Army

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
with this committee and I didn't want to do that.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
In other words you said.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
That's...

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
You have understood that General Lawton had been cooperating with the McCartney committee.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Oh yes sir.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
But what are?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Yes.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
In the investigation of each of the persons.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
That's right.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
And this Mr. Mr. Cwensioner.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
That's right.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
And you knew that General Lawton himself had suspended a number on his own volition

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
since about after the first stage.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
That's right.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
And Mr. Secretary you say that you did not want to relieve General Lawton

12:05.000 --> 12:12.000
without first learning of what sort of a reaction it was to bring from Senator McCartney

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
and with the fear shall we say that he might charge that you have done it as a reprisal?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Is that right?

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
Because of Lawton's cooperation with him McCartney, is that it?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Now I have that recorder read that.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
That plays Mr. Jenkins.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Is he?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
What is all the deep questions?

12:40.000 --> 12:50.000
And Mr. Secretary you did not want to relieve General Lawton without first learning of what sort of reaction it was to bring some kind of a party.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
But the fear shall we say that he might charge that you have done it as a reprisal?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Is that right?

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Because of Lawton's cooperation with him McCartney.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I don't know anything about reprisal.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Mr. Jenkins, let me ask you this question.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
You have to relieve General Lawton.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Are there command?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Sometimes the time had you not sent your law statement.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
He was the only one under consideration at that time after.

13:21.000 --> 13:31.000
You have never considered Senator McCartney about any other change, promotion, demotion, switching, changing or anything of the kind.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Of the personnel of the Army.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
That's why now I might appear to this committee I don't know how their minds are running.

13:41.000 --> 14:04.000
That you did not want it perhaps was afraid to relieve General Lawton without first after sustaining what the reaction of Senator McCartney would be without first finding out whether or not he would make an issue of it and charged you with having done it as a reprisal against General Lawton the reason of his cooperation with McCartney.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Senator McCartney.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Now Mr. Secretary the committee I am sure wants to know.

14:10.000 --> 14:20.000
Whether or not the purpose of your long distance call of Mr. Adams was to get him to ascertain whether or not Senator McCartney would make an issue of it.

14:20.000 --> 14:30.000
Now whether or not my happy behavior yesterday no purpose of my call was to inform Senator McCartney.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
That I had this under consideration.

14:33.000 --> 14:43.000
Will why inform Senator McCartney he hadn't appeared before him because of my policy of constant and continued cooperation with the committees of the Congress.

14:43.000 --> 14:57.000
And with your permission I'd like to read just five lines from a report of this committee just two weeks after the date we're talking about a published public hearing on Fort Monmouth this statement by the chairman of this committee.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
Mr. Chairman we will have to call all of the members of the board and put them under hold and may I say John at the present.

15:07.000 --> 15:18.000
And this is not a criticism of you I think that you have tried to cooperate with this committee fully and I think Mr. Steven has that's an official before this committee.

15:18.000 --> 15:26.000
Mr. Secretary let's keep not of the issue this this very charge is made against you by the command of the Macartes Act.

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
That by reason of General Lawton's cooperation with you are as attitude towards the person.

15:33.000 --> 15:47.000
You were about to relieve him of his command of Fort Monmouth but the implication of their charge is that you were afraid to do so until you first ascertain whether or not Senator McCartney was there.

15:47.000 --> 15:58.000
Senator McCartney was making a public issue now that is the charge against you I was not afraid of this I didn't ask you that question I'm I'm I'm imponing the charge.

15:58.000 --> 16:08.000
You do say that you call Mr. Adam and told him to tell Senator McCartney that you had under consideration relieving General Lawton that's correct it.

16:08.000 --> 16:34.000
And I believe you say that you told Mr. Adam to get Senator McCartney's reaction to that I'm a correct in that to inform him that's right you wanted to know how Senator McCartney would see you that's right if you relieve Senator if you relieve the General Lawton that's correct in that that's right now.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
I think we're entitled to a yes and a wife's wrong this.

16:39.000 --> 16:55.000
Did you tell Mr. Adam to convey to Senator McCartney the fact that you were going to relieve him if he Senator McCartney would not make a public issue of it.

16:55.000 --> 17:05.000
I don't recall so now Mr. Secretary I was criticized very severely and I don't mind confessing it here in public and maybe I deserve it.

17:05.000 --> 17:18.000
And if you are now for a public apology for pressing this private yesterday only yes or no answer and you are the secretary of the Army and I think this committee is entitled

17:18.000 --> 17:42.500
to tremendously important issue in there and you know about these charges for some time I'm not arguing with you and you have to sum my water to a three days rest and now you tell this to me that all that tremendously vital issue that is whether or not you told Mr. Adam to tell Senator McCartney that you were going to relieve this

17:42.500 --> 17:49.500
General Lawton if he was not making public issue of it your answer today is I don't remember.

17:49.500 --> 17:55.500
I think you also explain why you don't remember I answer that is no.

17:55.500 --> 18:06.500
Well thank you for answering your question is no but I say you want yes or no and I say no but I understand you and I feel that you're saying

18:06.500 --> 18:14.000
that you didn't remember was that's right you do not have I'll have I'll have read it all right read the

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
question read tonight.

18:16.000 --> 18:29.000
I'll be part of the call that we had issue and the bars 10 seconds for station identification.

18:29.000 --> 18:39.000
WNYC New York City's own station.

18:39.000 --> 18:51.000
I'll back to the car of the Army hearing the reporter is reading the question which Mr. Jenkins I've asked.

18:51.000 --> 19:19.000
You tell me that I'm just trying to get a handle that yes or no.

19:19.000 --> 19:29.000
Are you able to save positive is that you think that you think that I'm not question the way it was read the way I

19:29.000 --> 19:36.000
concentrated on it while the reporter was reading it I would say no but then I'd like to offer an explanation.

19:36.000 --> 19:44.000
That's question says convey to Senator McCartney the fact that I was going to relieve General Lawton.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
Now that was not the fact we started over person who's not that person who's not that you wanted part of the trying to correct that

19:51.000 --> 19:57.640
when they said yes you see I wasn't what I said because I didn't know whether or not I was going to

19:57.640 --> 20:02.000
relieve General Lawton and the fact is I did not and you still would come under there and then I'd

20:02.000 --> 20:12.000
just want to tell us then are you in now and do you now deny positively that you told Mr. Adam

20:12.000 --> 20:19.000
to continue to convey the message to Senator McCartney that you were going to relieve General Lawton of his command

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
the fourth moment that he Senator McCartney would not make a public issue of it.

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
Yes I do not you don't you don't have that in safe positive is it did not occur that's right but what I

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
like to make clear is if I haven't already is that I told Mr. Adam I'd like Mr.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
McCartney to be informed about this cooperating with this committee and I didn't want to do any of

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
things that was non-cooperative and I'd like to know what thermocartney's reaction was.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Well Mr. Secretary this is one of my questions.

20:55.000 --> 21:04.000
In view of the fact that you and you alone were charged with a responsibility of relieving General

21:04.000 --> 21:11.000
that you and you alone knew of his qualifications the character of work that he was doing

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
the senator McCartney was in no position whatever being in the latest lady right of the government

21:18.000 --> 21:27.000
to face on the policies or fitness I'll general law to reside over the destiny of the fourth moment

21:27.000 --> 21:36.000
and in view of the fact that you say now that you call Mr. Adam's in New York City and told him to tell

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
senator McCartney that you were considering relieving General Lawton of that command

21:43.000 --> 21:58.000
and as I remember that you wanted the senator's reaction to that is it not a fact Mr. Secretary that you did not

21:59.000 --> 22:09.000
would not relieve General Lawton of that command without first neither getting senator McCartney's

22:09.000 --> 22:18.000
consent to do so are his reactions that would occur if you did do so.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
That is if I might say so Mr. Janker rather complicated question but I'll try to have no tricks to it

22:25.000 --> 22:32.000
I know there's no trick so I realize that sir. If I have come to the conclusion that General Lawton

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
should be relieved I would have done so but I thought it was appropriate when I started thinking about it

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
seriously to advise Senator McCartney because I wanted to follow my policy of cooperation here

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
I did not want this committee to feel that I was impacting in a non-cooperative manner.

22:50.000 --> 23:01.000
Well this other question. Would you have construed the removal of General Lawton from the command

23:01.000 --> 23:08.000
of Fort Monmouth as an act of this loyalty to senator McCartney or his committee?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
No sir.

23:09.000 --> 23:18.000
Or an act that would be construed as being an attitude of non-cooperation with the committee on your part.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
I think it has been considered as a non-cooperative thing yes because I know that kind of McCartney

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
and he's that thought highly of the cooperation from General Lawton and it seemed to me

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
that for a purpose since they were working very closely with that installation that he also knows

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
any major change like that that I might have in mind.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
I think that during the period of your consideration of the face of General Lawton of Fort Monmouth

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
you also considered his successor.

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
Now sir I just, well regardless of who his successor would have been, he would have been a man

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
who would have cooperated with Senator McCartney's staff just like General Lawton.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
That's correct.

24:00.000 --> 24:07.000
In which instance Senator McCartney would have had no calls to complain or make any few words?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Well that's right.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
That's right.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
But General Lawton had already demonstrated his cooperation and it seemed to me that Senator McCartney

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
would like to know about that if I was going to make a change.

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
Where do I think it is that you, the message you got back from Mr. Adams was that Senator McCartney

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
would have construed it as a reprimal against General Lawton.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Is that a general law?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Is that correct?

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
I don't know about reprimal but I certainly got the words back that Senator McCartney

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
was not, was not the play of the lawton was released back then.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
Did he really need to use the lawton as a lawton or as a police?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
That's right.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And who do they think that makes a change?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Mr. Adams as I recall it.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
And you did not really need General Lawton.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
There.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Didn't them and haven't since and I have no intention of.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
Was it the cause of the work you got from Mr. Adams and Senator McCartney wouldn't stand by here with no just me?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
No sir.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
Was not the investigation revealed in the General Lawton as a right man to continue there?

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
Now the only reason you continue them and the fact that he didn't meet with the approvals of Senator McCartney

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
had nothing to do with his ass brought absolutely not a cello on the mark.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
That's it.

25:20.000 --> 25:30.000
Mr. Walsh, our watchdog at times, has been signaling to the chairman and had asked me at the lunch hour that he wanted to go to Boston this afternoon.

25:31.000 --> 25:41.000
I believe therefore this chair, the night as well adjourned at this point until 10 thirty Monday morning and the chair would like to have an executive meeting of the committee and his officer to fire the fire.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Thank you.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I have a word.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
I have a word.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I have a word.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Thank you.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Thank you.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Thank you.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Thank you.

25:55.000 --> 26:02.000
You have been listening to a session of the Senate Permanent Investigation Subcommittee inquiry in the Army McCartney Contravers.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
This broadcast came to you from Washington in cooperation with the American Broadcasting Company.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Thank you.
