00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
I'll ask you whether or not you had far a conference with the Chief of the Chief of the

00:05.200 --> 00:09.000
Commander I am and send the McCarthy on the other.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
I think that's correct.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.900
That's not sure that it was sent to McCarthy as I understand it over that weekend,

00:17.900 --> 00:18.900
when McCarthy was in Maine.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.400
I don't know when he was due back.

00:21.400 --> 00:26.800
I didn't know then when he was new back and Mr. Cohen had given up the invitations

00:26.800 --> 00:29.800
and how upset he was and he didn't be able to send him to McCarthy with us.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.800
So, I think that's the reason why he let me to breathe back, which is because

00:32.800 --> 00:36.800
he made a fast information on Mr. Stevens and that we thought that was

00:36.800 --> 00:39.800
a reason to touch his self-derived made a call to Mr. Cohen.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.800
Instead, we can't get together some way.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.800
And so, my call to Mr. Cohen was to be effected.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.800
We'll come and see you if you want to come to the office.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.800
That statement of November 13th was correct.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.800
You're done believe it wasn't yes, sir?

00:56.800 --> 00:59.800
You were on firm ground.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.800
But actually, these two of three conversations with Mr. Cohen knew

01:03.800 --> 01:06.800
it's a direction of the Secretary of the Army.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.800
Call Mr. Cohen in New York and ask for our hand was given an appointment with

01:11.800 --> 01:13.800
Senator McCarthy, where you're not.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.800
Now, this code says that he's come to Washington the next day to talk it over.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.800
This is not the next day.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.800
The Secretary of the Army has taken all the lab we agreed to go to New York on the

01:23.800 --> 01:24.800
second.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
We decided to go to New York.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.800
You, the Attorney Council and the Secretary of the Army, then go to New York

01:30.800 --> 01:34.800
the next day for the brother of the Secretary of the Army to respect this

01:34.800 --> 01:37.800
first relief that he's there to save the facts.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.800
Yes, sir.

01:38.800 --> 01:46.800
That was for the purpose of modifying a placating of a chairman of this investigating

01:46.800 --> 01:47.800
committee.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
Wasn't it that?

01:48.800 --> 01:51.800
But thankfully, yes.

01:51.800 --> 01:56.800
No cabinet officer cares to have open hostility with the chairman of this committee.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.800
Is it going to be ready?

01:58.800 --> 02:02.800
Well, sir, you were carrying all these businesses.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.800
You didn't care whether you carried them off.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.800
So do you say you're not.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.800
You say you're on firm ground.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.800
You follow those things, sir, to advise these youths and may head them to the United

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
Army.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.800
Leave your duties here in Washington.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.800
I'm going to New York City for the purpose of conferring with this matter.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.800
Well, one of the things that we were made aware of as a result of those weekend conversations

02:29.800 --> 02:35.800
and that conversation on Monday was the fact that Mr. Steven Chapman made a

02:35.800 --> 02:38.800
mandatory that the committee have open hearing of.

02:38.800 --> 02:45.800
For the purpose of proving the death deny and the method of the type of hearings which

02:45.800 --> 02:52.800
were outlined, we're not the type that we were enthusiastic about because it just came

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
to us.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
They've been outlined for it before.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
So what would you like?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.800
Came to us if they would be a lot of in New England.

02:57.800 --> 03:03.800
There were inferences as to the existence of death deny and there would be considerable

03:03.800 --> 03:10.800
ways in the minds of many people and these and they would either seem sort of both in hearing

03:10.800 --> 03:13.800
that had been outlined to us as a luncheon of November 6th.

03:13.800 --> 03:19.800
We weren't enthusiastic about them and then there was the second factor that that

03:19.800 --> 03:26.800
Senator McCarthy was chairman of this powerful committee and therefore Mr.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.800
Steven and Senator McCarthy had been very friendly, very good friend.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.800
Mr. Steven did not want to because the rupture of that friendship,

03:33.800 --> 03:37.800
nor did he want to have open hospital at the age between the Senate's

03:37.800 --> 03:41.800
committee on government operations or the Senate investigation subcommittee on the

03:41.800 --> 03:43.800
one hand and the other part of the army on the other.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.800
That's a natural reaction.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.800
These are the golden and New York and these and the McCarthy and the Trump.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.800
And that's the new government in New York and the process of Senator McCarthy not

03:53.800 --> 03:57.800
sending the facts to it on fire and down the Metro East of November 13th.

03:57.800 --> 04:03.800
Representative Steven, you made a different statement to the President.

04:03.800 --> 04:11.800
Mr. Steven, Mr. Steven, from now, Mr. Adam, you and Mr. Steven are a main

04:11.800 --> 04:14.800
defeat in this thing and you so desire to serve.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.800
Yes, yes, yes.

04:15.800 --> 04:22.800
And whatever you do with Steven's discharge of all these, we read all that down.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.800
In your official committee?

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
In my official committee.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.800
Yes, but I'm not talking about your personal outside, that's too particular activity.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.800
And vice versa.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.800
That's too easy.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.800
Yes, very well.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.800
And so it's different.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.800
Relief was given to the President.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.800
Yes, yes.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.800
Well, Mr. Adam, was in fact a peon.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.800
Well, I don't know if everybody was interested in differently.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.800
I met Steven here in their position.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.800
If wasn't or not, in your opinion.

04:59.800 --> 05:05.800
Well, Mr. Steven contended that he had been wrongly quoted by the press.

05:05.800 --> 05:14.800
And he stated that on the 13th of November, he had stated to the extent that he had made

05:14.800 --> 05:18.800
statements to the effects of the Army and he was no current at the night.

05:18.800 --> 05:26.800
And he contended that when it was reported, the inference is gone from the newspaper stories

05:26.800 --> 05:29.800
where there was no current at the night.

05:29.800 --> 05:35.800
And when he talked to the press as a conclusion of the day on November 7th, he refused.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.800
But the Army knew of no current at the night.

05:38.800 --> 05:44.800
And he did not know what the credit is.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.800
Mr. Adam, you know General Land for days, he did not.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
Yes, sir.

05:51.800 --> 05:55.800
He is one of the outstanding generals in your opinion in the Army, isn't he?

05:55.800 --> 05:56.800
Yes, he is.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.800
He is a fine officer.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.800
And a man of 40 seems.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.800
I have no last.

06:01.800 --> 06:02.800
I have great admiration for him.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.800
I say he's a strong character.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.800
He's a thief of me, yes, sir.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.800
How did you all know we were relations?

06:08.800 --> 06:09.800
Yes, sir.

06:09.800 --> 06:21.920
And told you that China has been there for a long weekend, by its prescibe time, and the

06:21.920 --> 06:26.800
D-Roy, through Rhyme, was not going to grant you to told you that, didn't he?

06:26.800 --> 06:27.800
Yes, sir.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.800
You then went to talk to Secretary of State about it, didn't you?

06:30.800 --> 06:34.800
I think my first statement told me that I think that's fine.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.800
Well, it's sickle up to you.

06:36.800 --> 06:40.760
And the reason I say that is that this indication that I had two telephone calls with General

06:40.760 --> 06:44.800
Rhyme, within a matter of about two minutes, and then I talked to him again about an hour

06:44.800 --> 06:45.800
and a half later.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.800
And you did claim to resign, didn't you?

06:46.800 --> 06:47.800
I said, I did.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.800
And you did claim to take a new proof, very.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.800
No, it wasn't that I said to you, but your decision, General, anything you say goes.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.800
But then I decided I'd better tell Mr. Stevens about it.

06:56.800 --> 07:01.800
Well, I think General Rhyme told me on the telephone that this old, serious, psychologic

07:01.800 --> 07:03.800
training had not started with that.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.800
I think it started a few days later, the following week.

07:06.800 --> 07:12.000
And during this period, subsequent due to his induction, he was on the post in kind of a

07:12.000 --> 07:19.200
holding statement, which I think most new inductees considered to be an interferers-air

07:19.200 --> 07:23.200
concern, the latter English work.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.200
They do K.C. and they will delete the area.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.000
They do not do basic training.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And that was the status that they trained within at that time.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
So I did go to this decision.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
I did tell him that this request had come to General Rhyme and General Rhyme would

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
incline due to refuse this.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
I told him all, and then this student's asking whether or not his training had started.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
And I told him that it was my understanding that it had not.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
On that basis, Mr. Stevens stated, well, as long as his training has not started.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
And in view of the fact that we have only just fixed up this press confrontation, as long

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
as the committee has indicated they wanted for the committee business, I think that it

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
has passed.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
So I told General Rhyme up until.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Well, what are the reasons?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And you gave given reasons.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Committee business has always been the reason, as far as we knew.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
You counter-mandit the decision has done a rise.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yes, sir.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
That was not the reason, but.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
I have told you the circumstances of the business.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
That was that for the purposes.

08:29.000 --> 08:38.000
The story of preserving a good relationship with men and women with cards, is the counter-mandit

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
the order of this fine General Rhyme for the commission.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, of course it was for the purpose of preserving a good relationship with the committee.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
The request was made to it that the man was wanted for committee business.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
It was not the logic of the Committee General Rhyme for Dick, and he was not in his training

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
cycle, and the secretary had stated that he would try and make the soldier available when

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
it did not interfere with his dreams.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
The Sadams don't you know as a matter of fact that General Rhyme was advised by you and by

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
the secretary.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
The bear was alive at Fort Dick's on November 10th, they tried it and invested in battling

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
the T-rated giant, and that he was a member of the McCarthy Committee.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
You got it, yes sir.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
I am that on occasion when the General, when it was the Papa, the General was allowed him

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
weekend passes, even passes during the week for the Papa's.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
I said in the chairman, I don't want to interrupt, but we were going to terminate the hearing

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
to 10 of 12, the pay respect to our beloved friends.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
After that now and I respectfully request that we be allowed the press to the crowd in order

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
that we can be at the Tenant Floor at 12 o'clock.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
We will turn it into a two-stop protection room.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
The fact that we are always pleased to have our fellow citizens come in and watch the

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
processes of the Public Business Congressional Committee.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
You are welcome here, but the committee has a standing rule that if there are any audible

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
manifestations of approval or disapproval at any time, the officers and the playing clothesmen

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
and the audience have standing instructions from the committee to politely escort from

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
the room without further instructions from the chair those who violate the conditions under which they

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
come.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
I think I should also say injustice to the council for the benefit of those who may have come

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
in late who are not familiar with our committee rules.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
All they yesterday he interrogated Mr. Adams on what he called direct testimony, which

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
just to help bring out and put into the records the accusations and the allegations that Mr.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Adams has to make.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
The day he is cross examining him and his new role puts him in the first place as an

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
officer.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
The governor who tries to bring out the facts helpful to Mr. Adams today he is endeavoring

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
to bring out the facts which are injurious to Mr. Adams and which will tend to attack his

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
case.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
And those who hear only one, just of the hearing or the other are inclined to think that the

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
council has chosen so that he has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Row and is working on one

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
of the other of those today is Dr. Jekyll.

11:35.000 --> 11:46.000
You may proceed with the Dr. Jekyll's examination which may be coming the way.

11:46.000 --> 12:07.400
The madam's I was asking you about whether or not you knew that General Ryan had been advised

12:07.400 --> 12:13.800
that a pilot's ironing that he would soon arrive at Fort Dix for the name of G David Chan

12:13.800 --> 12:14.800
Rehrez.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.800
You don't always get to know that.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.800
That fact did occur.

12:20.800 --> 12:27.440
Yes, sir, I did not know of the advice to General Ryan on the occasion when the secretary

12:27.440 --> 12:33.140
talked to him but I became aware of it sometime later that the secretary had talked to General

12:33.140 --> 12:35.160
Ryan on the 3rd of November.

12:35.160 --> 12:43.660
You know why it was necessary for the secretary of the Army to notify a general in the Army

12:43.660 --> 12:51.160
and the commander-in-chief of a particular Army post that the time was opposing when he

12:51.160 --> 13:00.600
had certain individuals and inducted with a rise while all the other people, the name of

13:00.600 --> 13:04.600
this young man to the Bimstick Thou.

13:04.600 --> 13:11.800
Well, it's my understanding, sir, that Mr. Staden's since that weekend at his home in

13:11.800 --> 13:16.080
Wayne State of New Jersey, which is just 8 or 10 miles, both from Camp Kilmer and from

13:16.080 --> 13:17.080
Fort Dix.

13:17.080 --> 13:23.000
And that while he was there over the weekend, he stayed over to vote in the New Jersey election

13:23.000 --> 13:27.600
on a good day and on Monday of that week he made a call on both folks.

13:27.600 --> 13:32.080
And it's all for a secretary of the Army's order purpose of inspecting the party and one

13:32.080 --> 13:39.040
of the things that he told General Ryan was that private time was due to a rise very shortly

13:39.040 --> 13:40.800
at Fort Dix.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.800
How many privates arrived at Fort on an average?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
A day or a week?

13:46.800 --> 13:47.800
Do you have any idea?

13:47.800 --> 13:48.800
No, sir, I do not.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.800
It's a very large hope.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.080
And it's the basic training station.

13:54.080 --> 14:00.400
I am guessing, but I suspect that they come in the neighborhood of the 10,000 a month.

14:00.400 --> 14:04.680
I might be off by 60 percent, maybe 20,000 a month, maybe only 2000.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.800
I said very large, but I don't know what it's done.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.800
Several hundred each day, Mr. Hatton.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.800
Yes, sir.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.920
I would suspect on an average perhaps not every day, but there is a regular input from the

14:14.920 --> 14:17.920
New York New Jersey area.

14:17.920 --> 14:23.920
Assuming there were several hundred inductees arriving at Fort Dix these days, do you know

14:23.920 --> 14:29.440
whether or not either you are the secretary, Everdiss, Mr. General Ryan, of the arrival

14:29.440 --> 14:32.560
of any other inductee other than Sky?

14:32.560 --> 14:33.560
I never did, sir.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.560
I don't think the secretary did.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
I can't speak for him.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.560
But I don't think he did.

14:37.560 --> 14:43.220
So that General Ryan was no doubt a prize, as the fact that here was something extra

14:43.220 --> 14:45.240
special coming in the form of Sky.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.240
Yes, sir.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.240
Is that right?

14:47.240 --> 14:48.240
Yes, sir.

14:48.960 --> 14:54.000
And when General Ryan called you and told you that here was the young man who was running

14:54.000 --> 15:00.160
a long weekend fight, and he didn't end his kiddie, you can tell me to the secretary

15:00.160 --> 15:05.520
about this one inductee out of 30,000 for Dick and counter-mandated General's orders.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.520
That is correct, sir.

15:06.520 --> 15:12.640
I must qualify if I say that General Ryan did not say to me that the young man wanted

15:12.640 --> 15:18.480
to pass, he stated that the committee had recruited a secretary on how long he can.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.160
That was the committee that was investigating the army.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.160
Yes, sir.

15:22.160 --> 15:28.560
And that was an investigation about which you were either neutral or indifferent.

15:28.560 --> 15:35.360
No, sir, I think I corrected that in different statements before.

15:35.360 --> 15:42.360
No, that was an investigation in which we were participating, which we were very much

15:42.360 --> 15:48.760
interested in, which had been continuing for a month or six weeks.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.000
Committee, you said in which you were very interested.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
That's correct, sir.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.200
And I was, do you mean you're interested in continuing this investigation report, Mama?

15:56.200 --> 15:58.200
Are in this continuing?

15:58.200 --> 16:02.840
Well, I think you guys drag us a normal settle.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.840
And I insist that you do it.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.040
Well, very, is that continuing or in this continuing?

16:08.040 --> 16:11.240
No, sir, I said, been continuing or discontinuing.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.920
And I insist on a yes or no answer.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.920
That's what he said.

16:15.920 --> 16:16.920
That's what he said.

16:16.920 --> 16:17.920
You can't answer that.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.560
The SNL, if you say continuing or just as well, say through that.

16:21.560 --> 16:22.960
What's in this, madam?

16:22.960 --> 16:25.520
You say that is what the committee is.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.760
I'm talking about the McCarthy Investigating Committee.

16:29.760 --> 16:33.160
And you said that you were interested in that committee.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.160
Yes, sir.

16:34.160 --> 16:38.160
I'm asking you if you were interested in that committee continuing on the one hand

16:38.160 --> 16:41.080
that is in the investigation report, Mama?

16:41.080 --> 16:43.480
Are in this continuing?

16:43.480 --> 16:48.680
We were interested in a discontinuation of the sort of hearings that you've been going

16:48.680 --> 16:49.680
on.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.480
We were not interested.

16:51.480 --> 16:54.280
We were not interested in doing a fair with the sort of investigation.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.280
Very well.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.920
Now you have spoken frequently today of the sort of hearings that we're going on.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.240
And you say they met with you this approval?

17:02.240 --> 17:04.400
What sort of hearings?

17:04.400 --> 17:06.840
We're going on.

17:06.840 --> 17:15.600
Well, the last, the hearings we've been going on between the eight-to-bottles and about

17:15.600 --> 17:20.080
the fifth of November by the hearings to which I all is.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.800
They had suspended subsequently the fifth of November and up to the eighteenth of November

17:24.800 --> 17:26.840
there had been no further hearings.

17:26.840 --> 17:33.040
But during the periods from early October until early November, there had been a period

17:33.040 --> 17:39.920
of hearings in which there had been no paper accounts resulting from these executive hearings.

17:39.920 --> 17:45.760
And the paper accounts seemed to us to be leaving an unfair impression of the existence

17:45.760 --> 17:48.920
of SNI and an SNI network at Fort Mama.

17:48.920 --> 18:01.120
It did not appear to us in the fact that the interrogation and the transcripts between

18:01.120 --> 18:08.120
had been exactly borrowered in these paper stories which have resulted from and we felt

18:08.120 --> 18:11.120
that in that respect to hearing from fair.

18:11.120 --> 18:14.520
Then Mr. Adams is on our getting.

18:14.520 --> 18:20.780
The thing that met with yours in the secretary's disaffoable was the type of newspaper public

18:20.780 --> 18:23.280
disease that was flowing from the investigation.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.280
Is that right?

18:24.280 --> 18:25.280
From the hearings.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.280
From the watch?

18:26.280 --> 18:27.280
From the hearings.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.280
From the hearings?

18:28.280 --> 18:29.280
Yes.

18:29.280 --> 18:35.080
From the hearings, I was just a newspaper accounts of the hearings that were disaffoable

18:35.080 --> 18:37.600
to you are a message of your disaffoable.

18:37.600 --> 18:42.080
Well the hearings resulted in the newspaper accounts they were the same thing.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.680
Each hearing was followed immediately by a press conference.

18:45.680 --> 18:49.200
And the results of the hearings were reported to the press.

18:49.200 --> 18:54.560
The press did not have available studios for transcripts and the use of the reports which

18:54.560 --> 18:58.280
were given as the basis for the news story.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.280
And they did not seem to up.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.280
Is that?

19:01.280 --> 19:09.280
They did seem to up to the Army who are being put in the bidet your were will.

19:09.280 --> 19:14.280
They did seem to up to the Army who are that were coming in for a great deal of criticism

19:14.280 --> 19:19.280
and the doubts and suspicions were being raised in the minds of many people and worried

19:19.280 --> 19:22.280
and the people in the country based on the news stories.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
Very well.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.280
Now Mr. Adams will be lagged from the hearings.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.280
The results of the hearings?

19:26.280 --> 19:27.280
Yes.

19:27.280 --> 19:37.280
Then are we to conclude now that it was not the hearings that were obnoxious to you.

19:37.280 --> 19:44.280
It was the newspaper accounts of the hearings that were putting the morale of the Army.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.280
Now are we right or are we wrong?

19:47.280 --> 19:49.280
Well I think that is correct.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.280
Now that's correct.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.280
We've got an emergency right now.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.280
Very well.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.280
Now you've been talking about the type of hearings, Mr. Adams.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.280
All morning, haven't you?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.280
Yes.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.280
And that's what you objected to.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.280
Yes, sir.

20:02.280 --> 20:06.280
Now you say that it's not the type of hearings that Senator McCarthy was conducting,

20:06.280 --> 20:09.280
but the type of newspaper publicity.

20:09.280 --> 20:14.280
Well, an indictment against the young ladies and gentlemen here today,

20:14.280 --> 20:17.280
as well as other purvellers of the news.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.280
A rather than against Senator McCarthy.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.280
Now I'm right about that.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.280
Are we wrong?

20:22.280 --> 20:24.280
Well, I don't think you're right, sir.

20:24.280 --> 20:28.280
Well, for this reason.

20:28.280 --> 20:33.280
New paper reporters can report only what they can see or what they can hear.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.280
They can report only what they're told.

20:36.280 --> 20:41.280
And the newspaper reporters who attend this hearings can report to hearing assets,

20:41.280 --> 20:44.280
but if the hearing were behind closed doors,

20:44.280 --> 20:49.280
and if one individual were to leave the hearing, and were to report,

20:49.280 --> 20:52.280
and there were no other sorts of information available to the newspapers.

20:52.280 --> 20:58.280
The newspapers would all report exactly what that individual advised them had occurred.

20:58.280 --> 21:08.280
The saddens are you saying that it's a meeting now that these newspaper reporters cannot and do not find out what goes on

21:08.280 --> 21:10.280
but must the hands closed doors?

21:10.280 --> 21:12.280
And any security service?

21:12.280 --> 21:15.280
Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't care.

21:16.280 --> 21:18.280
All right, now that's better.

21:18.280 --> 21:22.280
But it was the newspaper published in the Q-objection, too.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.280
Now we'll be right about that, aren't we?

21:24.280 --> 21:28.280
Well, I'd say the newspaper stories, Mr. Stevens, that the type of hearings,

21:28.280 --> 21:33.280
the type of hearings on the newspaper stories were meldent practically into one.

21:33.280 --> 21:38.280
Because the hearings were always followed immediately by a press conference.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.280
And the press conference resulted in the newspaper stories.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.280
The press conference was a part of the executive leaders.

21:45.280 --> 21:57.280
Mr. Adams, if Senator McCarthy was successful in causing the distinction of 30 odds, security risks,

21:57.280 --> 22:01.280
which fact was publicized to the American people?

22:01.280 --> 22:11.280
Don't you think that it was a saluting policy for this nation to know that there were such a burden in the army?

22:11.280 --> 22:20.280
And to know that we had an agent six, which by diligence and its expertise was able to fade out

22:20.280 --> 22:23.280
and thinpoint them and cause this distinction.

22:23.280 --> 22:27.280
Don't you agree with that, Mr. Adams?

22:27.280 --> 22:31.280
I think with that, Mr. Adams.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.280
It's a very long question, sir.

22:34.280 --> 22:37.280
I think that's what you're asking me.

22:37.280 --> 22:46.280
If I do, I agree that it's a good thing that every suspension is made public at the time it occurs.

22:46.280 --> 22:50.280
And I can only answer that if that is the question, sir.

22:50.280 --> 22:58.280
That is, at fundamental or at specific variance with the policy and the which,

22:58.280 --> 23:03.280
the executive agency all have operated for as long as I have been in the government

23:03.280 --> 23:18.280
because the programs and the primary objectives always and my recollection has been first to defy the person from sensitive work

23:18.280 --> 23:22.280
if he is under any sort of a cloud of suspicion.

23:22.280 --> 23:29.280
The demand to proceed to evaluate a state through hearing boards and through proper procedures,

23:29.280 --> 23:35.280
make an ultimate decision on them and terminate his employment or reinstate him.

23:35.280 --> 23:44.280
One of the reasons for that, sir, is that in many cases individuals who are suspended ultimately are reinstateed

23:44.280 --> 23:51.280
and to announce publicly that an individual or a group of individuals have since descended

23:51.280 --> 24:00.280
if these individuals are ultimately proved innocence does great disservice to them as individuals in some cases rectilize

24:00.280 --> 24:10.280
and to be the primary purpose for the security and the administration of the loyalty program is to protect the innocent.

24:10.280 --> 24:16.280
Now, among the 30 somehow people who were suspended, primary purpose was to protect the innocent,

24:16.280 --> 24:22.280
the primary purpose of the security of the loyalty program is to protect the innocent.

24:22.280 --> 24:31.280
Now, among the people who were suspended at Fort Monmouth, there have been about 10 who were reinstateed,

24:31.280 --> 24:34.280
some of whom have been given full clearance.

24:34.280 --> 24:43.280
Had we announced publicly who they were, we would have done into a referendum today forever

24:43.280 --> 24:49.280
and each additional step designed for security and the administration of the loyalty program

24:49.280 --> 24:53.280
whether you announce the numbers, whether you announce the name, just give all for the same purpose.

24:53.280 --> 25:03.280
That is to administer the program in turn as whoever you place some hand, where the human state is being introduced.

25:03.280 --> 25:11.280
I said about and have been reinstated and some have been given full security clearance.

25:11.280 --> 25:17.280
Have any of the suspended employees ever been reinstated to which the defendant was reinstated?

25:17.280 --> 25:20.280
But the Army alone on its own immediately?

25:20.280 --> 25:23.280
Of those first, seven, six or seven?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.280
Yes.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.280
The answer is no.

25:28.280 --> 25:35.280
So, well, has the Army, to your knowledge, ever suspended a risk that was later reinstated?

25:35.280 --> 25:37.280
Yes, sir.

25:37.280 --> 25:44.280
That does not distract, however, from the importance of your work in affecting the suspension that it does not.

25:44.280 --> 25:57.280
Well, by the same token, it does not distract from the importance of Senator McCus's work not in bringing about a suspension of 30-odd employees that you're not attempting to minimize.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
I am not.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.280
The party discredited his committees.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.280
I am not.

26:01.280 --> 26:16.280
When you say it's a little high level, I told us about the hypothermations and about the inability of the newspaper to correctly get the testimony.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.280
The newspaper's returning.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.280
Let me ask you this.

26:20.280 --> 26:25.280
Did you object to any open hearings by Senator McCus's committee?

26:25.280 --> 26:26.280
No.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.280
Never did.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.280
That's my knowledge.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.280
Just the cold hearings.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.280
I'm afraid of them.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.280
I think we're entitled to a yes or no answer to that question.

26:35.280 --> 26:41.280
And the question is, did you ever object to an open hearing by Senator McCus's committee?

26:41.280 --> 26:42.280
Oh, yes.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.280
I'm in sixth November.

26:43.280 --> 26:51.280
When we were having lunch in the secretary's office, and if it was supposed they would have open hearings on the fourth month matter,

26:51.280 --> 27:00.280
when the matter, when the pattern, how they hearing the run was described, I think, to that.

27:00.280 --> 27:09.280
Did you ever own any other opinion of the picture and open hearing of the McCus's committee and I for a yes or no answer to that question?

27:09.280 --> 27:13.280
I remember no effect.

27:13.280 --> 27:19.280
I know you like the yes or no, but I don't know that I'm trying to follow five to this effect.

27:19.280 --> 27:33.280
There were two subjects when I opened hearing, one around November 24th, one on December 8th in Washington.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.280
I have no recollection of having other cases.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.280
Well, Mr. Adams, I want to see the search through memory now.

27:39.280 --> 27:45.280
I have searched my memory in Mr. Jenkins for eight weeks on all facets of his matter and I'm telling you all I have.

27:45.280 --> 27:58.280
I have been searching on this particular basis, so whether or not some several objectives except on November 6th to an open hearing by Senator Maccadie on Fort Mama.

27:58.280 --> 28:04.280
During the luncheon on November 17th, there may have been discussions of the full open hearings.

28:04.280 --> 28:09.280
I don't recall having objected to them at that time.

28:09.280 --> 28:14.280
If it came quite obvious to us to be open hearings, we're going to occur.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.280
I don't recall having any questions.

28:16.280 --> 28:20.280
Did you want open hearings to add on the not particularly note here?

28:20.280 --> 28:25.280
Did you object to open hearings to that?

28:28.280 --> 28:33.280
I don't recall objecting in stuck-away as to a stuck-

28:33.280 --> 28:37.280
I may have been told that open hearings were scheduled.

28:37.280 --> 28:51.280
I may have been told we want this witness and this and the pattern we're going to establish is this and I may have expressed some irritation that I don't think this is fair.

28:51.280 --> 28:57.280
It may have been a replacement of the things I said on November 6th, I do not specifically remember.

28:57.280 --> 29:05.280
I will not deny that there were conversations about the open hearings because I had the job of supplying the only witnesses.

29:05.280 --> 29:08.280
And the telephone call came to me regularly.

29:08.280 --> 29:17.280
Did you have any preference to whether or not the censors had conduct an open-air closing hearings?

29:17.280 --> 29:19.280
I don't think I had a preference.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.280
No preference.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.280
All right, farewell.

29:21.280 --> 29:29.280
Now your attention, particularly as a closing hearing was, that the newspaper reported to not get the testimony in its proper life.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.280
That's right.

29:30.280 --> 29:35.280
Now you say that you have no preference between an open and a full hearing.

29:35.280 --> 29:40.280
In an open hearing, Mr. Adam, you know that the press could be present and get it verbatim.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.280
That is right. That is right.

29:42.280 --> 29:59.280
So, does not that enjoy your serious, serious mounted cure from mouth-gating and offering the best committees that the objections of the games were to distortion by the newspapers of what actually transpired?

29:59.280 --> 30:01.280
Doesn't it?

30:01.280 --> 30:08.280
Has somebody said, I misjerk the rough out from under such a proposition?

30:08.280 --> 30:10.280
You say you have no preference?

30:10.280 --> 30:12.280
Well, I don't think so, sir.

30:12.280 --> 30:18.280
And in an open hearing, now there wouldn't have been this distorted newspaper inauguration.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.280
That is correct.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.280
There would not have been.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.280
And up to that time, I had never seen an open hearing here.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.280
I'm being hearing you.

30:25.280 --> 30:30.280
You have to vote, you have to vote, you have to vote, you have to stand and read that.

30:30.280 --> 30:34.280
You have to read that as possible, Mr. Namibus, you're the plurable every time.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.280
Rather than be my tenant.

30:46.280 --> 30:52.280
There is now a vote on the floor of the Senate and the eight members of that body who are present in this room

30:52.280 --> 30:57.280
and engage in the business of the hearing will must be for a few minutes, for the briefest,

30:57.280 --> 31:00.280
for over to the floor of the Senate's vote.
