WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Who had a soon-fetched from many responsibilities,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
that's never been occurred to you, that you've hurt us by.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
We did not hurt us by.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
We did not hurt us by.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
We did not hurt us if we did not have in both sides.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Yes, sir.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
I have been in both sides.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
That would be in both sides.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
But if you wouldn't be the most natural thing in the world,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
for you who are such a very serious even,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
or anybody who has been given that straight assignment of trust,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
the one who discharge this faithfully,

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
and decisively, and without the help, the assistance of an outside independent agent,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
wouldn't that be natural, Mr. Adam?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
I don't know.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
There's no criticism about it, but now I can help.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
You've asked me a long question, and it doesn't just be better to be an Englishman.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
I have known many officials of the executive branch of the government.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I have known practically none of them.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
In years that I have been in the government who have not welcomed me,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
welcomed me, and then pleased to have assistance from congressional committees.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
I have never heard Mr. Steven say anything other than that he has greatly respect

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
for the elected office of his country, a great respect for the legislature of this country,

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
and a continuing desire to assist and cooperate with the legislative body.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
So I do not think that it's correct to say that the fact that this congressional committee

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
or any other congressional committee had an interest in a matter of which was not being properly administered

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
had an agency subordinate to the secretary, the body of the secretary,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
because it did not.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
And he says the reactions of our subscribers would be unnatural.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
They would be unfair.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
They would be unnatural, but my knowledge is the secretary.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
You have no answer to RTLB about it.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
What about you?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
If you have been in the secretary of the army,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
matter of great fight is wrong.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Matter of responsibility is the necessary service.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Charge with the duty of cleaning out the army, getting these subordinates out of its right.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
And some other independent agencies is just in,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
and started doing work that you had failed to do.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Would your face feel alright?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Would you fight that you did to rule her?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Get an agency step in and do work that I had failed to do.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I would feel bad about it.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I don't think Mr. Steven had failed over the charge of obligation.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Why don't you say in your 40 days of basement care?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
That's...

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, you would have gotten this work done ultimately.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
If we think about by a son of the Macau's in his community.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Don't you say that without me, Madam?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I did say that, and there's very good reasons for that, sir.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Mr. Steven, the rest can self-presidentally do it,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
and rest can't self-presidentally do it, ordinarily.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
The office of the secretary of the army...

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
has responsibility for the entire field of the army.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
And we just people also think that they should have otherwise been doing it.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
The rest themselves, precisely, and quite succumb to this problem.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And that's the office of the state of the secretary of the office,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
personally, to be commanding general of the post.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
There are hundreds of military posts in the United States,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
and I would gather to get this on matters concerned with the administration of the post.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
The secretary of any of the one in one of the states has probably

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
been taught only to very few of them.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
The secretary talks also about the commanding general of the first army,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
under whose age and under whose jurisdiction is what one of the best,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
about a matter in its abort and echelon through that army headquarters,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
which is unusual.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
The post office is speed up in any case.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
If the secretary of any military department calls any post commander and says,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
I want you personally to do this to address yourself to this instead of your regular duties,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
or an extraduity or a good extra people on it.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
And if he states, rather, I am putting officials of my office on it,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
and I have directed the interview on echelon,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
also to put people, especially on it,

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
the work will get done faster.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
That's what happened in the case.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Those that you're saying, this is secretary, and I'm not charging you with it,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
was guilty of no dareliction of duty.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
No, no, no.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
But that's the work that was done more rapidly by reason of the intervention of Senator McCarthy.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Is that right?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
And by reason of the intervention of Secretary C.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
All right, well, now when you get,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
we do give Senator McCarthy and by the any credit, whatever.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
So that's right.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
You have to get any credit.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
All right, it's any credit.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
All right.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
Now then, it is time is important in leaking out the person who did not miss that.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Yes, it is.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Very well, we have placed in that, I read you, Father, from yours.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Time's fifth.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
On November 6th, at the end of the page, there's a statement.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Secretary C. Davis.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
A luncheon was held in the front.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
And the secretary, Steven DeNee, and Senator McCarthy, and Conan Haas.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.500
Mr. Steven's purpose was Father C.

04:41.500 --> 04:46.000
Suspended Senator McCarthy's statement of October 13th and 14th.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
He was ready to terminate the fort's mom last year,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
and turn the subcommittee findings over the army.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Not to slam their terminates.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Now, as do I get to get to that, that's the purpose of this luncheon of November 6th.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
Mr. Steven, watch the pursuant Father, these statements allegedly made for the senator on the 13th and 14th,

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
and he was ready to terminate, quit, and turn over to the committees.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Turn over to the army, the work he had been doing.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Is that what that statement is?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Is that a fair?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Is that statement the data?

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I'd like to have it read in very long cases.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I'll read it in a second.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I'll have to ask the secretary to pass it over.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
While the reporter is searching for the question, let's return to our studios across the country

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
to permit our station to identify them.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
This is ABC Television Network.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Delicious, former Secretary Conde, 59th, and Censipal,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
like a brand new Grand Union story,

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
collecting an avenue between Madison and Cesson Avenue and Cesson New Jersey.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Don't miss the night's 10th Pack Niforce,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
drawing him clear of Boston Blackest. That's not an eight.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Let's supervise 7W-80C Television New York.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Now back to Washington and the Army McCarty County.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Turn to the 17th and the findings over the army,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
and I ask you whether or not in the life

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
the rest statements made by you.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Both you and the secretary,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
not only wanted this suspension of Senator McCarty's words

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
but you wanted this termination of it,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
in surprise it's related to Fort Mama.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Is that a fair question or not?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
I don't think it's a fair assumption.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Because there was more to the luncheon than that.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
This 40-page statement of the conversation

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
is what's crooked and dead and 200-page.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
There were a number of circumstances surrounding the luncheon of November 6th,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
all of which were on the reasons for having luncheon,

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
one of which was, in addition to the fact that we were still aware

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
of what we consider to be the Democratic clear-faces of this plan.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
And we had an actual desire to ask and give this to what's going on.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
I had been receiving some very regularly from this cone

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
that there were independent news stories coming from sources within the Pentagon,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
which seemed to be or be generated from the top side,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
and which were not consistent with the announcements

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
that had been being made by Senator McCarty about hearing.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
And he was a little discontent about what he felt

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
where they had an effort on the fight of the Army

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
to issue conflicting statements from those that were being met

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
at the auditioning.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
And Mr. Steven also, I talked to him about those of those matters,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
and I told him that McCarty had made his offer

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
and that I had been to New York through a hearing on the 30th of October,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and that I didn't know whether it was going to continue any longer

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
or whether it was going to terminate Mr. Steven.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I think yesterday we could go together and see that,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
well, let's bring the envelope over lunch.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
That was the purpose of the lunch.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
It was not for the purpose of grinding it through a hole,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
we said that McCarty was not ready to grind it through a hole.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
We had also the concern, which was continuing to turn with us,

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
and which was building up about the threat statements from the Treasury.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
All right, I'm going to tell them that you've stayed here

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
for one of the purposes of the last luncheon in the mind of the Secretary

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
of the Department of Secretary of State,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
and I would say also that they're bothering you with an immobile round

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
or have to move around with the number of which they tell you there.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
The Secretary of State, until they're truly before I answer questions,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
they get their offer.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I think the Secretary of State is bothering the witness.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
They're wondering about it.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
The reason they didn't tell anything about it in the Christmas House.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
They understand the rules, they all lose, and they're quite a pile.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And it doesn't show anybody.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It doesn't really happen very much longer.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
This is going to have to suspend hearings or photographers can jump up and down.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
There is more important business currently before this country can take you taking.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
So let's proceed now to that month.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm getting back, sir.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I have to have the question asked again.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
All right, one, two, three, two, one.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I'll take you to the Parliament.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Question one, question one, Mr. Chairman.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Question, I understand Mr. Adam.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
I just say here that one of the purposes of that luncheon in the mind of the Secretary.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
The question was not finished before this.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Well, I don't think he said better than I think.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Mr. Stevens, purpose was further to pursue Senate Democratic statements

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
of officer was born, seen for 1314, but he was ready to terminate the report,

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
the board's monolith hearings and the subcommittee's findings go in the Army.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
That's correct, isn't it?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yes, sir.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Yes, sir, it is.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
And you say, however, there was no purpose to get Senator McCarthy to terminate the hearing.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, that isn't quite correct.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Where would this be getting to continue the hearing?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
No, it would not be getting to continue the hearing either.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
If I said there was no purpose to get him to terminate the hearing, that, of course, is not correct.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
By then, we were very aware of the...

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
...preferences in the statements that had been made about the hearing then.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
And we felt that the Army was receiving a very bad and very unfair press.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
And Mr. Stevens was very hopeful that the hearing could be terminated in some manner.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And that's the...

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
...mockage during back to the Army for further investigation.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Very well.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
I was still talking about whether or not your discharge was made against you,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
that you were trying to stop this committee's work and I reached out.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
During this lunch, and that's one of November 6th,

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Cones suggested that the committee have a few days of open hearing.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Had been none on Port Mama's last time.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You wanted it as he said to food, the espionage situation in Port Mama's.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
However, since there's been no showing of any current espionage,

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
since the plan of gangs as he outlined it was designed to be dealt by inference only.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Mr. Stevens and I objected to this program.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
So what program?

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
The deadline, the scheduled outline of hearing, open hearing,

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
in the matter of the suggested that they would be carried on.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
Mr. Cone, according to you here, says, let's have some open hearings on Port Mama's.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
That is right.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
The food that's in our situation, that is right.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
That is right.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
The discharge that this has, that is right, and it was a type of evidence.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
That's the suggest.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Well, I know, as you say here that he wanted, he said,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
suppose the espionage situation in Port Mama's.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
However, since there's been no showing of current espionage,

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
since the plan of gangs as he outlined it was designed to be dealt by inference only.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Mr. Stevens and I objected to this program.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Now you don't feel anything about it.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
You think about this as I do?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
No.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
But you say that definitely, if you objected to that program, what program is that?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
The proposal was open hearing in the matter of the proposed committee carried on.

11:52.000 --> 12:00.000
Then did you say, so that you and the secretary had no objections to the investigation

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
of Port Mama's switch investigation, including both the executive and the open days?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
We had no objections to the investigation.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
The thing that the secretary was opposed to, which we did last, was the type of hearing.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
That is right.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I read further.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
It seemed that the space matter, but the space.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
It seemed to me by now that hearings could be turned off at all.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
At home players, I was talking about hearings, he turned off at home players.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
And we now need to have the second meeting for us, the secretary, to keep the hearings going in better.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
We say this as that.

12:48.000 --> 12:56.000
That these hearings could be turned off at this phone players.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
And they had enough influence to turn them around to keep them going indefinitely.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
We're talking about hearings and hearings only aren't we?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yes.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
There are hearings and hearings only.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Mr. Here's your next statement.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Mr. Stevens, there for a statement.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
He was anxious to have the committee finish his work and was agreed to sign the papers for a weekend.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
And under exceptional conditions, the shines of the ability only can by his training.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
If the post-demand and maybe general ryan at least didn't you say, sir, Mr. Adams, in that very statement,

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
that Mr. Stevens agrees to these papers for these shines, because you've been used,

13:33.000 --> 13:39.000
that phone can turn its investigation off and on, and had enough influence over seven times as he's been going indefinitely.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Isn't that precisely what you said it is?

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
And that you were afraid in favor for a guy to give the investigation stop?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
No, I think so.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Very respectfully, Mr. Jenkins.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
You have read on the second page.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
And if you have picked it up, say a four-centred earlier and have read it, beginning with the second paragraph in the middle of page.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
No, I have read those to the places you concluded by this and they are the whole thing my son, this is it.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
All right, begin read now.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
Do you want me to read that or do you want me to read that or do you want me to read that?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
What do you read, Mr. Johnson?

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Say it once in a time, name your name by home for the time.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
These days, I have been spending several of my time spending the new work, which only time to do.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
And I would recommend that you all this time, be near the goal of the weekend and from time to time, on this night.

14:29.000 --> 14:40.000
The pharmacist in charge of this request by home, even though only a few weeks earlier, out of home present, he has strongly expressed to me and had later revealed that Mr. Jenkins is visiting me, signing with a little message in his name.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
It was difficult to disagree with home contention as the sign of the venture work.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
One of the requests was made in the presence of the chairman and agreed to by him.

14:47.000 --> 14:57.000
If we had physically, if we felt they had some great experience with home, that he might be no angered and as well, very well might express itself to hearing that in defenituration and bottom year.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
It seemed to me by now that he had been turned on and off its home players.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And we now know he has sufficient influence with the synergies he's hearing, going indefinitely.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Mr. Davis, there are four states.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
The Hewitt-Anxious, the health and committee finishes work.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
And what a great assurance that they'll have a little bit of weekend and under exception will send it in.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
The shine of the day will be on weekdays after training, if the post-command agrees.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Those questions, I mean, it doesn't mean too much.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
It doesn't mean too much, no.

15:21.000 --> 15:28.000
When you say bad, you just read it and I made it from the new paragraph, it was difficult to disagree with home contention as the sign of the venture work.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
When the request was made in the presence of the chairman and agreed to by him, why was it?

15:33.000 --> 15:42.000
Why was it more difficult to disagree with home alone in the presence of Senator McCrushen that it was alone, when he was alone?

15:43.000 --> 15:59.000
Well, yes, A. Concongression committee chairman and his chief counsel are together, taking to a official of the government and his chief counsel makes certain affirmative statements, which are asking or agreed to by the senator, it can only be assumed that that's the position of the senator.

16:00.000 --> 16:14.000
Funny if you were on firm ground, we respect to the army and its personnel and the citizens of its solid channels and its personnel and the words we were doing, we didn't ask the birches and come in and all that sort of thing.

16:14.000 --> 16:22.000
Why, Mr. Adams, this is a presence of your senator, Joe McCutty, having him go on to whatever lives and you'll just say it.

16:22.000 --> 16:32.000
This is our army, we're running it, we're running it right, just in the vegetable doomsday, which for his contrary was the sign of the day and the day of his reign, why didn't you say that, Adam?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Well, I just don't think I'll be here.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
All right, all right, all right. But you still say that.

16:37.000 --> 16:45.000
Speaking in new seconds, it's clean and easy to gain, it's just it turns them all on and off it's going to spread through, it's just it's done and it's done and it's done and it's done.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
All on and off it's done and it's done.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Let's make your friends.

16:49.000 --> 16:57.000
Mr. Stevens, the airport stated that he was anxious to have to commit a finished work, isn't that saying that in view of the past.

16:57.000 --> 17:04.000
The Roy Cohn and T.C. Zering's going in definitely, that he can influence the senator's age and feel those facts.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
We are free to give shine long weekends or special dispensations.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
I don't think so, sir.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
That's not a fair interpretation of it.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
No, so Mr. Stevens, position with residents is done and my presence at least always works the same.

17:18.000 --> 17:32.000
And that was that he did not want anyone to be able to continue that he or the army had stepped in and had taken an essential official from this committee and had made it impossible for the committee to continue his investigation.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
It was for that reason that he made the first in session on two weeks to do it when the man was inducted.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
It was that reason for that reason that he made this week's session, this week's session.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
He wanted to assist the committee and he always wanted to assist the committee.

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
And it didn't matter if the decision wasn't based on Mr. Cohn's ability to do this between these investigations or not.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That's your idea, right?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
No, that's not that.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
It did not matter to the spectator you, Mr. Cohn, who's been in the investigation going on and definitely did.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
That is why that was not even a sensitivity factor.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
You're bringing just a loud shyly gentle.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, what's the contributing factor?

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
I had nothing to do with the decision. Mr. Stevens made the decision and so by as he was in turn, I am sure it was not a contributing factor with him.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
There was only one factor.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Chine was required by the committee and he wanted to get him to the committee.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It was not a contributing factor with him.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I had nothing to do with the decision.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Mr. Stevens made the decision.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I had no entitlement for the decision in that case.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
I didn't even focus on the decision and he wouldn't have consulted.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Although I have been further, you were.

18:42.000 --> 18:52.000
And there were still talking about the charge at UN Secretary by the broadcasters investigation report moments in which you say 730 ought to proceed.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Our perforated duty risk was suspended.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
General McCarthy found that he could try to terminate the fort mom with hearings in an early days.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
And began an investigation of communist and labor unions in the bank plan.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
We were pleased with the prospects of an early end of the year.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
And with the prospects of an end to the demoralizing publicity which you'd result as their promise.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
Mr. Adams, as I gather, as I am perforated, you have made two statements of facts.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
We were pleased with the prospects of an early end of the year.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
Is that correct? Yes, sir?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
And yet I believe that you're position.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
That it was a matter of a different thing.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
No, no, I told you earlier that if I had said it was a matter of this difference, that is not the right thing.

19:45.000 --> 19:54.000
I would equally concerned that Mr. Decker said, with Mr. Steven, about the type of hearings and the publicity which is resulting there from.

19:54.000 --> 20:04.000
But as to whether an investigation continues from a professional point of view in the office of the Department of Counselor, it's just an investigation.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I'm so glad you like the word.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Thank you very much.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
And do you still say that you have no desire, however slight.

20:13.000 --> 20:25.000
I don't think we, I don't think that it's the right to say that we have no desire, however slight.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
But I think that's the right to say that yes or no.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I think that's the right to say that yes or no.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, Mr. Jenkins, I don't.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
If you say we question, it doesn't seem any as always, but yes or no.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
When I ask you now whether or not you, when you say it is the same, but I have this right.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
And in view of previous statements, I just say, when I ask you now whether or not you have any desire, however slight.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
We're done as a precaution, accept, and this, continue our suspend their investigations, report my list.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Can you answer that yes or no?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I don't think that's the answer.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
You don't think you know either.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, you leave that in your answer if you want.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Well, I can't answer it yes or no because it isn't the testable of the yes or no.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Some of these things have got to be in trouble with it.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
And if you'll give your permission now, let's go.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
It calls.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm not going to argue with you.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
We're going to pay for that.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
If you've got your answer now, I put you on leave with the committee.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
If you're right.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
If you cannot answer that simple question, yes or no?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I'm going to go.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I don't like it a lot.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
But what I said is that it can't.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
And the author's to explain why.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I don't care if the witness wants to leave that way, it's all right with me.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
But if he does want to explain why and give the answer.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
I'm going to send a senator in and say, I'll say, you get franky,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
but I didn't get the impression that he wanted to talk about it.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
If he does, I expect me to have no dissolution to the end of the rough.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Huh?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Uh, Mr. Adams.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
I've got a hard answer.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I did not mean to rush it to work.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I'm going to do the other thing that you desire to make as well.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I think I have.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Uh, would like to say this.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
Uh, the purpose of one of the purposes of November 6th is meeting.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
What I was afraid to follow up, what I considered in the way of an author

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
was sending a context that the investigation and the hearings were about

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
concluding the fires and the McCarthy with concern.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
And he was ready to turn those matters back to the end.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
Uh, when you have something in advance with something of that sort in the day end,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
well, one of the things you would have to do is to conclude.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
Uh, my conversation that day was in the county where directed toward that end

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
because of what I considered to be preliminary suggestions,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
which might be followed with satisfactory conclusion.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
We were not happy with the hearings.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
We were not happy with the publicity that was going from the hearings.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
Uh, as to whether or not the committee continues to investigate

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
uh, what monoliths and other places, that was not a matter which concerned us.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
It was the hearings and the publicity which monoliths.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
And I apologize to you, Mr. Jenkins, if I have failed to get the little answer requested for you.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I was tempted. Yes, no answer were I can.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
But you cannot answer my life's question.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Will you read the question please?

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
Whatever, if the question is answered is never too good to respond.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
If you reply, I'll let you know.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
I'll find out the time it has to be resolved.

23:33.000 --> 23:43.000
I'll have a clear message.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
What are you saying?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
No answer, I'll answer the question again.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
You better go ahead and go ahead.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Mr. Jenkins, how do you understand that?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Mr. Jenkins, what are you saying?

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Johnson.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
There's no place for no answer.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Mr. Jenkins, I suggest that the question be re-read,

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
where I always thank Mr. Jenkins against what he's looking for.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
If it's at all possible and I like to have the question re-read.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I'm scared of the question.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
This is what it means to write in one.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Somebody said he's thinking might just want to be read.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I think that's a different question to be read.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
It just hasn't been read because the reporter is served all of me.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
You see another one now.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
It's been a really different question.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Now I'm as people ask the questions to be read.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I'd like to share the question if you spend these interagitories

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
and color quizzes or degrees.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
I think there's a job before everybody gets halfway through each note.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Go ahead.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Question.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
When I ask you now whether or not you,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
when you decade as a saver, I have just read.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
And in view of previous statements, I have just read.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
When I ask you now whether or not you had any desire, however slight,

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
or Senator McCarty and his staff to discontinue or suspend their investigations

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
or for them, can you answer that for yes or no?

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
It's a way to investigation reviews.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
I think the answer is in the negative.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
I didn't care how long they can continue to investigate.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
That would not within the curfew of the Army,

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
and if I had to suggest it during a previous testimony,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
this morning that I did care, it was not accurate.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
That's a normal function of the investigating committee.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Mr. Adam, on November 13th, the Secretary of the State

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
went to the press to the effect that insofar as the Army

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
have been able to determine that this did no current

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
espionage support mama that is correctively.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yes.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
If they are so there, I answer.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
You received a telephone call from the scone this month.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
I think I received a telephone call from the scone that night.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
I heard the press had disseminated that smug news.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Brother, I said what mean it's that?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yes.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I asked you whether or not you've been,

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
as the secretary has been,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Dr. E. Coli.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Something like that, I guess.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yes.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I answered that in the affirmative.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Yes.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Mr. Adam, you learned very well in the set statement

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
of the Secretary, and again, call to the real.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Are I in your own private home list?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Yes, sir.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
I will ask you whether or not

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
they are so there, I answer.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You call to the phone yourself.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Well, I had a call from Mr. Coli on Friday night,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
and I had another call coming on Saturday.
