00:00.000 --> 00:29.760
There's Mr. Jenkins now, joined Senator Tom on his acute new position.

00:29.760 --> 00:39.760
The right of the chairman is on the left of the chairman, but on the right of the chairman.

00:39.880 --> 00:51.280
Mr. Jenkins from the Chant Council, Mr. Senator Jenkins, for Funk Claire on the left, and Mr. Welch on the right, they are the councilman and the Associate Council for the Army in this inquiry.

00:51.280 --> 01:05.280
Now Mr. Charles Mayner and the Associate Council of Mr. Jenkins interrupts the proceedings for a moment, and now it does look like we will be underway.

01:05.280 --> 01:12.280
Mr. Wittler, you have a duty to run a meeting with the record, he's locked up in my safe and my office.

01:12.280 --> 01:16.280
You're a landlord, I didn't know what it was.

01:16.280 --> 01:20.280
By the time we get through with our preliminary announcements, we'll be ready.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.280
Yes, your ma'am, all in tomorrow.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.280
Yes, that's a great question.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.280
We'll get him.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.280
We'll get him.

01:26.280 --> 01:46.280
Chair would like to welcome our guests this pretty Monday morning and tell you that we're happy to have you as our guests to attend the committee hearings, and to remind you of a standing committee rule, which the Chair has repeated many, many times during the year.

01:46.280 --> 01:57.280
That rule is to the effect that there are to be no other room manifestations of approval or disapproval of any time, at any time during the year.

01:57.280 --> 02:15.280
And to enforce the rule and maintain order, the uniformed officers that you see before you and the plain clothes people scattered to the audience, have standing instructions from the committee to remove from the room immediately, politely and firmly.

02:15.280 --> 02:26.280
Anyone who for reasons, just knowing himself might choose to violate the chair, but which you entered the committee rule, namely to refrain from multiple manifestations of approval or disapproval.

02:26.280 --> 02:31.280
Our audiences have been magnificent, your cooperation has been split.

02:31.280 --> 02:42.280
We resume this morning where we left off Friday afternoon, reading into the record the monitored call, so it has become part of the evidence in this country.

02:43.280 --> 02:59.280
And so we will ask Mr. Lucas and his two associates to take the stand and repress hearing the first call, monitor calls, it will be in evidence of those of Senator McCullough.

03:00.280 --> 03:06.280
We soon to the agreement we made with Senator McCullough and Friday afternoon, he had called the way shortly before the meeting ended.

03:06.280 --> 03:25.280
So if whichever of the monitors covered Senator McCullough's call will take the stand at the witness table, Senator McCullough will begin by asking some preliminary questions, and by that time I'm sure the calls themselves will have come down from the office upstairs.

03:30.280 --> 03:35.280
Mr. Williams, please.

03:35.280 --> 03:44.280
Mr. Williams, you are again sworn, you've been kept behind the certain call, telephone call that you monitor.

03:44.280 --> 03:51.280
Yes, sir, regarding this office secretary, do you monitor any calls of the second day of the arm and make the meeting?

03:51.280 --> 03:55.280
Yes, sir, I know. How many?

03:55.280 --> 04:07.280
I want to monitor. I'm going to have a copy of them. How many heavy loads together? Do you have two copies there?

04:07.280 --> 04:13.280
Well, that's why I want to copy it, sir. But by I copy it we can proceed.

04:13.280 --> 04:18.280
We get one in a minute. You only monitor one. Yes, sir. What date was it?

04:18.280 --> 04:28.280
That 20th February, sir. So, that was the 20th? Yes, sir. Is that the first call that was monitored?

04:28.280 --> 04:44.280
Yes, sir. One of the date of the other is that you have there. Mr. Lucas has one of March 1. March 1. What other is the hour? That is all, sir.

04:44.280 --> 04:52.280
Well, I thought it was three hours, sir. I want to make it harder. I think that after you, I think Mr. Williams, you have to get them a benefit.

04:52.280 --> 04:58.280
Yes. But that date, so I can present them in front of all of the pillow.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.280
21th February, Mr. Pike, had that one, sir.

05:02.280 --> 05:06.280
February 21, are you monitoring two?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.280
Hello? What's the new monitor?

05:08.280 --> 05:14.280
I'm Marker, the one on 25th February, sir. Mr. Williams, who monitor the one on March 1?

05:14.280 --> 05:15.280
Mr. Lucas, sir.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.280
Lucas. Yes, sir.

05:18.280 --> 05:22.280
Everyone, they have in this February, I thought.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.280
28th February, you say? Yes, sir, Mrs. Pike.

05:26.280 --> 05:31.280
21th February, you may say, yes, sir.

05:31.280 --> 05:38.280
All right. If you're the range, you're not going to introduce them and testify to them and you found a lot of people out there out.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.280
We shade it. Yours is February 20th.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.280
Yes, sir.

05:43.280 --> 05:48.280
I don't know how to copy the folder, but let's proceed. I don't know how to do that.

05:48.280 --> 05:52.280
On February 20th, what code do you have?

05:52.280 --> 05:56.280
955, the Secretary of the Army of Foreign Center, John McQuarrion.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.280
As a Secretary of the Army, call me.

05:59.280 --> 06:04.280
Yes, sir. All right. What would you say, Secretary of the Army?

06:04.280 --> 06:09.280
I appreciate it if you're paying yesterday afternoon and I will tell you why I call this morning.

06:09.280 --> 06:18.280
When I found out what Senator McCarthy's address was, which I didn't find out until this morning, it happened to be the Ten I Coltell in Albany.

06:18.280 --> 06:28.280
I telephoned him a few minutes ago because I thought it was a fair and proper thing that I should tell him that I had been up on the hill and talked with you and other members of the committee yesterday.

06:28.280 --> 06:38.280
Afternoon and just what I said and of course, Senator McCarthy didn't like that at all and he hopped on me pretty hard.

06:38.280 --> 06:44.280
And I told him I was not going to let General Wicker appear at that public hearing up there on Tuesday morning.

06:44.280 --> 06:52.280
Maybe eventually we will have to produce him, but I was not going to let him go through again what he had gone through before.

06:52.280 --> 06:56.280
Senator McQuarrion, I wonder if he denied that statement.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.280
Secretary of the Army.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.280
You know what statement was referred to?

07:02.280 --> 07:06.280
What statement was referred to?

07:06.280 --> 07:09.280
I presume the statement of General Wicker I do not know sir.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.280
All right, we'll see.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.280
Secretary of the Army.

07:14.280 --> 07:21.280
I have understood John, I don't know whether this would tie in with your information that it has all been sprickin' from the record.

07:21.280 --> 07:27.280
Senator McQuarrion, I can't get a copy until Monday probably. Secretary of the Army.

07:27.280 --> 07:32.280
I think you are going to find that out, but I have a statement on my desk this morning from General Wicker.

07:32.280 --> 07:39.280
I couldn't get a copy of what, so when there's a transcript to the hearing, I presume sir, yes sir.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.280
All right, so see.

07:43.280 --> 07:50.280
Secretary of the Army, I think you are going to find out that out, but I have a statement on my desk this morning from General Wicker.

07:50.280 --> 07:55.280
I think you are going to find out that General Wicker was coming from General Wicker, which covers all those statements.

07:55.280 --> 08:02.280
And as I told you, I think his captain, a medical man, was with him and I can produce him.

08:02.280 --> 08:07.280
Senator McQuarrion, I tell you what we will do.

08:07.280 --> 08:14.280
We will find out the name of the reporter that took that, and I will call him for an accurate transcript of what happened and what was frickened.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.280
Secretary of the Army, I think that is very important.

08:18.280 --> 08:26.280
I don't know the name of the reporter, but I will find out who and I will call on him for an accurate transcript.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.280
Secretary of the Army.

08:28.280 --> 08:35.280
Now the senator has, Nick was, maybe to use the word, abusive, would be a little strong.

08:35.280 --> 08:45.280
He was very rough with me on the telephone and he said, you mean you are going to continue to cover up Communists and not let those, these officers appear?

08:45.280 --> 08:50.280
And I said, you know Joe, I wouldn't cover up a Communist anymore than you would.

08:50.280 --> 08:57.280
I am interested in doing the right kind of job, but I am also interested in preserving the morale of our professional officer corps.

08:57.280 --> 09:02.280
And I feel that is, that is a duty I took under my oath of office.

09:02.280 --> 09:09.280
He asked me if I would accept a subpoena for 10 o'clock Tuesday morning and I said, I will take that under advisement.

09:09.280 --> 09:14.280
He said, are you refusing the subpoena? I said, I am not refusing it. I am not accepting it.

09:14.280 --> 09:19.280
I will take it under advisement, standing on up the phone. He wouldn't go beyond that.

09:19.280 --> 09:26.280
He really batted me pretty hard and said I would learn that you couldn't operate that way or something of that kind.

09:26.280 --> 09:35.280
As it stands now, John, he says that I am subpoena for 10 o'clock Tuesday morning and as I say, I have taken it under advisement.

09:35.280 --> 09:44.280
I want to talk to not only my council but also various members of the committee to see what the best thing to do now is.

09:44.280 --> 09:50.280
Senator McQuarram, I thought you were going to request a current secretary of the Army.

09:50.280 --> 09:55.280
I was in due time. I don't even know what committee it is.

09:55.280 --> 09:59.280
I presume it is the subcommittee, although he didn't pay so.

09:59.280 --> 10:05.280
I am perfectly willing and delighted to appear before the committee, whatever is the appropriate time.

10:05.280 --> 10:09.280
I want to satisfy myself that Tuesday morning is the appropriate time.

10:09.280 --> 10:17.280
Senator McQuarram, I was let it rest for the moment. You don't have the subpoena secretary of the Army. I don't have it now.

10:17.280 --> 10:28.280
Senator McQuarram, if you get one that is all right to get ahead of the thing now, I was announced to the press that I was going to request the opportunity to appear.

10:28.280 --> 10:37.280
Secretary of the Army, I think that is a good suggestion. Senator McQuarram, talk to your attorney about it.

10:37.280 --> 10:46.280
Say you are requesting to appear or the opportunity to appear. Secretary of the Army, I think there is a lot of merit to that.

10:46.280 --> 10:51.280
Senator McQuarram, beat him through the punch. Talk to your council about that.

10:51.280 --> 11:00.280
Just the now that you have definitely requested the opportunity to appear. Secretary of the Army, I think that has got a lot of merit.

11:00.280 --> 11:04.280
Senator McQuarram, just beat him through the punch.

11:04.280 --> 11:14.280
That was on June 1st, February 20th. Yes. Secretary told me he was regarding the prospect of his adhering before the committee.

11:14.280 --> 11:23.280
And it was after he had gone to see me the day before. Yes, Senator. They tell us the conversation they thought is to me.

11:23.280 --> 11:32.280
At the time when he was talking to all the senators going to the committee. Yes, Senator. All right. We got another one. Who's the make? Mrs. Picer.

11:32.280 --> 11:50.280
I'm the firm with beating the ward in the lay out of the table. Mrs. Picer, the personal secretary of the Secretary of the Army.

11:50.280 --> 12:07.280
These are the telephone calls of Senator McQuarram. You have already invited President Spide, haven't you, Ms. Spide? Yes, sir, I have.

12:07.280 --> 12:12.280
You've just died with your spectre, some of them called to few monitors. Yes.

12:12.280 --> 12:23.280
So you have any calls from the secretary of the Army and what you monitor? I do. What is the date of February 21, 1954?

12:23.280 --> 12:35.280
21, 1954. That's right, sir. All right. Will you read it? Whatever it is. Time is 5 p.m. Now, isn't it better if they call the secretary made to me? Yes.

12:35.280 --> 12:46.280
Yes, sir. Yes. Yes. Or, please. Secretary of the Army called Senator Melon saying, wanted to bring you up to date. You saw the public today.

12:46.280 --> 12:59.280
I thought it was time to make a statement and tie it to my name. I am issuing this afternoon a short statement telling the people I have told the victor not to appear and rob.

12:59.280 --> 13:13.280
I go on to say, if the front of the company called upon me to appear before, I will be glad to do so. That's why I have not received any formal notifications, which is a fact.

13:13.280 --> 13:26.280
Only thing I know is that McCarthy and he hung up the phone said, you can consider yourself a human. And before I could ask where he was in New York, he hung up.

13:26.280 --> 13:42.280
So I consider I have no formal notification. I am not speaking or asking to maybe to appear, but if they desire me to appear, I will be only to grab to come fly.

13:42.280 --> 14:08.280
I am waiting to be heard. But I certainly appreciate the way you and I have seen and the last thing I want to do is to muddy the water like volunteering to appear when you gentlemen might have an idea of having this hearing.

14:08.280 --> 14:16.280
At that time he had decided he didn't want to volunteer this year. I had suggested doing this.

14:16.280 --> 14:23.280
It was a few days before you had the one who had the baby before, or I should guess it if you want to get enough.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.280
He wanted to appear, didn't he?

14:25.280 --> 14:29.280
I may have stayed his mind and he says he doesn't want to do this.

14:29.280 --> 14:40.280
I am sorry, I think it's for the poor.

14:40.280 --> 14:52.280
I can consider I have no formal notification.

14:52.280 --> 15:03.280
I am not speaking or asking to be here. If they desire me to appear, I will be only to grab to come fly.

15:03.280 --> 15:09.280
On basis of some stuff in paper, they are not ready to appear that I was asking to be heard.

15:09.280 --> 15:21.280
I am willing to be heard is called. But I certainly appreciate the way you and I have seen and I have seen and the last thing I want to do is to be here.

15:21.280 --> 15:27.280
I am willing to come at any time committee asking me to.

15:27.280 --> 15:36.280
I am willing to come at any time committee asking me to.

15:37.280 --> 15:51.280
This will make I am not clear to everyone in the paper tomorrow morning that I am not asking to be heard but I am available and willing to come at any time committee asking me to.

15:51.280 --> 15:59.280
Imagine this relief which is getting into the hands of the staff about now will be for some comments from Senator McCarty.

16:00.280 --> 16:17.280
But just what that will be remains to be seen. One point I know can relief is what I say and then you will personally believe about what's not been called and it's called holding from the press statement.

16:18.280 --> 16:28.280
Because it is important for this subject, hearing the open to prayer, since it is a matter of great importance and should be public.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.280
Senator McCarty has you want a public hearing?

16:32.280 --> 16:37.280
Senator McCarty has you want a public hearing?

16:37.280 --> 16:47.280
Senator McCarty has you want a public hearing?

16:48.280 --> 16:52.280
Senator McCarty has what did not say to you.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.280
Secretary of the Army answers.

16:54.280 --> 17:02.280
He is very much the staff over the post I gave him from General Vickers and I told him I was telling him not to appear.

17:03.280 --> 17:12.280
I talked to you. Months were highly discussed and anxious to see the records but non-committal.

17:12.280 --> 17:20.280
Senator McCarty has tried to make a position until I see the transcript of something left out there.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.280
I have not to take a position and I see the transcript.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.280
I will go inside and listen. I have an indicator.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.280
Let me make a sense as it is.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.280
I will say that it is really important.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.280
I have to take a position.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.280
I have to take a position.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.280
I have to take a position until I see the transcript.

17:41.280 --> 17:45.280
I cannot get it until Monday, which is probably true.

17:45.280 --> 17:51.280
Secretary of the Army says I put this statement and I quote.

17:51.280 --> 17:59.280
I have asked Senator McCarty to examine the complete copy of a original plan as it was recorded in the process.

17:59.280 --> 18:05.280
Senator McCarty, did you say without any division, did you put that in?

18:05.280 --> 18:08.280
Secretary of the Army.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.280
I have released it but I will clear that up next time.

18:12.280 --> 18:17.280
Senator McCarty, here again I miss some sir and I have any clear look for the staff.

18:17.280 --> 18:22.280
If it is not in there, I will call the reporter and ask him to read them.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.280
Could the reporter destroy them?

18:25.280 --> 18:30.280
Secretary of the Army said, don't believe a respectable firm could.

18:30.280 --> 18:34.280
I have sworn that this regard to this matter.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.280
I didn't want to give this after this obviously to the press.

18:38.280 --> 18:43.280
Because now I am going to give it to anybody, it's through the committee.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.280
All of that cover says...

18:45.280 --> 18:48.280
That conversation is about the Secretary of the Army.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.280
Calling you, sir, calling him, I know.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.280
Do you ask another one?

18:52.280 --> 18:53.280
I do not.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.280
What's made of that? Somebody says it's from there.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.280
What is that?

18:59.280 --> 19:02.280
Did he call me at home or was that all for?

19:02.280 --> 19:08.280
I don't recall and if I made the note I didn't put it down on my cash register.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.280
All right, but all you know now, but all you monitor.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.280
It's all I get, sir.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.280
I will let you know.

19:27.280 --> 19:32.280
Mr. Lose with you, Benzone, and you've already testified to some other calls that you monitor.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.280
Yes, sir.

19:33.280 --> 19:38.280
You have a call about you, Mona Bird,

19:39.280 --> 19:42.280
and which I call Secretary Steven.

19:42.280 --> 19:46.280
Well, first, what does the state of it?

19:46.280 --> 19:49.280
One month, 1954,

19:49.280 --> 19:53.280
time and day, three or five PM.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.280
Do you have any other?

19:54.280 --> 19:56.280
Did you monitor any other calls?

19:56.280 --> 19:58.280
No, sir.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.280
When I've earned the spam, the food that has defeated,

20:01.280 --> 20:04.280
in which the Secretary called me and this call,

20:04.280 --> 20:08.280
I will let you know about the testify accounts to keep all of the calls.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.280
Either through a formal secretary,

20:11.280 --> 20:13.280
sign me, that's the monitor.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.280
Yes, sir.

20:14.280 --> 20:18.280
All right, go see if you place this call in the record.

20:18.280 --> 20:22.280
Better than the call, I haven't gotten to see you around here lately.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.280
It's not very safe.

20:24.280 --> 20:29.280
I could use a lot of words, but you know what I mean.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.280
Better than the call, I never would've told you guys

20:33.280 --> 20:38.280
when you got off over there in that game without anybody with you.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.280
Of course, they told you,

20:42.280 --> 20:46.280
of course, they told you they wanted to work things out.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.280
That's Jerry Sidney.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.280
That is about it.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.280
Learned in the club.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.280
My remarks are not critical.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.280
We were left out of it.

20:56.280 --> 21:00.280
I just have to take the position if one day we're troubling the world.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.280
That's Jerry Sidney.

21:02.280 --> 21:06.280
I have to put his foundation on.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.280
Of course, we said it in the club.

21:09.280 --> 21:14.280
I am going down space this weekend that I initiated by that.

21:14.280 --> 21:17.280
There's something in that stuff.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.280
I know.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.280
I still watch the sub-bid matter was left out.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.280
I don't have a sound here, sir,

21:24.280 --> 21:25.280
but I made a note on this.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.280
It gets a nothing further than the conversations or faces

21:28.280 --> 21:29.280
in the perfect season.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.280
Monmouth Matter.

21:30.280 --> 21:34.280
Don't you know if you need to know what I'm talking about in our own PC units,

21:34.280 --> 21:36.280
or college in my state?

21:36.280 --> 21:38.280
I have a recollection of it.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.280
At some point, sir, you said it.

21:40.280 --> 21:44.280
I suppose that's what the yet.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.280
Well, I want to be sure about it.

21:46.280 --> 21:50.280
If there are any of those, I'll check us first.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.280
I know I thought him about an own PC unit in my state.

21:53.280 --> 21:54.280
He hasn't been to see me.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.280
I was just almost, and I started conversation with him.

21:57.280 --> 22:01.280
I had been around here later, and then you just found what he said.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.280
Yes, sir.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.280
You left out the balance of it.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.280
You said 30, you know?

22:06.280 --> 22:10.280
I want you to be in the test, sir, if I didn't fall in about an own PC unit,

22:10.280 --> 22:11.280
so that's my recollection.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.280
I think you'll find it correct.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.280
I know.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.280
I know you're just calling on that subject, sir,

22:16.280 --> 22:19.280
and I did not tell him on this subject.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.280
He brought up the subject, didn't he?

22:21.280 --> 22:22.280
Yes, sir.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.280
That's all.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.280
The Senate is a fellow.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.280
That's a German.

22:27.280 --> 22:33.280
Would it be satisfactory to use the Senate if we were to say to you our understanding you?

22:33.280 --> 22:35.280
Let's talk about the other.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.280
That's right, you may go, I know what I did.

22:37.280 --> 22:42.280
Now, if anybody else is not satisfied, I want to be able to present with you.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.280
Thank you, sir.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.280
Any questions about a bill?

22:46.280 --> 22:47.280
No, not about that.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.280
I'm going to complete it.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.280
Yes, sir.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.280
I would like to ask the whistle.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.280
Questions on yesterday.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.280
Around the park in the regular order.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.280
Sanford Jenkins, have you any questions?

22:58.280 --> 23:00.280
No questions, Mr. Chairman.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.280
I have no questions about sending the call and call.

23:02.280 --> 23:07.280
Just a question, Mr. Lucas, and your general procedure.

23:07.280 --> 23:15.280
I might have understand that the only note that you took on the call was always dealing with the so-called McCarthy County Regents,

23:15.280 --> 23:20.280
or that you simply didn't transcribe the rest of the Missinda McCollum's call.

23:21.280 --> 23:25.280
I think we didn't transcribe the rest of the Missinda McCollum's call because of anything to have.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.280
Anything whatsoever to say in general.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.280
But in your note, the full note should be there by the call.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.280
Your third.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.280
Yes.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.280
Senator McCollum, you have no information that we do send to Jackson?

23:35.280 --> 23:36.280
No, no.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.280
No, no, no, no.

23:38.280 --> 23:41.280
Well, they're going around the table while we have this office.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.280
Senator Franklin, Senator procedure has been.

23:43.280 --> 23:48.280
If you want to follow the same one, a senator has had his call, then he's...

23:48.280 --> 23:51.280
It worked the press as him to make an exact copy, then they go to the report.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.280
On a military statement, no point in the statement.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.280
It's been impressed by a few in the record now.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.280
They've been going there to the record, and they're going to be able to report.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.280
But I have never had a copy of an incident.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.280
Now, what about the rest?

24:01.280 --> 24:03.280
No, eventually, we can send them back to you for you.

24:03.280 --> 24:04.280
I have to.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.280
You can do an air-con.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.280
It's here, there, without all the public.

24:06.280 --> 24:11.280
We have worked out some arrangement with the presser that they could get the message from the good of our reportage.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.280
And they were used to get back to send the Missinda McCollum after that.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.280
Fine.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.280
I have sent the Jackson.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.280
No, no, no.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.280
I have sent the product.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.280
No, no.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.280
I have sent the assignment.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.280
No, no.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.280
I have sent the version.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.280
I have sent the brochure.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.280
I have just two out.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.280
Send the McCollum.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.280
You'll be too early to ask the formal back question.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.280
My final answer.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.280
Thank you.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.280
Very well.

24:32.280 --> 24:37.280
We're going to be next to the phone calls, which will be the phone calls, which will be here at the moment.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.280
Send the McCollum.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.280
So we'll be...

24:41.280 --> 24:46.280
Whichever monitor took the push call, kind of like you did, we've sent the McCollum.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.280
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.280
I have sent the McCollum.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.280
I take all of them.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.280
I want one call for him.

24:50.280 --> 25:01.260
I want to raise a point in regard to one of the members of the committee, for the

25:01.260 --> 25:03.280
show that we've done now.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.280
Whether...

25:04.280 --> 25:05.280
I'm afraid to conclude if we can.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.280
We've got all the monitoring calls that we've been following through.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.280
The chair understands that Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.280
Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.280
Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.280
Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.280
Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.280
Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.280
Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.280
Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.280
Mr. Corwin sees it.

25:15.280 --> 25:25.440
I was tempted to suggest you that you conclude everybody could have been in one package.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.480
You'd be more hurried orpole day,스가.

25:28.480 --> 25:33.140
If you'd don't have those time with yourself to questions about Turqu初 or other things

25:33.140 --> 25:34.120
I'd be appreciate it.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.280
Thank you.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.280
Thank you forache the obscene.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.280
I'm out.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.280
If I make Kadokő.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.280
Byroomá deep chargers and chargers I guess you have toII me.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.280
If I make fairs I guess you have toII me.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.280
Neither of us, you'll be out of this.

25:42.280 --> 25:46.280
If I see chargers and you must better understand all your reluctant we would do this

25:46.280 --> 25:48.280
by looking at one of our firsts and the firsts.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.280
I'm not going to listen to a star of some discussion.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.280
I put it mild.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.280
And here's my notification.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.280
But here's no more room for the other way.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
I'm going to go to Iovnjók.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.280
When you get to those points, put it in some place.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.280
There's no point in going to the other side.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.280
You're going to go to Iovnjók.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.280
I like that point.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.280
I'll go to another side.

26:06.280 --> 26:09.280
There's the conference with Mr. Raid Jenkins, the committee council,

26:09.280 --> 26:10.280
Mr. Callman.

26:10.280 --> 26:17.280
I'd like to appreciate if the council would read my monitor calls all of them.

26:17.280 --> 26:22.280
So one place for their number of dashes on one side of the royal number dashes

26:22.280 --> 26:27.280
and the other side indicating that the conversation is omitted.

26:27.280 --> 26:33.280
So we get to that point I would like to throw in my recall that conversation of them

26:33.280 --> 26:38.280
and number two with the chairman of one firm's picture.

26:38.280 --> 26:44.280
I consider it a little easier to do that, but I wish it could be worth a thousand times

26:44.280 --> 26:47.280
to do with individual of nothing, but even if they're against the system,

26:47.280 --> 26:51.280
so it'll be pretty important to know how to know what to throw over that.

26:51.280 --> 26:55.280
That's the number three assistant, go in and chair ahead of the roll.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.280
The position in the sentence and the cost of your arm and the committee members

26:58.280 --> 27:01.280
must have looked at it and take a make-the-ditch combination.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.280
I'll continue to have this council.

27:04.280 --> 27:07.280
Mr. Rookus, the demodentary certain telephone calls

27:07.280 --> 27:10.280
pricing between the spectacale and the army and some of the McCarthy.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.280
What's up? What is the date of the first room?

27:13.280 --> 27:19.280
7 November 1973. Do you have a copy of it before you move? Yes, sir.

27:19.280 --> 27:23.280
So you and the McCarthy do not understand the history of your design of our use this,

27:23.280 --> 27:28.280
of the record. Mr. Rookus, I would like to ask you whether or not

27:28.280 --> 27:33.280
the monitoring of that call is accurate or substantially so.

27:33.280 --> 27:40.280
And does it, in your opinion, substantially complying the meaning of the conversation

27:40.280 --> 27:44.280
pricing between the sanctions and the pricing of the second army? Yes, sir.

27:44.280 --> 27:51.280
Do you now refer to your monitored call of November 7th and Paul Amir reading out it? Yes, sir.

27:51.280 --> 27:56.280
Yes, sir. And if I make an error, I will ask you to stop me and correct me.

27:56.280 --> 28:00.280
No, you're not. You're not there yet. Any questions?

28:00.280 --> 28:07.280
Do you have two copies of that call, Mr. Rookus? No, sir. I have one. I will move them on.

28:07.280 --> 28:14.280
7 November 19th, 52, 3, 19, pm, Sunday, MacArthur, phone, second case, fever, senator.

28:14.280 --> 28:19.280
Bob, the dead work out all right to your satisfaction yesterday, secondary of the army,

28:19.280 --> 28:25.280
yes, it did show. And I appreciate you taking your very broad view of the day, senator.

28:25.280 --> 28:30.280
We both have the same interests and we both are working at the same job, take a day of the hour.

28:30.280 --> 28:37.280
I was worried at first, but the way I'm looking, I was satisfied with it, and I want to thank you, senator.

28:37.280 --> 28:45.280
I would like to ask you one question of favor. For God's sake, don't put savings, service, and assigning back to my committee.

28:45.280 --> 28:52.280
When we said one, word I couldn't get away was any more than a week. The new papers would be back on us.

28:52.280 --> 28:56.280
And you would have to send them back into uniform anyway.

28:56.280 --> 29:02.280
Two. This thing has been running along so cleanly so far they have not been able to beat your brains out.

29:02.280 --> 29:09.280
There's nothing the left wingers would like better. They don't like this cooperation between the committee and the army.

29:09.280 --> 29:16.280
And the third thing they would say I asked for him. He is a good boy but there's nothing indispensable about it.

29:16.280 --> 29:25.280
From my day today I can give up letters from that, so half a dozen letters from others who've gone for a more shape than these.

29:25.280 --> 29:30.280
And it will be amazing if all of them need.

29:30.280 --> 29:33.280
Uh, things.

29:34.280 --> 29:48.280
Stunder, McCarthy has now marked this sentence and desires me to pay this to the committee for the purpose of getting their consent to the ink debt.

29:48.280 --> 29:54.280
As well as what is the next paragraph that is underscored.

30:03.280 --> 30:16.280
There's something kind of discussion as they sentence the senator McCarthy asked to be deleted from the text of this monitor telephone call.

30:16.280 --> 30:20.280
There is the huddles Mr. Jenkins on the left. Senator Jackson. Right.

30:20.280 --> 30:28.280
And Mr. Connell the right. Senator Rick Clawman. Senator Simon from the Democratic side of the table.

30:28.280 --> 30:35.280
This is the first of the monitor telephone calls of Senator McCarthy to create an event of the seventh of the 53.

30:50.280 --> 30:56.280
Senator asked for the deletion of one line.

30:56.280 --> 31:03.280
Senator Johnson.

31:03.280 --> 31:07.280
Mr. Jenkins consults with the Republican side of the table.

31:07.280 --> 31:14.280
Heading on, Mr. Chairman.

31:14.280 --> 31:19.280
If he could get all three games, Roy.

31:19.280 --> 31:25.280
I understand now, it was my area. This is not the part of the Senator McCarthy, why it's still here.

31:25.280 --> 31:32.280
If he could get all three games, Roy, it is one of the few things I have seen completely unreasonable about.

31:32.280 --> 31:35.280
Senator Connell.

31:35.280 --> 31:42.280
If you would press on the witness of the matter before the name Roy and after the name Roy and the deletion,

31:42.280 --> 31:49.280
it's so I would like to add my recollection of the deletion there was.

31:49.280 --> 31:55.280
Mr. Lucas, commit me to read this sentence again please and I ask you a question about it.

31:55.280 --> 32:00.280
If he could get all three games, two days each is the right.

32:01.280 --> 32:05.280
What was that indication, Mr. Lucas? In the case of Faw.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.280
A Paws. Yes sir.

32:07.280 --> 32:14.280
Those who are not in the queue, the truth perhaps have left out a word or a phrase. No sir.

32:14.280 --> 32:21.280
Leaving it again, if you could get all three games, two days each, Roy. Two days each, is that correct?

32:21.280 --> 32:26.280
Yes sir. It is one of the few things I have seen completely unreasonable about.

32:27.280 --> 32:32.280
He thinks they should be again, I would have worked from the paint house of the wall dog.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.280
Did I ask him, what is the name of the nation?

32:35.280 --> 32:39.280
No, there was nothing I thought you had to find that meant the cumulative material.

32:39.280 --> 32:48.280
I believe I justified and what I did there was you got the indication that I did not take down all of the chairlet with Saturn.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.280
It was not able to take down all of the stuff.

32:51.280 --> 32:56.280
I wanted to go back to the jet and we wanted to make a material.

32:56.280 --> 33:00.280
I recall that one for the shithead.

33:00.280 --> 33:04.280
No sir, it is not my last of the story yet.

33:04.280 --> 33:11.280
What I believe is that the back here is just you started to throw a pattern.
