WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
I was talking to you. I don't... with the council repeat the last part.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
So what did I can understand? You mean the lay sentence to the lay sentence?

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Yes. He thinks that he should be a general and work from the pink house of the wall law.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
That was the lay sentence to the lay sentence.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I haven't got a copy of the lecture.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Yes, sir.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
And the discussion of course is with reference to both of the lectures this year.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Well, I didn't mean that. I think it's fine. I thought there was something that the senator from Wisconsin talked about.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
The secretary of the senator is something being eliminated.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
And the secretary had our fight in doubt.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
He was meeting this second for two patients at the end of the board's weekend.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Some of them are tied to physical positions, that had indicated certain words that had been doing it.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
According to his recollections. The witness says that it's in the case they call the master's relation of any work.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Thank you, sir.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Meeting further. Secretary Arnie.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
That is where my partner was from, right from the start.

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
He never had done or said anything that spared me on this situation at all, other than to take a friendly interest in the senator.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
He said in the consideration and asked if he'd be immediately assigned.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Well, I was next to putting the committee. He thought I had thrown back on the committee.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
And for God's sake, don't sell blank line. And as I understand it, all of the members of this subjectivity have agreed to die.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
So do let me, let me. That's correct.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
I did correct for you.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
For God's sake, don't sell blank line. Anything of this before you go right back and sell life. Secretary Arnie.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Thank you.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
I'm not leaving. I think you should explain because somebody not involved in this conversation.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
None of the tent's moving.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
There's no witness doing.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I think it's only fair.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
So you can ask any.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Or to face him and find anyone else with the committee is raising an amount of this.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
The federal government are together on the outside.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
We'll hold a conversation for the committee.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
We'll hold a conversation for the committee.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I wasn't bringing his name in.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
I just thought that the committee was about to start talking about this in my service.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And the minister has this chairman that's a little bit of a reason to this name.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
The reason is that it's called the new wise, all the different things, whatever.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
For God's sake, I do not need. I would rather not tell anybody anything.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
And as far as what you have said,

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
I am not going to do anything except to have you go to the regular thing.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Maybe a weekend, a year or a year, or something of that kind.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Actually, on the two week thing,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
I said I have personally arranged this thing because I wanted to be available

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
to have the committee get along further with this thing.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
That is the way the thing was done.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
The federal consorts in there before the vat first.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Thank you, partners.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I put some vat in the chat.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I was just about to start.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm sure the reason is because we just about to end because it's very well reported together

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
otherwise the hydrally leading back for a very short time.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Actually, on the two week thing, I said I have personally arranged this thing

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
because I wanted him to be available to have the committee to get along further with this thing.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Four dollars.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Correct with two.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
That's the way the thing was done.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And I felt that was the proper way to handle it.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I think I know what you mean.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
And I will handle it in the proper way along the lines you have been talking about.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Senator, if you put them into service to work with the committee,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
I'll know the whole way through.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
That's about right, Mr. President.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
The reason that they calling me not to play favors because anyone is going to committee.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
I think the lawyer states that he can make him come back for weekends with something

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
so his verdict won't get too long for him.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Maybe if he's received his hair off, he won't want to come back.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
I think every day, I appreciate your whole attitude on this yesterday.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Have I corrected it in the solution?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Yes, sir.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
I think now whether or not you've monitored another call facing between the sector there

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
and in front of the matri-d.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I'll recall, is that correct?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yes, sir.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
What's the date of the next one, Mr. Lucas?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
14 January, 1954.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Do you have a copy every before you?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yes, sir.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Was that call correctly monitored?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yes, sir.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
I will now read it and ask you the following.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
14 January, 1954, 245 PM, Senator McCarthy returns like they see them fall.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Steven.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
I want to thank you, first of all, for that marvelous cheese you and Jeannie.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
We're both late for you, Joe.

05:22.000 --> 05:30.000
I am going to the far east on Sunday and I would like to begin to have you work me in somewhere on your schedule.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And I don't care much when.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I would like to have a little bit of it.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
McCarthy.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Anytime you're technically with DOC because I'm leaving you nice to go to Boston, and I will be gone.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Fire is off.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Correct, Mr. Lucas?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yes, sir.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
At two o'clock I have a meeting with the first committee on my birthday.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I have to go out and have a different fee.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Steven.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
How long will that meeting take place?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
McCarthy.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I expect quite a struggle over there.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Steven.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
It will be in or out of order to have refreshments with you.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Is that something to correct?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yes, sir.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
McCarthy.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
I would say that that day much.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Steven.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Shall we go to the regular place or somewhere else?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
McCarthy.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
Why don't you drop over here about five o'clock and we will go across the streets and have refreshments together?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Is that something to correct, Mr. Lucas?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yes, sir.

06:27.000 --> 06:36.000
I've spoken back down there after that and indicated that the appointment was firm that did not take no time.

06:36.000 --> 06:46.000
Mr. Lucas, are there other calls that could face the treaty sector and the Army and Senate and McCarthy, which have been monitored by you?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
No sir, that's my name.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I'll ask you to stand aside.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I'll rather exchange things with Mr. Rose.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Mr. Rose, please say whether or not you monitor the telephone call,

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
I think between the Secretary of the Army and Senator McCarthy, Mr. Dester, how many are there?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
One sir.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
The day that it's least 25th February 1954, I've used the right to monitor these.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yes, sir.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
What's this one?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
This one is session, sir.

07:26.000 --> 07:34.000
If I'm on here at 10 a.m., and I checked with, I had a little doubt about it over the weekend, and I checked with the telephone record to the Pentagon,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
and it was initiated at 9.30 in the morning, about five minutes to get the call through.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
Was that exception, this is a correct transcript of that telephone call, Mr. Rose?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yes sir.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Do you have a copy of it before you?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Yes, sir, I do.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
I will ask you to follow me, Mr. Rose, Senator Mataji, as I speak, to read it into the record, and the act I shall have finished reading, and then say whether or not you can, I'll finish the record rare.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You need both, Mr. President.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
But in February 19th, 54th, 10 o'clock AM, 6th day, the Army's following the Senate, and I'm going to Mr. Stevens.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I'll tell you why I'm calling you.

08:08.000 --> 08:18.000
I didn't find out until late last night, where you were staying, to bring you to the event over yesterday on the Hill and call on the various members of the U.S. Committee.

08:18.000 --> 08:27.000
It is him that happened to be over there, and that included Senators, Dersen, Father, Month, McCulloch, and Simon Good, because I was told...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I just get us to read those bad news.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
You would read that slowly, and so I can understand.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Senator, I thought the Chief complaint against me was with our rent too slowly.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I used to be out here in his place, but I'm...

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I'm just saying, we can get to Temple.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
And I think you're afraid, please.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Thank you very much.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I didn't understand that with you receiving.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
I'm not included in Senators, Dersen, Father, Month, McCulloch, and Simon Good.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
Because I was told, except the reports I had, and I'm very, very glad I had a vote against them, but I didn't get that.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
When you fly, it's the worst that month.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
And when I read the whole sentence, I think your voice is a little lower than that.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I think it's better.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I think it's better.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
This is my voice.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
It's lower.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Maybe you're getting it.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I was getting it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I was getting it.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I was getting it.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I was getting it.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
I was getting it.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I was getting it.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Mr. Stevens, I'll tell you why I am calling you.

09:23.000 --> 09:31.000
I didn't find out until late last night, when you were saying to tell you that I went over yesterday on the hill,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
and called on the various members of your subcommittee.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
Any of them that happened to be over there, as that included Senators, Dersen, Father, Months, McCulloch, and Simon Good.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
Because I was so upset for the reports I had on the executives' appearance of General Flicker,

09:49.000 --> 09:57.000
and what's written his reaction to it while, that I just feel and vanish to the officer's cordley army I had to do for the matter.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Just say it in a second.

09:59.000 --> 10:08.000
So, I think the best thing for you to do is not to fall in the old position of the previous administration.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I think you've got a wonderful opportunity here, Robert.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
You neither set this course for a house meeting.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
This division is the Congress knows about the figures, nobody ever has they are.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
The other person tried to cover up everything, gone on the board.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
That would be impossible, out of Gen.V.D.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I've had a most infotain session with the General.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
I've got the letter, which I am sure you didn't write.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
You see this? I was completely in on that letter, George.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
That letter was a result of careful consideration right here in my office.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
In fact, I took it home and worked on it one evening, Senator MacGything.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
There's something radically wrong with the advice you have on that,

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
and tell you that the commissionings of Communists,

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
while and all they're against discrimination because of political belief, that is, George,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
you don't recognize that, Mr. Stevens.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
That is exactly what has been used in referring to the type of thing you go.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Senator MacGything, let me ask you this.

11:18.000 --> 11:26.000
If it's your position, if you're going to try to keep from us the names of the officers who protected the Eastman,

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
Mr. Stevens, I'm going to try to prevent my officers from going before your committee,

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
and then you and I have an understanding as to seem to be a few slayer going to get it.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Take care of yourself, Senator MacGything.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
You will not protect them from going before our committee.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
You are not going to be in a position to keep us from calling them in or not.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Mr. Stevens, you and I can debate this thing,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
that I don't want to make outstanding officers like General Swicker

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
and some records decorated in some sort of drawer times.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
It's about two days since that right in the school, I think that's an intersection there, sir.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I think you've found an intersection by Senator MacGything.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Well, I know, he's an Senator MacGything.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
You're not going to always even up to appear before my committee.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Just go ahead and try it, Robert.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
I am going to keep the names out of anyone who protects Communists.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
If that is the policy of you, you just go ahead and do it.

12:23.000 --> 12:33.000
I will gain to you that you will live to regret it.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
You got to recognize the road, yes sir.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
There is no reason why the city administration should protect

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
the introduction of Mr. Stevens.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Don't you know that Senator MacGything, let me finish.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
This is your time, I didn't call you.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
If you see the administration of the Army is going to try to protect the hang-horses mill,

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
that in turn protected Communists, the people will know about it.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
And I'll again be your boss if you will learn before you are through

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
that instead of protecting Communists, you should be helping us on third of the House.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I didn't give...

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
I don't care whether or not there is... how's that?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I don't know what I hear.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
When it comes before us with the Indian,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
since it is in service, I expect those who appear out of guarantee

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
that the American people will know all about it.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Is that some type of reflection to those?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yes sir.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Mr. Stevens.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
That is certainly the reason we write it.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
But let me assure you that you know this as well as I do,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
that I have no intention of coming up in it,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
communists or anything like that.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Senator MacGything.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
That is exactly what the Army is doing now.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
You're trying to tell us that you think

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
one color sees protecting this communist nature.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
If you have nothing to hide, interrupt just Mr. Stevens.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
I've done nothing to hide 100 percent, Senator MacGything.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
If you get this straight saying Bob,

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
you are not only refusing to tell us who was responsible for the promotion.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
The Honourable Judge of this man,

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
you are calling me this morning to tell me you are going to other officers

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
to be armed and not to come before our committee.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
And I understand yesterday you went to see each member of the committee.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Did you go in there, Mr. Stevens?

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Yes, I told him I was not going to let Drickler of fear on Tuesday.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm not going to say that I interrupts in Senator MacGything.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Would you continue to search for the Phoenix President of the Cross

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Tuesday morning with Mr. Stevens?

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
I would take that on the excitement of Senator MacGything.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
If you don't want to hear all right,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I am telling the first to shoot the bullet here.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
If you decide not to, you will then take steps tomorrow.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I am all too with this stirring up of common.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I am sorry, Bob Stevens is one that is doing it too.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
So please, if this point doesn't look like the unit of the phone,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
please show it.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
And has nothing to record?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Yes, sir.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Are there any other telephone calls that you know of?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
That you know of, that the road, the place they have in place

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
between the Secretary of the Army,

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
and Senator MacGything, which has been monitored?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
None monitored by myself, sir.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
This pipe, while you're sitting where you are, you can hear me, I'm sure.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Do you have any monitoring telephone calls between the Secretary of the Army

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and Senator MacGything?

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
What's the proof of reading of Senator MacGything's calls, Mr. Chairman?

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Dave Schring,

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
most of the way they told me one call,

15:40.000 --> 15:47.000
was the Secretary Steven McCallman from Mr. Steven to Mr. Schring.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I asked Mr. Schring to be here this morning,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I believe Councillor Alston be here,

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
so that he might consent to have his call ready on my believes he's done.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I made the call even now, Mr. Chairman.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
He said he didn't take it because I don't think I've got these calls,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
because I actually called five at the time next.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
But we'll go around around now.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Are you any Christian?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
No, I have no public questions there.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Sure, I have only one.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
Mr. Wold and Mrs. Pike and Mr. Lucas.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Do I ever send the calls to all of the calls now that

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
a monitoring concerning the target?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Do you have another?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
That's right, that's correct.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I have no other Christian to send this, Mr. McCallman.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
All I want to ask one question, all of us,

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
is that each of you, I think, I will look at it.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Where the monitoring calls would mind place

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
the military without any deletions whatsoever.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Each of you answer please, just a minute.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
How about you, Mr. Lucas?

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
Well, you didn't delete anything, you just didn't include it.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Well, I mean, you didn't include the conversation about the other matter,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
but I mean, it's far easier there than the deletions.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Correct.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Will you get the record only remaining, all of us?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
All right.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
We'll get to it.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Not too yet, sir.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Underjection.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Any questions?

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
I have too many questions to swear to the conversation

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
bread by the Comfort, the Nietzsche Neverian.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Underjection, I have to pick questions whether or not I

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
is correctly read the call.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
That was six meters.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
You all I didn't know that the answer was in the Affirmative of each answer.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
That's not a pause, all of us.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
That was three.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
That's the great.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
And I think we have to go through here.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
We're just sharing the warning to 30% of the purchase.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
That's right.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Otherwise it's all done.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
30% of the price that it was at by Senator McCall, I would like it.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
It's just a road downright, yes sir.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
There were two words deleted yesterday for my testimony.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Five.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Five.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Five.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I beg you, five.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
One of the words I think you might have taken down wrong when I asked

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
to be deleted.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
The second word was deleted at the suggestion of the council.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Is that correct?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Yes sir.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
And the more wise change the meaning of the conversation, whatever,

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
that was made perfectly clear.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
And you agree that that's correct, so you cannot.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yes sir.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Thank you.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
From there, Gorshik.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Yes sir.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Hello.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Yes sir.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Hello.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Good afternoon, President.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
There were some indications that we pressed yesterday last.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
And giving these monitor calls to the press that I have made some deletions.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm afraid that while I'm not familiar with how I'm not so intensely as question about

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
having no deletions meant to call me, I've created the impression that

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
the order deletions meant to call me, is correct that the only deletions

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
from all of my calls were the name of an individual,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
if I say don't tell why.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Why?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
That's the only way.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Not my call, Fred.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
I have to look at the way, Fred.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
He said that's right.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
So, so that, if you thought that complete,

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
that's the question of what you may not have gotten as you monitor them.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
And the, the other thing that I asked you to delete was the name of one man,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
was that nothing to do whatsoever with this comment.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
That's right.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Yes sir.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Good.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
And let's go on a round of applause.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I want to know if you know that my name and accept that last part,

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
which absolutely is not relevant to this kind of version of the subject that I call,

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
but I do want to confirm by the best part of the last one.

19:55.000 --> 20:02.000
I was trying to do it in a really short time at the committee table of temporality,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
while we meet your call into the reference,

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
so that you will have the same change in life as a principle,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
very different things you would share with me.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You know it well.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
Now in the doorway, and at the call to the street, and here he comes now.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
Which, have you, of course, monitor for the time, so?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Let the look is so.

20:35.000 --> 20:42.000
Proved G David Shine.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Did you remember the committee table besides Son of a McCartney?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm sorry, so I didn't hear the question.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Did time decide which of you monitor the time and time's cross?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
I did.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Did you just one call?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Yes sir.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
One call, monitor just by you, or one call of his monitors,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
is made all the gifts.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
There was only one call made all together, and I monitor it.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
I monitor it.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
I monitor it, sir.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Will you give it the date of that call?

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
21 October, 1953, and the hour of date.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
922 am.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
And the same preliminary questions that resume with the answer value

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
in the same manner as just as a complete.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Total factual reproduction of the call

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
as revered in which you were able to make it.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Your call which you were not able to capture all the words,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
but in which you were interjected, no words that were not set.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Your call.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
All right, Councilor Jenkins, if you have the call you may read it,

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
try the time and just press the money and get it in the way.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
There was the other members of the cabinet, there's some sticks that you want to make,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
and I'm going to have a mission or a deletion, you have that later.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Yes.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And now we're going to go around.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Thank you, Chairman.

22:03.000 --> 22:11.000
Well, I had assumed that the mentors, Shine and Cohn and Carr,

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
would sign a consent to the admission of the telephone call.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
I think the form of their consent is unimportant,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
but I take it, Mr. Shine and Cohn, who our president,

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
will confirm all of the in the record that their consent to the admission of the call

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
is now awkwardly shared.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Thank you.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Now, in further evidence, the head of this, the form of the Indian director.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
I do serve.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
And Mr. Cohn, I gather all the on the yield confirmed that you have your form of the...

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Yes, sir.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
I confirm the fact that those calls submitted in compliance with the subpoenas,

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
through Mr. Jenkins, which have been displayed for me as the telephone call with me,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
may be admitted into the record.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
And now you are in position to do the same for Mr. Cohn.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Yes.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
That's our secretary, Mr. Welk.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Yes.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
We'll have Mr. Sanders.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Could you please read the number of new mums,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
here's a telephone call placing the finger check here,

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
the Army, Mr. Stevens, and that, and G. David Shine.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Yes, sir.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
I want to give you a good later that call, Mr. Lucas.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
21 October, 1953, 922 AM.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
For the benefit of the record, Mr. Lucas, you understand the fact that Mr. Shine was a private citizen

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
and modern and nothing in the Army.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Yes, sir, I understand that.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
Mr. Lucas, do you mind if you think that Mr. Shine wants to give you a gift in the record?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
If you please, sir.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
Now, Mr. Lucas, you have a copy of that monitoring of the call before you.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Yes, sir.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
You can't say that you're sorry.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Yes, sir.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
You just create a substantial issue.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Yes, sir.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
I will now read it, Mr. Lucas, an ice-cream to follow me,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
and point out any discrepancies.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
There may be between you copy and the copy which you're sitting and delivered to me.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Yes, sir.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
Sir, G. Stevens calls with David Shine as May Hill 8-0-1-1-0.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
From his office in the Pentagon, 21 after the 1950s to V9-22 AM.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Reach on the Hill 8-0-1-1-1-0, Secretary Stevens.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Call him a fourth day, he's full close.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Is that right?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Shine.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
I'm sorry, I missed you yesterday, Stevens.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I thought you were coming down.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Shine.

24:31.000 --> 24:38.000
I was also set to go, and the pilot told me at the last minute that the fault wouldn't commit the claim to take off.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Stevens.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
In New York, Shine, yes.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
They told me a fault that's been over Governor's Island practically every day.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And sometimes it's fair, and sometimes it doesn't.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Sometimes it's fair, and sometimes it doesn't.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Stevens.

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
While it was a little easy and mumble, it was perfectly all right to the fly.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
I would rather have talked with you, if persons, than to have called you on the phone.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
But since I didn't get to you in person, and I'm about to leave on a quick tip to California,

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
I wanted to tell you I have reviewed this whole situation with Mr. Wilson, and that's just a list.

25:22.000 --> 25:29.000
When there are me, there are I can see any appropriate ways to avoid the basic claims.

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
I think that if you do, that it is almost a month, in the situation as it's now is this,

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
that you're going over the situation three times now, in survival you're concerned.

25:41.000 --> 25:50.000
It is Mr. Wilson's and my condition that that is the wise thing to do, Dave, and that having them met,

25:50.000 --> 26:01.000
then I think there is an excellent chance that we can pick you up and use you in a way that would be useful to the country and yourself.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Just thought that would be, I don't know.

26:04.000 --> 26:13.000
I can't define it now because I haven't gotten to that point, but there is something.

26:13.000 --> 26:24.000
All my mind and one that I would make every effort to carry out, I personally would like to arrange it in such a way that you would come into this army,

26:24.000 --> 26:32.000
our military establishment in such a way that you could use the knowledge and ability you have in certain fields.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
But I don't discuss it over the phone, but that is the never-beard.

26:37.000 --> 26:49.000
I would visit Mr. Wilson. We discuss it at a considerable length, and we both felt that it would be a big mistake to attempt in any way to do anything until you had taken the basic training.

26:49.000 --> 26:57.000
Then we feel our hands are free to make some kind of a plan that would work outside of such a way that you have been using the government and for everybody.

26:57.000 --> 27:07.000
I am certainly happy to know you are talking over with Mr. Wilson, and if you are both thinking about it, Steven, we are, Cheyenne.

27:07.000 --> 27:14.000
Now, if you are going to California, Steven, I will be back here on Monday, Cheyenne.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
Why are you going to in California, Steven? I will be all over the place.

27:19.000 --> 27:29.000
I am going first to talk to the National Guard Association in San Diego tomorrow morning, and then I am doing public assistance just for my community.

27:29.000 --> 27:37.000
I was pretty quick, if you would like to get hold of me, if you would call the office, they would be able to tell you just how to do it.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
Cheyenne, obviously Colonel Boone, he was, Colonel Boone will be here.

27:43.000 --> 27:51.000
He will know exactly how to get hold of me, and I will leave the light as he gives me at any time.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
Steven, you are not going to a Cheyenne, I beg your pardon.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
You are not going to Los Angeles, Steven.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
No, I am going to San Diego, and I am going to overfly Los Angeles, Cheyenne.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
I hope you will have a nice trip, and we will probably have to talk to him over and create a lake sometime.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
Steven, if you come down, I will be less delighted to see you, Cheyenne.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
What will be hearing is that he will be shaping up in such a way that you will want to see them on some of them.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Steven, possibly so.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
I will leave it somewhere there, or if you are down here, we will talk it over further. Cheyenne.

28:28.000 --> 28:38.000
I will maybe talk to you when you get back from the way, but I am not correctly ready to get conversation with Mr. Lucas as you have it, Ted.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
That is right.

28:40.000 --> 28:50.000
There was at the beginning, I have sent to a Steven's return the call of David Schurren, Richard of the same burial number.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
Well, that is not on, and let me raise the way I have it again, and then you collect it.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
You are talking about the heading now, the second.

28:58.000 --> 29:10.000
Secretary Steven's call to David Schin at Murray Steel 8-0-1-0 from his office in the Pentagon on 21 October, 1950-922 AM.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
Now, that is the way I get it the first time I am sure is that correct?

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
I believe that is the way that the panel is just different than you, Frank Schiff.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Yes, sir.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Can you reach your Constitution, Maus, too, Lucas?

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
On 21 October, 1953-922 AM.

29:28.000 --> 29:40.000
Secretary Steven's return call of David Schin, Horren, reached Mr. Schin at New York NYC Murray-0-8-0-1-0 close friend.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
You know all of the respect, Mr. Lucas.

29:43.000 --> 29:50.000
All of the trans-fifishers identical.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
How are we going to reflect it?

29:53.000 --> 30:03.000
In the long path that Mr. Stevens brought mine lines down, I have, it is my honest conviction.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
I believe you read something about Mr. Wilson.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
I think it's just the lady here, Secretary.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
Ah, Mr. Lucas, I didn't follow you.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
I'll reach one.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Yes, sir.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Honouration, Mr. Stevens, mine lines down.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yes, sir.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
You forward, Secretary.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Certainly.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
Do you read it to where you had it?

30:26.000 --> 30:33.000
And after going over the situation three times out into far as you are concerned, it is my honest conviction.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
But I have it, and I read it, it is Mr. Wilson's and my conviction.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Yes, sir.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
But you have it, it is my honest conviction.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Is that correct?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Yes, sir.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I have it.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
You will proceed.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
In other respects, is it correct?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Yes, sir.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
So, if the others were very minor, was Wood and Cod or Well and Wood?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It is no last chance, no, sir.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
I like to hear Chairman.

31:02.000 --> 31:09.000
And any other senators who desired to look at the head of this document from which I read,

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
had confirmed the fact that I read it correctly, that right, Mr. Chairman.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Mr. Chairman.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
What was the consulate's file where they...

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Where this copy came from?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
No, thank you, Chairman.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Mr. Jackson.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Mr. Chairman.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
If I could get it, Mr. President.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Yes, sir.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Yes.

31:24.000 --> 31:33.000
I think Mr. Jenkins, you will agree with me that the copy you have read was taken by the case over the telephone.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Mr. Well, it would be else to say that fact now.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Frankly, I do not know.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
No, not by telephone, I'm sorry.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
But it was taken by the case.

31:40.000 --> 31:51.000
And I think the obviously the correct copy of the telephone call is the one in front of the record, from which he has made corrections in Newark.

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
And my suggestion, Mr. Jenkins, would be the copies of the...

31:56.000 --> 32:03.000
That the Montenegroal, as a hearing before, is the notion that his file should be permitted to be permitted.

32:03.000 --> 32:09.000
Rather than the title deal with your copy, which file the error is not serious, is somewhat different.

32:09.000 --> 32:16.000
And then the K-DF, just a little further, Mr. Mucha, I read in the title, if you're suggesting, that the co-unit represents the sign I'm sure to do.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
I don't know about that, sir, but I would like to present myself to this whole...

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Well, that's what I'm expecting you to do.
