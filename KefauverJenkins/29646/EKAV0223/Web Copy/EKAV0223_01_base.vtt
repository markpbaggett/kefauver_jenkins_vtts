00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
They have probably become very fast friends.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
This is the 26th day of the hearings and there is the gavill opening the session.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
Beginning of the session this morning, the chair would like to again welcome the guest who has come to our committee room.

00:27.000 --> 00:38.000
We are glad to have you here. We went to the know now of our committee ruling for these hearings if you have not already been surprised of us.

00:38.000 --> 00:49.000
The committee has or yet but there will be no manifestations audibly of approval or just approval of any time, at any time during these hearings.

00:49.000 --> 01:02.000
The uniform officers before you and the plane closements gathered among you have a standing order from the committee to remove from the committee room immediately, politely but firmly.

01:02.000 --> 01:15.000
Anybody who has always been best known to himself elect to violate the terms under which you entered the committee room, namely to completely refrain some audible manifestations of approval of this approval.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
Our audiences have done virtually 100% 30% cooperative and we expect and hope to tell a continue.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Many have asked about the executive committee meeting which we had this morning.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
One motion was made in charge.

01:30.000 --> 01:50.000
The effect of the transcript of the executive committee meeting of May 17 is to be typed and copied and delivered to each of the members of the committee and each of the principles and outcomes which end of the meeting today.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
The chairman of the committee is the chairman of the committee which virtually means the people who were in attendance at the meeting of May 17.

01:56.000 --> 02:06.000
The chairman has asked the reporter in view of the action of the committee to write across the top of those hearings which are for the distribution of the people mentioned.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
The confidential executive committee seconds not for attribution or publication.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Those who receive it will receive it with that understanding.

02:17.000 --> 02:31.000
We had just concluded yesterday going around another whole of questions and Mr. Welch has concluded a 10 minutes period so Mr. Jenkins we will start with you to have any further questions at this time.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
Mr. Coney has yet to be in the ass to prepare and bring to this room and tie with the committee.

02:38.000 --> 02:50.000
All documents, data, memorandum, papers, prepared by David Cheyne, such the good to his induction in the Army of November 31.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Are you prepared to now be so missed call?

02:53.000 --> 03:15.000
I pledge you have been advised Mr. Jenkins last night there was a meeting between attended by Senator McCrathy, Senator McClellan, Mr. Kennedy, the minority council, Mr. Ponsour, a gyrosis and myself that which we spent some time going over various of the materials prepared by Dave Cheyne and Flaurplor by your direction to produce back on Thursday or Friday.

03:15.000 --> 03:42.000
The old question is to confidential informants and government employees who had furnished information came up and at that time it was decided but Mr. Cheyne would come over to the building this morning and go over these files and give us the benefit of his recollection and believe in so far as the various people who had furnished information might be concerned.

03:42.000 --> 03:54.000
Mr. Cheyne is here and is at this very time going over various of these files and papers and according to the situation reached up to the meeting last night.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Mr. Cogris has seen me along that line and we understand.

03:58.000 --> 04:14.000
Mr. Cogris, the members of this committee are anxious to have that information and I'm sure no one might be interested in talking to the evidence that works best of Mr. Cheyne's subsequent duties in the Army.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Do you think that information will be available to this committee?

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
I don't know Mr. Cogris, it will be available just as soon as everybody can agree what you're going to go in.

04:26.000 --> 04:39.000
I have already testified with Mr. Cogris, I believe that as far as documentary work is concerned, the bulk of it for the report, the pre-interim report, and the certain sections of the annual report which I've already furnished to Mr. Welk.

04:39.000 --> 04:50.000
Although he did not keep draft, there are some notes from him that Mr. Cheyne's writing which are definitely available to Mr. Welk to the committee and to everybody.

04:50.000 --> 05:07.000
And those will be a more clear material. There is also a booklet with the head of the time that he was standing by when he was standing in the name of Mr. Cheyne in some cases telephone numbers and address and information on that.

05:07.000 --> 05:20.000
There are names of people who are confidential and informed in this committee and I think everybody has agreed that those names and phone numbers and addresses and information should not be made public.

05:20.000 --> 05:31.000
But a good deal of private touch and information I think everybody working on it is working as expeditiously as a human being, but the most considering the fact that we're all up here, touchifying and otherwise occupied during the day.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
And did you work on it last night? It's calm. Yes, sir. We met Mr. Prudence of my family. Yes, he did.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
You say Senator McCartney and Senator McCullen were likewise saying it.

05:41.000 --> 05:51.000
Mr. Kennedy, get the rest. Now Mr. Polman, I'm sure that we understand your position. You get a board stated.

05:51.000 --> 06:04.000
How more than one occasion. That's a part of the work that was done by Cheyne subsequent to his induction in the Army on the word of the third is to protect him from doctors.

06:04.000 --> 06:14.000
A part of it is not expected. That's for right. That's right. Now what we want is that part of his work.

06:14.000 --> 06:25.000
I think it's conducted in the Army. This is reflected by doctors and then a police informed and just as quickly and as expeditiously as you can be told,

06:25.000 --> 06:33.000
I can jump in with the assistance of members of your staff, that information will be forthcoming about here to this room and presented to this committee.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Yes, sir. Now Mr. Jackson, do I understand I think we leave the directions of the both.

06:38.000 --> 06:47.000
The material prepared by Mr. Cheyne when he will quit the committee and between July and the time of his induction into the Army.

06:47.000 --> 07:00.000
The principal interest of the committee as I understand it is the work that was done by Mr. Cheyne during his years of leaves of practices, both we say,

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
how they're leaking in short all work that was done by Cheyne subsequent to his induction in the Army.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
Yes, that is the principal form of industry. I might have forget about the work he did when he was with the committee and during that July and November period before he went in which he was doing the work.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
Yes, sir. If I was talking about the work that was done by Cheyne, I would have been very happy to see you again.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Yes, sir.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Yes, sir.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Yes, sir.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Yes, sir.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Yes, sir.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Yes, sir.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Yes, sir.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes, sir.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yes, sir.

07:40.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm asking him to bring you all documentary evidence of all the works that Mr. Cheyne did while serving as a member of the committee.

07:50.000 --> 07:58.000
Or whether it is any of the reasons the documentation of the work that he did last year he did the work that he did in the Army.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm going to share them their two classes.

08:01.000 --> 08:11.000
They are documents, reporting, or what I was called the work product of private time, after his induction and while his fort did.

08:11.000 --> 08:22.000
Then there is a second work product that is almost equally interesting, which covers the period after which it was known to Mr. Colton and Mr. Cheyne that he would be inducted.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
That is to say I take it from about July 1 until it is inducted.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And that is of course a critical period.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And I'm interested to see his work product.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So that's my...

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I have no idea what that is.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I have no idea what that is.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I was like separate it so you could see one pile and look at that and another pile.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Very well.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Now there is a committee member who has anything else.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
Well that's the Adi-Sythian Carbine, who is different groupings of the case of this.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I was like, my name is A.L.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I was like, my name is Anishar.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
I was like, well in the beginning to insist that I see anything in the piles of this committee that I want to see.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
I was like, what does the shine that it didn't do, what work he could do, I don't know.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
But certainly, let's get going.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
The Missouri understanding to request this for him to produce.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
So that's the committee can see it.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And whatever he says he does, and brings in years.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Where is he?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
That he did it.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
That's comfortable, but it is.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
That's what I love.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Now I was trying to determine if anybody would not say one of the three groupings or two.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
The very two people have been all of the works described as shine.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
And James B.J. this time has done as the number 5 commission.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
Mr. Wells says that for his purpose, his use can have his Egypt one groupings.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
He works documented that he did between July 1 and November 3rd at the beginning.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
And the work done between November 3rd and up to the present time.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Has any of the committee ever wanted to be a chairman?

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I've said that he's got to be an order to get the complete picture.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
In as much as he was on the committee from one January or February 1st, I've seen all of these.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
And why we should not have it for all preachers.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Because I made that because they're trying together.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
I believe there's testimony in the record that he worked on the voice of America,

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
the information, closely, and the layback to January.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
We're going to find ourselves reflecting all three areas.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
And at some, I mean, material from all preachers and I,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
the light is the gift of the entire curious recovery.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
It's not long.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
It's only from February through the period of January.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Of the Charminada, of the Dr. Phil,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
the famous bachelor's person of the rich here,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
is what was he dealed as he got him on.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Now that is pertinent.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
That on the seven, whether it's to give some indication

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
of the fact that he's actually on the committee business.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Or whether he's on some other business.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
And that is what our environmentalists are in the end.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
And that will be sure to be for the committee in the past,

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
for the material as I do, for the final conclusion that this committee is.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Well, cherry trees, we're under some art and sob,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
and you're trying to provide the information

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
that the various members of the committee or the council might want.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I was hoping to be able to put into two things.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
But I'd go into the files and getting it in my book.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
It's time to get to one of the material.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
And the very data.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
But it's time to join the committee up in Gilles.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
July 1, with the customer doping.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
It's night to fire a little more time.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
The committee's chair has no good conditions to keep out of the record.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Anything that's there.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Any members of the committee want to make connections.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Well, we'll provide all of them very well.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
We'll have three doping terms I understand.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
We'll get to it.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
They say all of them are fallen and say,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
they're trying to find the time.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Where do we stay and all the money that's called the police?

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
We stand on the place that we hope to get to them

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
doing the trick-of-use communication this morning.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
But as the sender of the McGill, I didn't say we're not mentioned at any time.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Duke is the fact that he had other motions before it to the police.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And what a plan is the fact that at this time,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
plan is to have another executive committee meeting whenever we can

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
to go into the committee.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
Well, Mr. Cameron, I'd like to respectfully say that it seems to me that we have some of those.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Well, well, well, please proceed.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
We are in a process of implementation.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Now, the statement is here.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
For some time, we've now we've asked them here

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
if these might have some conversations,

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
might well have something to do with.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
And expedite finding of the basic charge which is time to seem to me

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
and we get far to feel from.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
At least, right, people have mentioned my monitor call in the hearing.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
And I think that in order to be fair to all people,

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
the monitor call to be released and released properly.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
Otherwise, I do not think that I may very respectfully say that it is fair

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
that this situation is being handled properly.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
If you know this, we've been now,

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
whether it's monitor call, the shine, memorandre, or whatever it is,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
we now spend a lot of time to be sharing with the chairman

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
and to exercise the charge we spent a very much while we've been there

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
and trying to get for submitted members

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
in the nation of the committee.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Mr. Dingy, with the call I want to make,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I want to discuss who said this we got.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
Number one, have a nice bringing to deliver to me today.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm getting forward to the terms and the conditions under which you knew

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
and Senator McCarthy agrees with these monitor telephone calls

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
may be for these to go.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
The intercession memorandum I get yesterday is correct.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
The intercession of the one gets to be because the Zionist city gets to be

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
in a conference between you and a member of my side.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
It was decided by you that that letter was not complete

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
and that you desired to elaborate upon it and to expand upon it

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
and to set forth specifically the terms and conditions

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
under which it was this agreeable, the news side of this controversy

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
for the monitor telephone calls may be introduced as evidence.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Now then, I've been a fan of the air about the anti-chimit air.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm now at the city here, I mean, such a definite letter today.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I mean, you do that.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Surely so now the position is the same as it always has

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
and we will consent to all of the calls going in.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Do you want families to come to state publicly?

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Thought your position is with reference to the monitor telephone calls

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
because I as well as all the members of the committee are receiving

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
numerous inquiries from the members of the place.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
So he expected that stuff.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
So if I say the memorandum, the check is by the two things.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Number one, I list its none-runnered phone club which had never been supplied

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
by Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Adams, that it's committee which I believe

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
exists and I'm making this a decision.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
I will call it as many as I can recall the specific date.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
I listed a number of them.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
I gave a specific date and name for people between whom the conversation took place.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Number two, my position is just to send them across these states

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
and other members of the committee to very first date.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
The phone will call to be made available.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
They're accurate.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
They should call to it.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And I will be very grateful to give you a letter

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
to the court of the day and body management.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I'm your love letter, executive name, now, particularly.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Is it calls to which you have reference?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yes, sir.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
For there is, it is composed by the committee.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
They come under the presidential banner, who is a position not being known.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
And as we make important to matter and know, specifically,

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
the terms and conditions under which it is needed for those calls to be produced

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
is evidently.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Yes, I'll be very grateful and we will give you the letter.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
That will be for coming to date.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Yes, sir.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
One other statement, choice, which is perhaps not a question.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
And it is done for the purpose of clarification and pinpointing

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
this particular area of inquiry.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
You are now requested to call by the committee.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
With respect to these, the documents later,

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
the members have written evidence to work them to shine the pretty slight information

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
to us in just like the case.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yes, sir.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
Inspecaly, in the other, number one, the work plan has reflected the documents.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
And we are explaining the position of not all of these workings,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
reflected the documentary actions.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Not all of the work of anyone.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That's right.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Obviously, that means the part is not where it is concerned.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
Number one, all of the work done by Mr. Shion is reflected by anything on paper.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Yes, sir.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
From the tiny chain with a democratic committee,

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
until approximately the first in July when it was known that he would become

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
and he's not seen in the audience.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Number two, the same character of evidence,

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
reflecting the work done to shine from the first in July

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
approximately that base in the wind of fire.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
Number three, the same character of evidence reflecting the work done by him,

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
the subsequent in November that is not working on that.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
We are sure we have everything that is still working on.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
We just last night and they're working on it right now.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
And when that is ready, you will notice five meters of chairman or the members of this committee.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yes, sir.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
That's all I can add.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
That's the thing that you have to send me to the comments.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
I'd like to ask some two senators a matter of five.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
I would like to be taken out of the time of each member of the committee.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
I would like to be there to claim that the poem about his position will be,

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
whether he will object to other members of the committee who have one of his calls

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
to place them in the record under the rules.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
So, one, in other words, let's be frank, but I'm doing it just as mine going to record.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Will I inject it?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Yes, sir.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
No objection.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I'll have to go in and open the window to get the man of the other flag.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
And if any other member of the committee insists upon his telephone calls to the monogamous

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
coming public evidence, you will not object to that list of poems.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Not my right or a product, so it's exactly what sir.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
And I can certainly wait for you.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Exactly.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
So, exactly.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
So, whether in the evening is reached with respect to this,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
always participation of calls or not.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Is that right?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
That's not my business.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I can certainly not object to our problem.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
So, I would like to welcome you to the very thing I have to do.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I think that is very important point of order here.

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
I think that when I was very well found the strategy of waiting in the chair of the committee,

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
as everybody was smoking the implications of being in the middle of itself a total draw.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
Some of these audiences are not even realizing of the chair's birthday.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
Once the floor and one floor was sunk and something shared about the...

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
to consider professional material made of the back of the chair.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
And I'd like to know if it was a chair.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
That's the one point of order I would not have never go over with.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
It's just too much.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, and I believe that was the first time and I have probably just been the last time the guy named Noel Debra,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
he was into a censor.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
They couldn't have been able to replace him and do it.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Thank you.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
The other thing that I would like to say is that,

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
as you can see with the monitor, it's a telephone call.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I'd like to take a picture of the chair.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I think it's taking the chair.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
In the back there, they'll take a picture of the chair and this has signed and filed all of those things.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
But it's entirely correct.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
It's a very important point of order.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
There's been five round care.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
They really know that the pollackers are sharing their guys next ten minutes.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
кахam yesterday with him.

19:52.000 --> 20:17.000
That's really, very important part between General Washington and Anderson Adams while son of FBI,

21:17.000 --> 21:24.000
and the first place we have never yet received in a sense from the senator and the colon covering this precise situation.

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
Next, I think that is the answer of another question, was that if the existing calls by the delivery to the council will,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
then it's a matter of whether they're going to go in or not, nobody knows the answer to that.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
There's not only the reason that's passed, you've received my repeated request, but there's a little problem.

21:41.000 --> 21:52.000
In those instances where they were telephone calls, obviously involving natural security or obviously falling within President Eisenhower's order, those have not been submitted.

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
Well, there's one simple question that I know you know, the other one, if you're a few, answer if you want to.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
There were very important calls, and as long as they didn't matter, we can never find any questions right now because of this.

22:04.000 --> 22:11.000
It's all like the comments. I just was like, no, probably they have the delivery to Mr. Johnson or not, if they've not, for you to tell us.

22:11.000 --> 22:19.000
The answer that's chairman is in the negative, because Mr. Jenkins and I both understand, though it's the fault that he has the presidential direction.

22:20.000 --> 22:29.000
Mr. Jenkins, the very late in starting this morning, I think she was passing 10 minutes to get out with the unirritated driver,

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
would like to submit a part of the kind of hearings.

22:34.000 --> 22:43.000
The letter he received, Mr. Sue tends to run the date of May 31st, and my reply is in June 2nd, both of which is already in session this morning,

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
but he thinks they should be part of the company during the without objections of the entity, the civics and market court.

22:49.000 --> 22:57.000
Other than that, the chair was just like that. One follow-up question, the right-wing guest in Mr. Cormon, we've thrown out a signed entity,

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
and we'll then pass the rest of this time to this round of questions.

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
The chair I asked him questions about your financial relationships, give any, as a long term, as a member of a law firm,

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
I would tell you the sign, as you would see, they'd decide, and you would end up with some detail answering those in the negative.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I should have asked you one follow-up question, but time does not permit.

23:17.000 --> 23:25.000
As any member of your firm, not connected with the sign, or not connected with your law firm, any member of your firm,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
has any financial transactions with any of the signings.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
No, sir, you're sure of that? Yes, sir.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Send him a call.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Let the phone appear before again, do you?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Document of charges.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I believe.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
Yesterday, we had concluded, we'll number six.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.000
So I'll point out number seven at this time, and I shall not read it.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
But it refers to a misfit, true pencil.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
I shall not read it, and comment upon it.

24:08.000 --> 24:20.000
Other, but the cause, misguided by a majority hold of this committee, and over my process, has been dismissed as a principle from these proceedings.

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
When that's a term and the letter, which you have left based in the record, I wish to make some comment about it.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
You may do so, sir.

24:29.000 --> 24:41.000
I protested vigorously against the action of the committee at the time at this list, with the answer as one of the principles to this committee.

24:41.000 --> 24:51.000
There's counsel, however, which, but, and insisted that the committee take the action that it's there.

24:52.000 --> 25:06.000
Infesting as I understood him by the age of four, or four or three by this committee would be accepted by Mr. Hempsel as complete vindication, yet the charges was dismissed under the second sentence.

25:06.000 --> 25:17.000
I want to say, Mr. Chairman, the fact that Mr. Hempsel now comes back here and asks some further consideration of this committee, does his thumb with very good grace to meet?

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
The accepted that action is counsel insisted upon it.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
I thought it was unfair to him at the time. I tried to prevent it.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
I'm not making this statement.

25:28.000 --> 25:46.000
It's definitely precluding a fuzzy consideration of Mr. Hempsel's request, but it's the cause of that action, Mr. Chairman, that was taken, and the cause of Mr. Hempsel's consented to it, and not only considered, but two years of any urge that it be done,

25:46.000 --> 25:55.000
that I now shall not question the witnesses, this witness, or any others regarding Mr. Hempsel, come up and the charges against him.

25:55.000 --> 26:04.000
So he accepted his complete vindication, is not complete vindication to me, but these charges, if they are speaking well, come in.

26:04.000 --> 26:14.000
So they'll have to remain so because of his action, and the action of his counsel, and not because this, and if it consented to it, or act guilty of it.

26:14.000 --> 26:21.000
It's not my time, Mr. Chairman.

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
Oh, you are not getting it time to carry it, because you have not reached a long change of course, since it would like to stay.

26:28.000 --> 26:39.000
At any time, Mr. Hempsel, he said he could well sympathize with his desire to have the record cleared concerning the charges about his world war coups and actual activities.

26:39.000 --> 27:00.000
And I respectfully suggest to the him that Mr. Hempsel's desire to have the house to meet the young government operations, or the Senate Armed Services Committee, to hear that particular phase of the case, because nothing to do with the institution.

27:00.000 --> 27:07.000
The Canada and the other people that he desire to have the different governments for him, to clarify the area, sorry, those charges, if they are speaking.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
Mr. Chairman, I want to say a big part of this.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I want to say a big part of this.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I want to say a big part of this.

27:15.000 --> 27:38.000
The reason is, in the Hempsel case, Mr. Hempsel's sanctions might be rightly so, advised the chair that, while the gentle matter could be brought him to the standpoint of the model, it could be shown as we were investigating him, whether or not he knew the investigation was going on, but that in this particular form, we could not try out all the issues in the Hempsel case.

27:38.000 --> 27:55.000
I agree with Mr. Hempsel's in the House of the Chair, I then felt that because of the consular and the front-manageral order, which Mr. Hempsel from telling anything about what he had to do with other individuals, the executives.

27:55.000 --> 28:06.000
So, when we couldn't get to the truth of that particular matter, however, I think that some of the numbers have made a good point here, and that is that the Hempsel matter should not be left paying in the air.

28:06.000 --> 28:14.000
The charges have to do not merely with World War II activities, but activities last year in Europe.

28:14.000 --> 28:31.000
So, at the present time, I believe it is all intent and purpose in charge, my saying, charge, maybe not technically so, but actually in charge of contracts being led over in Europe for the proper term, rather pie.

28:32.000 --> 28:42.000
A lot of them out of the thing investigated, so I think some of the refining of me to point very well that this should not be left hanging in the air.

28:42.000 --> 28:54.000
Obviously, Mr. Hempsel would not be thought of as having me set a chairman of a committee investigating those charges, and rightly so, I think that we shouldn't.

28:55.000 --> 29:14.000
The Secretary fires that case to another committee, or the alternative would be to find a completely impartial individual on our committee, and assign him the unpleasant path of handling this investigation.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
I have a mind-worn individual who certainly is from the parts of this matter.

29:21.000 --> 29:36.000
What I have a mind-doing is calling a meeting of the committee at the earliest moment that is right in the investigation of the committee and asking the permission of the committee to assign him.

29:37.000 --> 29:46.000
The time is responding to the job being one man committee to file and investigate these charges. I'm sure we'll get a fair investigation.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
I know it'll be an unpleasant duty, but I have a member of this committee. I'm sure he will not.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
Sure, perhaps, have a given as a fine to him.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Senator McCullen? Yes.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Those are all my fellow members.

30:03.000 --> 30:13.000
Much as I appreciate the status of the councilman to meet you and to leave investigation of Mr. Hempsel in an impartial manner, I do appreciate it.

30:13.000 --> 30:24.000
Nevertheless, I feel for two reasons that it would be wrong. The first is that Mr. Hempsel works for the administration, and I am a member of the minority party.

30:25.000 --> 30:34.000
The second is that I think that in a matter of this seriousness, no one man should be a judge.

30:34.000 --> 30:42.000
I'd like to take this opportunity and as much as I believe one of the greatest changes to America is character of that nation.

30:43.000 --> 30:55.000
The emphasis lies that I have nothing in the world against Mr. Hempsel and that I know nothing whatever that he has ever done wrong.

30:55.000 --> 31:05.000
Under all the circumstances, however, I do not believe it will be right to the one member of the minority party to investigate these serious charges.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Senator McCullen?

31:07.000 --> 31:15.000
I'm sure it suggested that the anymore yielding is then you have to come out of the center to find or move you down almost that to get on now with the work.

31:15.000 --> 31:23.000
I felt that more Mr. Hempsel has done dismisses the principal of the case, and there would be no questions concerning him because there would be here all of us.
