WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm asking for a pass over somewhere,

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
not from explanation of why.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
I spoke to the same reason I passed over the charges

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
in New York.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Charge number eight.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Charge left number eight and all four number nine.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
I'll be locked and take issue by force.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
The calls are with us.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I'll be right through the mid-term.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Yes sir.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
But I would like to ask you a five-time task

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
and I'll need the first son and twin.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Be a gift by these petty-gone politicians.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
To take their time on the subcommittees

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
expose your other activities on the drafting

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
and treatment of five-year-olds.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
The sign is petty and untoundless.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Is that true or untrue?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
That's true.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Name the sonny-gum politicians.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I identify them for the country.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Will you please introduce the committee?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yes sir.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I believe it's clear to send a McCarthy who signed a sweater

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
for himself and his behalf.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
I saw from Frank Carlisery throwing two certainly

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Mr. Steven van Mr. Adam.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes, those two.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Well, sorry you're not there.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Senator McCarthy who else he had.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
I'll ask for you.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I'll ask when the McCarthy will need takes to stand.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I'll see you.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Who do you name as the petty-gone politicians?

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I would have in mind particularly Mr. Steven van Mr. Adam.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
No one else?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Find me sir.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
No one else?

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I would not have in mind any other specific names.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I think that there were probably some people outside.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I think there were probably some people over there,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
who were not displeased with the idea of an attack upon this committee.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Maybe that's a title of some honor.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I don't know in distinction, but I will know who they are.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I name I would say Mr. Steven van Mr. Adam.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh, had I called you attention?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Number 11.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
On which you state no impover means of any kind have been used

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
to change that influential treatment for private time.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
All applications and discussions concerning your true beauty

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
with the army have been open and pop-up.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes sir.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Do you state that as soon as?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Yes sir.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
What are you willing for any monocle and calls that you may have made?

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
We'll respect to him, be admitted in evidence in this case.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
So we can check and see just whether it will go from.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Sir, whether it will seek this?

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Sir, I am willing as I said the first day to have four monocle calls.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Go into the records in the preceding.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
But on this part, particularly you would object to them going in

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
unless you could get other monocle calls.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Stand in the mclollion.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm sure you want to be fair about this, sir.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm letting you be fair with yourself.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I'm letting you give your staff the answer.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Fancy and then it's to put in all the calls and give the whole picture

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
and not permit a collection of a few calls which give a part of the picture

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
and leave that other place.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
You're on the same mission.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm object.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
All I'm going in the distance.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
You understand?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
You're on the same mission.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm going to know the position to be that you want them all.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yes.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
But I'm not going to be able to answer this.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
If I want to get as much of the truth, the brigade and all of it is my priority possible.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
As far as I'm concerned, sir, I do not want to get a distorted age.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
If there are any particular calls that you would object to here,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
if it's right, open and nothing, secret or nothing,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
but we're seeking preferential treatment.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Why would you object to it going in because it is co-operated?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
What's your say?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
That's right, sir.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
And we would like all of the calls to go into.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I am the same as I call.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
But if you can't get all of it, you can get more under the call.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I'll bring one, two things right now.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Why not?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
We'll do it.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
So this region, sir, you have set something on the phone.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I respect what you said.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Many stations that you want to be fair to everyone in one area.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
You're being constructed in a fair way.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
To me, sir, it is not fair to let one side of a controversy select.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Not a bunch of calls, a few calls, or a number of calls,

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
which they think are going to help their sides and to exclude other calls,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
which they think might damage them.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
And I think if you ask me, sir, if you ask me to consent to a collection

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
by Mr. Davis and Mr. Adams of what call they want in,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
and to give them the option of concealing, even from Mr. Jenkins,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
and the committee's other call for phenol existence,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
which shed life on the toll issue.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I think you are being very unfair.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Well, I don't really know what I'm going to ask you this.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
If the call would help you, if the monitor notes of this call,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
and it was getting called, when Mr. Metz and Mr. Shine would help

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
corroborate and substantiate your own statement.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
You don't know how in the world you think that would be unfair to you.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
It's done.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I think it would be unfair to have a collection set.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Well, if the selection is made of those that corroborate,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
you can defend your holiday that being fair.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I'll say how it might be unfair to you.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
There might be one call about one thing.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
There might be another call about something else.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
One call might be spread away previous call.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
If we get the one and we don't get the previous call,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
you will have one here for picture.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And something in there might be taken out of context,

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
or particularly, if you were the fact that Mr. Stephen was monitoring the call,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
we did not know he was monitoring them.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
In addition to that, sir, he is now seeking to make a selection

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
of which call can come in and go out.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Do you think, Mr. Stephen, is actually seeking to make this election?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yes, I don't know.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Do you know they will be produced in so far as they can in the executive direction?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I believe so.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Don't you believe that?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
No, sir, I do.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
You don't believe it.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
And may I tell you why, sir?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yes.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Be call out.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I wonder.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yes, sir.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Be call out long before there was any executive director.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
In existence, we request this certain call,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
if he turns over to Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Hollis,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
or if at least they two weeks last,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
when there was no executive director in those call,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
and never turned over,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
saying that very at the time.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Do you mean an executive director is an executive representative

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
for cheating parties?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes, sir.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
That's the potential call from coming in.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, I understand that to be the position being served by Mr. Hollis, sir.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Well, I didn't say I understand,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
and I'm sitting as the general director that he finished the year before,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
it has been a special director of wildlife together.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
It's the main subject that he's directed by such a person.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Does that mean anything that the director makes?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Well, I may have been taken by that.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
But I may not have said it disagreeing with you.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I would want them all to, and I do.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
I hope it can get them all.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
So what it's thought of making here is one that

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
has corroborated what the attorney has.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
They seem to me you wouldn't object to it in yourself.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
No, sir, I don't object to helping myself.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I do object to what this thought is.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
It takes you coming into the right.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I'd like everything to do.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
All right, let's go to number 12.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yes.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, I still promise.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
What's the charge, the participation in this matter

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
was the participation and the charge.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
At the constant attempts on the part of the Pentagon,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
the billions, the trade-off,

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
treatment for a private charge against the plighting of self-committee exposure

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
of the manning of commoners infiltration and the military.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Did Mr. Carr express your invitation?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
A man of self-committee.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yes.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
He did?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yes.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
All am in the occasion?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
A number of occasions.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
A number of occasions.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yes.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
When don't you agree with me that he's an important witness to this

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
repeating?

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Surely, sir, and I'm sure that Mr. Carr is not only willing but anxious to come in here and testify.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
He should cooperate with that statement, please.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yes, sir.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm just saying it.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
As the charge against the Army or justice, this happens in secondary scenes.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I think there is testimony of these folks that admit he can substantiate it.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
He can testify to that personally.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
Yes, I, again, so bad that it irritated him as staff directed it to me.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Sir, I think there is a lot that Mr. Carr is going to say that it's going to be repetition

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
for the third or fourth time to think for Senator McCarthy.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
And I have said that.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Oh, my God.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
A whole lot of parole, but Richard is in a major repetition.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
And it did not.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
You know that as well.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
You don't.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
You're absolutely right, sir.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
So it would not hurt the case.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
The admins, the far testifying parole, he's charging with the parole solace, and that will help.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
I wouldn't have say he wouldn't have a through-five that it would help with it to get the hold back.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I think there is a 50-low solace, though, that will help our case.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yes.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
So, this time is exciting.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
The fourth center of the direction starts to question the witness what's returning to us.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
You'll be out across the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
This is ABC Television Network.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
The standing is now that the police do you want.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
As a senator to the Inclusion of Telephone calls between himself and members of the committee.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
That's right.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
Mr. Lounce, I presume that's a good deal.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
I agree with Mr. Lounce, thanks, and yes.

08:44.000 --> 08:55.000
Now Mr. Chairman, would there be any objection to a party in interest reading his own telephone calls into the election?

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Mr. Lounce, I believe, is a range of things.

08:59.000 --> 09:08.000
Legal points are very, very serious days, and which this matter came up about some part of the Federal Communications Act,

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
which requires content to people at both end of the telephone line before you can devour the sentence.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
Obviously, I'm not sure if I remember Mr. Wilt Gray's point, because at that time suggested this business of getting content,

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
but just to wealth is a distinguished spot to lawyer, and we can answer whether that is correct enough.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I think this is a good deal.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
I was wondering why the one derailed for this certainly was raised, and it is a problem that Mr. Dake and the Nile have longed real.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
If the record would show your rage in an interest instance, you'd probably call me to look at this, because you're all signed at that time to find a way to put the limit.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Mr. Jenkins, cooperate with what you said, you're correct.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Mr. Chairman, thanks.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
You're not a required by that matter, and I'm seeing Senator Berkland.

09:54.000 --> 10:05.000
Mr. Wilt and I agree that for four, a telephone call, which is monitored, maybe for an evidence that is the monitoring of this telephone call,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
is the same as the credit that we had.

10:08.000 --> 10:21.000
It is mind-assigning that Senator Berkland desires to now lead into the record, certain telephone calls, monitor telephone calls, between himself as a security army.

10:21.000 --> 10:33.000
It is better mind-assigning that the security of the army has been considered by a student, and a direction by the very leading of the telephone calls, consent, and the security.

10:33.000 --> 10:46.000
The message in the message is perfectly proper, and by any, no, or whatever, percent of the reduction of this time to reach into the record, the monitor telephone calls between himself and the security army, if he desires to do so.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And the mic's out.

10:48.000 --> 10:59.000
I have no action to reach it, but I call attention to the committee that it will not be shown in the testimony if it's just brought by the senator himself.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
So what I have been trying to do is to get what's the testimony.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Who does the looser of this?

11:05.000 --> 11:13.000
Well, the reason why are these are the monitor calls, and when it does, I'm going to press my own record, my own record.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
That's the other phone of order, but not the other one.

11:16.000 --> 11:28.000
And the matter is that as well, the motion when the police and the telephone calls, there's a public evidence that they were enjoying inside the corner.

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
So, I have no objection to mind going into the matter back to the mine, the matter part of the public record.

11:36.000 --> 11:45.000
But it's understanding that there's a group in front of the order, so that you can determine what the truth is.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
So, I think that's the kind of work that people need to monitor.

11:52.000 --> 12:01.000
My director, my director, that's the chair of the matter that is collected by the comment moving to the center.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
And as far as people who are all introduction to the monitor calls are concerned, chair of the lead.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Chair of the lead, is the monitor?

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
What's the reason he's own monitor, his telephone conversation, in the end of the week, that they haven't been offended to by perpetrated people.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
The subject is certainly has that right.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
And that, if and when we should look at this call, there's a special duty problem.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
And he, then, as I said in the OHS, is this the true transcript?

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
It will have the same essence as one testimony, tell them about it.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
Chair of the I.T., it's actually lead his own monitor, his telephone conversation, the record.

12:38.000 --> 12:47.000
So, it's 50 days old, in the relative, under whatever circumstances prevail, and none of the prevail, he will follow the same criteria, that's not his right.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Keep your order, I will, I think, a gesture chair.

12:50.000 --> 13:01.000
I do think that, though, we are all to be reminded of this fact, that only at the very early stages of the trial, we have just to make this on the stand.

13:01.000 --> 13:10.000
As most of you, say, say, see, from the Mr. Adam public place, authentic to be an election of the monitor telephone calls.

13:10.000 --> 13:22.000
And I will say that as the trial lawyer, I have proposed the three that have missed the one that was then remissioned to the way into what they seem to expect a season to descendant.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
And they then ran to the block with the help of the other students.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
The descendant has said, nothing is going in the left air where they know the data.

13:34.000 --> 13:50.000
And to the right, when it comes to either the son of the, or anybody else, and the son of the son of the, or anybody else can seclude the son of the, from reading his calls into the record, along with the son of the, by, secretary of the, the chair with you, and the secretary with him,

13:50.000 --> 13:59.000
and those who are here to defend the state, if you don't, and the state, the secretary is an intellectual, and the secretary, but only three in the chairman may take.

13:59.000 --> 14:11.000
Under the terms of the consent, for the been fined by the secretary of the army, Mr. Adam, and is fined by all members of the special subcommittee,

14:12.000 --> 14:21.000
is it possible to, say, certain forms of health and have admitted, admitted, and be found out?

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
Concerned to such consent, the chair with us contains, he comes to the well, or is possible or not?

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Uh, I'm so well, does it consent?

14:29.000 --> 14:40.000
Given my secretary, Adam, and Mr., the secretary, I suspect that Stevens and Mr. Adam, have any change attached to the, have any modifications that they say they must all go in or not?

14:40.000 --> 15:07.000
I think you mentioned, Adam, in respect of this situation, that the, that Mr. Secretary Stevens and Mr. Adam, on the mentioned, Adam, consents of the attations of all members of the telephone calls between, um, and in addition, have given the senators an honor and both the state to put on again their telephone calls, their members of the call, get the senators, which is, which is, which is, to exercise that option?

15:07.000 --> 15:36.000
I ask that you take them to that, that the year they got for the job, Mr. Wreck, I am handing a VV and place others at this morning, Mr. Cohn, as stated on the House of the Human Services, and of Senator McCuckish, that they are now within part of the senators, the members of the committee, to present an evidence, their respective monitors, monitors, telephone calls, and under the situation of the, as it's now existing chairs, as I do, which individual members of this committee are,

15:36.000 --> 15:45.000
as members of this committee are, as members of the hall of the committee, may now lead into the record, or any time they since this lead into the record, their monocles telephone calls.

15:45.000 --> 16:00.000
So, well, to get right down now to the C in the Boston Harbor, I want to ask you the direct question, whether you desire the chairs to submit, Senator Dirk Smith, or he's monitored phone calls, which gives my attention to the record, or whether you object.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
I serve the commission, no else, just an investigation in my proceed.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
It's Chairman Oliver Evans, not out of my concern, I serve.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
It was not.

16:09.000 --> 16:19.000
Now, Mr. Chairman, there are things such as Sherlock Holmes' attributes about all the telephone calls, or the mixture of telephone calls.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
What I tell these were taking calls between Secretary Stevens and I, obviously bodies, the latter days.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
The first one happened on September 8, 2015, in 1954, as I mentioned.

16:31.000 --> 16:40.000
Both days, running for Secretary Evans called on to the book, 9.50 days, except days, right for the Army, please.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Those were the I calls that had been charged with its role.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
I didn't know where he was yesterday, but John Adams found out that he was staying at the can I tell in all the names.

16:50.000 --> 16:59.000
And I just came off the phone with him, and I simply responded to him, that I have gone to the very most relevant to the company that they encounter.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
And the touch-creen to the conversation I had with each one of his friends.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
Of course, he didn't like it, got very mad about it, and finally he just said,

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
when he was supposed to be the first kind of thought to be known before the committee went first.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I told I would take it under his life.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
He said, both, are you with him?

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
I said, both, I have taken on your life, but it's not.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
I don't know whether I have accepted it or not.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I just wanted to post to you that I took it.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
I told the general where it came from, and it wound up with your continuing move for 10-15 days.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
That's about it, and I got too often known, and I thought I often tell you other than it was in both.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
I understand, Bob, the observations that you gave me yesterday afternoon,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
and all of them taken through the record.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
I have heard that it was about the year of the Olympic Games.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Secretary Johnson, they have them set up a judgment yet.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Secretary Army, I have not an athlete from the general himself,

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
so they are going to be the general and the captain against those, yet.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Secretary Johnson, yes.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Secretary, because it's of all indivisible.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Secretary Johnson, I checked this morning, and I had it there in line.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
They were striking it from the left.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
Secretary Johnson, we will have to consider this is the fall of all the committees,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
and let's recognize our left-hand side.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Secretary Johnson, yes, Dr. Williams, yes.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
I am sorry to call things that make me turn to the panel.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
I can't just idle my hand, wipe this posture forward, please do not.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
The next call in the Chabin was 25.1954.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
8.5 AM, covered in proven foam, kind of, of the same speed and speed.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
If you are just about life I told you, and I can't file,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I'm going to have to do something.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
It must, it may get stressful.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I want to do many things, all these kinds of things,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
working on these big problems, telling me what to do.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
But I am going to leave it, lady.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I am not going to leave it, lady.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
I think I have an absolute piece of art, and the service is along with me.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
And I think it is just a shame, and I think it has to be straight out of it.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Just what the right thing to do is, I don't know.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
My present safety is there, Severus.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
Should I be a bound by the fact that I can't come along what I've been all in yesterday?

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
He is not supposed to do the paper, but I have to know what he said with some of the papers.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
And I feel I have to ask that through for the most necessary to be a stumped.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
And go back up there and play this morning that I felt bound.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
And the whole thing is told me to be good by the fact that I will have to make a tape,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
that I will have to make a tape.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
When I may be even tell them what the paper is, what the tape is, what the paper is.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Who have you come to see?

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Last week, I was thinking of a person who was holding a paper.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I didn't get him until 11th birthday.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
I thought the car was Charlie, and I thought this girl,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
known as the one in the costume, I told all of my kids.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
I said this thing is one thing credit, and it's kind of sad because I came to show what happened.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
He just absolutely didn't go in the day, I am a yellow guy.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
I have a person who has a particular ability.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
So I will have to be taken by a person.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
I don't know what to do about this, and I don't want to do anything with you.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
But it will have to be done.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
First, let's call a call.

21:08.000 --> 21:20.000
Mr. Tom, in order to try to pinpoint the

21:20.000 --> 21:29.000
issues in this controversy, I want to now, want now to put to you some two-ball question

21:29.000 --> 21:36.000
that I also want to ask you.

21:37.000 --> 21:44.000
Chapter 79, Title 18, Section 1621, deal with purchase.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
The states have been affected any person that testifies under oath,

21:50.000 --> 22:14.000
and willfully and contrited such oaths, states or conspired, any material matter which he does not to please too,

22:15.000 --> 22:24.000
and will be a purgeary and shall accept as otherwise expressly provided by law if I am not more than 2000 or more than five years.

22:24.000 --> 22:34.000
There have been a number of allegations and statements made against you Mr. Tom that I believe are material to these controversy.

22:34.000 --> 22:43.000
To this controversy, these allegations have been made under oath by Mr. Steven, Mr. Adams, Lieutenant Blouk and Colonel Ballot.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
I wish to give you the opportunity of time to declare the truth of Paul Smith's fault for the of these allegations.

22:49.000 --> 22:59.000
On the other hand, there have been a number of statements and allegations by you against Mr. Steven and Mr. Adams that have been denied by them under oath.

22:59.000 --> 23:09.000
I want to give you the opportunity at this time to repeat the statements that you have made in public here and before this form under oath.

23:09.000 --> 23:20.000
If you repeat the statements under oath that you have already made in public and that you have been denied here under oath by Mr. Steven and Mr. Adams, then someone has given you a purgeary.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
This is the most serious matter and I hope you will consider deeply that you answer these questions.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Do you want me to comment on that?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Yes, I must be glad to.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Of course I know the purgeary statute, so I prosecuted Cami Nus Andre.

23:32.000 --> 23:44.000
I also know that the attorney general and his chief assistant are more involved who have instigated this infancy proceeding in the fake I'm going to be looking at my testimony and I assure you anything I tell you will be the truth.

23:44.000 --> 23:59.000
In spite of the fact there is a fact that for Mr. Smith's fault, the statements that I just read to you is the identical statements that I read are substantially identical, but I read to the other two principles.

23:59.000 --> 24:07.000
Nothing in the statements that I have made is to be construed obviously that you will testify for what you understand that.

24:07.000 --> 24:16.000
Of course I can finally make this statement for the record so there is no misunderstanding as I put these questions as I say.

24:16.000 --> 24:26.000
The form of this preliminary statement is identical with the form that I read to Mr. students and the matter.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
I will answer every question you put to me and I will answer it justly.

24:30.000 --> 24:47.000
Mr. Cohn, it was stated by you on March 12, 1954 that the Army had issued the so-called chronological series of events because they had failed in fired blackmail attempt.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
Is this allegation of attempted blackmail to a fall?

24:51.000 --> 25:02.000
Yes, sir. I think it's true and I think the testimony of members of this very committee concerning Mr. Adams, visit to them, try and excel at the scene as if the loyalty for it and hinting as one of the members put it.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
But if that were not done, something else would be done. That's the me, sir, it's blackmail in the way I use it.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
You say you think it's true. Is it true or is it false?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Sure it is true. I think that's been proved to be uninducked.

25:22.000 --> 25:34.000
It is stated by Frank Carr and the memorandum, the Senator McCarthy of December 19, 1953 and I told him.

25:34.000 --> 25:44.000
Even though they, the Army, said he shined the verb they commissioned, they did not give us to him because of the left wing threat.

25:44.000 --> 25:52.000
And they kept trying to dangle the post-mall favors in front of him, end of post-memorandum.

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
Did you ever hear Mr. Stevens or Mr. Adams make a statement that five of China deserves a commission?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Yes sir.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Then I, you say you did. I just said.

26:05.000 --> 26:15.000
So is this allegation that the Army stated that the truth of Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams, that China deserves a commission?

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Is that statement true or is that statement false?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I don't follow you. They just say that.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Mr. Adams particularly said that.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Well now let's take them one at a time.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Yes sir.

26:25.000 --> 26:32.000
Because the statement that Mr. Adams stated, that China deserves a commission.

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
Is that statement of Mr. Adams true or is it false?

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Right. Mr. Adams said that.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Yes. I heard him say that.

26:43.000 --> 26:55.000
Well, is the statement then that Mr. Adams made to you that he made the time to work the commission?

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Is that, is the true that he made the statement?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Yes sir. It is true that he made the statement.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
It is true that Mr. Stevens made a similar statement.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I don't recall the statement making a statement.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Mr. Adams did say that.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yes.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
But he deserved a commission and that statement is true.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Yes sir.

27:15.000 --> 27:22.000
Mr. Cohn, you're quoted in the US News and World Report of March 19, 1954 as stated and I quote.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
No improper insolence was ever exerted by me or anyone else on behalf of China in this book.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Is that statement true or false?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
What's out of that is my position.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Is that statement true or is it false?

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
I believe I thought it was true. That statement is true.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
You didn't, but you didn't now.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Well, I will say it again sir. That statement is true.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
All I want is no improper.

27:45.000 --> 27:55.000
On the press, on March 14, 1954, you answered a question of Mr. Jack Bell by stating and I quote.

27:55.000 --> 28:02.000
The only communication we had with the Army about China when he was down a fort dick.

28:02.000 --> 28:19.000
So, for sure, it's through our arrangements, but after his thing he was over, at the end of the day and over weekend, when he was doing a no training, he would instead of recreational activities, the voting itself to work.

28:19.000 --> 28:27.000
And that was the only purpose of any communication we had with the Army while we were at Fort Dick.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Sir, I believe it's about committee work and it's not.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh, we read it. What part of it do you have the...

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Yes sir.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
...of transcripts from Mr. Fred.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I have an excerpt from the transcript which I believe is the excerpt.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
Well, what part? Let me read it as soon as you stop me when I'm...

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
Well, I can say something that the voting itself to work. I believe it was the voting itself to commit.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
I believe that I said the voting itself to committee work.

28:53.000 --> 29:06.000
Well, just a minute. I'll have the actual transcripts to you that are saying from each of the tests and then I think there can be no.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
What if it appeared in your transcript?

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
I have this from the typewriter's and she and it may be well...

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
It may well be Mr. Stone that's...

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
...the sonar that's been made an error.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
Maybe that I'm wrong to tell a little bit about this one.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
What's the budget?

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
I have to be a focus stat of the original transcript here sir.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
And I believe on page 7, the term...

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Committee work appears.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
Well, close me back to that.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Sure, it's so long. I'm 10.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Close me back to that.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Sure.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I'd be glad to hand up the...

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
...this photo set of the transcripts.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
We have a right here. I understand that the amendment is pretty work. We're checking it right now.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Yes sir.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
And let me refer again now to be surprised if you have a handy there and I...

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
...shut, so on any mistake from the actual transcript.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Yes sir.

30:12.000 --> 30:19.000
You were quoted on each the press on March 14th as stating in an answer to Larry Svay.

30:19.000 --> 30:30.000
And I told him, as I said Mr. Svay, we did not ask for special statements or shy for him, meaning shy and the full.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Is that statement true or false?

30:32.000 --> 30:40.000
Yes, that's true. And I'd say as I said Mr. Svay, as I believe that, we laid back to certain things which I said then, which I said before this committee.

30:40.000 --> 30:49.000
Namely sir, that our discussions with the Army about shine, both relations, they'll finish up committee work, that on the question of assignments or treatment,

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
but with regard to him was why he deserved on the merits, nothing more sir and nothing less than I stand on that.

30:55.000 --> 31:03.000
It is a crucial question Mr. Corm because they do aligns with the special treatment has been asked for a choice.

31:03.000 --> 31:12.000
I say with the modification that as I said, you refer back to the prior context of the broadcast, the statement is true.

31:13.000 --> 31:21.000
Any member, next question, any member I am from you Mr. Corm, the senator must part the date of December 9th, 1953.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
The following was stated, you have that.
