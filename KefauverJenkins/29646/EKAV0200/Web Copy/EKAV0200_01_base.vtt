WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
May we come to our duty?

00:07.000 --> 00:18.080
Chair, we begin again by welcoming the folks who have come here as guests of the committee

00:18.080 --> 00:20.080
to attend your hearings.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.080
I tell you you are welcome.

00:22.080 --> 00:29.840
So, all your attention to a standing rule of the committee, which forbids any manifestations

00:29.840 --> 00:38.440
of approval or disapproval of an audible nature by any member of the audience at any time.

00:38.440 --> 00:44.320
The officers that you see before you and the plain clothes men scattered to the audience

00:44.320 --> 00:51.320
have a standing instruction from the committee to remove from the room immediately but politely

00:51.320 --> 00:58.320
to anybody who at any time violates the terms under which you enter the room which was

00:58.320 --> 01:02.720
to refrain entirely from manifestations of approval or disapproval.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.280
Chair has two announcements to make.

01:06.280 --> 01:13.320
He is very certain of the context of the first after he has touched on around the table.

01:13.320 --> 01:21.000
It was decided by General Agreement that in his mantra, the Monday of next week is a legal

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
holiday.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.520
There will be no meeting of the committee and the legal holiday.

01:27.520 --> 01:36.760
So, when we adjourn and party, we will recess until Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock.

01:36.760 --> 01:44.040
We also have a meeting on the question of the monitored telephone call Mr. Welsh produced

01:44.040 --> 01:52.040
a new form of a new statement which has been signed by Mr. Stevens and Mr. Paters.

01:52.040 --> 02:00.040
It was signed by all of the members of the subcommittee, seven members of the subcommittee.

02:00.040 --> 02:09.040
Chair understands that the monitored telephone call involving Mr. McCarty, Senator McCarty,

02:09.040 --> 02:17.040
Mr. Cohn and Mr. Carr have now been turned over to the custody of Council Secretary.

02:17.040 --> 02:23.040
And there will be additional signatures for any calls involving members of the subcommittee.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.040
There will also be turned over to Council Secretary Jenkins.

02:27.040 --> 02:32.040
Council Jenkins is going to spend a considerable portion of tonight while every time he is

02:32.040 --> 02:39.040
necessary with his staff, determining which calls are relevant and whether there are any

02:39.040 --> 02:46.040
items of security from the standpoint of our national security interest involved in any of

02:46.040 --> 02:48.040
the calls.

02:48.040 --> 02:55.040
In connection with the introduction as evidence, once the subcommittee has decided on advice

02:55.040 --> 03:00.040
of Council, which calls are relevant and to be introduced.

03:00.040 --> 03:06.040
We will ask whoever happens to be on the stage of the time, whether it be somebody representing

03:06.040 --> 03:13.040
the position of Mr. Stevens and Adams, or somebody representing the position of Senator McCarty,

03:13.040 --> 03:19.040
Mr. Cohn and Mr. Carr, to step down at that time so that we can introduce those calls with

03:19.040 --> 03:23.040
the possible, with the least possible amount of delay.

03:23.040 --> 03:27.040
The audience has a cheer on you, but I have heard that you have a good session.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.040
Mr. Chairman, find a minute.

03:28.040 --> 03:32.040
As I commend the door, I have stood you to play the son of Mr. Cohn and not.

03:32.040 --> 03:40.040
I think it should be made clear that all of my men are for 12, all of Mr. Cohn, all of Mr. Carr.

03:40.040 --> 03:45.040
I already am a hand, I will let you join from Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.040
Those calls have not yet been delivered.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.040
It has to do with the judgments, and now find an agreement.

03:51.040 --> 03:56.040
They have all signed the same agreement, and so Mr. Wilson is able to deliver to Mr. Jenkins.

03:56.040 --> 04:01.040
Those calls under the same restrictions and on the same basis, with your calls, are going to deliver to Mr. Jenkins.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.040
Mr. Chairman, I shall.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.040
I am a comment.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.040
Well, I'm very inquired about it.

04:06.040 --> 04:12.040
I am a chair of the CAA, but all of the principals and all members are looking at their hands, so I am going to.

04:12.040 --> 04:17.040
I do feel as one exception because I do not know whether Mr. Cohn is considered under the head of the principal.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.040
He was not up to meeting. He did not see the difference over 50 times.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.040
He already signed over 50 times.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.040
He signed over 40 times. That's three weeks ago.

04:25.040 --> 04:34.040
Very well, but then, the basis for that information might presume that the calls of Mr. Cohn, either have been delivered to Mr. Jenkins or are not available.

04:34.040 --> 04:43.040
Would you count through the will of all the national witnesses, Mr. Charley, the presentation of the seasons out in the side of the case, Mr. Cohn.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.040
Mr. Chairman, I have a wire here, which I would like to put in the record.

04:48.040 --> 04:52.040
The Mrs. Dorothy ship, published her the New York Post.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.040
The wire reads as follows.

04:54.040 --> 05:02.040
As you know, Santa McCogkey this morning repeatedly characterized the New York Post as a communist sheep.

05:02.040 --> 05:12.040
He has previously made similar posts and ridiculous charges against the New York House of June, the New York Times, the Washington Post,

05:12.040 --> 05:21.040
the Baltimore Sun and the magazine publisher, By-Han Reloots, but it means published by, I don't know, but that's the way it reads.

05:21.040 --> 05:32.040
Who have known me and my family for over 25 years, who have heard the testimony of our editor, Jimmy Wexberg, when he was called before the McCarthy Committee.

05:32.040 --> 05:41.040
I know that you know my devotion to democracy and my hatred of both communism and fascism at home and abroad.

05:41.040 --> 05:53.040
But for the benefit of millions of people who may not know me or my newspaper, I would appreciate it if he would read this statement into the record of the hearing today,

05:53.040 --> 05:58.040
sincerely Dorothy Sherp, publisher New York Post.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.040
Mr. Cohn, can you confirm it?

06:01.040 --> 06:06.040
I think it's due to that wire from the publisher.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.040
I think I should confirm it.

06:08.040 --> 06:14.040
I think maybe she has one point in my wire.

06:14.040 --> 06:21.040
If I referred to it as a communist sheep, I should have referred to it as a communist land sheep.

06:21.040 --> 06:31.040
I'm glad to fact a record. I don't think that they get their directions as a daily worker to those directions that the headquarters have become a part of it.

06:31.040 --> 06:35.040
Just a complete communist wire in the paper.

06:35.040 --> 06:42.040
I'm going to say that, well, I have discussed the infiltration of certain elements of the press and the offensive they have added to the commissioners.

06:42.040 --> 06:50.040
I feel that the New York Post is in a class almost by itself.

06:50.040 --> 07:01.040
It is not a follow-up for today. I agree that the daily worker is not publicly under the discipline I assume of the communist party.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.040
I don't know what it appears to be.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.040
They do follow the daily workers that it oils.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.040
Completely fouling them.

07:08.040 --> 07:14.040
You're very sure that the communist party, the editor of the paper, had missed it.

07:14.040 --> 07:18.040
They had missed it. He was one of the top functionaries.

07:18.040 --> 07:25.040
The young communist league claims that reform, knowing the case, never reform.

07:25.040 --> 07:31.040
Certainly has never done anything like what the certain individuals who were members of the party reform,

07:31.040 --> 07:40.040
just to find it done. He continues to attack the FBI, continues to attack any committee, anyone who was exposing communist.

07:40.040 --> 07:44.040
They are excited. One final word in this connection with Mr. Chairman.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.040
I do this because of the wire.

07:46.040 --> 07:53.040
When I refer to the elements of a press which have been immunized by the people of New York Service for the communist party,

07:53.040 --> 08:01.040
I think that I always make it clear that the vast majority of the press,

08:01.040 --> 08:05.040
I are performing a great service and bringing news to the American people.

08:05.040 --> 08:10.040
It takes, for example, a working class here, at least 90 percent of them.

08:10.040 --> 08:21.040
I think some of the finest Americans I've ever met, so that we make no mistake about any claim that all of the press are communist controlled.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.040
Just one further word to...

08:24.040 --> 08:31.040
We know that one of the aims on the orders of the communist party has been so safe,

08:31.040 --> 08:34.040
they press and control the media of information.

08:34.040 --> 08:39.040
I feel they have done that thoroughly insofar as the New York Post is concerned.

08:39.040 --> 08:46.040
I feel that it's next to the daily worker, following his line, doing great service,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.040
becoming the party of the party of the Supreme Court,

08:48.040 --> 08:52.040
which I am nothing on as soon as I'm discussing this further.

08:52.040 --> 08:56.040
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, but here you at least, we admit it.

08:56.040 --> 09:01.040
Again, it makes us pleased that we get on with the case of hand because certainly,

09:01.040 --> 09:04.040
among our problems, there's nothing investigation of the New York Post.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.040
Thank you, Chairman.

09:06.040 --> 09:13.040
Mr. Chairman, there has been much discussion of the federal fuel investigation,

09:13.040 --> 09:16.040
commonly termed the FBI.

09:16.040 --> 09:21.040
In all the six positions that I held the executive side of the government,

09:21.040 --> 09:29.040
I always had next to me either an FBI man or an FBI train man.

09:29.040 --> 09:35.040
The Air Force today is one of the great boys at the FBI,

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
one of the greatest boys the FBI has ever put out.

09:37.040 --> 09:41.040
He's now a major general in the Air Force, and he handled those matters.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.040
The only reason that I bring this up is,

09:45.040 --> 09:49.040
but all there was back to any member of this committee,

09:49.040 --> 09:53.040
or any member of this committee stand.

09:53.040 --> 09:58.040
I think I know Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, as well as any other member of the committee,

09:58.040 --> 10:03.040
and I know that I admire him, at least as much, as any other member of the committee.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.040
Thank you.

10:05.040 --> 10:10.040
You will call an explicit superintendent from Cedars-Ratton-Francini.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.040
Mr. Sounds.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.040
Please.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.040
Mr. Sathin in the room.

10:28.040 --> 10:32.040
The way you are going to do it, is the time Mr. Sathin is here.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.040
First of all, I'm here about to give you the juice, the whole juice,

10:35.040 --> 10:37.040
and nothing but the juice you've got.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.040
You can add it to your ear.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.040
You can try it.

10:41.040 --> 10:45.040
Mr. Chairman, I should make this statement.

10:45.040 --> 10:51.040
Mr. Samson, as well as the witness that will follow Mr. Seagull.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.040
Our representatives are of the Chesapeake,

10:55.040 --> 11:00.040
the telephone company in New York, telephone company respectively.

11:00.040 --> 11:07.040
The report was merely now in the introduce and the help of some of the managers.

11:07.040 --> 11:11.040
This man, on the road, can say that he left a 2000,

11:11.040 --> 11:13.040
five hundred thousand won to me,

11:13.040 --> 11:16.040
and Mr. Sathin knows that I still lift the phone down,

11:16.040 --> 11:18.040
but I'll tell you the time.

11:18.040 --> 11:21.040
Well, if the folks are agreeable,

11:21.040 --> 11:25.040
if it's all party, that's the only wife in the institution,

11:25.040 --> 11:30.040
everything's back and set, all of the records are the two telephone couples.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.040
The reception of the fire, when that's nothing,

11:33.040 --> 11:36.040
that is poor and testimony, and it has been issued out of the government.

11:36.040 --> 11:41.040
There is nothing with history in this channel with both aesthetic kinds,

11:41.040 --> 11:46.040
as the original telephone pick is made to introduce by the tent.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.040
Before you introduce the call from the government,

11:50.040 --> 11:55.040
Mr. Tankham's decide which ones are certain persons.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.040
I think any phone calls, any phone calls from the committee here,

11:59.040 --> 12:01.040
Mr. Sain, any calls from him to the committee.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.040
And perhaps other calls may be certain.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.040
I personally was, and I think with a bit of a,

12:07.040 --> 12:12.040
I personally was, of the making public and the names of all the people

12:12.040 --> 12:14.040
that Mr. Sain might have called.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.040
And I'll be glad to rely on Mr. Tankham's death on that.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.040
I'll let the letter go on.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.040
Mr. Tankham's office is canceled,

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
but an agreement has been issued.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.040
Mr. Walsh has no disposition to involve people who are not going to be called as witnesses.

12:26.040 --> 12:31.040
I think enough of Mr. Tankham's and the calls that he introduced about understanding.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.040
Mr. Tankham, we will be delivered to you,

12:34.040 --> 12:38.040
this watch, the Dr. Walsh's.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.040
Mr. Tankham's meeting,

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
you know, when you'll be the next to Dr. Walsh,

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040
so the state is making laws.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.040
Mike, you might be the next to Dr. Walsh.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.040
Mr. Tankham's office is on,

12:51.040 --> 12:55.040
as well as Mr. Tankham's office.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.300
I'll beuchi's

12:58.540 --> 12:59.540
minus

13:01.240 --> 13:02.880
motor

13:03.380 --> 13:04.220
2

13:06.680 --> 13:08.880
night

13:11.240 --> 13:12.400
Don't

13:14.880 --> 13:16.300
buy

13:20.520 --> 13:21.600
another

13:25.640 --> 13:30.240
I was at this point to read a letter of death to me of May 13th.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.640
Mr. Jenkins

13:32.640 --> 13:36.120
I see hearings on late times, Mr. Corne and Senator MacArthur about us for

13:36.120 --> 13:41.040
first taste on page 2246 of the transcripts of following appears.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.320
Mr. Corne

13:42.320 --> 13:46.000
Mr. Secretary, we need now to address the name of the person our persons to give

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
him honor with his charge to the Communist Major Major Erving Correct Mr. Jenkins.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.560
Mr. Janet is in my opinion with that question and I am sure that he is there by

13:54.560 --> 13:57.060
with the only relative to the issues of this controversy.

13:57.960 --> 14:01.060
Mr. Corne and Senator MacArthur's first father are over for the names of the

14:01.060 --> 14:03.460
officers and the facilities of the Inspector General's report.

14:03.960 --> 14:07.360
They have anything to do with the day's personnel actions concerning correct.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.860
I could tell the discussion of following the three's on page 2250, Mr. Jenkins.

14:11.860 --> 14:15.260
I certainly don't know any of the reverse of the position I think Mr. Chairman.

14:15.860 --> 14:19.960
I think it is time I'm showing my objection and then I'll pay $2.565 to stay.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.960
And then the names as I understand it, the chairman who the division is.

14:24.560 --> 14:30.260
To this committee are me as is counseled privately and without a spoozing their name.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.560
At the top of page 2250, Chairman, months 30.

14:35.160 --> 14:40.360
The other names of the question, Mr. Corne should be submitted confidentially and account for our committee.

14:40.960 --> 14:45.160
Because we don't want to expand the circle of witnesses anymore than necessarily.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.560
There are five softwares, changes, the investigation of the Inspector General's office and the same

14:50.560 --> 14:52.060
investigating officer in the press.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.560
According me, I, according may I announce the missing of the attack on the low.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.060
Remain requested.

14:58.760 --> 15:02.260
I've been so as a personal and private communication and that's the feet names.

15:02.260 --> 15:06.260
The animal you in line with the quotation mentioned the most until here's Robert Stevens.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.060
Secretary of the Army.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.660
For sure should I let her, Mr. Chairman.

15:12.960 --> 15:19.260
Another envelope addressed to me as special jumpsuit for this committee and Mark Contevento was delivered.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.660
It is a soon-underlow.

15:22.460 --> 15:27.460
It has not been opened by me and I have not, of course, examined the contents of it.

15:28.260 --> 15:34.760
After doing that, it contains the information that's put in the Secretary's letter to me of May 13th.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.960
We have converted the records, the transcripts of the proceedings in the state.

15:40.660 --> 15:43.760
The quotation that's put there in our corrective support.

15:44.760 --> 15:49.760
For sure and for that, Mr. Chairman, I say nothing to be gained by me as counsel,

15:49.760 --> 15:55.260
choosing this confidential report and going into the information requested by Mr. Colne.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.760
Since it was to be delivered to me and to no one else.

15:58.560 --> 16:02.260
And I now ask the Chairman's permission to return it.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.260
The Council for the Army.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.760
They call it.

16:06.860 --> 16:10.760
It is given to me on condition that our mother of the elite's come name.

16:11.260 --> 16:15.260
No purpose could ever be by my retaining it in my position.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.260
I am not clear by confidential information.

16:19.760 --> 16:25.260
And I will say that Mr. Chairman greatly relieved that I am allowed to see unbuttoned,

16:25.760 --> 16:30.260
and I am not even covered by this highly confidential and secret information.

16:30.760 --> 16:39.260
Before the Chairman make any really a comment on the permanent subcommittee,

16:41.260 --> 16:44.260
which has been attempting to get this information for a month,

16:45.260 --> 16:49.760
not as Chairman of this committee.

16:50.260 --> 16:58.260
I will just say in order, Mr. Jenkins,

16:58.760 --> 17:02.760
not turned it over to us.

17:03.260 --> 17:08.260
I don't want you to argue about that now, but they not put that beyond our control.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.760
And I am saying it's not as harmful to Mr. Colne, Mr. Troyer,

17:12.260 --> 17:14.760
and this investigation of the day.

17:15.260 --> 17:20.760
I've been trying to get the names of those who promoted, who protected,

17:21.260 --> 17:23.760
and covered up the time of the major.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.760
I attempt to get that brought on with hearing.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.760
I tell you for a closure of time this now for a week.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.760
So the Chairman of the Cromon Committee,

17:36.760 --> 17:38.760
does not end up getting sent in this?

17:39.260 --> 17:40.260
I will now.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.260
Be sure that might be Colne, they subpoena.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.760
I'm not going to have to be turned over to us.

17:46.260 --> 17:49.760
If it's been given Mr. Jenkins an confidential nature,

17:50.260 --> 17:52.260
I will discuss that with him, discuss with the Chair,

17:52.760 --> 17:58.760
but I don't want to put the audience control regardless of what they tell us in this particular case.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.760
Period.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.760
The Chair recalls the Colne, which, uh,

18:03.760 --> 18:06.760
produced the envelope in question.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.760
It developed out of a series of interrogatories,

18:10.260 --> 18:14.760
emanating from the metripy Colne car end of the table,

18:15.760 --> 18:20.760
to the effect that these hearings perhaps were retarded the date when,

18:21.260 --> 18:22.760
if I could tell you, the Army,

18:23.260 --> 18:25.260
could make available to his committee,

18:25.760 --> 18:28.260
as contracted, contracted with this special committee,

18:28.760 --> 18:30.760
the information on the progress case.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.760
If you are of the introduction,

18:33.260 --> 18:36.260
in the testimony of the so-called memo of undefensed,

18:36.760 --> 18:39.760
in which the Secretary of the Army, Mr. Stevens, agreed,

18:40.260 --> 18:42.760
that after the Inspector General's report was made,

18:43.260 --> 18:47.760
he would provide the information very much to the regular investigating committee,

18:48.260 --> 18:50.260
again, as contested with this committee.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.260
Finally, to the end that we could get on with the hearings,

18:53.760 --> 18:55.260
and that we could demonstrate as possible,

18:55.760 --> 18:59.260
that it was not delaying that determination on the parts of Mr. Stevens.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.760
He was requested to provide any confidential matter,

19:04.260 --> 19:06.760
to our council, the information,

19:07.260 --> 19:13.760
so that Mr. McCarthy and his associates can be assured of the fact that that information had now been defined,

19:14.260 --> 19:14.760
and then isolated.

19:15.260 --> 19:18.760
It was available to them under the terms of the number of understanding,

19:19.260 --> 19:21.760
and inappropriate time, when he returned to the chairmanship of the committee.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.260
So I think it has fully accomplished purpose.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.260
I do not feel that we should continue to hold that,

19:27.260 --> 19:30.260
so that Mr. Jenkins responsible for the information,

19:30.760 --> 19:32.760
because he does not, as he said, have any right to open it?

19:33.260 --> 19:34.760
I do not feel that we should continue to be against it.

19:35.260 --> 19:37.260
My name is Thomas Chairman, I perform,

19:37.760 --> 19:38.760
and I make this very clear for the right.

19:39.260 --> 19:42.260
As the chair knows, it does not necessarily have to be this,

19:42.760 --> 19:45.760
so very written, so you know, one of what's written for that evidence.

19:46.260 --> 19:47.760
And all the ruling,

19:48.260 --> 19:50.760
if the written says not applied,

19:51.260 --> 19:54.760
the certain information that the Secretary has has made it by a committee,

19:54.760 --> 19:56.260
that is sufficient.

19:56.760 --> 20:01.260
So Mr. Jenkins will consider that the subpoena disc is taken as being served upon him.

20:01.760 --> 20:05.260
I'm not asking you to turn it over to us now, I'm asking you to stay there.

20:05.760 --> 20:09.260
Until it's up to him, he can advise that Chairman wants,

20:09.760 --> 20:12.260
but if they, if they, if they, if they, if they,

20:12.760 --> 20:14.260
if Council's friends are having an all holding response,

20:14.760 --> 20:16.260
so I don't want it to go beyond that result.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.260
The answer for our is that the chair is concerned,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.260
and he thinks it believes that the communication has turned its purpose,

20:22.260 --> 20:25.760
he's furtherly worrying the discussion with the colleagues and executive sessions sometimes,

20:26.260 --> 20:30.760
any motion that might indicate what this position Council should make a written suggest

20:31.260 --> 20:32.260
for the time being,

20:32.760 --> 20:35.260
it continues to keep it in his position, and in a confidential statement.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.760
We will next time.

20:37.260 --> 20:37.760
All right, gentlemen.

20:38.260 --> 20:39.760
All right, questions.

20:40.260 --> 20:41.760
Those officers admitted

20:42.260 --> 20:45.260
far with purposes that this committee,

20:45.760 --> 20:46.760
or all of them, now they're saying,

20:46.760 --> 20:52.260
or what conditions your thoughts of the committee are suggested in connection with the requirements

20:52.760 --> 20:55.760
that Council has read from the excerpts of the testimony.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.760
It was submitted to the government states so that we would all know that the

21:00.260 --> 21:01.760
ascertainment had been made.

21:02.260 --> 21:06.260
That's a department of the Army now knows who was responsible for the sort of situation

21:06.760 --> 21:09.260
and is demonstrating of that, that demonstration of that fact.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.260
I submitted that information to all Council and conformity with the call I think

21:13.260 --> 21:16.760
which said it should be submitted on a confidential basis enough to publicize.

21:17.260 --> 21:17.760
Mr. Chairman.

21:18.260 --> 21:20.760
All right, I'd like to invite you to fire further.

21:21.260 --> 21:23.260
Before I am personally concerned,

21:23.760 --> 21:24.760
and I have a member of the committee,

21:25.260 --> 21:31.260
and this is the path to the announcement of the committee.

21:32.260 --> 21:34.760
All the powers are under way, so now there's no reason

21:35.260 --> 21:36.760
or the committee should know of the information.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.760
All right, I'll have to say, in line, submit it in the description,

21:39.760 --> 21:43.260
and if we don't need it, will that no response be delivered before?

21:43.760 --> 21:47.260
Or it's not the part of it in the issues in this case.

21:47.760 --> 21:51.260
I'm trying to determine whether it's submitted though,

21:51.760 --> 21:54.760
whether you're understanding that it is not to be reviewed

21:55.260 --> 21:57.760
through the regular short committee when it is approved.

21:58.260 --> 22:00.760
If so, we should determine about that.

22:01.260 --> 22:03.760
I think firstly the committee has entitled to it.

22:04.260 --> 22:05.260
Whether they consider not,

22:05.260 --> 22:08.760
Chairman, but I don't want us to take a position here

22:09.260 --> 22:12.760
that by the way is a condition of which the testimony is open,

22:13.260 --> 22:14.760
which the documents are submitted,

22:15.260 --> 22:20.260
until we know that it is either being made available

22:20.760 --> 22:22.760
or that we issue the subpoena to the public source.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.260
Because they have the same information and the subpoena to be issued

22:26.760 --> 22:27.760
to the army for delivery.

22:28.260 --> 22:30.260
And he's found that there is a position like the committee.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.760
May the chair say he's in complete agreement?

22:33.260 --> 22:35.760
With the position of the Sunday for Mark and Sarah,

22:36.260 --> 22:39.760
certainly the interest in the Peresse case is nationwide.

22:40.260 --> 22:41.260
It's public business.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.260
The answer should be made public.

22:43.760 --> 22:49.260
But if Alvin is making the information public probably is more appropriately,

22:49.760 --> 22:54.260
the subcommittee when chaired by Senator McCarthy and its ordinary status

22:54.760 --> 22:55.260
rather than this.

22:55.760 --> 22:59.260
He will ask the council to examine carefully the background

22:59.260 --> 23:00.760
by which we got this information.

23:01.260 --> 23:05.760
And if the senator from Arkansas is just to inquire of the secretary of the army,

23:06.260 --> 23:09.760
whether he will send it out to make it a part of this particular matter.

23:10.260 --> 23:10.760
May I have a follow-up?

23:11.260 --> 23:11.760
Yes, sir.

23:12.260 --> 23:12.760
There's one more.

23:13.260 --> 23:13.760
I have a follow-up.

23:14.260 --> 23:19.760
As of now, so far as I know, I think this information should be required

23:20.260 --> 23:22.760
by the regular subcommittee, not the pending army.

23:23.260 --> 23:24.760
But I don't want to get something to the back door.

23:25.260 --> 23:28.760
I want to go right by the rectification of the army and get it and bring it up here.

23:29.260 --> 23:29.760
That's my...

23:30.260 --> 23:31.760
Mr. Chairman, I have a yield for a minute.

23:32.260 --> 23:33.760
I'll get to you next time.

23:34.260 --> 23:35.760
I'd like to ask some of my phone yield for a minute.

23:36.260 --> 23:40.760
I have a few minutes to say that as ranking members of the member

23:41.260 --> 23:43.760
that side of the committee looks good.

23:44.260 --> 23:50.260
That's why I have asked that the committee will be held in federal school

23:51.260 --> 23:54.260
before I would order this news.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.260
Or I can't overlooking it.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.760
I'm not sure if the committee will be taken up with my authority.

23:59.260 --> 24:03.760
As soon as this investigation is over, no use of that in the mandate.

24:04.260 --> 24:07.760
I will not have to be turned over to me until the other six senators

24:08.260 --> 24:11.760
on the regular investigate committee make their decision on them.

24:12.260 --> 24:14.760
I've said the same, I see the object in the hold of it.

24:15.260 --> 24:16.260
But I like to do it direct.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.760
I like the subcommittee army.

24:18.260 --> 24:18.760
They haven't bring it up yet.

24:19.260 --> 24:20.260
Whether it is the committee...

24:20.760 --> 24:24.760
I just don't want to put beyond our control in case we decide

24:24.760 --> 24:26.260
that we're in federal school.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.260
Mr. Chairman, I have a sentence.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.260
A parliamentary inquiry.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.260
What can we say?

24:31.760 --> 24:34.260
A reference was made to a memorandum of understanding.

24:34.760 --> 24:37.760
Yes, I'm sure that you're not as innocent about the contents of that.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.260
It's your face by indicates.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.760
Well, I'm understanding in which you participate.

24:43.260 --> 24:44.760
I'm a resident of that colleague.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.260
Can I consolidate the public in lunch?

24:47.760 --> 24:49.760
Which we held with the Secretary of State.

24:50.260 --> 24:52.260
Well, the only point. I'm not bringing any party to the chamber.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.260
I didn't bring him a memorandum on the Senate, but I just wanted to make sure that...

24:55.760 --> 25:01.260
I know no memorandum of understanding by which I'm bombed or my colleagues on this cyber bomb.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.260
Directly memorandum understanding by.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.760
I don't know the reason for the army to make it that kind.

25:06.260 --> 25:07.760
Well, I don't think it ought to be in these procedures.

25:08.260 --> 25:08.760
That's all.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.760
Mr. Chairman, I got hold of it.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.760
So, this time, what was the memorandum of the Green?

25:15.260 --> 25:17.760
I'm sure I can put it for base.

25:18.260 --> 25:19.260
But I'm one of it.

25:19.260 --> 25:25.760
But the reason was that the Inspector General was going to go into the arrest matter.

25:26.260 --> 25:29.260
Well, there's an avar committee to continue to explore.

25:29.760 --> 25:34.760
And when the Inspector General had made his report, the information would be made available to our committee.

25:35.260 --> 25:35.760
Yes.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.760
That's not a memorandum of interpretation.

25:38.260 --> 25:41.760
And I would quote him like the court room, because I don't take it on short-term.

25:42.260 --> 25:44.760
Now, you may proceed with the decision.

25:45.260 --> 25:45.760
There.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.260
Mr. George, apparently, has one water.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.260
Now, the point of order, Mr. Love?

25:52.760 --> 25:53.260
I have two.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.760
The four steps of telephone.

25:55.260 --> 25:55.260


25:55.760 --> 25:56.260
Nothing.

25:56.760 --> 25:57.260
Nothing.

25:57.760 --> 25:58.260
I'm at the nation.

25:58.760 --> 26:01.260
No question about that, I'm sure, and I'll place you on the table.

26:01.760 --> 26:07.260
Mr. Chairman, I think that I have an announcement that will be received very happily.

26:07.760 --> 26:15.260
So, please, making that announcement, I should like to make inquiry of Mr. Welch with respect to one or two matters.

26:16.760 --> 26:24.260
Mr. Welch has counseled for this subcommittee I have invented to the best of my ability to develop the Army's proof.

26:24.760 --> 26:31.260
As far as I know, I have put on the witness stand, each and every witness who had asked me to put on.

26:31.760 --> 26:37.260
There were some two or three additional witnesses here today, and he expected the use of the Army.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.260
You might support their testimony together.

26:40.760 --> 26:44.260
And decided that it was either a community lady,

26:44.260 --> 26:47.760
or that it was not the peculiar material of this time.

26:48.260 --> 26:58.760
Are you now set as fragments to us for us to cause the Army's case with the understanding that you're not particularly from putting on any material rebuttal proof?

26:59.260 --> 27:01.760
Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

27:02.260 --> 27:08.760
You do now have what you might call a permissation to an English for the Army.

27:09.260 --> 27:09.760
Please, please.

27:10.760 --> 27:18.760
There are at least two other witnesses that I understand will be called as committee witnesses.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.260
If not otherwise, call.

27:20.760 --> 27:25.260
One is five of G David Shines, and the other is Mr. Frank Taw.

27:25.760 --> 27:31.260
I do not worry anything I say now, wish to indicate that I have no interest in those two witnesses.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.260
I do.

27:33.260 --> 27:38.760
But I must say I am afraid you case that so the original witnesses would I wish to have called.

27:39.260 --> 27:42.760
You have treated me Mr. Jenkins with the utmost consideration.

27:43.260 --> 27:54.260
You have been prepared to put on at least two witnesses that were accumulating that for the Fourth Monmouth incident when Mr. Colm was excluded from the laboratories who were accumulating.

27:54.760 --> 28:01.260
They were excused in fact because of the Senator saying yesterday that he was conceived of Mr. Colm as a least angry on that occasion.

28:01.260 --> 28:06.760
So I have been able to contract the Army's permissification to that extent and subject only to what I say here.

28:07.260 --> 28:10.260
Then you have called the witnesses I have asked to call.

28:10.760 --> 28:14.260
Mr. Welch, thank you very kindly for what you have said.

28:14.760 --> 28:21.760
But I am about to close the Army's case unless there is a specific objection on your part.

28:22.260 --> 28:25.260
When will we act in honor of your due absurd?

28:25.760 --> 28:38.260
Is to have your unconditional consent so to do and expect to call upon Senator McKipley to make the same public announcement when I shall have finished the presentation of his case.

28:38.760 --> 28:49.260
There is this difference Mr. Jenkins between this and an ordinary law, but this as they hear it, in which it is as I can see but the urgency Mr. Jenkins to call for all the facts.

28:49.760 --> 28:59.260
No, as I have constantly said to the newspaper men when they would say to me who is the Army's next witness I have said Mr. Jenkins called the witnesses and you certainly do.

28:59.760 --> 29:04.760
You have now called all the witnesses that I have asked to call to make the final face your case as I have indicated.

29:05.260 --> 29:07.260
I have wanted however to make it very careful.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.260
Carefully a matter of records that I do not wish to exclude from this.

29:11.760 --> 29:17.760
The fact that I consider it quite a good duty to call the two men that I have mentioned if they are not otherwise called, meaning shine and car.

29:17.760 --> 29:24.260
And failing that if they wish you fail to call them in the last hour to decide which to insist on my own part that they be called.

29:24.760 --> 29:37.760
At any time during the preceding meetings as counsel for the Army, Senator McCartney and Mr. Cohn are invited to criticize any daily stimulus maybe on my part.

29:38.260 --> 29:43.260
And to request me publicly to put on any witness that I haven't put on, I welcome that.

29:43.260 --> 29:44.260
Thank you.

29:44.260 --> 29:49.760
And now the gentleman and members of the Committee are very heavily announced that we have concluded with their own case.

29:50.260 --> 29:54.760
And I am now the guy to call as the first witness for the Senator McCartney.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.260
Sir Mr. William Cohn.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.260
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman.

29:59.760 --> 30:04.760
While I'm going to go to the witness stand, let's return to our studios across the country to permit our stations to identify themselves.

30:05.260 --> 30:05.760
I'm evolving.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
I'm evolving.

30:11.760 --> 30:16.760
Tomorrow night, Kraft television theater brings you one of the truly great dramatic hours on television.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.760
A fine play with a fine cast.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.760
Watch for the different temperament on your screen.

30:20.760 --> 30:26.260
When you see him, you know you can tell him on an hour of enjoyment with your favorite players and the featured roles.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.260
Watch Kraft television theater tomorrow night.

30:30.260 --> 30:35.260
All the way to the hotel, Kraft, lose those poems, get in step with Louis Shannon, sugarcane jelly.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.260
Grape, strawberry, black raspberry, orange, Montenegro.

30:39.260 --> 30:41.260
Waterment is calories for a teaspoon bowl.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.760
You read it mostly by Mr. Cohn.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.260
I've worked on it for a second and my sentence is written with Mr. Cohn.

30:47.260 --> 30:48.260
I'm the president.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.260
That's Alan.

30:50.260 --> 30:53.260
I trust this one of those will make his motion satisfactory.

30:53.260 --> 30:54.260
All right.

30:55.260 --> 31:04.260
The first motion to dismiss these charges against Mr. Hinsley is manifestly impaired as those who made the charges.

31:05.260 --> 31:10.260
They have not had an opportunity to testify against Mr. Hinsley.

31:11.260 --> 31:15.260
Whether they walk or withdraw the charges, I do not know.

31:15.260 --> 31:21.260
But the charges against Mr. Hinsley were made by Senator McCartney, Mr. Cohn.

31:22.260 --> 31:24.260
And that's the car possible.

31:24.260 --> 31:27.260
And they have not had a chance to prove their case against them.

31:27.260 --> 31:31.260
We've been wearing charges made by the Army against the other side.

31:32.260 --> 31:34.260
I insist that that motion is premature.

31:35.260 --> 31:39.260
That is the manifestly impaired as Senator McCartney has to made the charges.

31:40.260 --> 31:42.260
And I respectfully urge the Senator to withdraw.

31:43.260 --> 31:44.260
Mr. Cohn, how is the other case?

31:45.260 --> 31:50.260
Many add to that by saying that the charges with reference to Mr. Hinsley.

31:51.260 --> 31:53.260
I have a question for Mr. Cohn.

31:53.260 --> 31:57.260
I'm certainly not a part of the Army's case under the documents before us.

31:57.260 --> 32:00.260
I would not be able to wonder whether I'm a serious one.
