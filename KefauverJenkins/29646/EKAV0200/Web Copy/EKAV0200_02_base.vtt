WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Getting as Judge and jury, even as there is

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Bonnany Court where litigation takes place,

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
that insiphas possible the convenience

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
of the litigation's revispective,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
but wherever they are immobile and lies,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
that inconvenience be terminated as quickly as possible.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
That is any participant feels that he's in jeopardy in any way

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
that that jeopardy be resolved as quickly as possible.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
And so here is elsewhere, I think this motion is not only an audit,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
but I think it is a duty in responsibility,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
this committee is to be in judgment, to take common control,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
and to relieve any participate.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
On left there has been testimony and proved somewhere along the line

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
that were the indicate out of office.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Now thus far Mr. Channam, where has been no proof,

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
just sustained the charge against Mr. Hinton,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
and I think this committee is almost in duty by,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
under the circumstances, and in the interest of expeditions

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
to support this motion to start.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
And with respect to Mr. Channam, his name has been used very freely

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
all through these hearings about the only thing

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
in derogation of Mr. Channam that I gleam from the long testimony

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
by Mr. Adams becomes more to the Army well,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
that by his silence he may have given consent.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
That's entirely on the negative side, Mr. Channam,

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
and not on the affirmative side.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
And in the circumstances, I do not believe it's fair

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
that we have overrides Mr. Channam any longer,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
and keep him from his regular duties if he wants to repair to them.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
And on the basis of the record thus far,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
and it's a pretty long record, there has been no proof

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
to sustain the charges, and I think the motion to strike

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
is imminently in order, and that it ought to be sustained.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And that in fairness to these participants,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
we now say instead of waiting for the long interim period

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
when a report will be filed, that insofar as these two participants

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
are concerned that their identity

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
would be proceeding be concluded for it with,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I think the motion should be sustained.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
All of them are in for a set of action.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
May I inquire on the chair?

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
To who have had the response of the case

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
has been presented from the time they're hearing

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
started up until now?

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
Until now, we have been presenting the file of the case

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
represented by the charges made by Secretary of the Army Stevens

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
and by Mr. Adams.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
And the case has been organized and presented to us

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
under the direction of Mr. Welch and Mr. St. Pratt.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
A further parliamentary inquiry.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Did the Army, as there's a record show based on the complaint file

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
here in the pleadings, so to speak, if we may use that term?

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Is there anything in the pleadings which indicate that the Army

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
got charges against Mr. Hempel,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
parliamentary inquiry?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Not to the best recollection of the check.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Mr. Chairman, I ask for the parliamentary inquiry on what theory,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
not a legal theory, but on a theory of common sense.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
What a motion lie to dismiss charges against someone who has

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
not been called upon to offer proof.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
The chair is persuaded by the arguments presented by

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Senator Dvoysach and Mr. Dirkson in connection with the general

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
overall picture which we now confront.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
To which, on two different occasions,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
motions were made which, as part of their context,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
would have stripping from the record the charges

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
made against Mr. Hempel.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
At that time, the chair was around the triangle to determine

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
whether in the opinion of either Mr. Hempel and his council,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
or Senator McCarthy's associates and himself.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
There was anything unreasonable or unfair or unjust

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
about that portion of the context of the proposal.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
At that time, on three different occasions, both of those parties

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
said that it would be agreeable with them.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
The chair did not vote for those proposals, however,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
because when he got around to the third part of the triangle

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
and asked the same kind of questions of Mr. Stevens and his council,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
they said that as far as their position was concerned,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
and as far as the Stevens Adams portion of the case was concerned,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
they felt it was not proper and not fair and not just.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Consequently, the chair voted against the motion,

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
not because it included Mr. Hempel, but or Mr. Carr,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
but because it included Mr. Adams and Mr. Stevens,

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
and because they felt that it was not a proper procedure.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
However, there was a different situation which now confronts us

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
because Mr. Adams and Mr. Stevens have had a complete

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
opportunity to present their case.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
The chair feels that Mr. Chairman,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
if I may just be monitoring to your particular point,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
if you'll be patient.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'd like to...

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
The chair feels that, as far as Mr. Carr is concerned,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
all of the evidence that they have to present has been presented

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
because their witnesses have all been arraigned before this commission.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
And the chair...

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
And Mr. Hempel is concerned.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
What was the interruptions?

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Mr. Chairman, I just really made the point that I did not direct my parliamentary inquiry to the minister.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I understand.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I understand.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Mr. Hempel, the motion has too much.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And the chair feels as far as Mr. Hempel is concerned

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
that the situation which confronted us at the time the original charges were made

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
has been altered substantially by the course of the testimony,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
by the evidence which has been introduced up to this time,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
by the fact that on two previous occasions, both Mr. Hempel's counsel

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
and the McCarthy side of the position have agreed,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
disdiking that part from the case,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
and furthermore, and perhaps most importantly,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
by the issuance of the executive order,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
which is going to make much more difficult, certainly,

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
finding out those pertinent questions about the testimony of Mr. Hempel,

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
then would have otherwise had done the case.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
So the chair would say, as far as his own particular goal is concerned,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
that if Mr. Hempel and his counsel and Mr. McHathie and his associate

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
are of the same opinion now that they were on the two previous occasions,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
he would, of course, both distract them from the record,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
something which neither side cared to project into it,

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
and consequently delay the conduct of these hearings enormously and unmetheaterally.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Well, Mr. Chairman, I just want to conclude by saying that I know

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
of nothing in the executive order that prevents the offering of proof

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
based on the charges filed against Mr. Hempel.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
What part of the executive order would present that?

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
I refer to the part which concludes any possibility of discussing any of the transactions

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
occurring at the meeting on January 21.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Well, what the committee has previously decided unanimously

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
that the only portion of the Hempel charge which we could appropriate

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
is to consider it as a portion dealing with mortgages.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
And the mortgages phase has been obscured by the fact that there are other meetings,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
other discussions dealing with mortgages,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
in which we are not permitted by the executive order to inquire.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
Well, Mr. Hempel has sent the file that the meeting in January 21st had nothing to do with it.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm at a total loss on all the time, and Mr. Hempel is at that meeting.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
Well, nobody, he has testified as to who brought the initiated the charges.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
And I must compare that if this theory has followed through its logical conclusion,

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
and it does come in sense, then logically the charges that Mr. Cohn,

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
Senator McCarthy, have made against the other parties' motion to dismiss those charges

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
would lie because no proof is been offered up to this point.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
Mr. Chairman, am I interrupting the discussions with the learned senators?

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
If I am, I do have a thought that everything that you are will be happy to have you interrupt.

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
So, right here, Senator Jackson has raised a question about what basis there is

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
for dismissal of the charges at this time against Mr. Hempel.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
As a matter of fact, the motion that was made by Senator DeVoljert,

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
in my judgment, is entirely proper, and to me and to my client,

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
if it were passed at this time and properly passed at this time,

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
would constitute a wholly justified vindication of my client in these proceedings.

09:05.000 --> 09:13.000
Mr. Hempel, now the fact is that in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding of this case,

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
as the proof develops, if the proof as it develops,

09:20.000 --> 09:31.000
shows that any given set of charges against a topic were unbound and without basis,

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
then it becomes the duty of anybody to issue or quasi-judicial at that point

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
in the proceedings to dismiss those charges.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
That point in my judgment has now plainly been reached.

09:46.000 --> 09:57.000
I will not review the testimony in detail except inside that witness after witness on this stand has made it perfectly plain,

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
that the two charges which were in any way lower to these proceedings,

10:03.000 --> 10:14.000
namely, that Mr. Hempel for some motive, tried to stop the proceedings of this subcommittee

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
have been affirmatively disproven right now, and since those charges have been affirmatively disproven,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
it seems to me that in all justice and balance,

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
neither Mr. Hempel nor his counsel should be kept sitting around in these proceedings,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
as they talk with this sort of threat hanging over their heads.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I may say in addition to that, Mr. Johnson.

10:38.000 --> 10:46.000
In addition to that, I distinguish between a judicial and a quasi-judicial proceeding such as this,

10:46.000 --> 10:56.000
in a proceeding of this character, where you have not the normal protections afforded by a court of law,

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
it is even more important to a citizen and a party and a distinguished public official,

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
that the charges against him be disclosed of as rapidly as possibly can be,

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
and that if his vindication comes, it comes fairly in sweat before the American public.

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
That point, as I say, has been reached not alone by failure proof,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
and we know there is no proof in support of these charges,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
but also by a firmety proof to the contract,

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
and that's why I would urge you to form this committee and upon its learning channel,

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
that this motion ought to be granted in all justice and fairness to Mr. Hempel right now and for his vindication.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Now may I say one other thing?

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
Senator Goyce's motion was coupled with a statement that Mr. Hempel will be excused as he wishes.

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
What or not, that's the grant, in whole or in part by this subcommittee at this time.

11:55.000 --> 12:06.000
I want to say, and Mr. Hempel's behalf, that he is always ready and willing to appear at the behest of this subcommittee at any time

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
to give it any information which will throw any light that might be thrown upon the controversy presently before.

12:13.000 --> 12:22.000
He sees no need to appear as a witness to dispose of unproven charges or charges that were proven to be unproven,

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
but he is still available as a witness to this committee and will be at any time and let there be no doubt of that.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
I may say one final thing with regard to my client, and after all, Mr. Chairman,

12:33.000 --> 12:41.000
I have remained silent as you will confess for a very long time here and may be have just a little opportunity to speak.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
Mr. Hempel was given by this nation the second highest decorations in its power to give.

12:50.000 --> 12:59.000
The distinguished service model. He was given that medal for a very highly maristory service to his country,

12:59.000 --> 13:07.000
during the Second World War as a system secretary of the Navy and in other high capacities in that department.

13:08.000 --> 13:21.000
He has come down to this capital of the nation again to serve his country as great personal sacrifice and his presence in days in matters of the highest importance to the nation.

13:21.000 --> 13:32.000
Now if public affairs against home charges are loving or not vindicated when they can be vindicated at the earliest opportunity,

13:32.000 --> 13:40.000
my mind is a deterrent to men of ability and character who desire to serve their country.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
I call upon this committee and ask this committee to grant this motion right here and now.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Anybody else ready to be heard?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yes, sir.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Uh, Benjamin Conn.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
I have witnessed some peculiar proceedings in my lifetime.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
One never before I have I witnessed charges gone.

14:00.000 --> 14:12.000
And then somebody moved to a business of the poor, the men of the person who made the charges was given an opportunity to testify.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
This would be one of the grossest reflections upon those who made the charges.

14:20.000 --> 14:28.000
For this committee at this stage of the proceedings, in this list of charges they call it a beat.

14:28.000 --> 14:36.000
Can't amount the saying to Senator McCarthy and Mr. Cohn that your charges were baseless.

14:36.000 --> 14:45.000
That they were an imposition of the this committee and upon the country and that they are a responsible.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
If you want to place that stigma on the Senator McCarthy and upon the Mr. Cohn you may do so.

14:50.000 --> 15:00.000
But so far as I have concerned we're going to get the food or the charges be withdrawn by those who made them and I shall pull against the motion.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And, gentlemen, I'm getting the directions.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
It occurs to me that we have ventilated this matter long enough.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.000
First of all, it should be said that it has been brewed about and discussed in some of the executive sessions that we had.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
And I think Mr. Bryan will bear that out.

15:18.000 --> 15:26.000
I think the testimony discloses that Mr. Hensel had only an incidental relationship to the proceedings as far.

15:26.000 --> 15:38.000
And insofar as that portion of the charges concerned that goes back to 1944, I am frank to say that I have conferred with counsel and counsel what field is posed to object.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
If anything relating to those charges that goes back ten years might be introduced in evidence.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
Under the circumstances there is nothing unusual or extraordinary about this proceeding.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
This is regular in evidence back.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
And I think it does justice to two principles in the case Mr. Carl and Mr. Hensel.

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
And I suggest now Mr. Chavez that we vote on the matter because it's a responsibility individually for every member of this committee.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Mr. Hammond?

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I give you a top senator's time and you haven't spoken.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Have you addressed the chair?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I've heard you've been a Jackson but I'm taking him to the office.

16:14.000 --> 16:29.000
First I would like to ask the counsel for Mr. Hensel or Senator McCartney have the charges against Mr. Hensel been withdrawn.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Are you asking out of me?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Senator?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
I would ask that either of you or Senator McCartney.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Or for for all.

16:39.000 --> 16:51.000
As far as I know, Mr. Chavez, my arguments have been directed to a motion pending before this committee.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
My question is a very simple question Mr. Bryan.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I think you're perhaps on the answer from me.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I would like to have it from somebody.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
I think perhaps the most nice answer that.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I may not say that nothing has been withdrawn.

17:03.000 --> 17:15.000
However, I have taken the position of since the presidential directive ordering certain people who perhaps they meetings which the machinery of a certain motion for these mere charges.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
Which resulted in this show since the president decided that they couldn't talk.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
I just feel we never will get the facts in the matter.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
It never can get the truth of Mr. Hensel will be forbidden to testify in that directive.

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
And anything the committee can do to cut down the links of this so we can get back to our work.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
And they want to do to eliminate two witnesses.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
The eliminate days of testimony will not be affected to by me.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I've got one objective now.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
Now that we know we can never get all the facts in order to get the show off the road.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
As soon as we can get back to our work and exposing the joint.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
How many of us were in this moment in dangerous positions?

18:00.000 --> 18:09.000
Now that the chairman I would like to make this observation about the question of Mr. Hensel.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
I have known him a long time.

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
He is in a position of great authority in the Department of Defense of the United States.

18:19.000 --> 18:27.000
As I understand what Madam Maclady has said, these great charges are not being withdrawn.

18:27.000 --> 18:37.000
Except for the fact that the president of the United States has issued an directive which makes it impossible to get the truth.

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't see how that could be known until and unless Mr. Hensel defended these charges.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
In his position, he probably has as much more to say in the Department of Defense.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
Which incidentally is not the Department of the Army.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
For respect to the spending of billions and billions of dollars.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
And it's been said and I believe with complete justification that a public office

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
is a public trust.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
He was appointed by the President of the United States to this high office.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
I have no reason to think that he is guilty in any way of the charges that have been made against him.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
But I joined with my colleagues.

19:22.000 --> 19:32.000
That's a dismissive charges at this time and leave this man in as the number one legal man in the defense department of the United States.

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
Where everybody is looking for corruption and problems and lead hanging over him these charges.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
To me is just unbelievable.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
And I regret that apparently it is going to be decided on a straight four to three vote.

19:49.000 --> 20:01.000
I would hope that the members of the majority party of this committee consider the position

20:01.000 --> 20:07.000
in which they are leaving Santa McCarthy because he made the charges and once the truth.

20:07.000 --> 20:19.000
And Mr. Hensel, because from this day on he will operate on the basis of the charges that were made and were dismissed before he was even given the opportunity to answer them.

20:19.000 --> 20:30.000
Mr. President, Mr. Brown, the learning senator from Missouri has just advanced what to me is one of the most extraordinary theories

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
that I have ever heard advanced in an American public hearing.

20:35.000 --> 20:46.000
That theory is apparent that when charges are made against someone and those charges are unsubstantiated,

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
he has the purpose of proving himself innocent.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
That's the new one to me.

20:53.000 --> 21:07.000
For over a thousand years of Anglo-Saxle war, we have proceeded on the theory that a man was innocent until proof was brought forward that he was guilty.

21:07.000 --> 21:16.000
I cannot believe the decision from Missouri really meant to invent any such theory before the American people.

21:17.000 --> 21:33.000
The whole point of this motion is that affirmative proof has been brought forward that Mr. Hensel had nothing to do with this situation and should never have been brought in and second of all.

21:33.000 --> 21:51.000
But apparently there is going to be no full offer in substantiation of the charges and a keeper man in this situation in what might be called public jeopardy under such circumstance and to make statements which might affect his probality.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
I think he is unworth in such a form as this or before the American people.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
Mr. Brown, I would like to continue the comment we just to this extent.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
I deeply regret having shocked this eminent counsel and delightful gentleman from New York.

22:09.000 --> 22:22.000
I want to say that in turn he has deeply shocked me and I hope when I'm ever represented by a counsel in the minutes that the counsel agrees to give me a chance to prove my innocence before the people.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Mr. Chairman, I'll be very grateful.

22:25.000 --> 22:42.000
May I just say this to Mr. Brown that while I may not have the best knowledge of the law, I must say that I have never heard of a doctrine advanced in all the years that I've lived.

22:42.000 --> 22:50.000
That would prevent an individual who has a case to make to prevent that individual from being heard.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
I will not vote for a motion that will deny to any party.
