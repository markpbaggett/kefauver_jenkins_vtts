00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
That's not a big fire.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
When we were talking about the filing system.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Yes.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
You said the filing system was changed in 1953.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Would you explain where the filing system was changed?

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
I didn't mean to say so much, but the filing system was changed.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I think just about everything was changed.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
And no jamming came in and no go out.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
But I was just asking the boss of filing.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I don't know.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
I don't know.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
There was a election in 1952.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes, sir.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Not a public notice.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Thank you.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Well, I have no objection.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I managed to survive in 1952.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm not objecting to all of the elections in 1952.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
Mr. Colum, would you explain where the filing system was changed?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
No, sir, because I cannot.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Well, I understand that the filing system has been the same since 1947.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
But I believe the Republic in here.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Now, I'll post it anymore.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I looked at this cost document.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I just like that as an example.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
And you'd say that all these things are in the file.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
And we can find them.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
How could anyone...

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Either a minority can't do or a member of the Senate serves on this committee.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Find that document.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, I think the way there would be a member of the committee can't take it.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
Me and his work preliminary investigations we had, or specifically whether we had anything on communist infiltration in the Army.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I was telling about it.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
And if he said, let me see the file, I thought we'd bring up the files on it.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
And then, look, what else at this point has been made in the hearings too long?

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And all that a member of the committee has to do is to now look to the file.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
How would you find a cost document?

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
And where would you find it face-by-the presentation of that document in evidence?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Well, where would it be file on this?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
There's no marketing on it.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I would be under a shelter at communist infiltration in the Army.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
In fact, I think the document is in file.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I mean, it's infiltration in the American Armed Forces.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
If it isn't not true, then I'm under the filing system that's been in effect in 47,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
and all these documents are marked with reference and tab number two.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I don't police officer.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Well, isn't that the practice and the filing set up in the committee?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I said so, I'm not familiar with the filing set up.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
I know I've never had any trouble in getting any cases of documents I need in connection with my work.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I don't know about a test, and I don't know the one thing to it.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
I wouldn't have raised this question except that it was raised in the hearings,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
and all of us are supposed to know where all these things are.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
And I must say that I was very careful to look over that document

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
because I had understood from you and your system only earlier

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
that the cost document was one of those critical items

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
that set off the investigation of the Army.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
And it was for that reason I wanted to know about it,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
because it was the first I had heard of that cost document.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
At least it was never called as attention of any members of the subcommittee.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Now, do I understand that that document was filed at all times with the subcommittee

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
and the subcommittee officers and what was its file under?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm sure it was filed at all times, sir.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Except if it was filed under, I don't know.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I can find out for you with the under.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I can just guess it was the uniligical thing with the uniligent

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and the kind of infiltration of the armed forces

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
or under something along the road.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Would you find out what it was your under?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I think that is.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
And would you also supply for the committee the basis

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
from which documents are filed in me?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, I mean the statement.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I think this is very important, Mr. Cohn.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I mean, it's not.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
I never raised this question, but we've been told time and time again

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
that we should have known about all these things

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
because they're in file in the committee.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
I want to know for my own information just how we find things

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
because after all, when we're busy, we can't sit down and spend

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
and you agree there will take days to go through these files

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
unless we know the key to the filing system.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
So I don't think any senders ever expected to go down

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
and go through the filing like that.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I was told that he was contact with the staff members.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
And well, it's an indicated here that we should have known

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
about these things we could have found out if they had no senator should,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
and I'm just facing this on the testimony

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
and statements made in the hearing that we should know about these things.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I don't think anyone expects a senator to go down

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
and start going through all the files to know every letter

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
and documents and members and in there.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I think so that the way it would usually be done is

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
if the senator wanted to know about something he would communicate

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
with the staff members and the staff members will see him what he wanted.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And I think that the senator, if the professor meant that

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I know that the senator once said since when he had not

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
said that he would hear him during the recess and something

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
like that requires us to send to him a long summary of what happened

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
at each session.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
And I know that we are very careful to see that that is sent to him.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I know that the senator there can send an appartor

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
half representative, correct?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Usually when they, hopefully, cannot be present at hearing

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
and the post-representative, keep him abreast of what's going on

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
and deal with the staff and keep the senator alive.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
And I suppose each one has a different way of keeping up

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
with the committee's work.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Well, I know that when matters come up, obviously,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
unless the senators are informed that we can't be down

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
on a fishing expedition going through the file.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
So that it would be pretty difficult to just make a run down

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
through the file every month or so to find out what's in the file

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
and should you agree with me or not as a practical matter.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
It would be impossible if not.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Well, I would say it would be difficult to say.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Now, the reason I'm pursuing this line of question,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm sure, you're fully aware of Mr. Cohn,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
is that as I understand the testimony,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
the Army investigation was started in February or March.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
And to my knowledge, at least I did not receive any information.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
That question investigation was underway north.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Did I have any information of the seriousness of these charges?

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
And I think that it's very important in connection

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
with the charges and counter charges made in connection

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
with this hearing.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Now, can you tell us what document

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
started the Army in March?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
No.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
You don't say no.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
There was no one document decided that or any other increases.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
As far as I know.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
There was no particular thing that set it off

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
but it did start in February.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yes sir.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
But what in February started it?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, I can't tell you what started it.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
If there happens to this way,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
we will get information from various sources about a situation.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We will get documents frequently.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And when there's enough there,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
we will start a preliminary investigation,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
which I believe is under the direction of the chamber.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Other numbers are going at all times.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I can tell you some of the incidents

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
relating to the beginning of this preliminary investigation.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
I know that's what started it in February.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, one of the first things I remember, sir,

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
is we were contacted by an officer in the Army

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
who an officer in the Army

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
who told us about certain situations

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
existing with regard to the use of co-communist literature

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
and the presence of subversives in the military established.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
That was an officer in the former.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yes sir.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
You've been an officer in the community with the committee.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Yes sir.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Yes sir.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
He communicated with the outside,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I don't know what the preliminary steps were.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
But I know that at this time of time,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I believe it was late in February

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
when some of the staff members had an extended interview with the staff.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
So, but he, that he's supplying the documents or materials.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I don't recall what he did or not.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
When did, I know he talked about my right-wing recollection.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I wonder if he'd yield for just a minute long.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It's not out of my time.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
I wonder if he'd yield for just a minute.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I would like to have the record very clear

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
of that all preliminary investigations by Stratford's

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
by the chairman of the committee.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Last year we had 450 some of our investigations,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
more hearings like that,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
until the time comes, I think,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
a matter of the sufficient importance

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
to disturb the early sunkers with us and I call the meeting of the committee.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
And we decided to call the hearing on this primary investigation.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
We followed the usual procedures.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
In that case, after the investigation and proceeded for several months

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
we held a meeting with the committee.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
We decided to call the hearing method not done by the chair.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
The chair never takes it upon himself

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
to call any public hearings of the authority of the committee.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
But I do, Stratford,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
whenever I get a complaint from any senator,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
anyone else who seems to have any merit,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I ask the staff to run them down.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And I think the last year,

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
it was with some 450-odd preliminary investigations,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
which form there are a lot of the departments

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
that are in the opening to the committee.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I fully worry the rules of the unrighteous press,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
preliminary investigation,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
to understand, understandable,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
and connection with any investigation,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
but the seriousness of the situation here is obvious.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
The statement is made under all five leave,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
you testify to it that you received information in April

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
for the April from the young officer,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
that there was 35 submissions.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Absolute monmer.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
No, I mean, that's pretty rough.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
That's the important radar lab at the point of the company.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
That was in April.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
That's good.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And how long did this situation come?

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
No, I wasn't until September that hearing got underway.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
And I'm greatly concerned why the delay

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
from April until September.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
So I think that's the third book that I talked to some first.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
I just have the other day that an April or May

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
was there about, I guess, this summary

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
of the FBI report warning of the existence of the first

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
of the fourth month.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
What's that after that time we didn't have the,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I don't think we have these figures 35.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I don't think so, when it was showdown.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
But it doesn't say, it doesn't say month, month, month.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
From the time you first get a serious complaint,

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
until you arrive at a point where you can hold public hearing

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
after I get the complaint,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I must first have the staff run it down,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
I must first take a mission of the committee to hold a hearing.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I did that in this case.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
And the subject from Washington for reasons

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
for he considered good and bad was not on the committee

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
of that time.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
So I took the matter up with the force owners

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
who were on the committee at the time when I softly

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
were ready to hold a hearing,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
to give them a complete report on this now.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah, come on, let me, let me, let me, let me,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
let my recollection, let me get that to the moment.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
My recollection was that in the now famous two

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
and a quarter of page document,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
there were about 35 names listed.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And honestly, what was it?

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
I think all that's the Russian, Russian espionage.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Now, if this information was obtained in April or May,

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
wouldn't the alert thing to do was meet

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
to immediately advise the members of the committee.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
This is pretty serious.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
If we had anything to say to this so far,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I think we've got something much more serious right now.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
That's a lot.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Right, so I'm talking about...

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yes, sir. Yes.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
...the fire that they're here.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I mean, when we had to meet for a person with an eye,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I think we've got a much more serious situation now

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
and how much information the PIA has disturbed me,

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
the number.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
What we have, the members of the committee,

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
is not that far.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I do think so.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Yes, I do.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Have we had the names and the numbers of the people

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
that I discussed with my other words,

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
the numbers of the many else and the rest of the members of the committee,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
because the foundest information of atomic and hydrogen bomb fire,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I felt that was, I think, even more important

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
from this information of the...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
May I...

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
May I...

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
May I...

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
This is going to be finished in view at one point.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
One point.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
May I have from the files all of them,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
and meaning to minutes of reference to this matter,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
so that we on the committee can be fully informed.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Yes, sir. You certainly may.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Certainly may.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And this time, as it's by, maybe,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Mr. Chair, the matter of the...

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Mr. Chair, this is Mr. President.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
He didn't get around, Mr. Collins.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
He didn't get to go around, Mr. Coler.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Chair, I'd like to remind Mr. Collins that,

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
to the new hour, he is supposed to provide to Council Jenkins.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
So this is the pregnant call,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
which we desire to get information from Mr. Lucas,

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
so that we can then find out whether Mr. Brownow will okay them for a mission.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
We stand adjourned until two o'clock.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Up towards Chairman Montenau,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
so the next session of a hearing will be a 2 p.m. this afternoon.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Chair, I'd like to...

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Call the committee to order.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
And begin by welcoming our guests.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
We're prepared to be here at unusually large numbers this afternoon,

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
to tell you that we welcome you as committee guests at the hearing.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
And to call your attention to the standing committee rule,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
with which I'm sure many of you are familiar,

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
and those who are here for the first time may not know about it.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
We have a standing committee rule for fitting any manifestations of approval

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
or disapproval of an audible nature for many members of the audience at any time.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And the uniformed officers that you see before you,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
and the plain clothes people feed in the audience,

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
have instructions from the committee to remove from the committee room immediately,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
firmly but politely,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
without further instructions from the chair.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Any of our guests,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
should the reasons best known to them,

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
elect to violate the conditions under which you entered the room as our guest.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Our audience has been magnificent,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
and uniformed curious,

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
and we expect them to maintain that fine standards of decarct.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
As the meeting was recessed this morning,

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
we had concluded a ten-minute go-around as far as the chairman,

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
and Senator McClellan, and Senator Dixon, and Senator Jackson was concerned,

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
and Senator Potter is the next senator to recognize by the chair for a ten-minute request.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Senator Potter.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
Mr. Jackson was born in the U.S.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
He has the presence of a bloody enough with people on the committee who were not being paid.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
I can tell him now that the only person working on the committee was not on the committee payroll.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Well, Mr. Carney,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
the people who are on my personal payroll,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
working on the committee,

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
the reason for that is because the budget of the committee will not allow the additional individual

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
which ultimately was necessary as an enough chair.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
Well, my question from Senator is related to a rumor,

15:32.000 --> 15:42.000
or rather than call on my attention that there has been individuals who were not either on your office payroll,

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
or on the staff of the committee as who put them in the party.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
So, I wanted to get it clarified,

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
and do I now understand that the only ones working on investigations for the committee for the staff

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
are those who are regularly appointed as not a payroll plus this one individual from your staff.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Because that's good mainly.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
And I know what it is.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I mean, say some injections.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I think it's a perfect way for a three-in-year plan.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I don't think that's the best of the goal.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
The only individual working for all time on the committee

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
is Mr. Davidson's within my personal payroll.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
My office staff, obviously, of course, works well.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm not with the other any more time.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Nope, nope, nope, no part time people.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
But no, what's correct isn't right?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Well, as I know,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
if that policy has been concluded,

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
there's a Senate fellow sounding the alliance with the Rose House,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
a Senate meeting,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
and then we'll be back to the Senate.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
And then we'll be back to the Senate.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
And then we'll be back to the Senate.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And then we'll be back to the Senate.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
This is probably one of the shortest recesses

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
and one of the shortest sessions, rather, on record.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
The senators leave almost immediately the Senate caucus room here

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
for Senate and vote on the measure before they drop it here.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
The House, Eric Chairman, months,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
three recesses, the ABC Television Network

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
is bringing you the complete hearings

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
into the McCarthy Army controversy.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
There's an again wrapping the gable for attention.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And it seems that there is another role

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
called now on the floor of the Senate.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
There's another role called on the floor of the Senate.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
And again, the committee members leave as well.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
One of the Jackson's Mr. James Sinclair,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
and the other side of him, Mr. Mayor.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
The mayor was going to vote.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
Just that, he's being voted to roll the votes in the Senate.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
It appears you will have some time now at least for the committee sessions

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
before there is another vote.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
And we will start in this time again with Senator Potter,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
who will be the first man in line there

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
as well as the first minister of the Senate.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Senator Potter, the month is called, the session order.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
And now Senator Potter,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
please call the drab of the day.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
He didn't.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Mr. Cohn,

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
you worked in the executive branch of government

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
prior to coming with a committee,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
which is a part of Armaday,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
so you better say the branch of our government.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Yes sir.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
You are a wing with me that,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
the communist world,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
we have been called to,

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
we're involved with the windshield break,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
our government service.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I do so.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
You agree with me that either one communist or a subverted

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
in our government is one too many?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I do so.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
You also agree with me that there is no monopoly on hitting communism?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
I do so.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
And you agree with me that the president of the United States

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
is from the great developed service for a country?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm sure he has.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
I suppose there is a post to communism as the URI,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I'm sure.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And he,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
the governing powerful,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
the government service of the communist

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
that's to come to the executive in government service?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
And that,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
other members of the executive branch of government?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Mr. Boney,

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
the attorney general,

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
he has never been known as being the

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
county coward,

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
who that's right, I'm sure.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
You only got the secretary of law?

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
That's the state.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
Now, also has an inter-pol to communist government.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
I'm sure you're sure.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
The reason I'm asking is this question.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
What I've had to ask whom other members of the committee has

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
had many letters and inquiries from people

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
who believe that the government is funny called

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
the communist security rep?

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
Now, with your last experience both in the legislative branch of government

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
working in this field,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
and a chief counsel of this committee,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
I would like to have your comments as to me,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
extent of communism,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
when our government.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Yes sir, can only of course not be a comment because of course I don't know.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
I was in here, you're known.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You're very correctly stated.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
One of the principal objectives of the communist conspiracy in this country

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
and every country throughout the world is infiltration of government.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
The moment I said that,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
you were very correct before when you stated that one of the principal objectives

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
of the communist conspiracy in this country

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
as well as throughout the world is the infiltration of government,

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
of the free government of the world.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
They tried to bring about the downfall of those governments,

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
and they tried to get people in there to commit acts of espionage

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
and sabotage within and times of peace

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
and in times of war or revolution.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
They tried to use those people in government

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
to help bring about the downfall of the free government

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
and bring about a dictatorship of the proletariat

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
under the world communist conspiracy.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
Now sir, on the extent of this communist infiltration,

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
during the 1930s and 1940s,

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
the communist party of the United States

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
was, I will say, remarkably and unbelievably successful

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
in placing communists in a number of key spots in our government.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
I would say that probably,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
if you want to look at it from the standpoint of numbers,

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
the numbers might not be the staggering variety.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
But so you made another point, which is the key to this.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
You said one is too many.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
One is too many. I think the staggering

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
or the one in one of the top communists and fair institutions

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
want better take, something to be effective.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Take a thousand people to build a bridge.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
It takes one person to blow it up.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
And another person, what you're saying is that both branches

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
or the government should be ever big of a mess

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
on this question of communists.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
But they have to be sure because the communists will be ever vigilant

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
in trying to infiltrate. They will not give up.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And they will always keep working,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
because they have people into various government agencies and events.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
And I'll let me ask you this question.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Isn't it true, under a presence,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
it's likely to serve us back?

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
Well, there's no provision for dealing with communists

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
and the far as implementing the act is concerned.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
But it's not a means of attention because of a person's role

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
to have in the far as well.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
I would say, when there's an authority conviction under the Smith Act,

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
it's a problem under certain laws of the Army rather than for the selected service system.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.000
The human agree with my conviction that a man who advocates you will go

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
about government and by force and violence.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
But who refused is you, either by using the federal amendment

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
or by using the federal amendment or using the federal amendment.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
So it's easy to answer, but the tape is the time to be grasped.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
But that man is not fit to have the uniformer of the government.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Yes, sir, I do.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
All right, I'll continue.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I think at the bottom of the front, this is what I have to do.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I'll do the service of the policy.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
But if I can move forward to the front, this is talking.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
It's not fit to have uniform.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
It should be in the least of having separate classification.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
So that wherever he goes, when he asks his presenters,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
the credentials of the draft service.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
So that man will be known as a man who is not fit to wear uniform

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
because it's a law out of his country.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Now, I'll go for a quick.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I'll go for a quick.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I'll probably send you some.

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
Mr. Chairman, first, could I ask if the committee has yet got the shine memos?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Two of them are three.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
How many names are there, Mr. Chairman?

25:13.000 --> 25:20.000
Between the one job I met with the minority government, the Kennedy and Mr. Charles Maynard,

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
Mr. Jenkins, there, for which time I just went to the both of them,

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
they filed and memos and everything else.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
For some problems, the connection with them, I don't think there are too many.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
We thought of this suggestion maybe with my idea, and any of them, I'll make it my now, sir.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
From there could be Mr. Chairman, the order of Mr. Cohen, you know what I'm saying, my time.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Can he answer this?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Without being one, my time.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
And much of this is a committee matter.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Thank you.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
Or I can say this, I think we all thought of, I'll take probably responsibility for it.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
I think it's been a negative suggestion meeting of the committee of the regular subcommittee.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.000
We would bring in everything we have, and we could make a decision on what to become right then and there.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
I think that was settled with Bob.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Pretty quickly.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Mr. Chairman, might I inspire?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Didn't we have the file yesterday?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
I wonder what Bob did, we were all off on Fox here.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
I thought that we were supposed to have petarined by now that was supposed to be deleted.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
I mean, what is, I don't understand, so there are two or three problems, and one is not the same.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
I think he said everyone in the thousands earlier.

26:35.000 --> 26:41.000
I don't know how to do that, because they have a file here yesterday, and then the file was displayed again today.

26:41.000 --> 26:48.000
What is the problem with this, that, well, the progress and the checks and first of all,

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
is that we've had people going through the files and tabbing things done by Dave Shine,

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
and also trying to tab things which reveal the name of confidential information.

26:58.000 --> 27:06.000
Problems arise, to disaffect the first question is, how much of this material should be seen by Mr. Welch or Council

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
from Mr. Stevens and Mr. Raddick?

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
That's a question with that, by Mr. Kennedy.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
I think it's a good one.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I don't know the answer to it.

27:14.000 --> 27:20.000
Another question is, what do we do with the information that comes from confidential information?

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
So we put that in a special box or file or category or an inventory and how many pieces of paper there are.

27:27.000 --> 27:34.000
And it's not to become a part of the public record, or it will be available to inspection by members of the committee

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
with both Mr. Welch and we talked it over for a while.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
We had the files right there, and we looked at some of them.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
We all came to the conclusion of they could be an executive session of the committee and bring the material there.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
So we'd have before us just what we're talking about.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
It probably could be disclosed off of that waiting time in public session.

27:52.000 --> 28:01.000
Mr. Chairman, why does this exist as told now that the box of papers or files be turned over to you as chair?

28:01.000 --> 28:08.000
And be held until the committee has a chance to go through the various items, then we disclose that,

28:08.000 --> 28:19.000
otherwise it's a pain fire and we're just delaying our proceeding here to try to take this that much longer there, quite later, to know if checkings are correct.

28:19.000 --> 28:26.000
And the other two of them have the files and the papers as well as it has been removed from the files of the committee from the tender,

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
which is Council Jenkins for his custody under my direction until we can help the executive meeting of the committee.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
The members of the committee have come to start answering questions.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
So that any members of the committee can answer this.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
All right.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
Well, I'm just wondering, this way, would it be turned over to the chairman of the committee, or is this a piece?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Very well, it's an old image.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
I'll say, I will look at that huge...

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
...and then a class.

28:56.000 --> 29:04.000
The committee's requirements for the one of those files are being turned over now for the inspection of members of the committee.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
So, there was always anything turned over to him.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
He has thought the audit for the webinar, the one of the subject of the webinar.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
However, the chairman says that he has said previously that he will be the reason now anything turned over to him,

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
as information for this committee is available to any of the seven members of this committee,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
or he can decide whether the assembly is going to be the case.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
So, the chairman is going to go all out.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I send him a class on his family.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
I don't want you to think of the chair of the committee, but...

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
...because it was said they've signed anything else in this committee.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The property.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
I have requested that the minority council, the propensity,

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
the member of the committee staff, member of my staff, will sue the material.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
The chairman wheat out, not as much for the investigation.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I don't know what progress it made.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
We had said that I will want to see what it's being turned over,

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
and then to the chair of the other day I found personal letters.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
There are too many correct letters referring to all their senators,

30:15.000 --> 30:23.000
which I would not want to make part of the public's left record about the subject of the commission.

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
So, the material was more than being available, but not all of them in that box.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
I'd like to admit that the committee persons who I take as a unit,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
so there's no question about it.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
There we have a deeper range of...

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
...and I'm going to check it. There's nothing you can do to me yet.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
It's my account.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
If you're available to all the members of our committee,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
I'm going to have a demo and I'll test the structure.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I just want to check it.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Can you be available?

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
That's one of the problems we get through here and you and the chairman...
