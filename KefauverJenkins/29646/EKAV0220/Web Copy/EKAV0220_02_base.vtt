WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
We, the emissary, now have a visit to the warm one.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Do you read it?

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
I'm full of the available to join that boy,

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
and Mr. Jenkins has an hour of your door, a platform.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
So I'll have to say one more day again.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
We send him a call and then so I'll always

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
know that when he gets anything, John,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
it'll be made available to all the members

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
that are on the main part of all the main outlets.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
So I'm in the bar, maybe, a job at all.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
I've been doing some business, it's just me.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not competing now

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
with all the things in that pile.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
It should be in it.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm taking another one of this today.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Judgment of anyone member or anyone

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
who's in charge of the same office committee

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
who's seeing what it's about to be.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I will, that's made very clear, it's just time to finish.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
So, I would think it's probably appropriate

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
to send him a call and then join that boy,

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
at his father's office, I'll say yourself.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I'll let you go, I'll let you go.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I'll let you go.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I'll let you go.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I'll let you go.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'll let you go.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'll let you go.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'll thank you.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
That's all that is under fire in India.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
The clock is going against you now.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
You have to have a good night to miss here.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Just a call and I thank you and I are

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
in the most completed agreement

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
about the things that come into this room.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
You spent a lot of time trying to build a America

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
against it and still have I.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
We may differ however,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
but that's the approach to it.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Now, I wanted to discuss a little bit more

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
this question of classified data.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
And I want to ask a few questions.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Do you believe it's important to maintain discipline

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
on forces in order to have an effective fighting force

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
against threats of communist aggression?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yes.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Discipline in the army would allow the one of

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
a's, the one of a's, the one of the superior operas

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
that does it not?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yes.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
And you may have to obey orders,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
even though you may disagree with them.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Is that correct?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yes.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
You agree with me, don't you,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
that it would not be able to fight a battle

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
if everybody could do what he wanted,

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
in spite of his order?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yes, sir.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Now, I want to read you, Mr. Cohen,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
a quotation from the New York Times,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
of May 13th,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
the point on a threat conference on May 12th,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
of the President of the United States, and I quote,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
the sole of an army,

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
the sole of a defense force,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
was the certainty that everybody responded

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
to the laws of the land,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
and to the order of the superiors,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
all the way up to the commander-in-chief,

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
assume otherwise,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
and how would you fight a battle?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Continuing your quote,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
do you give an order to you people as division commander

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
or something of that nature to carry out your order about?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I knew this order that isn't the thing to do.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Well, whenever we got to adopting that theory in the military,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
or in our civilian organization,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
we had better disband and, of course,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
you agree with that statement of the President?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
For me, sir.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Now, the President was a supreme commander

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
of the Allied Forces in the European Theatre in World War II,

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
was he not?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Well, sir.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Well, we both know he did a good job, so I...

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
He now command or enchant of the armed forces?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yes, sir.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
So an order given by him is an order from the highest officer in the Army, isn't it?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Yes.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Now I want to read you a portion of executive order 105-01,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
entitled quote,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
states guarding official information

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
in the assistance of the defense of the United States.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
This order became effective on December 15, 1953.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
The dissemination outside the executive branch

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
classified as defense information

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
shall not be disseminated outside the executive branch

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
except on the conditions and through channels

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
authorized by the head of the disseminating department or agency.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Even though the person or agency to which dissemination of such information

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
is proposed to be made may have been solely or partly responsible for its production.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
And, of course, yes.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Now, that's an order from the President's command and chief of the armed forces.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Is it not?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes, sir.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Please take that.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Do you think that the members of the armed forces should obey that order?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yes, sir.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
You said this morning that you felt you were always coming to the Lord of the United States.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yes, sir.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
I assume you agree with me that all members of the armed forces are also coming to the Lord of the country.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Are they not?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yes, sir.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Now I want to read you section 4A of the Universal Military Training Statues.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
No member of the armed forces shall be restricted or prevented from communicating directly or indirectly

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
with any member or members of Congress concerning any touches.

04:53.000 --> 05:04.000
On left touch communication is an violation of law or an violation of regulations necessary to the security and safety of the United States.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
At the end of the call, now Mr. Cohen and you, that's that.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
And in view of the executive order I read, do you believe that an officer or an illicit man who disseminated classified information

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
held to honor the executive branch in violation of security regulations necessary to the security and safety of the United States

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
shall be subjected to disciplinary action.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
Sir, it depends on the circumstances of the dissemination and to whom the materialist is having.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
Well, now if you amplify that forward with respect to the document that I think we both know we are considered.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
You mean the protocol or the picture?

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
The Jordan who refused number of amberboard to have been done is not the same.

05:49.000 --> 06:00.000
So the, in that case, the officer was giving to the ministerial committee, which has the obligation under the law of investigating

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
the criminal, mishandling and rat-city and failure to act on the part of the executive.

06:06.000 --> 06:18.000
He was giving to the chairman of that committee information, demonstrating an important case where the executive has failed to take action

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
despite a three-year lapse of time.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
When I assume he did that in accordance with his post-to defend this nation against all enemies,

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
violence, or message, and in accordance with his country.

06:34.000 --> 06:44.000
You know why when he delivered the letter, he changed the two forms of the general and civil war.

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
The fact that I think what he was throwing was conveying to us the fact, conveying through the fundamentalities of fact,

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
that there was a situation in the executive, a serious situation which had not been attended to over the years,

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
despite frequent FBI warnings, and he was calling it to the attention of the chairman of the congressional committee,

07:07.000 --> 07:16.000
which has the responsibility for upholding and correcting the failure of the executive to act in situations such as that.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Now my memory is a little heavy, but the letter was 51, it was delivered in the spring of 1953.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
That's like for the committee, gentlemen.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yes sir.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
And for the, uh, most gentlemen, I think I have no further questions on that.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yes sir.

07:31.000 --> 07:40.000
I don't see Sunday, MacArthur here, I think if you don't want to ask any questions,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
you talk with the council and I'll go to Mr. Ruff.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Call the committee.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yes sir.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
The meeting is important, you are from the governor's office.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
I was about to ask you this question.

08:04.000 --> 08:15.000
Do I understand your opposition would be to say that it's just a sign that gone over and got into the arms and his commission?

08:15.000 --> 08:25.000
You are of 1953, but there's still what have been the collision between the senator and the army.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Hi.

08:28.000 --> 08:38.000
Uh, for a given sort of a collision between the senator and the army was not caught because of the shying matter.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
So then you can go right along with the commission.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Well, I think this is shying.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
It got his commission on their hot July day.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yes sir.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And come back in power and wage.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
2000.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
You were in the room.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
The other opinion today is that the collision between you and the army would have happened.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, for I say it, there were not that thing, it's probably one of them.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
Some other thing which they, the people who are behind this were few.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
Do you mean to say to come that if there never has been any mischiefs,

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
you know today with a fat bear and I just ain't with a fat bear.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I can't say that thing.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
You talk for one more, think that he was part of the union.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Yes sir, do do.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Who think that there have been no shying in the world?

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
And you and I were just just done by faith.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
The making that joke was we asking the question to the new mechanism.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
No sir, I can't.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
But that is the answer to snowfall.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Now that the weather's a little bit tough on me to answer your questions.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Well, I hate to make some difficult for you.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
That's what contains the challenge.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Once again, have there been no mischiefs ever in the world?

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
You and I were just done to have you or no reason with the army.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
And I was just done to have the need for that right there.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
No sir.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
That's totally isn't it?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
That's totally the thing that isn't it?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
But what does that mean?

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
You and I were just not in this room with their never-ending mischiefs.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
I don't know.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
I don't know if it's not possible of me having the roomings up for that man.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I think we could have said.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
We have to be these questions and new meetings these are to me.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Yes sir.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
Well, Mr. Cole, do you remember the day on with the day Shines?

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
You know what I think put it to hold up his hand and get his commission?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
We'll put it that way.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Sir, would you say Mr. Shines?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
No, he says that.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
No, it's been testified to in this room by General Reaper that he called up and said,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
may I come over and hold up my hand?

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
No sir, I just not understand the General Reaper said any chancestation has been made to him.

11:09.000 --> 11:17.000
Well, in any event, were you aware of a day when Mr. Shines let us take us a taxi or some other exorpology and went over to the...

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
...and it gone to be sworn in?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
No.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Did he ever tell you why I'm going over there and I hope I'm going to come back with my commission?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
No.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
Did you ever know that he went over there and the fight for one?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Yes sir.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Did he tell you where he was going?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
I don't recall if we did or not.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
I know he went there and my friend was talking before he went.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
He sure did.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Yes, didn't he?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
The corner is missing wrong with that.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
He's talking wrong with it.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Are you working very closely with him there?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
What's up?

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
I want to take as much of it as an hour off to go with the Pentagon and get his commission.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
We have to know it, wouldn't you?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I might or I might not.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
Now, Mr. Cohen, suppose he had come back on that day, cause he was alive.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That was a form.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Did you have a plan to finish his work for the committee?

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't think he could have happened that way sir.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Suppose it had.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
You wanted him to have a commission in July of 1933 that you did not.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
He was not going to leave the way it worked.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
He was not have come back wearing the uniform.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
Well, he went over to the testimony and I understand the testimony saying the item over and pulled up my hand.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Did you hear that in this room?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
That's one side of the story.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Yes.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
He heard that testimony.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
I heard somebody say he heard somebody else say that.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
I never heard this.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
And I was supposed to suppose Mr. Cohen that he had succeeded in going over and holding up his hands.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Mr. Cohen, coming back from the commission.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
You following me?

12:40.000 --> 12:40.000


12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
Did you then have a plan for Mr. Cohen to finish his work for the committee?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Kind of happened that way sir.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I didn't ask you whether it could have happened.

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
When you were trying to get him a commission in July, did you have a plan for Shindra finish his work with the committee?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
No, there was no plan.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
No plan at all.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Is that right?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
No, I hadn't quite finished it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Do I have to work for the plan or not?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Well, I was trying to say it was very fair.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Would it depend on when he was going in?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
All right.

13:09.000 --> 13:16.000
How much time were you allowed to put job at finishing up Shindra's work for the committee?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I may not have gotten to it.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
How much time did you take about it?

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
I can't say that I did.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
You knew he was going to be around, didn't you?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yes sir.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
And you have to take about it.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Don't explain that.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
You have to take about it completely, did you?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
By the way, when you went to the washers, somebody else.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
What the washers, what the charter was going to tell us down in the committee is

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
I don't think anybody has a washers except for the chairman of the committee.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Everybody just walked around on their own.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, sir, that might be amusing, but the boys down there, side by side, explained something wrong for them.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I don't mean to be a musician.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Who gets Shindra?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Who gets Shindra orders?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Anybody?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I'd like to answer your question.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
What about Shindra?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Who gets Shindra orders?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
That'll be an answer.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
No, sir.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I was so like this.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
And don't you answer that question.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Who gets Shindra orders?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Sir, before I do that, may I be...

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I don't care what you do before you can do it after.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
But tell me now, please.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Who gets Shindra orders?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Mr. Chairman, I answer your question.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Who gets?

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I answer, I think it was three questions back.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I was in the middle of it.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
No, I...

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
I will wave any question.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
The three questions back.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
And now I ask you who gets Shindra orders?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
I was in the first question.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I was before you.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Who gets Shindra orders?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Mr. Chairman, may I answer your question?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Mr. Welles, I have the question.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
But there's an answer because I think it cares the reflection on the people who work on the staff of this committee.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I need to cast no less lecture on anybody.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Mr. Korn, I'm trying to get from you the simple proposition who gave Shindra orders.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Who's telling me first?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Mr. Chairman, may I have a clear...

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
I want to give Mr. Welles all the yes and no answers I can.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Listen to your name.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
I call for a name.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
What's the name of the guy who gave Shindra orders?

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Sir, at the same time, I would like him to...

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
...concrete the answers to Mr. Welles' question before he cuts in and starts in with the...

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
All I can do is have some questions hanging back there.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Let's have it read.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
I'll tell you what it was about.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I'll ask it over again.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
What was it?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
As I recall, it's the one which I wanted to answer was...

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
...they spoke to me by you that people go laughing around down there.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I asked that again.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Do people make up their own minds as to what they're going to do?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Or do you have some direction in that committee?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
The way I can answer is you first, by telling you just what's done,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
and that's what happened down in that committee.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I don't care what happens, I want to know who gives me orders.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Who gives them?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
I try to...

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
...I will...

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
...because anybody gives them a little wealth.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I'll be happy to be playing with you.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I'm trying to find out if you could...

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
...I just want to know who gives me orders.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Well, whatever.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Mr. Welles has it ten minutes.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
He can use it anyway he wants to after Zoom.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
So, Lord, I have Mr. Welles.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Now, if you just heard over your shoulder, who gives me orders?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I just saw Mr. Tioniana talking to me.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh, he's had him in.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
So, I don't know.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I don't think he's wanting me to receive any sentence.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Well, he can tell you who gives me orders.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Oh, that's not all that.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Now, that's not me.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
He's not in.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
He gave me orders.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Mr. Call, let's eat green, back in our chairs,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
as far as the microphones are missing.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
And smile all over.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Yes, sir.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
And I'm now going to direct my remarks to a man named David Chan.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
On the first day that he turned up to work for this committee,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
who gave it his order?

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Sure, before you do that, I'll be very glad to answer that pilot so much

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
to answer the pending question that I make.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Well, if we got anything pending, I'm surprised.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Are you still troubled about that question of ropping around?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Is that so?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It's so tough.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Well, now make a speech, if you will.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Subtít, quote, ropping around, unquote.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Well, Mr. Chair, we'll have to ask the audience to deliver the questions.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Mr. Welles has the happy cycle.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
He has the new, new, shippling questions.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
But we don't want to, oh, I missed the chairman's craft, the unhappy stuff.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And now I think it's a happy cycle.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
He has the unfeited people who have just their grim face along the entire territory.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
So I do ask him to chuckle the quieties and still have the problem.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Now, that will not be taken out of your time, if it will.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
So, the summary will allow.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I'll tell you if not, before we go.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
The summary, Mr. Welles,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
and what you want at least is description of the right things for it down in the committee room.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
No, I want to speak to you on both ropping around, unquote,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
but you say you want to make it.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Well, Mr. Welles, for now, this is all very funny to you.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
It's not to make it.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Mr. Cold, I say to you, I hate him this much as you do.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
But I'm trying to cause examine you.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
And keep telling me you want to make some kind of a statement about this.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
That is a very big question of mine that has the phrase of it ropping around.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Now, let's get to it and tell us what you want to tell us.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
So, in front of your person,

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
what I wanted to say is people downstairs do not knock around.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
They work hard.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
They work much harder than they have to turn the pay which they get.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
Now, they do a careful and inefficient job for a train.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
They're capable, or they wouldn't beat it.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
And we don't have to have somebody sitting on top of them,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
giving them directions and quarters.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
They do their work, and they do a well, and the end resulted

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
that communists have been all eliminated from defense plans and government agencies.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
And that money has been paid to the taxpayers of this country.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
That is the way we work out of it.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
We don't have a chance to get to this disfound yet.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And he's out for it.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
You don't have to have time to reply.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
The suggestion to the question?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
No question.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Mr. German, do you find it right?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
No.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
You can't.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Is that so for you?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
No, I guess not.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
You were asking from the table to the ten minutes came that there's no objections to anybody

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
who would give you a dissent.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That might make you very well.

18:55.000 --> 19:03.000
Mr. Koen, I'd like to thank you for having a minute of the road up.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
And as I said this morning, I think it's very rightful,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
so by the able-sunture tool.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
I don't know what I have to do with your truck tube.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
You're talking the lab are you?

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
I'm not having a document which I didn't have this morning when I questioned you.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
So I'm trying to test Kagan.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
The statement on it, I am tempted to support that the unsewing election.

19:33.000 --> 19:41.000
And I do hear by nominally the following main person as a candidate for the candidate of the coming of the press.

19:41.000 --> 19:50.000
I'm going to confirm you that Mr. Koen asked you whether or not you get towards the mid-adventure of the Kagan.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Well, the time you went to Europe was at the monthly title acting director,

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
who is acting director of the Public Affairs Association of the Office of the Micromissariat.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
I'm going to hand you the stripes of support to the coming of the party.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
And ask your mother or not to,

20:09.000 --> 20:20.000
you look at it from the Kagan, the admission under oath that he is the same Kagan as the one to sign that adopted.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Yes sir.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
And this was signed, I believe, after the Hitler-Solling Act,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
because I believe it was.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
And one of the results of your self-truth, Europe, was the elimination.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
And we had our information serviced over there, they're called to help to make.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Now this man who had pledged supports to the coming of the party,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
he resigned during that investigation yesterday.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Now Mr. Koen, is that a bulls-drawn among the bulls-drawn?

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I don't know if it's a bulls-drawn.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, nochmal, we have to stand and meet that.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
So, what about the ten minutes I guess for our own cowboys?

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Can we have a come to our duty?

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
I mean, just concluded a kind of roll call, hopefully, now here in two bells,

21:22.000 --> 21:29.000
the alarm for a corn, we'll speed however hoping that it may not be seen as a race and a roll call.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Time keep the rises, we send him a call, and you have eight minutes left.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
You make a head-up.

21:36.000 --> 21:46.000
Mr. Koen, one of the subjects of June 9th has got their childhood number of friends that are called as the crossman's

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
authority, the committee has to get information from the executive branch.

21:53.000 --> 22:00.000
I have seen Facebook formatting from the justice department at the White House.

22:00.000 --> 22:08.000
So, we expect that the general law, if he's in force to law, are glad and executive, we only have a step back, we agree with that, don't we?

22:08.000 --> 22:20.000
Not that, I believe we also agree that there are friends who have some confusion from a part of some between the aggression of the race when forced to law,

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
from a partly executive and the right of a congressional committee to get information if the law is not properly enforced,

22:27.000 --> 22:34.000
because there's mouth-safes, there's speech, there's a left, option, treatment, etc.

22:34.000 --> 22:48.000
I think you and I have gone over and detailed the organization act and have the green fully that new chief counsel,

22:48.000 --> 22:56.000
as the chairman have no choice but to attempt to get information.

22:57.000 --> 23:08.000
So, any failure to properly enforce the law, any grants, any corruption, any dishonesty, any communist infiltration in the executive branch?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
That's right.

23:10.000 --> 23:19.000
I have a formula, a state malicious by the White House this morning, and I'm slightly disempowered by the president.

23:19.000 --> 23:31.000
It led from very excellent accomplishments, in the case that our executive branch certainly is getting in the right direction.

23:31.000 --> 23:43.000
I think that you and I have always agreed that this administration has been heading in the right direction,

23:43.000 --> 23:53.000
and it has been simplified the removal of communism in turn, we may have had some question about the stage of which they were moving,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
is that right?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Yes sir.

23:57.000 --> 24:18.000
Mr. Combe, under the law of the National Bank, as you interpret it, this committee has no choice but to attempt to get information.

24:19.000 --> 24:31.000
To expose any wrongdoing, any misstatements, any incompetence in the executive, that's the duty of the Congress under the rule of the National Bank.

24:31.000 --> 24:39.000
If there is a law which says we cannot choose that out of force, then you and I agree we cannot get information.

24:39.000 --> 24:57.000
I believe we have agreed to over that there is no order of any bureau of chief, any department head, which can nullify the reorganization act.

24:57.000 --> 25:21.000
And if any bureau head, if any cabinet officer, anyone up to the president, including the president, signs an order, issues an order, which would make it impossible for the committee to do the job which it has been ordered to do under the reorganization act,

25:21.000 --> 25:31.000
we certainly are not bound by any such orders, that's right, so that was even said in Frenchman on the duties of the legislative party.

25:31.000 --> 25:44.000
Right. Now, once you're calling on me, ask you to listen, you'll be in the Israeli high official Democratic administration.

25:44.000 --> 26:07.000
I think you and I use the Democrat as Republicans have agreed that both of our committee is concerned that there will be no cover-up regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans get hurt, but the job of our committee is to disclose any wrongdoing and any communism and corruption that's right.

26:08.000 --> 26:28.000
Well, yesterday, the senator went and attacked upon what the committee found her, I find that attacked headlined in the communist daily worker,

26:28.000 --> 26:37.000
and found her, like, in McCarthy to Hitler, I believe you described the daily worker this morning already as the telegraph agency of the communist party.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Okay, sir.

26:40.000 --> 27:00.000
What's the reform there's in the statement that tends to raise the cost of religious racial history, I think it's a vicious thing, I read his speech, I don't believe that he wrote himself.

27:00.000 --> 27:07.000
I think the kindest thing you can say about Ralph is that this may be the result of some illicitness.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.000
In fact, religious racial history comes a fight between the three counties on our committee.

27:17.000 --> 27:29.000
One happens to be, they protest, and one happens to be Jewish, and the other happens to be Catholic, but all active in their church, Christ Joseph.

27:29.000 --> 27:53.000
There's also to come that there is no head of either politics, religion or race, who comes to hiring investigators of the sole theft, and to get comfort young men, and all we have on our committee now, has had a background standing either in the FBI, the Justice Department,

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
and a secret service with one exception, I believe, maybe two now.

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
You left? Probably, sir, they all, I, I, I, I, they all, confident in that, but they were doing a tough, fun, hardworking job.

28:05.000 --> 28:20.000
Now, Mr. Cohn, one of the questions that this summit is going to have to decide sooner or later is, the question of whether or not the Americans people are entitled to know what's going on in their government.

28:20.000 --> 28:32.000
As you and I have often discussed there, the two theories, one is that if they special favorably American people let them know what the facts are, you don't subscribe to that, I do not.

28:32.000 --> 28:45.000
The other theory that was you and I both described is that the American people are the matter of right, and title to know what their servants are doing, and all of them down here are their servants.

28:46.000 --> 28:55.000
Well, we're going to have any time sooner or later, doesn't it? Do I extend the Bureau of Education for texting self from exposure?

28:55.000 --> 29:01.000
What, what extent, an executive department can protect people in the executive?

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
Now, you were in the Democratic administration, rather high official in the justice department.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
I just wonder if you wouldn't, now this time give us some pulling examples.

29:13.000 --> 29:26.000
The attempts on the party of the executive to cover up information, cases in which it would work for a conventional committee individuals who are now in jail would not be there.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
I would like to direct your attention first, if I may, to the Remington case.

29:31.000 --> 29:42.000
I'd like to direct your attention specifically to the question is what happened when you were helping to prosecute those patients so far as five years ago?

29:42.000 --> 29:51.000
The files were concerned. How much assistance lead to events? How much assistance the prosecution government has?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
How the time is it for you to question me?

29:54.000 --> 30:02.000
Sure. In the Remington case, I think that that case was further developed before this committee.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
Answer that, another hearing was held on before the House Committee on American Activity.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
There was then a surgery and a grand jury investigation and a surgery indictment.

30:14.000 --> 30:37.000
And for to answer your question directly, before the prosecution, before the trial began, one important point in the in the prosecution was whether or not Remington had become a member of the Communist Party while in Maxwell, Tennessee working for the TBA.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
That was a key point in the post he was on trial for the surgery, connection with the denial of Communist Party membership.

30:44.000 --> 30:51.000
A number of our witnesses of the type that they came from, Maxwell and what people have worked with Remington in the TBA.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
We did not get their files and we did not have access to their files.

30:56.000 --> 31:11.000
We found out that certain officials of the TBA had physically turned over confidential files on government witnesses in the case against Remington, too,

31:11.000 --> 31:21.000
Remington's defense counsel and were going all out. These officials of the government were going all out to help the defense and to hurt the prosecution.

31:21.000 --> 31:45.000
I think the incident which you mean at that point I recall going down to the great city of Maxwell and one of my very able associates and a association, we subpoenaed well of the file and then physically took them back to New York, that there were numerous other instances which occurred to me within my personal experience.

31:45.000 --> 31:52.000
There were people in the executive who tried to stop the prosecution and be uncovering a communist.

31:52.000 --> 32:03.000
And I can say at my own personal knowledge having worked in the executive that it has been the work of committees such as this, such as the House Committee when it was founded a month with Acting Chairman in the his case.
