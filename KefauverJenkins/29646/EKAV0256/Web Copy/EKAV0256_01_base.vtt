WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.680
We also operate it on a final act quite frequently in this investigating committee of seeking

00:14.680 --> 00:20.320
and sometimes securing the cooperation of executive head evidences.

00:20.320 --> 00:25.120
For example, the General Services Administration, I think you will recall we investigated that.

00:25.120 --> 00:32.560
Mr. Jess Larson, who was a Democrat, but operating collaboratively, what's the committee

00:32.560 --> 00:37.120
enabled us to achieve a great deal of good in that department, a three-way cooperative

00:37.120 --> 00:38.120
basis?

00:38.120 --> 00:39.120
Is that correct?

00:39.120 --> 00:46.000
That is correct, and Mr. Chalin, there was stuff that they won't wait on this, that Mr. Blantonberg

00:46.000 --> 00:47.600
went a step further.

00:47.600 --> 00:53.320
He got rid of the loyalty board as far as we know, and when a man came before the committee

00:53.320 --> 00:57.160
at 9 o'clock in the morning, took the firm at the moment about communism.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.160
He didn't self-mustream at the committee.

00:59.160 --> 01:04.160
He just fired him in the staff and had cleaned up, made an unnecessary force to continue

01:04.160 --> 01:05.160
that.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.800
The Edward Rothschild case with Mr. Chair and Mr. Mittian.

01:08.800 --> 01:14.160
Now, I would have pinpointed and worked it was that this cooperation built down.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.400
It has been demonstrated both under Democratic and Republican administration.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
It can exist.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.200
Where it does exist, you get salutary results and you get them quickly.

01:23.200 --> 01:29.200
There will be minimum of embarrassment, but there will be maximum of vindication of the

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
Republicans.

01:30.200 --> 01:36.800
You said, go down in the first place because of your continued efforts to disclose who it

01:36.800 --> 01:40.160
was responsible for what happened to major progress.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.160
That was one point.

01:41.160 --> 01:45.160
I can pinpoint it out to a definite date, perhaps.

01:45.160 --> 01:50.160
Mr. Steven Scholl, I believe it was on a Friday night.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.080
That's all it was monitored.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.480
Objective, Deloddy said, was unfair treatment of the victor.

01:56.480 --> 02:02.200
I have been trying to get the victor to give us the names of those who were responsible

02:02.200 --> 02:05.120
for the special treatment of the press.

02:05.120 --> 02:11.120
Specifically, I wanted to know who the morning after we asked that press, the court march

02:11.120 --> 02:18.120
told, got rid of him, got him the under jurisdiction from the Army.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.120
That was when everything broke loose.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.120
The press said that his family expired.

02:25.120 --> 02:29.360
I want to ask you, most specifically, to pinpoint it and suppose to wait for my next

02:29.360 --> 02:30.360
10 minute break.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.360
You know, let him take 10 minutes on.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.360
Yes, him.

02:33.360 --> 02:37.360
Mr. Scholl, I'm worried about which is the announcement.

02:37.360 --> 02:42.240
I shall ask the leaves, which afternoon at 3 o'clock I do understand that the committee

02:42.240 --> 02:46.240
in terms of recess or that today is correct.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.720
I'd like to ask for that in terms of this, and also has the leaves that we're going to

02:49.720 --> 02:50.720
carry since the Lord of the Army.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.720
So I'll go after the leaves.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.720
Sometimes it seems quite any in violence.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.720
Lord, why?

02:55.720 --> 02:59.720
Well, not really as in 40, but I thought about 40.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.720
Well, that'll be a strong help.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.720
I'll let it go.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.720
Mr. Halton, we make that observation.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.720
It will not be possible.

03:07.720 --> 03:16.760
I assume from the limited time, when you reconvene at the noon for me to come to the

03:16.760 --> 03:20.960
afternoon, the questions I shall ask that should like to ask.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.760
And I assume that it'll take them to Monday anyways.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.800
It's completely false of demination at which time I should want to resume.

03:29.800 --> 03:34.520
I assume that you'll have a chance at night.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.800
And the beginning, Mr. Chairman, I wish to make this observation.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.800
That bear has now developed.

03:41.800 --> 03:50.800
Here, these earrings, one of the strangest paradoxes that I have ever witnessed are experience

03:50.800 --> 03:53.880
for fear and attribution.

03:53.880 --> 04:00.880
And especially, is that true, where people in high official government positions are involved?

04:00.880 --> 04:11.480
And it shall be my purpose to try to bring back some major clarity and proper understanding

04:11.480 --> 04:14.600
of just what is involved in this conversation.

04:14.600 --> 04:22.400
And I shall therefore undertake to direct my questions at this time to that end.

04:22.400 --> 04:31.400
For this, I shall make use of the official documents that constitute the charges and the

04:31.400 --> 04:32.400
countercharges.

04:32.400 --> 04:39.400
And I should like to interrogate the senator to take the lay regarding his countercharges

04:39.400 --> 04:41.400
and you all.

04:41.400 --> 04:51.400
The testimony that he gave yesterday regarding Secretary Stevens and his appraisal of

04:51.400 --> 04:53.400
the commission as an honest man.

04:53.400 --> 05:01.400
And back, Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask, and I do ask the senator from Mr. Thompson.

05:01.400 --> 05:10.400
For his documents, I shall refer to it as charges or countercharges, because that's what it is to me.

05:10.400 --> 05:15.400
He may refer to it as a statement of fact, so use any other term.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.400
He may choose, but for me it's charges.

05:18.400 --> 05:28.400
By reading the second paragraph of that document, senator, we are submitting here with what we consider to be part of the statement

05:28.400 --> 05:44.400
concerning the appeal, the appeal by two honest civilians, most beloved key Steelers and Mr. John D. Adams, to discredit the investigation of the

05:44.400 --> 05:54.400
investigation of the military and to force a discontinuous of our hearings exposing communist

05:54.400 --> 05:58.400
infiltration in their department.

05:58.400 --> 06:04.400
Senator, is that charged to the truth?

06:04.400 --> 06:15.400
The senator, is that charged to the fact that both charges are facts and truth.

06:15.400 --> 06:26.400
So you've done this to me now, but for the act of an honest man, a man of integrity.

06:26.400 --> 06:37.400
Just because you don't risk hope that I said yesterday, I said that except for the worker incident and the filing of these fraudulent charges,

06:37.400 --> 06:43.400
other than that I found nothing involved Steven Sandler to disperse you.

06:43.400 --> 06:53.400
Do you regard those acts as your lies there and as a gift to discredit this investigating committee?

06:53.400 --> 07:01.400
And to force a discontinuous of hearings exposing communist infiltration into the department of the Army?

07:01.400 --> 07:05.400
Not only was it an attempt, but it was a successful attempt.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.400
Do you regard that?

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
As long as you know it was a successful attempt.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.400
I know, I know the whole story of the story.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.400
You know that story?

07:13.400 --> 07:19.400
Do you regard that as an act of a patriotic official of this government?

07:19.400 --> 07:23.400
No, I think that is a joke to say.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.400
Highly improper.

07:25.400 --> 07:30.400
However, when I said of the same, we drafted the charges.

07:30.400 --> 07:39.400
We did not know that he was being advised by the chief political advisers of the opposite political party.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.400
I expected you to inject that.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.400
That's no surprise.

07:45.400 --> 07:51.400
May I say to you that your colleagues on this committee have refused to call in as a witness?

07:51.400 --> 07:56.400
When I have twice, you refuse to refuse to call in as a witness?

07:56.400 --> 08:02.400
When the Democrats have twice made a motion to call in, I want you to have that evidence if it's true.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
And I'll help you get it.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.400
I mean I say that there is a mic in the front of the Hienauti call,

08:08.400 --> 08:13.400
so that the last son of his family can also put the stand, the picture would not be complete.

08:13.400 --> 08:19.400
And up to this time my good friend from Missouri has nothing to say.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.400
May I say this to you?

08:21.400 --> 08:24.400
I said it to the first person.

08:24.400 --> 08:32.400
I shall hold in this regard, both the charges, and in the evidence that you may be of against him.

08:32.400 --> 08:39.400
He'll first submit his own not caring, and give him the opportunity to defend himself against your charges.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.400
From a nice, not someday, or many may.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.400
Who is accused? I'm speaking of Mr. Clipper.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.400
Who is accused here in this form?

08:49.400 --> 08:52.400
Who is not given an office unit, Mr. Dupont?

08:52.400 --> 08:55.400
Well, the evidence against him is nothing given by me.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.400
Well, I've been given a five-year, some given him a monitored call.

08:59.400 --> 09:13.400
I think the evidence is very clear, some are monitored calls between Mr. Swamington and Mr. Steven.

09:13.400 --> 09:18.400
Mr. Swamington, Mr. Steven, that is the evidence against Clifford.

09:18.400 --> 09:24.400
It shows that Mr. Swamington starts out by saying I'll get Clifford.

09:24.400 --> 09:29.400
There's no question why Steven's a little clipper to him.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.400
I am quite a little bit of a make-up.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
You're sure that I gave the evidence.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.400
No question me with this.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.400
I don't tell them I'm pressing you or not.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.400
Mr. McClillin, when I tell them I'm pressing you or not,

09:40.400 --> 09:43.400
but I want to extract it from you.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.400
Do not extract me, say, the facts.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.400
I know we're not in a very good place.

09:48.400 --> 09:56.400
The testimony here is the County of St. Louis.

09:56.400 --> 10:01.400
The first mention of Clifford is when he talks about Clifford.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.400
It's on years you, I think, is revealing.

10:04.400 --> 10:09.400
No explanation of Clifford is, so frankly, I've been discussing this before.

10:09.400 --> 10:16.400
Finally, we finally final day on the 8th of March that's seriously

10:16.400 --> 10:21.400
before the fraudulent charges were filed against myself and me.

10:21.400 --> 10:28.400
If that's when we find Mr. Swamington is calling Mr. Steven.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400
Not Steven's calling Swamington.

10:30.400 --> 10:35.400
We find Steven's saying that day.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.400
In effect, there's practically nothing to this.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
I don't think there's anything to it.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.400
We find him, though, currently the urging,

10:42.400 --> 10:51.400
the urging was probably the lawyer for the political advisor of the Democrat Committee.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.400
Now, if he were called, and I just felt the question whether he should be called

10:55.400 --> 10:58.400
even Mr. Swamington does not appear.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.400
The point is that he can take the lawyer quite unfairly.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.400
He could refuse to answer whether he would or not.

11:03.400 --> 11:10.400
I don't know, but I think the important link here would be to have both Mr. Swamington and Mr. Clifford

11:10.400 --> 11:15.400
and Senator Al Heptie get Mr. Clifford.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.400
How much was he trying to climb the head?

11:17.400 --> 11:19.400
Wait a moment.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.400
I don't care what he says.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.400
I just want him to know that I'll have to get Mr. Clifford.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.400
I thank you.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
I'm a title student.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
And I'll have to get him out of my bed.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
Would you help me get Mr. Swamington?

11:30.400 --> 11:31.400
No, sir.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.400
I am not going to have one senator against another.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.400
You know their privileges.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.400
You know their life.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.400
And I'm not going to have Mr. Swamington get you the best of them.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.400
I'm neutral.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
Of course here, Mr. Swamington.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.400
And may I say, keep it that way?

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
Mr. Chairman, may I rise before you?

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
May I rise before you?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
No, thank you very much.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.400
You'll have your time.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.400
Let's keep it.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.400
That is preferred for me.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.400
And you can take it in your time.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.400
I was dealt my request.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.400
I'm trying to be neutral between you two.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.400
Senator, I just that I am, but I do think that Charles B.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
Well, I'm not going to let you down.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.400
Just stay there.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
I don't know.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.400
All right.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
I'll be right back.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.400
I'll be right back.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.400
Mr. Swamington, I'm not going to let you down.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.400
I can't take it in your time.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.400
I'm in neutral between you two.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.400
Senator, I just that I am, but I do think that Charles B.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
made here against Mr. Clifford.

12:11.400 --> 12:15.400
He should have a chance to answer, but I think Senator,

12:15.400 --> 12:20.400
a multi-faceted, the able to persuade his colleagues, his

12:20.400 --> 12:24.400
brothers and colleagues on the committee, the reverse staff position,

12:24.400 --> 12:25.400
and let us get it.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.400
Now let's move from that.

12:27.400 --> 12:32.400
There's one thing that you mentioned that, but oh, may I say this to you?

12:32.400 --> 12:38.400
When was the Mr. Clifford first contacted?

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
I don't know when he was first contacted before.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400
Well, I mean so far.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.400
It was around the day.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.400
You just got on her told to defend those.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.400
What is the date of it just to get that far in here?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.400
So you want to know what the best?

12:49.400 --> 12:52.400
I believe it was around the 21st.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.400
The first assignment that you played with me, right?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.400
Monitor call was there.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.400
The 21st said what?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.400
To get between those.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.400
To get between the call.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
The other thing I wanted to say.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.400
Senator, the only thing I wanted to get.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.400
If that is the date that first thing you have in every day,

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
it's about Mr. Clifford.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.400
I want to ask you if ever incidental age.

13:11.400 --> 13:15.400
Then these charges and counter charges didn't occur long-fired.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.400
And that's Clifford ever being in trouble.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
No, not a fact.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
No, the...

13:20.400 --> 13:23.400
And all this kind of break you arrived before Clifford's name has ever

13:23.400 --> 13:25.400
been mentioned before, he's ever consulted the one who will be out of here.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.400
No, no, no, no.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
What is the month's plan?

13:29.400 --> 13:32.400
The first call that Clifford was on,

13:32.400 --> 13:35.400
first one of his calls, I don't know when the first time that I was,

13:35.400 --> 13:38.400
the first one of his calls was...

13:38.400 --> 13:40.400
15 minutes.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.400
I told me at times, the exciting look at that man.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.400
So...

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
No, I'll tell you, we can't reach that.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
You have Dr. Edgterg's here and mother now,

13:51.400 --> 13:53.400
so the next session of the hearing will be at 2 p.m.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.400
Do you?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
I'm an issue.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.400
By the members of the committee,

13:57.400 --> 14:00.400
the first one to question him in the afternoon session will be Senator Dirkson,

14:00.400 --> 14:03.400
a Bellinoi, then Senator Jackson of Washington,

14:03.400 --> 14:05.400
then Senator Potter of Michigan.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.400
Sorry, sir.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.400
I'm very happy to acknowledge the presence of an old personal friend,

14:23.400 --> 14:27.400
the General of Joe Fox, well known for many people in the audience.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.400
I'm sure because it is outstanding record in the World War II,

14:30.400 --> 14:34.400
and having shot down and obtained number of plans is Eddie Wickenbach,

14:34.400 --> 14:37.400
that we have him and I guess to the committee room,

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
and because there's a rule of no politics,

14:39.400 --> 14:43.400
I will not mention the fact that he's the Republican candidate for governor,

14:43.400 --> 14:45.400
I'll tell you about that.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.400
I'm not going to ask that.

14:52.400 --> 14:57.400
Mr. Chairman, may I say that I served in the Pacific

14:57.400 --> 15:03.400
where Joe Fox was giving us fighter cover and all through the Pacific.

15:03.400 --> 15:08.400
We considered Joe Fox the greatest marine fighter pilot

15:08.400 --> 15:12.400
that the Marine Corps any unit ever produced.

15:16.400 --> 15:25.400
We will now come to order three of the shareholders welcome the guests of the committee,

15:25.400 --> 15:30.400
we have come to the committee room on this Friday afternoon,

15:30.400 --> 15:34.400
and again remind our friends and the audience of the outstanding

15:34.400 --> 15:37.400
and prevailing rule of the committee,

15:37.400 --> 15:43.400
which forbids any demonstrations of approval or disapproval on the part of the audience,

15:43.400 --> 15:48.400
concerning any of the matter insuriously being considered by the committee.

15:48.400 --> 15:54.400
And the uniform members of the Capitol Police Force and the trained closing of the audience

15:54.400 --> 16:01.400
have the painful duties under orders of the committee to ensure it from the room immediately,

16:01.400 --> 16:06.400
politely but firmly, any of our guests who violate the committee rule.

16:07.400 --> 16:15.400
Mr. Harold Beckley will come forward now and also the radio representative of the press gallery.

16:15.400 --> 16:21.400
We have the copies of the executive hearings of yesterday available for the press.

16:21.400 --> 16:27.400
They are here and I'm sure sufficient numbers so that each of you may have a copy.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.400
Charlie is the copy for you.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.400
Mr. Harold Beckley, the superintendent of the Senate Radio Gallery,

16:33.400 --> 16:37.400
and Connie DeAndre, the assistant superintendent of the radio and television gallery,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.400
is the copy for the report.

16:44.400 --> 16:50.400
Charlie would like to say that they come to you a little later than usual for only one reason.

16:50.400 --> 16:56.400
And as you know, the chair has operated under the rule when we release executive testimonies

16:56.400 --> 17:00.400
and simply have a 10-strived and released.

17:00.400 --> 17:07.400
Senator Dirkson called attention to an omission of a syllable and one word that he uttered the other day

17:07.400 --> 17:13.400
with a change of meaning, instead of it by making a phrase instead of an upraise.

17:13.400 --> 17:18.400
And while it may not be controlling the senator McCarthy, he says that he does not say that he was going to praise

17:18.400 --> 17:23.400
Senator McCarthy's work, but it was going to after this when he came to testimony.

17:23.400 --> 17:28.400
And then the committee members felt and the chair thought rightfully that before releasing a patient

17:28.400 --> 17:34.400
have a right to correct any omissions or deletions, I don't want this to be a criticism of our repertoire of service.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.400
I think Mr. Alderson's super done extended job.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.400
But we meet down there around the big table.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.400
There are no microphones.

17:42.400 --> 17:47.400
We meet rather informally with several senators sometimes talking at the same time

17:47.400 --> 17:50.400
and a little bit of going to get exactly correct.

17:50.400 --> 17:55.400
I would like to say that the meeting yesterday was a very harmonious meeting.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
There was no yoke temper.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
There were no high phrases.

18:00.400 --> 18:06.400
And the transcript that you have is a faithful transcript of what's up based down there.

18:06.400 --> 18:12.400
Senator McClellan had just concluded I believe he's 10 minutes with Senator McCarthy.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.400
So I will call next on Senator Potter who has 10 minutes of time.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.400
Bring around to 10 minutes go around.

18:18.400 --> 18:24.400
Mr. Chairman, I believe as we concluded the morning strike in Senator McClellan

18:24.400 --> 18:33.400
made a statement concerning the Republican members of this committee refusing to ask for

18:33.400 --> 18:39.400
a specific part of the committee to prepare the witness.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
That's true.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.400
We voted in the exact respect yesterday.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.400
Not just the committee Mr. Crippard as a witness.

18:47.400 --> 18:54.400
Mr. We have them in our practice to the committee a witness who hasn't been reflected

18:54.400 --> 18:58.400
by the principles involved at the meeting yesterday.

18:58.400 --> 19:08.400
Senator McClellan or his staff has selected Mr. Crippard or Mr. Weft and his co-op has

19:08.400 --> 19:10.400
to meet the governor.

19:10.400 --> 19:17.400
Now if we made a practice of opinion every name that's mentioned in the hearings,

19:17.400 --> 19:23.400
of course the chairman was born for weeks on weeks and the mornings and months.

19:23.400 --> 19:28.400
Now Mr. Crippard has not known as being a man who is not articulate.

19:28.400 --> 19:38.400
He has never requested the committee to prepare the committee to testify.

19:38.400 --> 19:46.400
I assume that they made a request to be heard and asked to be heard.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.400
That's what I would be on.

19:49.400 --> 19:57.400
I haven't been the case and until I was done I was fulfilling my self and the other Republican members of the committee.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.400
So you have for example Mr. Crippard here.

20:01.400 --> 20:11.400
Mr. Crippard is actually as counsel, also for, apparently Mr. Stevens and Mr. Crippard

20:11.400 --> 20:21.400
and the Prime Minister, according to the minor information, the telephone conversation that goes into the record,

20:21.400 --> 20:31.400
if non-usual practice you have a lawyer that's a lawyer, what's the place that when the principal

20:31.400 --> 20:41.400
that he was to advise haven't themselves given their position concerning his bias to be counseled to give.

20:41.400 --> 20:52.400
So until Mr. Crippard asked to be heard, I feel that we have no right to go in and opinion because it's named to mention.

20:52.400 --> 20:59.400
They've also been meeting these, they've been mentioning of following the general law.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.400
And now it's been a lot of them to call.

21:02.400 --> 21:09.400
Certainly I would bring our other witnesses to law, that's because the same thing to show what a private term is.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.400
I think it's well to consider it.

21:14.400 --> 21:21.400
And understanding the emotion of the Republican members of the committee,

21:21.400 --> 21:30.400
that we have signed long goal, the president stated, and just stated for sure, that all principals are to good Earth.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
All principals will be first.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.400
Who we go beyond that.

21:35.400 --> 21:41.400
We will be continuing the hearings for many weeks, but no one's here to bother us.

21:41.400 --> 21:46.400
So that was the position of the members of the Republican members of the committee.

21:46.400 --> 22:00.400
I'm confident that for the time that Mr. Crippard and Mr. Crippard have concluded that this morning we will have all the facts put to Mr. Crippard to this controversy that we ever will.

22:00.400 --> 22:13.400
Now I think that we also have the Council's involved, Mr. Wells, who represents Mr. Crippard and Mr. Adam Jarmie,

22:13.400 --> 22:19.400
who has the Thunder and the Roy Cone's representative, and has the counter-birth of his new state.

22:19.400 --> 22:27.400
Where they were willing to conclude after calling the principal's involved.

22:27.400 --> 22:38.400
They both say that if we go to call for our witnesses, that this will drag on for many, many days and weeks.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.400
So I think it will, that we understand the system.

22:41.400 --> 22:56.400
The position of this senator, and I'm sure the other Republican members of this committee, we have no desire to cut off any legal facts from the day.

22:56.400 --> 23:06.400
But ladies and gentlemen, we have an obligation to our constituents.

23:06.400 --> 23:17.400
We have an obligation to our responsibility as a United States senator to conclude this as soon as possible.

23:17.400 --> 23:30.400
We have the President of the United States last night making a wonderful address, appealing to the Congress and appealing to the country for his legislative programs.

23:30.400 --> 23:36.400
I know I have said he is most difficult for these eight senators to try to form this area.

23:37.400 --> 23:49.400
To carry out our responsibility to the President and bring in about a successful conclusion to the his legislative program,

23:49.400 --> 23:57.400
to an act, his legislative program, who are tied up at eight hours a day, to this area.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.400
We guarantee that we will bring out the fire.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.400
That's the argument.

24:04.400 --> 24:09.400
We didn't guarantee that this was water room on November 4th.

24:09.400 --> 24:16.400
So I say that I think these Republican members of this committee,

24:16.400 --> 24:27.400
the President, they took the responsibility to conclude the hearings after the principles that I mentioned have been taught.

24:27.400 --> 24:36.400
I think many people have missed the conclusion of the members of this committee.

24:37.400 --> 24:54.400
Unfortunately, I'm afraid many people would like to see what role and they think that every member of this committee should be able to draw blood either on Sunday or Secretary Stevens or draw blood on Sunday.

24:54.400 --> 25:00.400
Actually, members of this committee, that's in a semi-divitial capacity.

25:00.400 --> 25:05.400
The proposition is to have to change the fact.

25:05.400 --> 25:09.400
Now, it's more difficult to ascertain the two facts.

25:09.400 --> 25:20.400
If you are carrying the quote, pointing one side of this front of it,

25:20.400 --> 25:25.400
I'll draw John to get the facts with a little needed talk.

25:25.400 --> 25:33.400
And unfortunately, during the part about carrying the facts, he has the most important situation for a personality that he has developed.

25:33.400 --> 25:46.400
I say there's most important for committee actions of jury and should not either be action of but as a matter or to winter into the various personalities on this.

25:46.400 --> 25:56.400
Therefore, I sincerely appeal to the individual members of this committee and to the principle involved and to the council involved.

25:56.400 --> 26:08.400
I can recognize that he doesn't necessarily produce blood and we can ascertain the facts much better in a full-com collective manner.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.400
And I carry on with dignity and fair play.

26:12.400 --> 26:24.400
By doing that, I'm sure the people who are watching this hearing will be able to form their own mom where it thinks it is, what the controversy is all about.

26:24.400 --> 26:32.400
And it might be well at this time to restate this, what is the controversy here?

26:32.400 --> 26:44.400
It has been charged on one hand by the Mr. Stevens and the threatens by some of the parties that are following Mr. Cohn.

26:44.400 --> 26:55.400
You think investigating my arm of thumb that the number to secure or attempt to secure a certain treatment for David Cohn?

26:55.400 --> 27:13.400
Now the counterstatement by Senator McCartney, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn, will affect the Mr. Stevens and Mr. Adams, were in effect blackmailing or attempting to blackmail the committee and an effort to get him to call off this investigation.

27:14.400 --> 27:27.400
Now, blow the rest in the truck and I work to now direct a question to Senator McCartney and send him about the I have to put him on my feet.

27:27.400 --> 27:34.400
And I'd like to direct this question to you, one of the things that you do.

27:34.400 --> 27:43.400
Do you agree with me, Mr. Plexen, I've asked Mr. Cohn, I've asked Secretary Sabin and Mr. Watt?

27:43.400 --> 27:55.400
Do you agree with me that the charge which Cohn has made by the Army against yourself, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Cohn, are serious charges?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.400
Uh, of the most serious charges.

27:57.400 --> 28:01.400
Wasn't the charge that directs to your fault, they are still serious.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.400
Right.

28:04.400 --> 28:13.400
Now, Secretary, or Senator McCartney, I wish to ask this question, we give all the way, I hope that it is a slip of the tongue.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.400
Let's give it a try.

28:16.400 --> 28:26.400
I wish to ask you this question, which is also asked to the other friends responsible that have been on the charge before the committee.

28:26.400 --> 28:40.400
Do you think that the charge made against you and may Smith or Mr. Cohn on the Matthews these individuals?

28:40.400 --> 28:45.400
That the Army charge is a statement to Mr. Allen charges against you.

28:45.400 --> 28:56.400
So you use the investigating arm of the Senate to gain perfect statements for private signs, it's too or false.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.400
False.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.400
And it's not a desire.

29:02.400 --> 29:14.400
So all the Senate McCarthy, as I understand from your letter of December 22nd, the first two sentences, which I will post,

29:14.400 --> 29:17.400
would you wait a minute until I get that letter or deal?

29:17.400 --> 29:19.400
Okay, I have a number twenty seconds.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.400
I have a number.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.400
Top of the first paragraph.

29:21.400 --> 29:30.400
You say, uh, I have heard rumors to the effect that some members of my staff are intervening with your department behalf of a former staff.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.400
That's consultant David Shines.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.400
This, of course, they never write to do as individuals.

29:36.400 --> 29:49.400
Now, as I understand it, your position is that anything they wanted to do as individuals was fine that they had no right to represent the committee in this matter.

29:49.400 --> 29:54.400
And I believe also you stated our to represent yourself as senator.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.400
Yes, they're for a point of this way.

29:56.400 --> 30:03.400
I feel they do not move any of their rights, so the president will become the member of the staff in my committee.

30:03.400 --> 30:20.400
Well, I think we can agree that it's perfectly proper for a senator or congressman to ask a department of the army, the Navy, or the Air Force to consider the application of any qualified individual for a commission.

30:20.400 --> 30:26.400
I think, uh, certainly, uh, a senator or congressman shouldn't have any right-lefts in the citizen.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.400
I think we can agree on that.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.400
Great.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.400
Now.
