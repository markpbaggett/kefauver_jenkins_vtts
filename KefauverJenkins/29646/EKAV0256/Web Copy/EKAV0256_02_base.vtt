WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
We won't strike that, some wreck will just correct the wreck.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
That's point.

00:08.000 --> 00:17.000
Now as I understand it, you stated yesterday on page 6219 of the records.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't know if I can say that.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
I can give it to you very briefly in some sense, and if you want to refer to it by.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
That's a sign came in only as an unpaid consultant, and it is paid his own expense.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Now that is correct.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
And I believe you also stated today page 62, may I say Mr Jackson,

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
but as far as I know, we've paid no expenses for Mr. Shine.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
It's possible that we may have paid some secretary or some secretary of health,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
but I are point calls, but I don't know of any.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
And then today I believe you confirmed that on page 62191 of the records this morning.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
You say, would you wait until I get the record?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Do we have that?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh, okay, 100.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
You say that down along the middle of the page, referring to Shine,

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
he was very patient doing that work all day doing it.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
He paid his own long distance phone call when he called witnesses.

01:25.000 --> 01:41.000
Now, I have just seen the telephone record of the committee for the period running from 10 July to 29 July.

01:41.000 --> 01:54.000
I noticed that there are 13 calls on May day between Mr. Shine and Mr. Cohn

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
to General Reaver or to assistant in his office.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
And all of the two of these calls were charged to committee.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
Mr. Jackson, just so the record will be straight, you will find any number of times,

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
for example, that I may take a plane trip or coming up from Stathman,

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
and the committee gets the ticket at the end of the month to Stathman's at Austin Bill,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
people for the calls.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Now, whether or not they're trying to hit these calls, I don't know.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, let me point out to the court.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
These calls were in connection with...

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
We have to ask just Ruth Young whether or not the end of the month he was billed for those calls.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
I think it's very important because not the question the calls itself,

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
but whether he was calling, and Mr. Cohn was calling,

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
and a representative or committee capacity, why would he call from New York,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
where I assume he has pretty good credit at his home,

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
why would he call from New York to the Pentagon and then charge the call to the committee on the Hill?

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
All of the committee staff, as far as I know, has telephone credit cards and so on.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
And they can use those, as far as I know, as much as the attendees I...

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I just want to take a little thought.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
This is a detail that Ruth over here would have to testify on.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
As far as I know, they have paid for all the calls he made,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
now it's as possible that...

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
So, why should he...

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I assume he's calling from his own home.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
The same number here is Murray Hill 8-01-17.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Is that Mr. Shine on telephone number?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I wouldn't know, I can find out for a minute.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
But what I'm trying to get at, I can see that if he drops someplace away from his home town,

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
but why would he call from his home area, call the Pentagon,

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
and charge the telephone call to the committee if he was acting in an individual capacity?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I wouldn't have any idea.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
This is in connection with his own application, which we all agree had a perfect right to do.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
We know this few to about that.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
But I think it's quite significant that he would charge these phone calls,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
and Mr. Cohn did the same.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
All but two out of the 13 were charged to the committee,

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
and calling from New York, where they had their own telephone accounts and their own residence.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
Mr. Jackson, if we want to start figuring out the accounts between Dave and the committee,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
we'd have a tremendous bill to play.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I hope we don't have to do that.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
I'm not a swear book over the daughter.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
As far as I know, all I can tell you is something.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
As far as I know, he paid all of his expenses now.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
It's entirely possible.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
That some expenses were paid by the committee.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I know that.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
As you know, any committee member including yourself is entitled,

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
I believe it's the total of nine dollars a day when you're out of town.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I'm sure the day is in a bill.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I'm sure he never put in a bill of that kind.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I think that all of the funders might at least have hope so.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I'll put in their bill, and that doesn't come anywhere in New York covering.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
As you know, some of the Jackson, when you come out,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
let's say you move over to Boston for an investigation.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
All you're allowed is nine dollars.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
That doesn't come anywhere in New York covering your expenses of your hotel room,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
your taxi fare, your food.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't think there's any dispute about that.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
The point I'm getting at, Senator McCarthy, is not so much the dollars and cents.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
The question is that when they call for charge for the committee,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
isn't he in the fact?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Isn't that evidence?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Forgetting the dollars and cents.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I haven't mentioned how much the calls are.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
That's not the point with me.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
The point seems to me, isn't when he charged these calls to the committee.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
When both Mr. Cohn and Mr. Shine call them the committee,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
isn't that clear evidence that they were acting in a committee capacity,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
otherwise why would they charge the calls to the committee when they're calling

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
from their home base in New York to watch them DC?

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
So Senator Jackson, I just like going over this over and over,

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
but Secretary Stevens, Bob Adams, I mean, John Adams,

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
everyone here knew that as far as the committee was concerned,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
no one had any right to think for the committee,

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
and so far as they had commissionals concerned.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
And I think I'm going to clear, I think he was perfectly with any still on the right

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
to try and get a commission.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm not just feeling that part.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm just pointing out that as far as these individuals are concerned,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Mr. Cohn, am I right?

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
The group is announced to the benefit of some of the congressmen

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
who are our guest today that he charged an answer just kind of word

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
you're having a role co-host in the House.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
And I thought to the whole House member,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
I think that could have been good if they could have known that in the court.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Thank you, Senator.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
I wonder if you could, I know you can't do it today,

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
but can you check and see whether or not the day is the end of the month,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
days of those calls or not?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I don't think it's any great importance.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
I think the, just for the members, I think $6,000 times that,

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
at any point pursuing any further at this time,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I don't think I can make a clear conversation.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
But the record may not speak for itself.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Take for example, a conversation takes a trouble.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And after the committee will rain for it,

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
give it a non-committee business unit that builds for that purpose.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
I have never made such arrangements.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
The point I'm making is Senator McCarthy.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
The situation here is so different.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Here is the case, the Mr. Shine and Mr. Kong,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
who have their own home telephones and office numbers in New York.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Why would they charge it to the committee down in Washington DC?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
When I call him out, I think we've gone into that.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
And why he is, why would he use the credit card?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I don't know.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Well, it wasn't a case of using credit card.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
I think it would have to be the charge of the committee.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, I think we don't want to call an expense in the telephone company,

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
but if you have a telephone account in your phone area

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
and you're calling from another area,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
you can call another telephone number in that thing.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
City and Shriks did that account.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I don't think there's anything quite so far.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
There are things that are there.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
If the charge goes to the office,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
the five-time concern is perfectly alright,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
because he worked completely free.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Work-long hours today from London to full the committee.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And if he charged one of his controls,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
the committee and did not pay for them,

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I know that...

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Well, Mr. Kong and Mr. Shine both charged these for the committee,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
which I think would be evidence that they were acting in a committee capacity

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
in calling General Reaver.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
A lot.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I wouldn't have to get a point.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Now, I think you've testified to senators

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
that Mr. Shine had spent considerable time,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
and if I'm wrong, and if you'd correct me,

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
dealing with problems with psychological warfare...

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
That is correct.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
What does that have done in experience in its field?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Well, education and background experience.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I just felt that when he told me that he's made a study of that for years,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I've done his biology calculations.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
But it's been more or less his hobby,

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
this question of how we can win the war against communism

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
without using blood.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
How we might be able to win it by means of information

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and therefore stabilize...

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
He was never employed in any such capacity or in business.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
You know, he did submit, I understand.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
He told me he submitted a plan

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
to, I believe, the information bureau

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
or someone planned to be drafted himself.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
So who did submit that plan?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
He's going to plan the State Department of Royce

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
as we have a copy of that here in case you'd like to see it.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Should we have a copy of it?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I have a copy of it.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
May I say I have not read the plan in detail myself,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
at least not recently.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Senator Dexon and Senator Royce are necessarily absent this afternoon.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
So Senator Dexon, do you have an extendment?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Senator McCartney, you testified to do not

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
that you first met G. David Chine about the time he came with it committee.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
That's correct.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
It was about that time.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
And you said Mr. Roy Cohen introduced you to him.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Right, that's correct.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
I thought he was employed by the self-committee as an unpaid consultant

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
around February 1, 1953.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
That writer was around on this.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Former died Roy Cohen, recommended he be employed by the self-committee.

11:57.000 --> 12:06.000
Senator Timings, am I employed him on the recommendation of Mr. Cohen?

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
I called various funds of mine, his name's not rather not mentioned today in Athens,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
but they thought about him, but before he was employed,

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
or at the time he was employed, I asked the FBI for the usual FBI name,

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
and I said, I mean, did you examine his qualifications before you employed him on the self-committee staff?

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I discussed his background with him.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
By examining his qualifications, I'm not sure if I'm not too mean.

12:40.000 --> 12:49.000
I knew that he was a graduate of the college that the...

12:50.000 --> 12:59.000
He was president of a large hotel corporation.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
I knew that he had been interested in the information's program.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
And frankly, that is what interested me mostly,

13:08.000 --> 13:18.000
because we hadn't been receiving so many complaints and some serious comments from about what they considered weight in compliance.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
I mean, the documentation in this information program, I recall,

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
I think the day that I first saw him, he had an article which was entitled,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
is this the voice of America, is the voice of Moscow,

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
and he convinced me that he had a good background knowledge.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
In fact, better than any man I've met, of the information program.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Did he tell you that he'd had any experience as an investigator before he came with the committee?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
He had no experience with most good.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
I am correct, am I not, that you said he had not served in the FBI, right?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
He had not.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
Have you ever worked for any local police force or, in any way, as an investigator for time?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I don't think so.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Is he a lawyer?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
No.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I think you've already answered the next question.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
You graduated from Harvard University around 1949 or 1950, is that right?

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Well, I can second the data, that's the first thing.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I wasn't all the day, he graduated.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
I didn't see any public to pamper entitled, definition of communism, distributed by the Cheyenne Hotel.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And not correct?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
No, it's correct.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I think, let me check on this.

14:53.000 --> 15:01.000
I just thank you for my income, so you don't mean that was distributed by Naval Intelligence also.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Is this a little six-page pamphlet?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
I'm putting a document I have here.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
This is from here in the wagon.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
And please participate in the next question.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
You're going to point out three errors with New York post-planet, phone, and this.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I get that answer, but...

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
That makes the state and this.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
No, will.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
May I say that you may be a good profit sometimes, but you weren't that time.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Does that make it okay?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Do you know whether he had any help in preparing that pamphlet?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
I wouldn't know.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Well, any point is, apparently, we're not going to call him.

15:47.000 --> 16:01.000
But you find out for the record who, if anybody, helped him prepare the six-page pamphlet.

16:02.000 --> 16:10.000
Do you know what, before he came to the subcommittee, he published anything else on the subject of Communism?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Nothing, and I know.

16:14.000 --> 16:21.000
But would you also find out for the committee how many of many books are pamphlet, the articles he's published on Communism or any other subject?

16:21.000 --> 16:30.000
I will, but I think I can answer that now, son, for I don't think he published any books on Communism other than what you have before you.

16:30.000 --> 16:38.000
However, I do know that he has a grasp of a plan for psychological warfare,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
it's a matter of that, to the state department.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
I'm not either endorsing or otherwise.

16:45.000 --> 16:55.000
He was spending a great deal of time before he came to the committee, before he had any thought of coming to the committee,

16:55.000 --> 17:09.000
studying the question of the use of information to win a war rather than to win it with a broadened blow.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
Senator McCartney, do you have applicants coming to you for jobs for the subcommittee as investigators?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Yes.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
Do you ask the FBI to recommend investigators for the subcommittee?

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I don't think I've ever asked the FBI to recommend anyone.

17:26.000 --> 17:36.000
We asked for a name sector over and anyone that we decide might be qualified to work for the subcommittee.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
What is this assigned experience and qualification?

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Make use of it as an investigator and preference to other applicants?

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Two things, number one, that our phones are very limited.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
He was willing to work for nothing, number two.

17:50.000 --> 18:00.000
I felt that he knew more about the information programs than any other young man I had met.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
He didn't employ him, just because he was willing to work for nothing.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I give you the truth.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
Did they demand in the same tower that other investigators would see, would you still have them deployed him?

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
I think I would.

18:17.000 --> 18:27.000
Now that I asked again, Senator, when did Mr. Cohn tell you that Mr. Shine was eligible for the draft?

18:27.000 --> 18:37.000
I couldn't give you the date I believe sometime in July, I think the question came up, I might have been tuned.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
You testified, did you not?

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, the efforts made by Mr. Shine to get a direct commission with the assistant to Mr. Cohn.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
I have testified about Mr. Shine's application for submission yet.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
When did Mr. Shine tell you that he had been unable to obtain a direct commission?

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Some of them are frankly don't know.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
If you tried to find out, put in the right kind of chair convenient, or if you just knew I couldn't,

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
because there's no official importance with the blinger in my mind.

19:15.000 --> 19:23.000
When the question of the New York assignment came up, who first wrote it up with you?

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
Inside the New York assignment of five of Shine.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
I'm not sure if I know what you mean by the New York assignment.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
I didn't think that he would go to New York for the first part of his induction.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
The only in the temporary duty, that is right.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Where's the committee?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
That is right.

19:41.000 --> 19:58.000
Mr. Cohn, the intercoals, we are talking in the office and suggested that the involved even had discussed further enough with the wires to have day spent a couple of weeks cleaning up his work.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Originally I made no objections.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
A couple of days later after thinking it over, I decided that was unwise.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
And told Mr. Cohn how much of Shine.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Mr. Cohn, there are plenty of guests to use.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Is there a good idea?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Mr. Shine, to be assigned to the New York area?

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
No.

20:22.000 --> 20:31.000
Senator McCullough, you testify that on September 16th, you told Mr. Cohn that he should give no preferential treatment to five of Shine.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
So that's the 16th or 13th?

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Well, if I had to say, if I made a mistake.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
You're referring to the one-time in the... or the breakfast in the... in the sign of Marklin?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, if I made a mistake, I think.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Correct.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
Roy, so that was the 16th, I thought it was the 13th.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
That was your testimony, wasn't it?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
No, that was correct.

20:53.000 --> 21:01.000
Did Roy Cohn tell you that you had been discussing an military career of private Shine with the Secretary of the Army?

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
At that time.

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
I knew that he had discussed with Mr. Adams.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
I didn't know that he had discussed with Mr. Cohn throughout.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Did he make any sense?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
We said he had to get it out of hand.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
We said it directly.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
In the 16th of September, I'm not sure if he had discussed with John Adams.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I frankly don't know.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
I think the answer...

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
That matter was not of sufficient importance, but the day the nice, fancy level of a certain month has much meaning to make.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
Before the next set of questions are asked, and why we have our time.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I have to leave when the maintenance is done.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Right, but I want to do it.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
And now, I have to leave this time in order to get the plan.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
Right, good. See you Monday, Monday, 10th.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
If you call, you have 10 minutes.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
If there was questions, you can try to ask.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
You're a client.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I said, Mr. Jim, you bet.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Mr. Welch, or Mr. Jimler?

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Mr. Jim, I'd like to rest my first remarks.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
The U.S. I made.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
So, can I first...

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Can I first...

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I'm sorry, I'm in the center.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I mentioned John Adams.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I don't...

22:24.000 --> 22:34.000
We're talking about the fact that 16th of September, I don't believe that John Adams, at that time, was with the military.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
So, therefore, there could have been no discussion with Mr. Adams.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
I'm not sure I think Adams came with the military later.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Pardon me, Mr. Welch.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Very well, Mr. Welch.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Thank you, Mr. Jimler.

22:48.000 --> 22:58.000
Mr. Chairman, I was going to say a word to you if I could, and along the line that I discussed with you, five years before we decided to hear you.

22:58.000 --> 23:06.000
It's always a little dangerous for me to say on Friday, so that makes us forget the Boston, because that creates a certain amount of interest to that end of the line.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
There is a debt on the news.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Interest, I would just like to create a possible.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
I wish I could think of a way of getting word to my dentist.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
No communist, by the way.

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
That a part of one of my teeth fell off in the automobile field today, one of my ancient rear ones.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
And that makes me somewhat anxious to get to Boston too.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
I hope we get to hear you in the early days each time.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Three of our colleagues have to be absent.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
And certainly, I have also, we are watching the sub of Michulie, so I'm trying to say it.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
So that might say a thousand days.

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
I would like to have that I have said to you that I thought by Monday, I could have a sort of an outline for what I think will be quite a short.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
And I hope, and orderly, and economical across the examination of this with us.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
In due of what I have said about this afternoon, it could even be that I would take less than all of my time,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
if it's the way that comes back to me again.

24:07.000 --> 24:14.000
Again, it might be the case with a smaller committee, but without, of course, waving the right to ask some things later.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
I have one or two questions that I can ask senators that are pretty much formal.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
In the first place you haven't had the chance to, nobody has asked you this question.

24:27.000 --> 24:35.000
And I would like to ask you now, as of this moment, is there anything in your testimony that you would like to change?

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Nothing that I can think of often.

24:38.000 --> 24:48.000
I think if you reviewed yesterday's testimony last night, or as Mr. Corn reviewed it, you don't think anyone even read it?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
I don't know.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
Well, in any event, your confidence in it is that you are quite clear, you wish to make no changes.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
I have no changes of the time that it's our imagination.

24:59.000 --> 25:08.000
There's a phrase that is drifted in and out of the room that is not important,

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
but you constantly speak of making a name check on someone.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Would you be good enough to tell me what that means?

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
You wrote the office if you fully understood it and everybody else should and I just don't.

25:22.000 --> 25:38.000
Well, if we hire anyone on the committee, Mr. Wells, let's close it for the Committee of Pastor Resolution asking for a full-field investigation of all of the committee employees.

25:39.000 --> 25:46.000
The FBI has taken it up to the Attorney General, so of course, it's the boss of the FBI.

25:46.000 --> 25:57.000
And up to this time, I don't believe they have decided to put their own position to conduct a full-field investigation of all investigators.

25:57.000 --> 26:04.000
However, I will link to do what is known as a name check.

26:04.000 --> 26:13.000
They check to the file to see if there are not there's any derogatory information in the file at that time.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
That's what's known as a name check.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
Also, we occasionally make a name check with the Health on American Activities Committee.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
They have an excellent file.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
They have them complete with cooperatives.

26:29.000 --> 26:46.000
So, if we want to make a name check if the situation which we cannot get us in the FBI, we refer it to the Health on American Activities Committee and ask them to give us all the information which they have about that particular individual in their file.

26:46.000 --> 27:00.000
The thing that came to my attention in the moment, I make it clear that we don't get a name check from the FBI on individuals under investigation.

27:00.000 --> 27:12.000
We get the name check from the FBI only on people whom we have proposed the higher-res investigators or staff workers.

27:12.000 --> 27:23.000
So, when I refer to a name check on investigation, I refer to a name check to our own files to the un-American Activities Committee files.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I think that pretty much covers it.

27:26.000 --> 27:34.000
Well, I'm not sure that you have enlightened me too much because of what you have at the end and I'll get there I think in the moment.

27:34.000 --> 27:45.000
I take it when you hire an investigator, you do want the most thorough investigation of him before you take him on, do you know?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
That is right.

27:47.000 --> 27:59.000
I'm not suggesting by the reason that mold is to mean that somebody wrong or rotten apple on your back.

27:59.000 --> 28:06.000
And please believe me that sir when I say that, but that would be an ever-fitting thing to have that, wouldn't it?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
You say it would be a devastating thing, right?

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Never want to have a subversive on your own self.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
That would make extremely bad.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
And the consequence is I take it that you exercise the extreme care in those cases.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
All right, I do.

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
And that extreme care is not accomplished by what you call a name check, is it?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
The ordinary name check.

28:28.000 --> 28:37.000
I get the background of an individual as far as I can find out who he is, what he's been doing.

28:37.000 --> 28:54.000
Well, in the way that we ask the FBI to give us a name check, we have been asking the Bureau of the FBI for a full-field investigation and accordance with the resolution passed by I think some of her months made the motion and we should have a full-field investigation we all agreed.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Maybe to some of her guys.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
We all agreed that would be wise.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
However, up to this time they haven't told you have they went.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
The Attorney General has not yet notified us, as well they're not.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
They can give us a full-field investigation.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Now I hope I'm not using a term that is.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
People don't understand my full-field investigation.

29:18.000 --> 29:26.000
I mean an investigation friend and the assigned investigators to Glob.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Glob's real man's background is previous life.

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
Interviews his neighbors, his business associates, and an issue report on that.

29:35.000 --> 29:45.000
The name check really means that they go through the files, the people that are not, they have in their files as of that moment.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Anything of a derogatory nature.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
Well, let's take a sample where I think you have testified. There was a name check.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Let's take Colonel Ringmer, if you recall.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yes.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Now, guess what?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
It was the name check.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
What consequences the name check that was done on him.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
We checked our files, we checked with the file.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Wait a moment, that's not right. You check your file.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Yes.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
Now that means I take it that you have a large alphabetically arranged name of people.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Is that right?

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I don't know how large it is.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
I very seldom get down in the file room. I don't think I've done the file room.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
I think I've filed.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Well, in any event that's where you start.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
And you take what I would suppose to be an alphabetical list of names.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
And take Ringmer, you find his name or you don't find it.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
And if you find it, then that takes you to a file.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
And you see what's in it. It's that right. That's the first thing.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
I believe that's their filing system. I don't know if that's the file first.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Yes. I'm not a senator. I'm not the deputy.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
We either do well often, or just what the filing system is.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
But the first step is to call your own office, meaning the office of this committee.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
Ask them to look in their alphabetical list and see if you got it.

31:05.000 --> 31:12.000
You know, that is the first step I would tell either Roy Cohn or Frank Carrick to make an amtrak on Mr. X. Mr. Y.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
They would do the job.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
They would do it. Now, do you know what they do then?

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
I assume they would check our file with the information.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Then the senator committee?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Then follow the House of the American Activities Committee.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Is that what I would call the senator committee?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
That's the deli committee.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
And perhaps all the dinner committee also.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
I may say the concern of Mr. Ringler, the amtrak,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Ringler was completely negative.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
There's nothing of a drug or a nature found in any file of Mr. Ringler.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Yes.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
But from some sources, it turned out something about him.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
This is what he didn't like, is that right?

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
We heard it was reported to me that he had been condemning the exposure of terminus,

31:56.000 --> 32:03.000
which I can't certify the truth of that, that he struck in a third hand.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
Because of that, I said one of the amtrak on him,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
he said anything we know about this matter.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
Well, then if I went down to your file now,

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
and looked on the card that says R or Ringler,

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
it is the nationals, I would now find that there, is that right?

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
No, these files were completely negative in the first ring.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
No, but now do we know?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Now it will be in your file, so that now,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I wouldn't know.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Well, that is an item of information about him, if I'm interested.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I can't tell you what's in the file, if I'm not.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Is there a teller?

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
I don't, I don't suggest to check with these files first.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
I have, as you know, a sweet committee of the ten Germans.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
This was one, I leave it up to my chief counsel, my chiefs,

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
to ask him to handle the work, they bring me the hem product.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
What would you love to have a出來?
