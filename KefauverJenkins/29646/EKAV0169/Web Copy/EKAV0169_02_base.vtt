00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
I guess the McCarthy staff, the width of the staff, used improper methods in attempting

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
to secure preferential treatment for the C-day in silence.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Now you say there was no conversation with respect to Shion on the 19th of October.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Is that correct, Miss Adam?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
As far as you can remember...

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
I had three telephone calls with Miss Cohn on the 19th.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
So my office diary indicated.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
At this moment I recall none of them were quick or directed towards Shion.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
They were, I think, to respect the matter, unrelated to Shion or any alleged attempts to secure preferences for Shion.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
That's correct.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I recall.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Now, on the 20th, did or not, she go to force Monmouth.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
In the company with the C-day?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I did, sir.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Who initiated that shift of October 20th to force Monmouth?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
It's Steven.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
It indicated sometime earlier that he wanted to go to force Monmouth.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
And during the latter part of the week, I think after I got back on the 17th, Saturdays of 17th,

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
although it might have been as a result of telephone conversations that I had with him to and from New York,

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
he indicated that he wanted to go up to force Monmouth.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Did he invite anyone to go along with you and him and if so, who did he invite?

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
Yes, he invited Senator McCarthy, Mr. Cohn and such other members of the staff as might wish to accompany us.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
And who did you choose?

01:29.000 --> 01:38.000
Senator McCarthy, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Rainbow and Assistant to Senator Erickson, Mr. Jones, and...

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
We had identified Mr. Jones.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
And Assistant to Senator Potter.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
A member of Senator Potter's office staff, Colonel Ballou from A to the Secretary.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Maybe then, I'll back to take the signal off of this.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
I think that's all I remember.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Now, there may have been a member of the...

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I may have been the name of Mr. Codd, but it's not his old.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I don't recall what he did.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
Mr. Adam, I will ask you to tell the committee whether or not any unforeseen incidents occurred at Fort Monmouth.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Have a nice day.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I'll make sure.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I'll go back a moment.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Sir, you asked me if there was any conversation at all related to Cheyenne on the 19th.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
There was.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
It was not related in so far as I can remember to preferential treatment of Cheyenne.

02:35.000 --> 02:48.000
But on the 19th, when we were discussing the drift of Fort Monmouth, Mr. Cohn first indicated that he might go back to New York and was inquiring as to whether or not there was a means by which we could arrange transportation for him to come to Fort Monmouth.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm really speculated on that.

02:51.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm not sure that we reached any decision, but he indicated at that time that if he'd been this golden in New York, probably he would be attempting to Fort Monmouth by Cheyenne from New York.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
That does not come off.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And as I say, I think it would only be in the realm of speculation.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
So on the 19th, the name Diffian was done.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
To the extent you have just been paid, accurately, etc.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
Now my last question, Mr. Adams, was whether or not any un-tored incident occurred on October 20th at Fort Monmouth of an unusual nature.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yes, sir.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
When we arrived at Fort Monmouth, we were given badges.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Red badges, you know, even secrets and yellow badges and gemogenoting confidential.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Those of us who were officials of the Army were given the red badges.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
The others were given yellow badges.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
We had been met there by Senator Smith of New Jersey and Congressman Hawkins Law of New Jersey.

03:48.000 --> 03:57.000
And those two officials together were Senator Parker and Senator McCarthy and members of his staff were given the confidential yellow badges.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Shortly after we arrived, we made a tour of Fort Monmouth.

04:02.000 --> 04:15.000
And again, our general law firm stopped the party in front of the seat of the laboratory to take the party in to see the new piece of development.

04:15.000 --> 04:24.000
When we got ready to go in, it was pointed out that only the individual was wearing the red badges would be entitled in it.

04:25.000 --> 04:34.000
And Mr. Stevens and Fireless now they've come about and there was a discussion of security and Mr. Stevens said that he would take it as a negative decision right then,

04:34.000 --> 04:50.000
they would be in the electric officials to see that the equipment had the effect of course that excluded the other individuals who had the yellow badges, the confidential badges, because this was a secret building.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
And that excluded Mr. Jones, Mr. Rainbow, Mr. Cohn.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, who was it, maybe?

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Well, the secretary just sent him a copy with him and he just sent his message with him.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
He just passed the office and also passed with him.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And of course, Mr. Bolo was a Colonel Bolo and I were inside the landers.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
What did you enter?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I walked in the building for a moment.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
I don't think immediately, but I didn't say it because I knew that Mr. Cohn had become very upset.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Well, did Mr. Cohn enter or not?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
No, he was not in the cabinet.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
How did you know that Mr. Cohn had become very upset?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Well, I was pissed when he got angry.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
The saddened I want you to tell in detail what occurred there with respect to Mr. Cohn.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Well, he became extremely upset when at the dollar said he would be excluded.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
What did he say?

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
And he paced up and down in front of the building for a while.

05:43.000 --> 05:52.000
And I was not in his presence during the entire 15 or 25 minutes because I walked into the building once to see.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Now, quickly they were coming out, came back out again.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
And...

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
Did or not you realize when you entered the building that left Mr. Cohn that he was upset that he was very upset?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Colonel Ballou had lost him, but he had come out also.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Lieutenant Cohn, who was in a Lawton Bade, had not gone in.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
And in the three of us were between us attempting to play case, Mr. Cohn.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
That was right to you, he and I.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
That's right. I was in the cabinet.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
The saddened I was just to pin points at the point of inquiry.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
I want you to tell the committee what you were told by those who were present with Mr. Cohn.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Well, I was said...

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Who were available with Mr. Cohn?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Mr. Cohn said and did as that happen.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Well, he said many things in front of me. I don't need to replace what.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Well, first, what he said is from the views.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, he said, this is war and we'll really investigate this place now.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Because they let the community in and keep me out.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I've got two different clearance. I can go any place in the world.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I've got security clearance. I've got any place in the world.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
I made a number of extreme remarks about that for it during the course of conversations.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
You did not say anything about whether or not he had access to FBI files?

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
He did not say that in my presence. He said it in the presence of others and it was retouched.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Have you now related all that you said in your presence?

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
No, he said other things. He came up to me on touristy occasions.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
He just had no run of those kind of things. He was in the effective bringing his hands.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Oh, getting his arm out of that room in New York. I can't stay here. This is awful.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
I said, I had indicated that he's been humiliated and deliberate.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
And remarks of that sort which were indicated considerable distress and considerable anger.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
And this continued throughout the period of 15 or 20 minutes while the Secretary and party were in one building.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Making him out of that building was about no four months.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
Yes, sir. They came out of that building and walked across the road to another area,

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
which was similarly restricted and into which people without the proper badges had not entered.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
And Mr. Tone continues to face him and his remarks from the getting discussed.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Well, just talk where he's remarks. Those that I have to tell him.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Same remarks you mean.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
That sort of thing which has been done with humiliating young guys.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
This is warring. They look coming at him here like I can't get in and that sort of thing.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Very well.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
Now I ask you, Mr. Adams, to relate to the committee.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
The information that you received from those who were present with Mr. Kone while you were out of his presence.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
And particularly with respect to what he says.

08:37.000 --> 08:46.000
Well, the only two significant things other than the remarks that I have recounted is that he reinstated in the presence of Donald Balloon.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
That he had access to FBI files.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
And Donald Balloon, the gentleman sitting behind you and an aide to the secretary.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Yes, sir.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Very well.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
How about that?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
And he stated in the presence of a man named Sullivan, who is employee of the post.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And who is available as a witness?

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
He is now in town that I'm sure he's available as a witness.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
He did talk later. Something to the effectiveness of the Declaration of War.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
And most of the remarks that he made in my presence, he made also in the presence of Donald Balloon.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
We were together most of the time with Mr. Kone.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
That's not all the time. There was some paving up and down in front of this small building.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
You know whether or not there was a man named Flattery or a slavery express.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I said Sullivan, I am that Flattery.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
He meant Flattery.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
This Flattery.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Very well.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Now I'm picking up from there, Mr. Adams.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
What inspired the media to buy an answer and particularly during the lunch hour?

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
Well, the luncheon was set up by Denver Lawton in a small temporary building.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
He had box lunches set up so that they had to be brought over from someplace else.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
That we're not in the building in between this.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And he had his staff present.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
The staff included probably 2015 or 20 officers.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
And in addition, there were presents that two or three officers from the intelligence section of first Army

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
and the decadence or the chief of staff of headquarters first Army.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Whose name I forget is General Officer.

10:26.000 --> 10:36.000
And we went into the room together for the box lunches around the temporary cable members, which was set up.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
During the previous day, there had been prepared a draft especially.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
But it had been prepared by me.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
What was the purpose of that?

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
The purpose of the tragedy was we had prepared it.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
I have prepared it with the thought that Senator McCarty might really visit his work month.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
I have not prepared it with the knowledge of the Secretary of the Army.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
And in order to give you the purpose, I have just stepped back a few days to October 13th and October 14th.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
On both of those days, Senator McCarty stayed in this seat.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
And that he felt that the subcommittee had largely completed its investigation for a month.

11:23.000 --> 11:35.000
And that he was about ready to turn the facts, the transcripts, and the information over the Army and to let the Army pursue the matter from last.

11:35.000 --> 11:44.000
I had no indication during the balance of the week after Mr. Steven Fletz, 15th and 16th, that there was any change in this plan

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
for Senator McCarty's four in this investigation for Senator McCarty.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Consequently, on the 19th of February, it seemed to me proper.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
It was on the 19th of October.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
You not hear me, Senator?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Can you hear me?

11:59.000 --> 12:09.000
On the 19th of October, I prepared a press release, one to which we have previously testified.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
I prepared it in that form because I had been made aware of the facts.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.000
That hearing, we're going to continue for a day or so in New York, and in Fort Monmouth.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And a day or so subsequent to that in New York.

12:25.000 --> 12:33.000
And this press release was designed to be something which would be discussed or offered to the Secretary to the Senator,

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
and it was just a thought that he might issue it, why he would ask Fort Monmouth on the 20th.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.000
When we were in the airplane, some relations in it were suggested by the Senator.

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
When we got to Fort Monmouth, it was semiographed as I recall.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
At the request of Colonel Blue, marched up in the form that it was been agreed to.

12:58.000 --> 13:06.000
And I think that is semiographed properly with Mr. Cohn, an office to me for identification when I was a damon on that matter as he did.

13:06.000 --> 13:15.000
So, when we went to lunch on the 20th, I sat on one side of Mr. Cohn and Colonel Blue sat on the other side of it.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
Our purpose was to continue our efforts to stay here.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
He made it quite clear to me that there would be no press release that day.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
And he made it also clear that he was as a result of the incident which had occurred just a few moments previously as the Chief of Lancetore.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Maybe you're not still in the sense Mr. Adams is that what you mean?

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
And he wasn't angry anymore, but in this case he was determined.

13:38.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, sometimes during the course of the lunch in Sendemokai, he left the dining room for a moment and just Cohn followed him.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
I had a feeling that this would be the time that the rest of the week would be killed and I saw it more so.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
They were together a couple of minutes before I was there.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, in short, we understand he went to the main room, is that right?

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Very well, I'll go ahead Mr. Adams.

14:04.000 --> 14:13.000
They were together for a few moments before I arrived and Senator MacCaise told me as we were returning to the dining room.

14:13.000 --> 14:22.000
He didn't feel that he had released that press release that day and he stated that it was because he felt that it was an indicator.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
There was a deal with the Army and they were calling off a investigation and it was not the group.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And that ended the press release.

14:33.000 --> 14:45.000
And by going back to where Mr. Adams, at the time you have told about what Mr. Cohn said his remarks when he was not as made into this secret laboratory.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Was there not that there a young lieutenant president named Cohn?

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
Yes, there was a kind of scores, which we really ate again a lot was present during much of the time.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
Did Cohn make a remarks to you as Mr. Cohn has just allegedly made the remarks you have detailed?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Yes, what was that remarks?

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
Cohn's distress caused me in turn to be the stress and the core approached me out of Cohn here,

15:10.000 --> 15:17.000
even said he didn't understand why I got up to upset about a matter of this sort because the...

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
He said this man is an employee of the Senate, he is not a senator.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
And he didn't see why I should be upset about that.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
And I responded that I had found out.

15:30.000 --> 15:37.000
All right, that Cohn has the capacity to control what happened to the committee.

15:37.000 --> 15:45.000
And that he had the capacity to stretch hearing done internally or to turn off as he chose to have that I was not happy about having come hanging with.

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
Had or not, you come to that conclusion that Cohn has been reinstated the Senate core of the Senate.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I have been reinstated the Senate core of the Senate.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
That's correct.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Very well.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Now going back to the luncheon, Mr. Adams,

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
I'd like to ask you whether or not the Secretary made any statements on that occasion.

16:02.000 --> 16:09.000
I made Mr. Stevens aware of how agitated Cohn was and blue, except for the current blue statement

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
to where his agitated Cohn was and at the conclusion of the luncheon,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
seated around the large table, similar to one, sitting down on the seat around.

16:18.000 --> 16:28.000
Mr. Stevens made a very consideratory remark, which were in design to make Mr. Cohn feel good.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Do you recall what he said?

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
Well, he said something to the effect that he had made a decision on the third moment to take these elected officials in.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
Perhaps it was not a proper decision if it had offended Mr. Cohn.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
He was sorry and that he had not intended to do anything in that story.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
And I thought it was extremely gracious form of apologies, which he made from the greatest round of about 25.

16:54.000 --> 17:03.000
Would you regard it as an apologies made by the Secretary in the presence of those approximately 25 people present?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I think.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Did or not that statement to Cohn?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
It seems to be substantial.

17:09.000 --> 17:21.000
Are there any other incidents of October 20th, Mr. Adams, as you think, are relevant to the issues of this controversy?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
None of that at all.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
When was your next contact either by telephone or in person with the McCarthy Investigating Committee?

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
I had numerous telephone conversations regularly during this period.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
Well, the next one, the next one, in chronological order if you can possibly give.

17:41.000 --> 17:50.000
And you may refer to your notes, sir, Mr. Adams, for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of these those exact.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
While Mr. Adams is looking up his notes, this gives us an opportunity to submit our stations to identify themselves.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
This is ABC Television Network.

17:59.000 --> 18:09.000
State line Detroit, Nash Lowes, Prices, Rock America, on ambassadors, basements, metro persons, the swing now is to Nash.

18:09.000 --> 18:18.000
And here's the big-sized farm shell, a famous Nash-rembleer family sedan, tax-free delivery shows for only $1,550 at your Nash dealers now.

18:18.000 --> 18:27.000
Mountain House Patel, because for likely persons, all the parties are the cardinotation that your guests represent without feelings.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
Give her telephone call two or three days.

18:32.000 --> 18:43.000
I can't say every day there was two or three, but I was in telephone contact quite regularly with Mr. Cohn, who spent most of the time in New York, and with Mr. Carr, who spent most of the time in Washington.

18:43.000 --> 18:50.000
You mean now, since we're dropped over 20, is that a correction? Do you mean beginning the day after October 20th, is this that?

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
Well, on October 21st, there's no indication in my office diary that I...

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
Mr. Jenkins is asking about his next contact, and I suppose to be an October 20th, with the committee.

19:07.000 --> 19:19.000
What I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Jenkins, is that between October 20th and November 1st, I had numerous conversations I cannot precisely say on which of these conversations.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
The subject of Mr. Shine and his treatment was discussed, but it was discussed during that period.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
We are now just discussing a 10-day session.

19:29.000 --> 19:42.000
I will ask you, Mr. Adams, how many telephone conversations you have during that 10-day session, with any members of the McCarthy Investigating Committee?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
I have encounters there.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Can you do so now? I don't think I could do so accurately for that.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Well, can you give us an approximate idea of how many?

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Well, I would have asked for a wrong if I did.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
Did I understand you to say, sometimes, two or three days?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
If you would like to stay there, I'll do a bit.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
On October 21, there was a telephone call to Mr. Buckley.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
I was sending the McCarthy spam. Some Mr. Buckley.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
22 October, indications of a telephone call from Mr. Cohn.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
No indication of the weather or not, it was a long distance call.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
Other records I had indicated I had only one long distance call from Mr. Cohn, and that was on 25 October.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
Is there anything in the conversation of 22 October with reference to Mr. Shine?

20:34.000 --> 20:44.000
I am trying to say to you, Mr. Jenkins, that I am unable to stay on which of the days between 20 and 30 October's the subject of Shine.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Specifically the discussion.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
Well, were there any occasions in that thing they feared that where Shine was discussed?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
There were some bad news about Mr. Cohn.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Who initiated those telephone calls?

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
Well, again, I have stated to you that there was a telephone call from Mr. Jenkins for us.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.000
And if Mike has been during the call, I initiated it, or it might have been during the call with him.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
But whenever it was, the subject of Shine was initiated by Mr. Cohn.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
In those conversations where other subjects discussed, in addition to the subject of Shine regularly,

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
I wish you whether or not to be particular of the subject of the McCarthy investigation of alleged subversives and forced moments were discussed,

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
that in those same conversations in which Shine was discussed.

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
That was the primary subject of my association with Mr. Cohn all to the phone.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.000
And do you say that Mr. Cohn was in New York most of the time when those telephone conversations occurred?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I can't say most of the time.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
I had an impression of Mr. Cohn spent most of the time in the ball in New York.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I feel like it's a question.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
Were those calls or any of those calls, monitors Mr. Adam?

22:01.000 --> 22:16.000
I wish you whether or not during that 10-day period, you felt or began to feel that any undue or unusual pressure was being put upon you with reference to Shine.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
Well, the pressure by then, I don't think today's categorized has undoes.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
There has been nothing unusual about it then, so it's your decision.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I can't say that, Mr. Dinkins.

22:27.000 --> 22:36.000
I was made aware of the fact that Mr. Cohn hoped that Mr. Shine would be as fine in New York as he was drafted,

22:36.000 --> 22:46.000
but as far as the pressure being directed at me and me alone and being expected to be burdensome,

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
although I was aware of it, it wasn't yet something which caused me any particular concern.

22:53.000 --> 23:02.000
It was a day I was made aware of a situation which was unusual because in my seven years in the government,

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
I've seen very little of that sort of thing by congressional staff members or members of Congress.

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
So the very first time that the inquiry was made of me, I was fine.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
And the reason I was surprised is that I had spent very two years as counsels of the 50th Secretary of Defense

23:23.000 --> 23:32.000
from then power and personnel, and I was very aware of the problems which we faced in the administration of the induction

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
and the selective service act, and more so, probably than most officials.

23:37.000 --> 23:51.000
In the Pentagon, I am and always was extremely sensitive to the danger that he had with any prop, any improprietious of any impropriet administration.

23:51.000 --> 24:00.000
During the period about which we were talking, they did not Senator McCarthy in person discuss Shine with you.

24:00.000 --> 24:10.000
With the exception of the one conversation in New York City at some time about October 15th or 16th.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
We were covering that a month of October, the first month of your tenure in office.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
You told what the Senator said in New York City about October 15th.

24:21.000 --> 24:30.000
Between that time on November 1st and Senator McCarthy discuss Shine with you, Father, are there any other tasks?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
At the moment I do not recall.

24:32.000 --> 24:40.000
There were times that there was a date which I have not been able to successfully to the pinpoint.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
During the month of October you mean?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
No sir.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
We are taking this up months so much.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
No, let me tell you the whole.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I don't need to tell you all the tasks.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
There was a date which I have not been able to successfully to pinpoint.

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
Which was around 31 October to 4 November.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
And I don't know whether it was in October or in November I think it was November that it could be.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
In October when there was a discussion with Senator McCarthy.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
We respect to G. David Shine.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
Then it would have been sometime between October 31st and November 4th.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
So right, it might have been a slight of an interest.

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
Mr. Adams I will ask you to tell the committee what was said to you upon that occasion.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
The Senator McCarthy, whether by telephone call our personal contact and who initiated the meeting.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Or the telephone conversation.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
That's three questions in one but I'm sure you might.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
During this period an arrangement was made which I didn't know.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
For Shine to be given to Lee's contemporary duty in New York City immediately after he was inducted.

25:49.000 --> 25:55.000
His induction was scheduled for spring or November which meant this from about three to eighteen November.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Shine was the on temporary duty in New York City.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
His temporary duty was not required to be in uniform but was made and available to the committee.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Who made that arrangement?

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
It was made by Mr. Cohn.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Who was made by Mr. Cohn with the secretary as I understand it.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
I had no participation in it so I don't know about it.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
I think you too got your information from the secretary or from his aide.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
That's right.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I don't believe it.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Very well.

26:23.000 --> 26:33.000
Sometime during the period immediately adjacent to Shine's induction.

26:34.000 --> 26:45.000
It was around the third or the fourth of November but it might have been the first of November that a McCarthy spoke to me about the fact that the arrangements had been made.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
But telephone are in person.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
Again my recollection is that it was in person and the may I have to make an explanation?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Certainly.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
I had fixed my recollection very carefully to find out when it was.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
I have a fade recollection that it was in New York.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
However my recollection showed that I was in New York only on the 30th of October.

27:08.000 --> 27:19.000
And the context of Mr. Cohn and the Democratic Condensation and the 18th 18th in the case that the individual already had been drafted.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
So the conversation must have been subsequent to his induction which can only mean money.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
And I must have spoken to Senator McCarthy here in the building.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
I have not been able to locate and isolate where it lies.

27:32.000 --> 27:46.000
I am quite sure it was not a telephone call but Senator McCarthy said to me that he did not feel that this temporary duty for Shine was a good thing.

27:46.000 --> 28:01.000
He felt that people members of the press who might be critical hostile of him or critical of Shine or Cohn or the committee might consider that it was a formal preferential treatment.

28:01.000 --> 28:08.000
And he would prefer in the after-mile of the race to have the temporary duty canceled.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
So I'm going to that Sophie going to that time and I was a minister out of the Senate of the Democratic Board.

28:12.000 --> 28:23.000
And Mr. Cohn, who was aware of this request stated to me that as long as it's the middle of the week now which would have been about support of November.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
There's no use canceling it and having a recording on Friday morning.

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
There's nothing for him to do, so why don't you just cancel it for him to record in on next Monday morning.

28:35.000 --> 28:48.000
The next result of this was that Senator McCarthy requested a termination of the temporary duty and the 15-day orders were canceled and 4-day orders, I think it was 40.

28:48.000 --> 28:56.000
A 4-day orders were substituted which would have the result of having him report for duty on the following Tuesday morning.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
Following Monday morning, he in fact reported on Tuesday I think because they took no class on Monday.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
And he did report on the following Monday about the 10th.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
Now he's empty-tailed a conversation that occurred.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
A optimum leave of 4th or 5th of November has not.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
That is right there.

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
When will your next contact with the McCarthy Investigating Committee?

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
Allow some time during this period.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
I think it was prior to the induction. It might have been just subsequent to the induction.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
I had a conversation with Mr. Cohn.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
With respect to shyness. That is correct.

29:41.000 --> 29:55.000
When you detailed that conversation with Adam, I was trying to point out to Cohn from what the little experience I had had in the administration of the Selective Service Act.

29:56.000 --> 30:06.000
How unwise it was to attempt to interfere with the induction of any individual or of the service.

30:06.000 --> 30:17.000
And I was basing it on the feeling with all of the staff who had the administration of Selective Service Act.

30:18.000 --> 30:28.000
It is fundamental that the Selective Service Act and the inductee take an understates monthly and partially treated.

30:28.000 --> 30:36.000
The strength of the army, the strength of the Navy, the strength of the Marines in the Air Force, all depend upon the draft.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
Even though neither of its none of the services except the Army are using induction.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
The very presence of induction and the threat of induction stimulates the listeners in all of the other services.

30:48.000 --> 30:57.000
We found from our own experience that only about a million or a million and a quarter men are career-stores or sailors in the air.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
And any time that we have a force and expect of a million and a quarter men and we have one around two and a half to three million now,

31:05.000 --> 31:12.000
Selective Service gives the is the never by which the strength of all of our services are being gained.

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
And I help them as I have always helped.

31:18.000 --> 31:25.000
The National Insurance Requires great care in the administration of the act and I said to them,

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
I said to them that I would like to get them some advice.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
I remember that the conversation was very friendly and I said,

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
I think you are one of the smartest boys I know.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Smarty young man I have ever seen.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
I am sure Mr. Cornwall does. Is that the second from the record?

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
It is Chairman. I am Mr. Chairman.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I am probably one of the most famous.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Is that the conversation in which you call the discussion of the fact that you are 15 years?

31:51.000 --> 31:56.000
I am not sure if this thing gets there. I have pointed out to them that I was 15 years.
