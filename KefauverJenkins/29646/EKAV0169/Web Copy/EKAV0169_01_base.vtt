WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
There was the wrapping of the gavel and they're called ordered by Senator Montpase.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Again, a small conference just behind the committee table.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
We have learned now from the Associated Press that Senator Jackson, the Republican Abel and

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
the Ranking Republican on the member, has told reporters that the next group that is for the time being.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
They may be into the letter, nice sessions and positive sessions.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
However, the committee and executive session, according to the report by Senator Jackson,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
is both which then the abstinence session is five o'clock.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Again, Senator Carmon, the temporary chairman, wraps the gavel,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
turning for another few words.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
But now, back in the chairman's speech, Henry will get it the way.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
May the bill please come to order.

00:50.000 --> 01:00.000
Chair would like to begin by saying that we're happy to have those interested in these hearings.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
From end of this committee room, as I guess, and so far as our facilities provide,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
we again call your attention to the rule of the committee, which is that there are

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
to be no manifestations of approval or disapproval of any audible type at any time or in any way.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
And we have officers and staying close with them, the audience, for the purpose of enforcing that rule,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
for instructions to provide a escort from the room, the purpose,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
and anybody who violates the conditions under which you enter the room.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
The audience says that then fine and easy hearings, the officers are going to a wonderful job,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
which simply want to continue that procedure.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
I would like to say that at the executive committee meeting this morning,

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
various ideas were considered as to how we could move forward with these hearings more rapidly

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
from the standpoint of providing more hearing time.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
We decided to start it tomorrow morning.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
We will begin the hearing each day at Punicom instead of 1030,

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
continuing them until approximately 1230, a little beyond, a little less.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
It appears in the judgment of the committee to be wise at the time,

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
and we will shorten the new and meet up until we stop the afternoon hearing that two o'clock

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
and run them until five o'clock, perhaps a little later,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
perhaps not quite as late, but in the general area, five o'clock,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
as is in the opinion of the committee.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Why?

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
There were no other decisions or decriminations made I think of in news where the nature says one,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
it was agreed by the committee at the suggestion that the president of the president,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
that we would authorize him as chairman of the regular committee

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
to transfer jurisdiction of the Alastin situation to some other Senate committees

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
if one is available that seems to have jurisdiction.

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
And that we would authorize in that transfer the use of whatever committee staff members have been working on these Alastin situations.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Mr. Denkins, you and the Justice Department, this time I desire to make an announcement or statement

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
that the purpose of fair staying up in misunderstanding which apparently arose yesterday

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
between the principal parties to this controversy.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
As Mr. Chair well knows, I have been instructed by resolution adopted in the executive session of this committee

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
to from time to time, pursue the question of whether or not there was any formula

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
to be able to all parties by which this thing might be shortened.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
The terms of that resolution and yesterday at the conclusion of the morning session,

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
I talked to Mr. Welsh representing Mr. Steven's and Mr. Adams,

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
and particularly with reference to the motion or resolution introduced the son of the Drs.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
At that time Mr. Welsh did not agree to that formula.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
He has never agreed to that formula with me, and as far as I know with anyone else.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
He stated according to the best of my recollections with, that is the word rebuttal.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
We're deleted from that motion or resolution. He would give its consideration.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
That fact I conveyed to the chairman of this committee.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
I did not talk to Mr. Welsh any further during the noon hour,

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
nor had I talked to him at the time he was interrogated by the chairman.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
However, during the noon hour I was advised by parties who may have regarded

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
as being in positions of no, that the formula set forth in the resolution of Senator Dutton

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
while agreeable to Mr. Steven, the secretary.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I conveyed that information to Senator McCarthy.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
It was upon that information which I conveyed to Senator McCarthy.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
And telling Senator McCarthy that there have been no agreements reached with Mr. Welsh

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
but that I had understood from sources I regarded as reliable that the formula

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
would be agreeable to Mr. Steven.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
It was upon that information I am sure that Senator McCarthy took the position

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
that he had been led to believe that the formula in that resolution

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
had been accepted by the Army so-called and that based upon that assumption

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
he and Public King accepted it likewise is very fair safe and dangerous.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
That was correct, then. Just today I had one short item to that.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Yesterday I think Mr. Welsh misunderstood,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
and I was referring to the conversation I had about his conversation to mean

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
that I had talked to him.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I have had my staff check the record and they tell me that at no time

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
that I ever claim, I don't not claim that I ever talked to Mr. Welsh directly

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
and I do not intend to talk to him directly but any sudden.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
That is absolutely clear.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Mr. Welsh, I think that covers the point, and I think we should proceed now

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
with the business ahead. What are you saying?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
What are you saying? Well, that's too well for them enough.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I have in his opinion stated the fact that Sally and Sally accurately

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
I would like to make sure he lies, Mr. Chairman.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
The first remark in respect to the duration of the morning and afternoon

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
the session, in Boston with somewhat shorter sessions,

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
we in about halfway through the session take a five minute recess.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
So you did have a tiny little break,

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
and I think it would be great if you would say that would be done.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Now as to yesterday's matter,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
today is done. We all know where we came out on it.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
We're all going to be in this room some little time.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
And I think a certain amount of graciousness from every end

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
or side of the table is in order.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
I think it must be quite clear that if somebody understood this

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
receiving through the green through wetless entice,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
there must have been some of it.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So I say let's put on a kind of a grin of some sort

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
of a small pile of each other a little if we can and go on with the next witness.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, the chair has come to like to say that.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Now in the episode we're going to be calling the executive session.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Insofar as the chair has authority to do so,

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
we hope to try to expedite these hearings by providing the official

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
be no more opening statements by members of the Senate at the beginning of the session.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
If we have other foreigners for expediting to consider,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
the chair will be happy to call the executive committee meeting for that purpose.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
We will not again discuss them in public if the chair has any authority to present.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
The chair is also suggesting to all people in the room that the questions that they ask

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
be as concise as possible.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
And to all witnesses that the answers be direct.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
And if they find in their hearts rewrites from the power that they ask

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
and know or I can't recall or I don't remember

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
and not make long speeches in answers to questions.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
The chair would like to say also that if he is empowered by his colleagues to enforce it

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
from now on, when point to word is a maid,

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
he's going to request those who make them the states to point of order first before talking about.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
The chair recognizes he does not have the authority of a judge in a question,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
he cannot fight this intent,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
because the best of his ability and authority supported by his colleagues

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
he would probably enforce that rule.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
And finally, the toes of us who enjoy 10 minutes of questioning should limit our toes to questions

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
and not for statements during the 10 minutes.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Mr. Counsel, you may call the next witness.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Chairman, that desire now to call the next witness Mr. Dunley-Headham.

08:24.000 --> 08:34.000
The time is for a testimony about to give it a truth to the hostess

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
and nothing but the truth about the judge.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
In every state, what's the day now?

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
A thousand, an unlimited time now shall determine the witness in direct examination

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
and in cross-addomination without any other action.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
The atoms will you bring in states your full name to this committee.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
My name is John G. Adams.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
What official position do you hold with the Army?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I am the counselor of the Department of the Army.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
When did you become such?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I was appointed on 1 October, 1953.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
Prior to that time, Mr. Adams, had you held any positions with the government?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
I had, sir.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Will you please state in short what they were?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
From February.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
From January, Canada, when the trouble back back was going through

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
the President's office.

09:21.000 --> 09:32.000
From January, 1947 until February 1, 1949, I was chief clerk of the Committee on Armed Services of the United States Senate.

09:32.000 --> 09:43.000
From February 1, 1949 until about June 1, 1949, I was an attorney adviser to the Secretary of the Senate.

09:43.000 --> 09:53.000
From June 1, 1949, who was about January 1, 1962, I was an assistant general counsel in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

09:53.000 --> 10:02.000
From that date in 1952 until October, 1953, I was deputy general counsel in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
I think it's a sure appointment was made by Mr. Steven, the Secretary of the Army.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
That's correct.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And you were sworn in inducted into office on October 1st?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
That's correct.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
At that time, Mr. Adams, were you personally acquainted with Senator McCarthy, Mr. Kohn or Mr. Carr?

10:19.000 --> 10:28.000
During the week preceding my appointment, I had been monitoring the job for four or five days.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
I met Mr. Kohn and Mr. Carr during that week.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
I had met Senator McCarthy on two or three previous occasions.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I met him once in 1946.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
I met him once or twice while I was an employee of the Senate between 1947 and 1949.

10:48.000 --> 10:58.000
And I called on him in my official capacity in the Office of the Secretary of Defense sometime in the spring of 1953, either one or two short cases.

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
Upon your induction in the office, I will ask you to tell this committee what these specifically were signed in the U-Badris.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
The Secretary of the Army.

11:09.000 --> 11:20.000
The position of the Office of the President's Counselor is set up in a general order of the Department of the Army, which was promulgated a couple of years ago.

11:20.000 --> 11:35.000
And it specifies a number of duties for the Department of the Counselor, including among them, are preparation and be assisting in the preparation of the Secretary of the Army's presentation to congressional committees.

11:35.000 --> 11:53.000
Both the legislative committees and the appropriations committees, assisting various staff agencies of the Army in the preparation of presentations that are going to be made in various investigations, various little jobs for the Secretary of the Army.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
All of those assignments were included, among those given to me by the Secretary of the Army.

11:58.000 --> 12:27.000
Additionally, specifically within two or three days of the time that I was appointed as the Department of the Counselor, the Secretary asked me to make contact with the staff of the Senate's permanent investigation committees for the purpose of taking office with children that we liaison responsibilities that he then had been doing for himself during the month of September, with reference to various investigators matters involving the Army.

12:27.000 --> 12:54.000
The madam's arrest, you will or not the Secretary, just just with you at length or otherwise, his relationship with the Secretary of the Army is expanding with them, and particularly his relationship with them with respect to any investigations they have been initiated of a latest infiltration of subverses in the Army.

12:55.000 --> 13:11.000
As far as I can now recall, on the occasion when Mr. Steven first talked to me about the investigation of subverses, he did not forsake all of the conferences and negotiations that he had had during the previous month.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
He did tell him about the beginning of the first month investigation.

13:18.000 --> 13:43.000
I think that our conversation was on the third month soon, and he told me that on the previous afternoon he had been called on by Mr. Cohn and Mr. Car, and that they had discussed with him the fact that the committee was interested in Fort Monmouth and were not and the place Cohn and Car were not satisfied with their ability to get information from Fort Monmouth.

13:43.000 --> 13:56.000
Mr. Steven told me that in Cohn and Car's presence on the previous afternoon he had telephoned the Commanding General at Fort Monmouth and had told the General that he desired that the Army give all of this impossible to be investigating subcommittee.

13:56.000 --> 14:12.000
He had done that in Cohn and Car's presence, and that subsequently, after this Cohn and Mr. Car had departed, he had telephoned the chief signal officer, General Back, and had made him aware of the fact that he had made this direct call and had asked General Floss.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
I think that he had given all of this impossible to be investigating subcommittee.

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
When you became aware, not later than after what served, I would have said that the Maccasi committee was interested in Fort Monmouth. Is that correct, Miss Adams?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yes, sir.

14:25.000 --> 14:38.000
What instructions specifically and the contents as much as possible did the secretary give you with respect to cooperating with the Maccasi committee in this investigation of Fort Monmouth?

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Mr. Steven told him then, and the told me repeatedly over the month.

14:43.000 --> 14:55.000
That he intended to have the only cooperates as much as possible and completely unholy hearted with this and every other committee of the Congress in any investigation involved in this.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
He specifically told me that he wanted me to assist this committee in every way possible.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
When did you first learn of the facts that very existed in your manly and David Chey?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Did you know that fact that you were in induction into office or did you learn it later?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I had read about Mr. Chey and the Maccasi.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Did you know that he was a highly controversial figure?

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
I had read some newspaper stories, not all of which were French.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
You knew that he was not then an in-depthie in the Army.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I knew nothing about it, personal facts.

15:26.000 --> 15:38.000
When did the Saddam, did you first learn that Senator Maccasi or any member of his staff was interested in securing any unusual or preferential treatment for the David Chey?

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I'm going to let you learn it.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I'm affecting the host's children.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
All right.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I got it.

15:55.000 --> 16:03.000
When the Saddam, did you first learn that Senator Maccasi or any member of his staff was interested in securing any unusual or preferential treatment for the David Chey?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
I'm going to let you learn it.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Why are you not relying on the chairs for just to keep the short eyes?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
I've opened up interrupt this morning, but I'd like to suggest that.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
When Mr. Duncan's asked a question thing, when did you learn such as the fact?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
The chairs' implications of the Duncan's think of such as the fact.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I'm not thinking one way or the other. I'm exactly the right question.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
When did you learn that there has been any intervention?

16:28.000 --> 16:35.000
On the part of Senator Maccasi or any member of his staff was interested in the David Chey. Any request made to respect the him?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
He's dragged off to the third.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I'll talk to the third.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
No, I'll just keep it in the rough.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
This is only regard to this question, but to the learn of the first.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
May I repeat what Mr. Duncan's saying?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
When did you learn that there was intervention?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
When did you learn that there was just a cycle of failure?

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
If I were a casual observer, I would think the Duncan had decided such as the fact.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Thanks to the fact that they were in the aquariums, that there was a person in the first.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
When did you learn that there was a person in the first.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
When did you learn that there was a person in the first.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Because this is the very need of the thing.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm really willing to still rephrase it.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Thank you.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
Mr. Adam, did or not you on October 13th for the first time?

17:18.000 --> 17:25.000
Did or not you at that time receive information from a reliable source, including the secretary of the Army,

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
that any request that the maids of Neil Martin of his first and I always respect his e-day of the chat?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Is that true or not?

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
There are a couple of minutes to challenge.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I don't think I can answer that question, yes or no.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
Because it is impossible words in my mouth and I think there is an answer to the question of the answer.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Well, I don't think the fact.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
I don't think the fact that question can answer that.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
I don't think I can answer that question, yes or no.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
May I recompense the incident of October 13th as I remember?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It's certainly so.

17:59.000 --> 18:15.000
On the 13th of October, the secretary of the Army went to New York for the purposes of all the things the executive hearings of the subcommittee which were being held in the United States Court House.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
I accompanied him as he had just one of the days.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
On the earth I am going to New York or working the automobile from the earth to going to the courthouse.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
He was expected to somewhere or another, the name of the shine came up.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I don't think I'm in the house.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
The secretary told me on that occasion that shine was going to be drafted.

18:35.000 --> 18:44.000
And that he cautioned me that I should not discuss it with the committee staff to talk it with the sensitive point.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
And he said, don't bring it up unless they bring it up.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
And don't send them on.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Something about effect.

18:52.000 --> 19:07.000
And although I cannot recite the exact words, the conversation was elaborated upon and the indications were that the secretary had been having some difficult conversations with reference to shine.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Is that the first time as far as you can remember?

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
As far as I can say, I would discuss shine with you on the making of his name.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
That is the precise time that I remember.

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
There may be a name that has been an illusion to us sometime between the 13th and the 13th, but I don't recall.

19:25.000 --> 19:39.000
Did the secretary at that time or did he ever relate to you all of the incidents that had come to his attention with reference to shine and particularly beginning on July 8th, 1953?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
July 8th, yes.

19:43.000 --> 19:57.000
Did the secretary ever or not tell you anything with reference to General Reapers' experiences with the McCarthy Committee with reference to shine on her about July 8th?

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I don't think Mr. C. C. C.

20:00.000 --> 20:07.000
Will you, Mr. Adams, tell all...like that question?

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
When was your first contact with Senator McCarthy or any member of this staff with reference to G. David Jack?

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
When we went to the hearings on the 13th of October, Shine was present at most of the interrogations.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
I'm not sure that he was there each morning and afternoon, but he was present most of the time.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
We went to lunch as the secretary's yes at the merchant's club on most of the 13th on the 14th.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
And on either one of the most of those occasions, I think Shine was present.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
He was part of a group of eight attendants who were together.

20:45.000 --> 20:54.000
Did or not Senator McCarthy or any member of his staff see you either off to research things or 14th with reference to shine?

20:55.000 --> 21:03.000
I can't recall whether there was any conversation with me on the 13th or the 14th.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
I was in New York four days, 13, 14, 15, and 15.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
There were conversations during the week.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm not sure if it was 13 or 14.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I think it was 15.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
With whom did you have such conversations with that, and I had such conversations with Senator McCarthy?

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Will you now relate to the committee what that conversation was with Senator McCarthy?

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
And particularly with reference to the David Shine?

21:28.000 --> 21:44.000
Yes, during one or two of the days, when the hearings had respect and the group of the participants including Army officials, less courthouse, there was the newspaper photographer for Christmas.

21:44.000 --> 21:51.000
I had not been aware of this, but I became aware because of the remarks of some of the people I don't now remember who.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
The Shine was getting in many of the photographs.

21:54.000 --> 22:09.000
And I stood back on one of the occasions on June on the 13th, 14th, 15th, and watched what these people said was the technique by which Shine managed to get himself between the two principles so that he'd be photographed.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And how would you...

22:12.000 --> 22:21.000
Well, I think on one occasion it was Senator McCarthy and Secretary Steven from the news of the 14th coming down the stairs.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
On another occasion for Senator McCarthy and General Back, one of the generals.

22:25.000 --> 22:33.000
And it was a source of some amusing, to various members of the staff.

22:34.000 --> 22:42.000
On one of the evenings when I was riding up town, I recall I was riding up town and I believe it was in New York Subway.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I'm not exactly sure.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
Senator McCarthy expressed to me his irritation about Friday's Shine.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
Just precisely what did he say according to your best recollection of that?

22:54.000 --> 23:02.000
Well, he made it. He made it. He remarked to be a fact that the Shine was not much used to the Committee and was only interested in being photographed.

23:03.000 --> 23:14.000
And that he hopes that nothing would happen to interfere with the processes of the draft and that Shine would be drafted.

23:14.000 --> 23:21.000
And then he asked me specifically not to tell Mr. Cohn, his attitude with reference to Shine.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I didn't ask him if I had his permission.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Did he tell you why he did not want you to tell Mr. Cohn?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
No.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Was there one President from that conversation to place between you and Senator?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I think Mrs. McCarthy was.

23:33.000 --> 23:46.000
Very well. Go ahead. You asked permission to tell Mr. Cohn when I returned to Washington about Senator McCarthy's attitude since I'm Shine and he agreed that I could.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
When I returned to Washington, I didn't tell Mr. Cohn.

23:50.000 --> 23:58.000
Now have you related all of the details of that conversation as far as you can remember the reference to Shine, Mr. Adams?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Well, the conversation took...

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
We were in the subway. I imagined 15 minutes.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
I think we were in the subway. We might have been in the cap. My recollection is that it was a subway.

24:08.000 --> 24:16.000
The conversation took five minutes or so. I have read and recited the book, took one minute.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
I may not remember sentencing. That was the gist of the conversation.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Very well. Now, when did I?

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
I mean, I didn't mean to cut you all before you threw me that. When was your next comment actually with either Senator McCarthy?

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Are you any member of this tab with particular reference to Shine?

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I cannot give you an exact date.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Some sequence, too, the time that we took the first month.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
Mr. Cohn sent him a car today with Cohn and I and others once for a month.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
I had various conversations with Mr. Cohn.

24:59.000 --> 25:07.000
Now, Mr. Adams, you're skipping over now from the 13th, 14th, or 15th to a date subsequent to October 20th. Are you not?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
That is right.

25:08.000 --> 25:19.000
Was there any contacts between you either initiated by you or Senator McCarthy or his staff between the 13th, 14th and 15th of October and the 20th of October?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
As far as you can remember.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
I was in New York on 13, 14, 15, and 16 of October, which was 16 with a Friday.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
Have you turned to Washington within my office on Saturday, the 7th, Sunday, the 18th?

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
We had conversation on the 19th with reference to the 5th to 4th month with just place on the 20th.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Any conversations on the 19th with reference to Shine?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
I recall.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
Mr. Adams, I think we'll get along better if you were very nice.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
That in your direct examination, I am questioning you with respect.
